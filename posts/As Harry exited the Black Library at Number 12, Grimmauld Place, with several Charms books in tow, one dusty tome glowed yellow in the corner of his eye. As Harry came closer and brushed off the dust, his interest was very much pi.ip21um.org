** The more Harry read, the more he thought and questioned, it had started as a fun read, he knew Grindelwald had been Dumbledore's enemy, and caused a War, so he thought it would be interesting to know how the guy thought, and how much it differed from Voldemort.

He never expected it would make so much sense.

Harry could say he came in prejudiced, half-expecting to see the ramblings of another madman, but it couldn't be farther from the truth.

The first ten pages got his attention, the next twenty got him to seriously review what he knew and look for more.

He had thought Grindelwald had an ideology similar to Voldemort's, of how Wizards were superior and Muggles were inferior, just without the problems for Muggleborns and Half-Bloods.

He was wrong.

The man described a Wizarding World very similar to how Harry knew it today, good on some parts, but full of flaws, and not willing to solve them.

He even checked the dates, because the Wizards he described were very similar to the ones Harry had met, especially the government people, corrupt, shortsighted, and unable to see beyond their own prejudices, only their names changed.

He described how some of the country's Wizarding Governments worked, and Harry was pretty sure he got the UK one on point.

What terrified Harry, is that it hadn't changed, Dumbledore had won in 1945, and it hadn't changed, Voldemort's Blood War had come and gone in the 70's and 80's and nothing had changed.

And Grindelwald explained /why/.

Harry had gone back to the library and looked up some history books, and even some records from the Wizengamot the Blacks had there.

It was all there, the systems had changed names, done some adjusting, and the name of the politicians changed, but under that, it was the same thing.

The power system, how those in power kept it, and prevented others who thought different from getting it.

Harry had this distant thought that if or when Voldemort was defeated, they would be able to change things for good, to end the prejudice, to get people like Malfoy out of positions of power.

Now he didn't believe that anymore. They may get /Malfoy/ out, because he chose to be obvious about it and went against the Ministry, but not the people /like/ Malfoy, the ones who stayed in the sidelines.

It got Harry to seriously question why he was fighting like he was. He thought of people like Hermione finally having the opportunities to show their talents, to not fear being attacked because of their blood. But he was seeing that even after defeating Voldemort, it wouldn't be that way.

In the middle of the book, Gellert stopped talking about the problems and started talking /solutions/, radical solutions, some were violent, but he explained why they were needed, and how could they be applied to be more efficient and to cause the least amount of damage.

Harry read them, and before he knew, he was taking notes, and checking the books he had to see if they made sense or were applicable.

They were. He wasn't a history or sociology genius, but it was all there, and he knew how people reacted.

It was only in the last parts of the book, that Grindelwald talked about Muggles, or the 'Muggle Question' as he called it.

He talked about the problems and difficulties between both cultures, put some history that Harry really wanted to have learned from school.

He talked about how some governments in the world dealt with muggles and the Statute of Secrecy, from MACUSA's almost total separation, to Britain and some countries of Europe having adopted a more relaxed posture, both came with their pros and cons.

He talked about Muggleborns and how the Statute made things difficult for them, in various situations, with the government, their peers, and their families.

Harry's situation was pretty unique, but Hermione's fit in some of those categories, he knew she had avoided many of the problems described because of her studious nature, and her very supportive parents(and her placement in Gryffindor). From what Grindelwald described, not all had the same fortuitous situation, Harry wondered if any of his peers at Hogwarts had problems dealing with prejudice and fear at home, while having little help to adapt to a world who sometimes wasn't very receptive.

It also provided solutions for that, some Harry thought too radical, but still logical if he analyzed it coldly.

Grindelwald advocated for change, radical change, a revolution even, of a scale not seen since the Statute itself was implemented. Harry could see, even today, many wouldn't like it, many would resist.

But he could see how much good it would make, to the great majority of the population both magical and muggle. Maybe that's why it was called the Greater Good.

The last pages were what Grindelwald himself called a dream, a world similar to what Harry had once imagined the Wizarding World to be, with magic being used to help all, where politicians followed the law, instead of using it or manipulating it for their own gain.

Harry found himself shocked at how much he would fight for a world like that.

Harry was about to close the book, he wondered how something that didn't advocate for the muggle's destruction and/or total subjugation had found its way here, he noticed there was something handwritten on the back cover in a beautiful script.

/For Sirius,/

/A friend gave me a copy, and I think this is the answer to many of the things we talked about, us five, I know the author doesn't have good fame, but it's solid Sirius, everything in it. Now may not be the time, but maybe when the dust settles, we can think of our future, I know this book speaks of a world I would be more comfortable raising my children in. And the way to get there./

*** Cont.

Harry looked at the book in a new light, he looked around in surprise when he noticed he was still in the library, in one of the tables there, books and parchment were strewn around him, full of notes.

"Ah, I had wondered where I left that book."

Harry turned in surprise to the door, seeing Sirius there, leaning against the doorframe with a fond smile, he thought of trying to hide it, the sudden worry of Sirius seeing him reading, studying actually, the book of someone who was considered a Dark Lord.

"Sirius, I-"

"Fascinating, isn't it? I had to get your mother to explain some of the stuff there to me, I wasn't very much interested in politics or history back then to get it, but when she did..."

He approached, throwing an appreciative glance at the things strewn on the table, "You are her son, heh, she had a table just like that, I remember seeing her studying it, this book, she would even cast some spells to not call too much attention when she was doing it."

He tapped the book cover, "Dangerous material back then."

"So my, mum, she..."

"Oh, she supported most of it, did some changes of her own, along with your grandparents and even James' help, to make it more...palatable, efficient, possible, to dilute the changes so they were not so shocking, but the end result would be nearly the same."

"My dad too?"

"Oh, yes, you would think he, the heir of a pureblood family would be against it, or his parents, but the Potters were always progressists, 'at the frontlines of change' your grandfather would say."

Harry was still trying to absorb the fact his family was planning a revolution, when Sirius continued, "We had pretty good chances if I say so myself."

Harry looked up at that, "What?"

"Oh, it was much bigger than us five Harry, I mean, Moony didn't have much faith, and Wormtail" he growled at the name, "was there because we were, but we saw he wasn't interested, so we thankfully kept him out of the loop."

He went behind one of the shelves, but continued speaking, "Your mother and others organized it, and we had a good number of the old families heirs in it, the Blacks, through yours truly, the Longbottoms, the Bones, the McKinnons, and of course the Potters, some others were more tentative, some were in it because they saw potential and wanted to be part of it, to keep or increase their power."

"All that can be used should be used, as long..."

"As long as the goals and their security can be kept, very good, Harry."

Sirius came out of it holding a pile of paper and books and notebooks.

Sirius placed them in Harry's table.

"Now, this," he indicated the book in Harry's hand, "is my copy of the book, which I guess is now yours. This," he placed his hand over the pile, "is your mother's."

Harry thought of what he could do, of all he had learned in this past week, he thought of political capital, of the one he would have /when/ he defeated Voldemort, he thought of Neville, and some of the people in the DA, Sue, Padma, he thought of Ron, Hermione.

He looked at his mother's version, and the notes he had taken, he decided to train like he never had before, to study and improve, because as Grindelwald said, 'Change requires power, in it's many forms.' and he needs a lot of it. Grindelwald had tried to do it mainly through the strength of arms, but maybe in this Dumbledore was right, and the bonds of friendship and common ground could serve as a greater source of it, when violence wasn't enough, or appropriate.

He thought of the money his family probably still had, if the books on Britain were right. He thought of the money and the name of the House of Black, plans started forming, and he remembered small conversations he had with some of his classmates, of overheard opinions, throwaway thoughts, and muttered grievances.

Slowly a smile formed on his face, now Voldemort's defeat was no longer the main objective in this fight, it was an important goal yes, essential, but it wasn't the end, it would be a beginning for change. For...

He looked up at Sirius, who had a matching smile, if a bit more mischievous, and both repeated their new motto in tandem.

"For the Greater Good."

***** Thank you, I am glad you appreciated it, I enjoyed writing this one, but I am already writing some other four hp stories, trying to make them as good as possible and wouldn't be able to give a long fic like this calls for the attention it deserves right now.

I would have to worldbuild, a lot, and do political worldbuilding which I don't find as fun as mystical and general worldbuilding.

I would then have to do a lot of research on politics to write a believable revolution the way I imagined Harry and Co. making it.

Two of my fics (non-published) are already a bit heavy on politics(it's hard for me to write a believable political system for Wizards) and it's already quite a bit of work to keep them consistent in the stories(one has a more feudal like system, the other is more modern, but it takes into account other Nations for non-humans and recognizes some of them as sovereign territories).
