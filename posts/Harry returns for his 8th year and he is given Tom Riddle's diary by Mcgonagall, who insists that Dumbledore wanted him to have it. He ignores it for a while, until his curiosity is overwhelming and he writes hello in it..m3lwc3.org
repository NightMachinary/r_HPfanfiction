Nothing happened. Harry didn't know what he expected. Voldemort was gone so would answer? He was about to flip it shut when he was stopped dead, staring in fascination as the words appeared.

/Well, this is a surprise. I haven't touched this thing in years, let alone written in it./

What-

No. It couldn't have been, could it? This was mad. Harry grabbed a quill and started to write furiously.

/Who are you?/

The words came seconds later.

/Tom Riddle. And who might you be?/

A story in which Harry finds out about another demension where another Tom Riddle is alive and teaching Defense at Hogwarts. A kinder, saner man who was never Voldemort. They must later team up together when a few of Voldemort's former death eaters want to get revenge on Harry for killing their master

** Interesting concept!

My suggestion: instead of fighting remaining Death Eaters, how about up the ante and fight a Voldemort from yet another dimension?

******* That's so relatable, I have an exam after spring break lol

One of those WIPs is one I haven't posted yet. I did one of these prompt things to share it, I dunno if you saw it but it's where Percy is depressed and suicidal and attempts to kill himself when Oliver stops him and over the course of that year they become really good friends and Oliver helps him fix things with his family

The other one, the one that is available, is an AU take on Percy's betrayal and starts out in his POV and then goes to Harry's and will remain that way until we get back to Percy.

** Remind me as well if you decide to write it.

How would you think up why it acted that way? It activated before because it was a Horcrux. It's no longer a Horcrux. Unless you make it act like the two-way mirror. But instead of seeing another person, you're able to write to another person instead.

I'm not sure honestly

When I got this idea, I didn't think that far but I like the two way mirror idea, if you don't mind me using that
