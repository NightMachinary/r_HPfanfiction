** I'm assuming you've read linkffn(The Art of self-fashioning) ?

If not, its a fantastic, gen, fic with Harry being a savant in Transfiguration, going as far as using Dark Transfiguration (its a thing) on himself.

Otherwise, there's one fic that he's training to be a healer, and uses a spell to get one of the basilisks eye. I think the name of the fic is The Serpent Lord, but I might be mistaken. Its a Harry/femDraco fic. If it was written well, I'd love it, but there's a bunch or errors, so that turns me off.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  There is a lot more to magic than simply waving a wand and saying a spell, something Harry Potter knows all too well. After all, when a mere mouth full of someone else's blood can drastically alter your life, learning magic's secrets is a must. (Amoral!Monstrous!Ravenclaw!Harry. No bashing, no romance.)

** I would second /The Art of Self-Fashioning./

There's also this one, /Monstrous/ linkffn(12754810), which isn't exactly what you're going for, I think, but is something you might be interested in nonetheless. A very odd little story, this one.
