I was thinking about this quote:

#+begin_quote
  /And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his,/ */even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees/*
#+end_quote

How exactly is that little old man showing off his knees to Harry?

** Its probably something about his posture. Thats my guess anyways.

** Obviously, it was a dirty old man holding Harry by his knobbly knees.
