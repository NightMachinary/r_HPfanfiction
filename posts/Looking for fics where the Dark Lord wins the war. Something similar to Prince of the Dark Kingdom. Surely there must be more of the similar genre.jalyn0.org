#+begin_quote
  Twenty years ago, Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry now guides the remaining resistance through the Magical Curtain that separates the rest of the world from Voldemort's Empire, where magic is out in the open and wizards reign free. Canon loyal, not dark. Adventure, not angst.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

** There's a super AU one where an artifact from the Ministry sends two sets of post-war Harry, Ron and Hermione to a world where Voldemort won. There, Harry is his right hand man and his wife and children have horcruxes. I can't remember what it's called though, but it's really good.

This is some kind of sequel from a story set in AU where Ron died after he drank the poisoned mead in 6th year but you definitely don't have to read that fic to enjoy this one and I really must say I think this story is kinda bonkers.

  Our choices define us. When Harry and his closest friends are transported to an alternate dimension, thirty years after the war's end, and forced to face the results of what would have been if only they had chosen differently, he will discover just how true this is.

** One of the best fics I've ever read was based on this premise. It starts out as a Handmaid's Tale crossover which may not be everybody's cup of tea but I liked it enough to persist with it (trigger warnings - you all know what happens in the Handmaid's Tale) Then in chapter 26, it jumps back in time to the year preceding Voldemort's victory and this part of the story is just unparalleled imho. It looks at the Order of the Phoenix fighting (and losing) the war. The internal battles between order members who did not want to use dark magic even if it meant that Voldemort would win, and those who were willing to do so, were riveting. This fic also has the best depiction of an adult Hermione Granger that I've ever seen. And the best last line I've ever read. I regularly reread this fic though I tend to start my rereads at chapter 26. linkao3(14454174)

  Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret, lost but hidden in her mind, so she is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve until her mind can be cracked. Now illustrated by Avendell.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
