Now, I am not talking about the use of knots, sickles, and galleons. What I am talking about is the fact every thing costs gallons. In both canon and fanfics, the costs of everything is always measured in galleons. Knuts and sickles are never actually used or even mentioned after Harry goes to Gringots the first time unless it is to talk about how rich he is. Nothing in the wizarding world costs anything less than a galleon. So, if no one uses knuts or sickles, why do they even exist. Why have I not found a fanfic that has more reasonable prices that can be measured in knuts or sickles.


** Canon is /full/ of items being charged in sickles and knuts. Charging everything in Galleons is pretty much a fanfic thing only.

  What she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.

*** Thinking about it, this seems to make the Sickle the primary currency by which everyday things are bought and sold with.

**** An interesting way to look at it, but of course currency is only part of the story. Naturally, the types of goods wizards value will be different from what Muggles value by virtue of the existence of magic and the absence of technology.

The most obvious example being that oil is probably worthless to wizards. Conversely, I imagine books as much more valuable to wizards, because it appears that you can't create them with magic.

The other issue on the currency side of things is the liquidity of the Muggle-wizarding currency exchange. I doubt it's possible to convert large quantities of currency, due to (a) lack of demand for Muggle money and (b) likely currency controls established to protect secrecy. Indeed, given the Goblins' attachment to gold, gems etc., as well as their "deposit box" approach to "banking", I doubt they have any interest in paper money/fiat currency, and the Ministry probably forces them to convert small amounts of it as a service to assist the integration of Muggleborns.

Whilst I don't disagree with your statement of books having great value in the wizarding world, I feel the presence of dictation quills makes their quasi-massproduction far more approachable. Perhaps it's more an issue of Intellectual Property that makes books so valuable. That being said, the ministry uses Court Scribes rather than enchanted quills, so they may be far rarer than I presume.

Goblins might have use for muggle currency in that it can be traded for gold. Perhaps it's only the Statute of Secrecy that holds them back form flooding the muggle world with counterfeit currency and buying up every ounce of rare metal.

**** This is terrific, though I should point out that the books are set in the 1990s. Make of that what you will, but the Muggle economy in the 1990s was a fair bit different than it is in 2020.

** Well think of it in terms of American currency for a second. A coffee at Starbucks might cost, say, 4.37 (random number) now at the counter the small change matters, but if I'm chatting with somebody, or mentioning it in a story, I'm just gonna say four dollar coffee or maybe five dollar coffee. Simply put, knuts and sickles are literally the small change of the wizarding world which means they are by rights inconsequential.

*** But that doesn't make sense. Galleon's are literally made of gold. By logic, they should be more comparable to a hundred dollar bill. If we take a look at cultures that used a similar currency system, knuts and sickles would be used the most. Galleons would mainly be only available to wealthy merchants and nobility.

For example, the Weasley's are supposedly a rather poor family. So poor, that they can't afford their son a new wand that should only cost 7 galleons. If Galleons are so common, then that should not have been a as much of a concern.

**** That's the whole thing you're comparing it to traditional societies rather than fantasy standards for currency. You can't hold it up to standard scrutiny when you consider the actual context of the world. In a society where time itself can be turned back on itself and magic is a ruling force and death isn't the end, gold really isn't as much of an end all on value as it would be in a normal society. Sometimes you just have to let some of the details remain unfocused in a story, and if that doesn't work for you then take a shot at it yourself. (:

***** What makes the best stories so great is how well they reflect reality. By not having a logical currency system, you make it harder to understand the value of the items in that world.

And don't get me started on the magic system of hp. I have my own set of issues with that ball of confusion.

How magic would affect the currency system has never been explored before to my knowledge (In the hp universe). But that is probably not a can of worms that we want to open right now, other wise we will be here all day.

I just might take you up on that one day. I have explored the idea of making an hp fanfic and I have thought of a few rules that would rule it.
