I am looking for fics that go into Wizarding culture deeper then canon. It doesn't have to be the main focus. I am alright with pro pure blood fics.

  When a more studious Harry Potter entered Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming. A Ravenclaw Harry story. Warning: child abuse, character bashing, and pureblood society.

** Well I don't really have anything specific in mind (couldn't find the one I liked), but you should try searching with: Pureblood Culture, Pureblood Society and/or Pureblood Politics, those often have some of the things you might be looking for, though they also can go little crazy about it, which is why it's hard to find good ones, sorry that I cannot help more.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

** Two fics: one is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]) , which is a must-read for pureblood culture and politics. It also has an /incredible/ amount of worldbuilding and is overall amazing.

This is a self-rec, but my own new fic linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13586585/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Enigmatic-Professor-Riddle]]) also has a deeper view of Wizarding culture. It's basically an AU where Dumbledore gives Tom the post of the DADA professor, and now Tom's deputy Headmaster, Minerva's Headmistress, and Dumbledore is dead. Now Tom's scheming...../a lot/

** There was an abandoned fic that was taken down then reposted by someone else on FFN. I remember it was something about Harry hiding out in Knockturn Alley for the summer and ending up finding out that 'Dark' wasn't evil, despite a lot of the Dark Wizards and Witches harbouring blood purist sentiments. I remember he was working for an apothecary, who was also a Dark Wizard, he was living in a place that also served as a brothel, and the apothecary gave him a key to a library where he met, and became friends with Draco Malfoy. The only other thing I remember is that he accepted the heritage of the Peverell family and was able to 'shapeshift' between his normal Potter form, and his Peverell form, which he called Hephaestus Peverell. I'll see if I can find it.

  After 5th year, Harry takes charge of his own life. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war, and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Long, slower-paced fic. Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, NOT Evil!Harry, No Romance. -ABANDONED-
