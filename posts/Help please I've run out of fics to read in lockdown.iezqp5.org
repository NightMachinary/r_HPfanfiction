Looking for anything good over 100k to waste my time away


** Well it's off topic, but one of my favorite crossovers is over 1,000,000 words long. It's a /Naruto/Mass Effect/ crossover called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9628704/1/Misplaced][Misplaced]].

*** I really like the Lore of Misplaced. How the author explains the History of Naruto's Earth and the Sheningans following, *BUT* My problem with this fiction, and it is a general problem with all the Mass Effect crossover fictions, is that the plot is a carbon copy of the Plot of the 3 games, at least to the point I read which is like 600k words in. There is like zero deviation from the main Plotline and the secondary missions.

**** But to expand on the complaint, Stations of Canon are a pretty big thing in any fanfic for any intellectual property. Very few fanfics make an entirely original story, unless they take it outside the timeframe of the canon. I mean, how many fanfics that take place during the Hogwarts years have you read that /didn't/ have Dumbledore setting up a trap for Voldemort with the Philosopher's Stone(or a fake Philosopher's Stone)?

Sure, that's quite fine when you are new to the world of fanfictions, but when you read hundreds of fictions following Canon, it becomes boring and really really repetitive. Unfortunately All Slytherin Harry, all WBWL, All Indy!Harry, OP!Hermione (and etc.) fictions tend to respect the same Tropes and in the end be the same thing.

That's why generally why I only now read fictions which are very AU, or about Time-travel, or during a non Canon Period or with an Original main character, not because the rest is Bad but just because I'm bored to read the same thing all over again.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!

****** I know what porn addiction is. It's not that. It's just my girlfriend is on the next town over, but the virus is interfering. And there's no car.. What am I supposed to do when I'm used to getting laid at least once every day or two.

It's hard times man.

  Various one shots Harry's various naughty adventures(or misadventures, depending on your angle), with women. Not for children. 1 to 350 is the main story. 351 and beyond is bonus chapters previously posted on my blog.
