I'm looking for a fic I read ages ago, no idea what the title was.

Harry is shot by some muggles in the beginning and wakes up in a hospital blind. Fawkes comes to him and allows his to see through his eyes, and he carrys on his search for horcruxes.

And ideas?


** That sounds bonkers. Was it as crazy as that sounds?
