In your opinion, what are the stories with the best writing? Not necessarily plot or story, but just simple style- no persistent grammar errors and looking like something that could almost be a published work?


** I've always admired [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net][Full Pensieve's]] dialogue and storytelling, particularly in Last Horcrux, though he drinks from the super-powerful-protagonist well more than I'd expect while reading original fiction.

linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks) has some weird stylistic tendencies (the author says English is not their first language, and you can tell) but the core of the story and the ideas within it are a cut above most fanfic.

linkffn(A Local's Guide to Life in London by Significant Owl), which I linked a couple of days ago, feels like really polished chick-lit-adjacent fiction to me, though I don't read any non-fanfic romance to compare it against. Good use of stylistic devices, tone, dialogue, etc.

There are a lot of really competent writers in fanfiction---obviously they're drowned out by the incompetent ones, but they're out there. Much rarer, I think, is people who can combine that with a sense of structure and economy. (Hence FP never finishing Years of Rebellion and getting swallowed up a little in the middle of Last Horcrux.)

If you're writing for a publisher, the incentive is simple: You aren't getting paid by the word, and unless you're an established writer of high fantasy they don't want to see something much over 100k anyway. If you're writing fanfic, people review and follow after every chapter, so the longer the better. (And readers tend to read fanfic faster and more indiscriminately than original fiction, so most of /them/ want long works, too.)

** Style isn't merely a matter of technical competence, though. Badfic notwithstanding, I'd say technical competence is a low bar to clear. Heck, /I/ would be one of the best writers in fandom if that were the only criterion.

In my corner of fandom, there are a lot of older writers, and most of us take good SPaG for granted. Beyond that, preferences in style are marked by personal taste. I can't count the number of debates I've witnessed over transparent vs. purple prose. I like a lot of styles, so I'm more likely to say, "I love this writer," rather than "this style is objectively better than that one."

** Sesc's fics.

Blank101's fics, or The Game of Champions by Lamora for the non-HP.

The Fire Omens linkffn(6199615) for oneshots.

Really, the bar is very low here. I wouldn't doubt that some 10,000 fics would fit "no persistent grammar errors and looking like something that could almost be a published work"

*** You see, this is very stupid. I'm not a fan of Robst, but his flaws are in the story, not in the telling of the story. Robst is a good technical writer, if his stories didn't feature 11 year olds in love and soul bonds they would probably be decent fics, since he has a lot of good ideas to back up his writing ability. However I think Robst must have been struck in the head because hes fixed on one idea and keeps writing new stories that are all just shells around the repeating core story of his.

*** This is also stupid because it ignores the fact that ~80-90% of fics are worse than anything Robst puts out.
