**** I have only recently begun on the way to greatness and can rate it yet. Buts as far as I know this is considered worse than On the Way to Greatness.

This story follows the stations of canon a lot but changes the outcomes of them quite often. For example Pettigrew gets Kissed, but Harry still gets to know about Voldemorts return at the end of Fourth year, and then It changes how the Wizarding World reacts to Harrys claim of Voldemorts return. I like how certain people like Lucius Malfoy, Rita Skeeter, Fudge and even Umrbidge can have the same personality but be perceived positively by Harry because they meet in different circumstances.

Generally I think its a good fic but it gets worse at the start of year 6. My guess is Dethry is getting tired of it.
