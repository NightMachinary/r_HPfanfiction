***** Eh, I don't think HPMoR is as bad as people here say it is. Sure, Yudkowsky's head is so far up his own ass that it is coming out his mouth xenomorph style, but the fic isn't terrible. If the pedagogy was either cut out or dialed back, a specific arc loosely based on SPEW removed, I'd call it a high 3, low 4 out of 7.
