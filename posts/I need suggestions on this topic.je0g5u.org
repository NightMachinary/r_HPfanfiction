I'm thinking of a fic right now where someone gets reincarnated in HP earlier in canon and he eventually becomes the DADA teacher

What I need is something like the entire curriculum from Year 1-7 something like

Year 1 - Introduction to DADA, Theory(Primarily), Difference between hexes, jinks etc. Basic spells

Year 2 - Practical Spells (Primarily), Less Theory, Dark Creatures and their weaknesses (Theory mostly),

Year 3 - Dark Creatures (Primarily), Weaknesses and specific spells for them, intermediate spells onwards

Year 4 - Dark/Evil Spells (Primarily), Introduction to Duelling and It's rules

Year 5 - Revision of all Previous classes, Practical Uses of spells (Primarily), Duelling, Consequences of using magic with muggles

Year 6 - Start of silent casting (Primarily), Study of Advanced Dark creatures (Theory mostly), advanced spells onwards

Year 7 - Advanced Dark creatures (Primarily), Advanced Practical Spells

Years 1-2 are taught Basic Spells (i.e. tickling jinx, leglocker curse, etc) Years 3-5 are taught Intermediate Spells (i.e. Bombards, Reducto, etc) Years 6-7 are taught Advanced Spells (i.e. Patronus, etc)

Anything I missed I haven't read the books in a while?


** The wiki has a pretty good breakdown of what is taught from year to year: [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts]]
