I was re-reading Delenda Est again and remembered reading a certain fanfiction where Harry and Bella (or at least I think it is Bella) are at Hogwarts together and she is either two or three years ahead of him. By Harry's fourth year they are romantically interested in one another. I am pretty sure Voldemort is in charge of the Wizarding World as well. If you can think of it, please let me know! I have been unable to find it or remember any other minor details. Thanks!
