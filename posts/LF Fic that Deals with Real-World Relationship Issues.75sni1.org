This might be a tough needle to thread, so not expecting many recs.

One of the criticisms of the epilogue is that the main high school romances led to happy marriages, which many thought highly unrealistic. I never had an issue with it, both because it's a work of fiction that wanted a happily-ever after, and because in the context of Rowling's world, I actually found it to be relatively realistic.

That said, I do enjoy fics that actually explore the legitimate relationship issues our heroes would deal with and was hoping for recommendations on fics that explore this topic. Such issues would include:

- Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione dealing with LDR during the girls' final year at school
- Issues about wondering if they regret not dating around before getting so committed (not saying Ginny would have such issues as she did have two serious-ish relationships, and Ron did date Lavender extensively, but maybe Harry and Hermione have those nagging pangs of regret)
- Ginny feeling like Harry wants to settle down too quickly and feeling she is losing her independence
- work-life balance issues (working too much, perhaps work crushes developing)

I prefer nothing where Harry and Ginny actually break up and fully move on with other people, though a short break up is fine, even if includes a fun "disastrous date" that makes them realizes they want each other. I understand this might be narrowing it too much, so as long as they wind up together in the end I guess I'm fine. But absolutely no cheating or dating of Malfoy by either!

For Ron and Hermione and any other pairing, go crazy. Cheating, Malfoy dating, anything goes.


** Northumbrian is a Harry Potter fanfic writer that writes the adults rather believably, of course it's been a while since I've checked on their stuff so my memory of the author's stories could be hazy, but from what I remember they were pretty good. Could try some out if you'd like.

Might not have exactly what you're looking for, but the characterizations are pretty believable at least in my opinion. (From what I remember).

*** Yep read them all. I basically have read every novel-length completed H/G fic out there, so at this point just trying to find some hidden gems or one-shots I might have overlooked. But since there are just so many one-shots, I'm trying to narrow it done. But thanks for the rec!

***** it is a bit odd that so many complain about the idea of marrying your high school sweethearts yet we don't see many fics that deal with the actual specific issue without just blowing it all up just to get their preferred pairing. Like I have seen a story that picks up where Harry is unhappy in his marriage just because, but doesn't actually show the issues that got them there that would realistically occur in a similar real-world relationship.

****** I don't mind stories where the characters marry young, I actually think it's rather romantic myself. But even so, it would be nice if they questioned not so much the love that they had for each other, but if it was too soon or something like that.

******* Exactly. I personally love the idea H/G were soulmates and in my headcanon, they are mostly smooth sailing throughout their relationship, but that doesn't make a great story.

I don't think its in character for either Harry or Ginny to feel like they are missing out on the single life or not taking advantage of being young and dating around.

But Ron is another story. He's generally felt unequal his whole life, first with his brothers and then Harry. But now he is a hero of the world and women would probably be giving him attention he isn't used to. I don't think Ron is a cheater, but I think he is someone who would like the new attention a bit too much.

******** That's kind of where you and I differ in opinions. With Harry I can see him wanting to marry Ginny, but I could also see the both of them being okay with taking a year long break or something so they can live the lives that they want to before settling down.

Which would also help if Ginny is in her last year at Hogwarts and Harry is helping get rid of the roaming Death Eaters.

He could try and date other women, because really the only one he ever dated other then Ginny was Cho, and even then dated is a very loose word because it was just one date and a kiss that wasn't very appealing since she had been crying.

While Ginny on the other hand had dated Dean and Michael, she could be a little more ready to settle down but could be okay with having a break as well. I see it as Ginny having faith in Harry that he would realize that she was the only one for him.

Plus if they weren't dating and were still friends, that would help Harry and Ginny get to know each other better.

And then there's Ron and Hermione. Ron only dated Lavender; that was my least favorite bit in that book. They were just so annoying. And then Hermione went to the Yule Ball with Viktor and they ended up writing each other, but eventually they broke it off as well.

I could see Ron and Hermione taking a break as well, and then realizing that they loved each other too much after dating whoever on their break from each other.

I mean Harry, Hermione and Ron hung out a lot during their seven years at Hogwarts, I could see Hermione and Ron try to distant themselves from each other just to see what could be out there.

********* I hear you, but respectfully disagree. While it isn't explicitly stated, Ginny didn't date during the reign of the Carrows. And Harry's last thought before dying was Ginny. I think based on this neither would want to waste any time and clearly view each other as the one they want. I think Harry would feel weird even trying to date anyone else considering his parents being together in Hogwarts and then marrying, plus again her being his last thought.

Both are also jealous of others. I don't think they would deal well with the knowledge the other was dating someone else, especially Ginny based on her reaction to Gabrielle during the wedding and later Cho wanting to show him the Ravenclaw common room.

Basically, the year apart they spent while still at war in a sense showed how much they would want to be with each other. I also don't think Ginny is the type to let Harry sow his oats while she waits around. She would insist on the commitment or do her own thing with no expectations of them getting back together.

********** Yeah you do make sense there, but with the way Harry's life was, his life was always controlled in some sort of way, either by the Dursley's or Dumbledore or Voldemort or whoever.

It just makes a little bit of sense that he would want to do something for himself for a change. While he might not want to date other women other then Ginny I could still see him be willing to take a year off, and get to know Ginny better at the very least.

And I could see him doing something cheesy like giving her a promise ring and promising to be with her, but they still take a bit of time to get to really know each other.

*********** I could see that. I don't think they all of a sudden become really logical adults right after the battle, but the idea of jumping into a passionate love affair right after so much trauma might seem wrong to both of them, so they might take it rather slow. Of course, that doesn't seem Ginny's style.

************ True it doesn't seem like Ginny's style, but I see Harry wanting time to just I don't know; relax. And if it made Harry happy I'm sure she would be happy to oblige to him. (Especially if he did something cheesy like give her a promise ring, that would show her that he does love and want to be with her).

And yeah them getting together after all the trauma just seems really wrong, which is why I thought taking a break from dating each other just to get to know each other better would be a good place to go.

** My works on AO3 deal with Harry and Ginny and Ron and Hermione in adult relationships. I started writing HP fan fic before OOTP came out, so the ultimate fates of the characters were not known. In my Potterverse, Hermione's parents died while Harry and Ron were out of reach and she couldn't deal, so she left the UK. I have some stories that deal with the two of them getting to know each other again and Hermione having a hard time with Ron being an Auror.

Since it wasn't known at the time that Harry and Ginny would ultimately end up together, I have a whole slew of one shots with them dealing with their complicated relationship. Are they friends? Friends with benefits? Something more? In the same universe, I have Harry and Ginny dealing with the hardships of conceiving a child.

Be advised, several of the stories are marked Explicit.
