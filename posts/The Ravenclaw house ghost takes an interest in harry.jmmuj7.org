after, overhearing of the prophecy Helena Ravenclaw eventually takes an interest in Harry potter as the supposed chosen one to defeat Voldemort, and starts watching harry (possibly Neville as well but mostly harry if chamber incident plays out similar enough) especially after the destruction of the Diary.

perhaps eventually after working with the Ghost (and gaining trust) harry begins to learn to use the diadem despite the taint of the soul, and possibly being able to take advantage of the soul to some degree or another, depending on the power level of harry for the fic of course

no idea if there is any fanfic like that, or containing any of what i have mentioned, aside from the various soul bits being taken advantage of.

start off hints early enough and it may make sense at least even if it is not a super loved trope?

anyways could be anywhere from a power boost by having the soul bits, to full on skillset assimilation (from that first Halloween nothing after)

actually baseline would be harry can, when using the Diadem (after mastering it of course, and possibly a few failed attempts) completely block out Voldemort from his mind, and eventually he could learn to do it without

sky is the limit from there I suppose


** I don't think that would have worked. Helena was a very beautiful woman, yet arrogant and snobby. Harry was an awkward four-eye with a golden heart.

*** I don't know, I think you could possibly write it.. maybe more from an angle that she wants to use Harry for revenge on Tom? Arrogance does tend to go hand in hand with grudges..

I get where you're coming from though. If the ghost was instead a living character it could be a golden-hearted-idealist melts cold-old-teacher's heart? Ah well, not my forte.

** So it's not the A plot or the B plot, but if you'd like to give this a go and pay attention to what happens with Helena, there's a plan to deepen their relationship: linkffn(13660332)

Sequel is currently in the works.
