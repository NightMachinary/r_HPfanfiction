I was reading a similar premise in another fandom and it reminded me of Harry, so I was wondering if there's any stories where Harry or someone else as the main character becomes an underground doctor, or healer, or potioneer, something like that, and maybe he gets the attention of dangerous people but helps everyone without picking a side? It would be cooler if he wasn't famous, like no-boy-who-lived AUs, or time travel (I know there's more than one story where he goes to the past and sets up a shop in Knockturn, I just never saw a Healer version).

Any pairing, length, rating, is welcome.


** I really, REALLY like the dog-leech archetype, so I'm amazed I haven't thought of this before. Been thinking of trying my hand at writing a fic, I'll link it if it, like, ever happens

**** Will do! I hope you're okay with relatively intense violence/swearing. My thought for it was, essentially, the ministry six just kinda being regular kids and friends. The story would begin at age 25-ish for them, with voldemort making his first bid for power in the late aughts

** Hey I actually stumbled across this from a thread you posted two years ago looking for fics like Death of Today.

May I introduce you to [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][Rigel Black]] who is probably as dear to me as any fictional character has ever been. There's politician!Riddle and healer!Harry, as well as far more than I could possibly describe here.

We're nearing the end of book four now and it's everything I ever wanted. If you think this fic is going to disappoint you.... stop worrying.

*** Oh love, thank you so much for the rec, but Rigel is who got me to make this thread in the first place, as I was thinking about Harry setting up a potions shop at the Lower Alleys XD

**** Ah, fair enough. The only thing I can think of that's even remotely similar to the Lower Alleys is the hedgewitch community in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13051824/1/New-Blood][New Blood]] but they're towards the end of the current content and I find this fic problematic at times.

I haven't read a ton of healer centric fics, so I'd certainly be interested if you found any more.

Out of curiousity, /did/ you ever end up finding anything like Death of Today?
