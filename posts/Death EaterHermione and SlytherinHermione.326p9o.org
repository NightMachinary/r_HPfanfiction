Any recs?

I don't really like fics where Hermione secretly turns out to be Bellatrix's daughter or something. She should still be a muggleborn.

Basically I'm looking for AU fics where Hermione meets draco first or something. Just read The Green Girl. Looking for more good ones.


** */BEGIN RANT: Fell free to skip to the recs./*

As someone who's been scouring the web for Slytherin!Hermione fics for years, and even took a crack at one of his own, my experience is that it's fairly easy to find fics with Hermione /in/ Slytherin, but *very* hard to find fics with a Slytherin!Hermione. /The Green Girl/ is a classic example of the former: yes, Hermione gets to wear a green necktie, and yes, she is still a Muggleborn, but none of the challenges of being a Muggleborn in Slytherin [1] ever materialize, because it turns out that Slytherins are A-OK with Muggleborns, as long as they are sorted into Slytherin. (I am not making this up or exaggerating. Even Lucius Malfoy likes her. *Their whole House* is OOC.) But, if Slytherin welcomes a stubborn Muggleborn witch with open arms more so than Gryffindor had in canon, what's the point of putting her there, unless you really like green?

Also, considering that meeting Draco on Hogwarts Express was one of the things that /kept/ Harry out of Slytherin, wouldn't Hermione meeting Draco have a similar effect?

Actually, now that I think about it, I can certainly see them getting in a shouting match, so that when Hermione puts on the Sorting Hat, it'd go, "Well, it looks like your heart's greatest desire is to make all the Purebloods acknowledge just how much better than them you are in every way, and to crush Draco Malfoy in particular. Have fun in SLYTHERIN!"

So, I sit corrected. Meeting Draco early /could/ end in her being sorted Slytherin.

Currently, /the/ Slytherin!Hermione fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/][/Applied Cultural Anthropology, or/ by jacobk]]: ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

A promising fic: Hermione comes to Hogwarts with a bit of a grievance against the world: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10462402/1/][/The Snake Pit/ by cupcake0118]]: After she is expelled from her London prep school for setting a science lab on fire, Hermione Granger is visited by Professor McGonagall, deputy headmistress of Hogwarts. Finally feeling as though she has found her place in life, Hermione travels to Hogwarts. But when she gets there, she is sorted into a house which despises the very blood which courses through her veins.

A very Riddle-like, but recognizable, Hermione comes to Hogwarts, with Harry in tow: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8375078/1/][/Labyrinth/ by Kroontjespen]]: The mind of a prodigy is a scary thing. Hermione Granger's however is downright terrifying. AU. Slytherin!Hermione, Slytherin!Harry

Not sure what to think about this one, yet: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9821720/1/][/The Stark Effect/ by NexusNebulous]]: In which the girl who might have been Hermione Granger is raised as Tony Stark's daughter, and the world is that much closer to imploding spontaneously. One know-it-all Stark was enough, thank you. *Includes other Marvel characters, i.e. XMen, Spiderman, etc.

Probably abandoned, but what's written so far is amusing: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5769888/1/][/Who's Afraid of the Dentists' Daughter?/ by TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel]]: Muggleborn Hermione Granger is sorted into Slytherin, but after a nasty prank goes wrong and gives her red eyes, her classmates become convinced that she's the Dark Lord's heir.

Interesting premise, but awkward writing, because the writer is not a native speaker: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8137134/1/][/Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents/ by CreatorZorah]]: At the age of five Harry turns into a snake. Five years later he saves a girl named Hermione.

Abandoned, but can be viewed as an interesting character study: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8094421/1/][/Wake of War/ by JeanHermioneSnape]]: 'Wake of War' is a story about a Slytherin Hermione Granger falling in love with her Potions Professor, while dodging the bad blokes and gals, some revenge plans and an evil mastermind, which will remain nameless for a while - let me know if you figure it out, just beware it isn't the obvious name. Enjoy your reading of 'Wake of War!

A heavy AU, where Hogwarts doesn't have Houses, but Hermione might as well be a Slytherin: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/][/Reign of the Serpent/ by AlphaEph19]]: AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

--------------

DeathEaterIsh!Hermione, though probably abandoned: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8614738/1/][/Darkest Witch of Her Age/ by darkrose0510]]: Hermione was known as the brightest witch of her age, but time and circumstances would soon change that. Who will survive a brilliant mind's descent into darkness? A dark Hermione fic'.

**** Canon Hermione displays plenty of cunning and pragmatism in Gryffindor --- more than any Slytherin of her cohort, anyway --- and a lot of authors forget that, casting her as an inflexible, authority-worshiping rule-monger, or a pacific paragon of goodness, unable to hurt even her mortal enemies, so, I guess that any fic where she displays those "Slytherin" traits up to her canon level is refreshing.

At the same time, the fic goes beyond making Slytherins only blood-prejudiced against non-Slytherins; it has pretty much everyone /except/ Slytherins be blood-prejudiced against Hermione, which is downright jarring. I'll give it another shot, on your recommendation, but I remain skeptical. If you don't mind spoiling, what does the fic do with Death Eaters' agenda which, you might recall in DH, involved confiscating all of Muggleborns' wands?

He claims he only adopted the blood purity view in the last war because he needed to unite followers behind a charged cause. Now, he has some followers already, including a new generation.

*** This may sound a bit weird, but are any of the above specifically /not/ Dramione- or pairing-related? I'm interested in reading about Slytherin!Hermione or Dark!Hermione myself, but I'm decidedly uninterested in Dramione [or Snamione, for that matter]. Yet most of the Dark!Hermione fanfictions seem to revolve around, or include, Dramione.

**** Not weird at all. I have a very similar filter. Pretty much the only way I'm OK with Dramione if Draco is Hermione's "minion with benefits". (Well, OK, I am exaggerating a bit, but only a bit.) So, these fics have already been filtered for the rich badboy / bookish ing√©nue Dramione pairing.

In terms of specific fics, Dramione is likely in /The Snake Pit/, if it ever gets written, but the dynamic would probably have Hermione on top, so to speak; /Reign of the Serpent/ is possibly, but unlikely, Dramione, albeit with twists; and /Wake of War/ has a Dramione moment, though it's more of a casual encounter, and it never gets to Snamione. In /The Stark Effect/, IIRC Draco is friendly (because Starks are well-connected) but no romance. In the others, Hermione is more likely to hex Draco than to kiss him.

*** Interesting premise, but a very incoherent implementation. This hypothetical Hermione is stated to have /led Death-Eater raids/ by the time she was 15. That means that she's tortured and murdered people. Despite that, 1) Draco at that age, can keep up with her dueling, 2) she still needs to cast the Disarming Charm verbally, and 3) The Hat takes one look at her mind and decides that she's so full of love, she can't be anything but a GRYFFINDOR.

I really don't think the author has thought things through.

**** The only reason I know it is because it's on portkey, making the D/Hr scene even stranger. I skip almost every story that author has written b/c that one was so strange. They're almost all very AU and go against my own personal head-canon... the primary component of which is that Hermione would never betray Harry.

But, that's just my opinion. Several other readers love those kinds of stories and I'm happy for them.

I don't think there's anything wrong with heavy AUs --- /Reign of The Serpent/ being a good example of one. The problem is incoherence. If Hermione is supposed to be this ruthless superwitch who leads Death Eater raids and assists Snape with Potions research by 15, then by golly, /write her like one/, even if she gets redeemed later through the Power of Love.

After the Troll-incident-ish, I can definitely see that. Before that occurs, or if it doesn't occur at all, why would she have any particular reason to be loyal to him? I can see it as a preference, but head-canon?

I see a big difference between 'being loyal' and 'not betraying.' Fics where Hermione is instantly ready to do everything Harry asks are just as AU as Slytherin Hermione stories.

******** No, not to just Harry or to other second party. I see her passionate about her values (although at a young age this almost immediately qualifies her for Mary-Sue status). She stuck with Harry and the haphazardly paced horcrux hunt because it lined up with what she thought was important despite Harry being extremely moody and Ron leaving prematurely.

So loyalty isn't just for the sake of being loyal, but it's showing kinship with people who share her values. It is those values - I think - that make it so difficult to make a Slytherin Hermione fic that isn't utter rubbish.

It's not so much hard as that there aren't many people interested in writing Hermione-centric fic that isn't a (usually submissive on her part) romance. The latter tend to not think about things like consequences of their premise, characterization, what different characters know and what they don't know, and what they are and aren't able to do, etc., with /The Green Girl/ and /In Too Deep/ being two handy examples.

Other than that, it's perfectly possible to be cunning, ambitious, and ruthless, without being overly treacherous. /Applied Cultural Anthropology/'s Hermione will most certainly take perfectly good care of her +minions+ friends.
