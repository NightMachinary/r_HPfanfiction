Hi, I'm looking for fics with a chill Harry where he takes everything in stride. I've grown tired of angsty fics with conversations full of screaming in all caps. Basically what I'm looking for is:

- Chill Harry. Not necessarily uncaring, but just level-headed in stressful situations
- Harry is witty but not super sarcastic, avoiding alienating everyone or making enemies (friendly!Harry ?)
- Harry spends his time wisely, i.e. hard-working but knowing when to take a break
- Harry isn't OP without a solid reason
- No Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor stuff
- Any pairings (no slash)

yes I'm probably asking for a Gary-Stu-ish Harry but well fanfiction is wish-fulfillment after all ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


** It sounds like you want Harry the Hufflepuff.

** Though it is comedic, Harry in linkffn(Oh God Not Again!) is about as laid back as you can believably get.

Example? He claims he can predict the future because he is the "Boy-Who-Lived", and when Sirius asks about it, Harry just says he wants to see how long he can keep it going before getting called on it. He even sells T-Shirts and merchandise.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

*** I tried to read Knowledge is Power recently but I had a hard time getting past the annoying OCs and the author's slut shaming. Does that get better? I'd love to try it again since it seems up my alley but I'm not sure it's worth it to work through the OCs.

**** Like I said, it isn't perfect and the OCs can be a bit too much sometimes.

The slut shaming is a good thing IMO. 99% of M rated fics have the author writing teen sex, pregnancies, and overall debauchery, it's good to see one author do the opposite.

** linkffn(Lily and the Art of Sisyphus) Fem!Harry, OP cus born the master of death, but chill to the point of hilarious about it. Because she's born OP, it comes naturally to her, and doesn't even think of doing powerful magic as a big deal. The only reason we as readers know it's impressive is because we have Tom the horcrux in her head commentating in a similar Hermione to Luna fashion, where he says that shouldn't be possible. Harry (named Lily) is witty, but in a witty without trying sort of way. (ie has funny nicknames for everyone, pavlov conditions dudley, etc)
