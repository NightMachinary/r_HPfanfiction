Ever since I rewatched prisoner of Azkaban and saw this scene: [[https://images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/2v037Xu3tyAaeYWUi0SEam/3b3101665f15b61f88cbdd85c973b790/WB_F3_SnapeStandsInFrontOfHarryRonAndHermione_TRL-022C_UP_HPE3.jpg?w=914]]

I've just needed some fics centering around it. Yeah, Snape is a pretty rubbish teacher and a vindictive, grudge-bearing bully, but he's still a teacher, and teachers are supposed to help and protect their students. So, yeah, I'm just looking for some fics where Snape helps and protects his students, not because he "has to", but because he chooses to.


** IIRC Moments in Love has that.

#+begin_quote
  In First Year, Harry realises early on that he has more in common with Hermione than Ron. Their friendship gradually blossoms into something more - something that Voldemort will come to regret - the Power he knows not. First through third year near canon, more AU from fourth year on.

** I've been reading A Different Professor lately. Harry thinks Ron's suggestion of going to Lockhart for help with the basilisk is stupid, so he goes to find MacGonagall. Snape is with MacGonagall in the teachers lounge and they all head to the chamber.

  "Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever." Ginny has been taken to the Chamber of Secrets and Harry may know where that is. How would things have turned out if he had gone to a Different Professor? Rated T for violence and gore

  The war's over. Harry defeated Voldemort, yada, yada, yada. But there's still one debt Harry has to pay. A strange request is made of him and he feels obligated to acquiesce. Listen to Harry's account of the story of how he came to be Severus Snape's Adult Baby. Additional Warnings: Some sexual Age play. Everyone is 20 or older.

** Have you tried Problem of Potions? It's really fun, but it develops a serious plot and has many original ideas. Snape and Harry have a nice mentor-student relationship in it, without it feeling like Snape is out of character.

  AU. Snape's first Defence lesson goes horribly wrong for Hermione when she is caught in a freak spell explosion and finds herself in a strangely altered version of the world she knows. While desperate to go back, she can't resist getting involved when she realises her memories may be the key to thwarting Voldemort's plans. But can staying lead to anything but heartbreak for her?

** Personally I really hate Snape and love novels that bash the hell out of him.

Still there are a few good Snape stories I have read over the years. One of the Crazed Inventor Harry! stories has him rushing about trying to keep Harry from killing himself or blowing up anything. Can't remember which but it really stood out to me at the time.

Will have to follow this thread and see if there are any good recommendations to check out.
