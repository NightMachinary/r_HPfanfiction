  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** One story that strikes me off the top of my head that's close to what you're looking for is CanonShipper's /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2435105/1/Secrets][Secrets]]/ | linkffn(2435105) . In that story, Harry and Hermione have been a couple for two years, but Hermione's never really quite been into Harry. She's actually attracted to Ron and the story begins with Hermione going behind Harry's back to begin an affair with Ron.

  Hermione has been dating Harry for two years, despite her feelings for Ron. She seems pretty content with this situation until Harry asks if she's ready to go to the next step. What she and Ron do next has the potential to destroy the famous trio forever.
