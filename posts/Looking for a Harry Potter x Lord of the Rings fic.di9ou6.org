All I remember is Harry waking up on a rock in the Lotr universe with a bottle of firewiskey that only has a little left. I (vaguely) remember him having a robe with a snake motif on it. He's found by the hobbits and some other people and they wonder how he got there because there arnt any tracks to the rock. Thanks!

  Fate hated him, Death obviously has something against him, and now he is awake in a green land unlike what he left and is determined not to care this time. NoPairings, HPLOTR X-over
