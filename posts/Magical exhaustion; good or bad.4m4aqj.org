** It's incredibly stupid. Harry gets tired from practicing magic in the series. There's no need to have him be 'magically' exhausted unless you need a reason to have him not do magic in the story. And even that could be done a different way. Really, it's just another way to use mana in a series without them actually using mana in the series.

** I would argue that exhaustion as a cause for losing a battle is bad, but I also think there is canon evidence that surviving a taxing battle can exhaust you more than just as if you'd been running. There are a number of incidents (end of 1st and 4th books in particular) that a young wizard suffering through magic beyond their experience/training takes more out of them than a night's sleep could restore.

Mana pool = bad.

Showing that being in a big battle has lingering consequences = good.

** Magical exhaustion is objectively a bad trope. Its just terrible writing since magical exhaustion simply doesn't exist. Never in HP does a character get so tired that they cannot cast spells. The closest thing is Harry practising the Patronus, and that exhaustion was due to the Boggart-Dementor, not from using the Patronus.

The one and only alternative to me is just straight limitless magic. No exhaustion, no cores or energy, or mana or whatever name want to call it. Just have magic cost nothing to maintain. The only time that a spell should be difficult to maintain is if it requires concentration (e.g. Fiendfyre or Patronus) and the caster loses concentration because they were distracted by something going on around them. In the case of the Fiendfyre, it would just run rampant until someone ended the spell. In the case of the Patronus, the Patronus would just fade since the caster is no longer thinking of happy thoughts.

But to have magical exhaustion is a sign of bad writing IMO. Its basically the author of the fanfic saying 'I want to put handicaps and limits on everything'. I hate when writers add limits and restrictions that never existed in canon to weaken spells, or magic in general. In the case of magical exhaustion, its trying to make HP magic into the type of magic used in an RPG. Spells can be cast endlessly without limit to them in terms of their frequency and how long they last.

In theory, a Patronus could be maintained endlessly if the caster is able to focus on a very happy memory. Same with any other spell. Lumos could be maintained forever. Wingardium Leviosa could be maintained forever. So long as nothing is physically preventing the caster from maintaining the spell (e.g. if the caster's wand-hand is being attacked by an object/creature during a duel). Taking a hypothetical example, if Dumbledore was dueling Voldemort and the latter was maintaining Fiendfyre... if Fawkes slashed the hand holding Voldemort's wand, it would physically affect the effectiveness of the spell (e.g. if Voldemort wand moved in his hand, or even if the wand dropped to the floor) and would cause Fiendfyre to go out of control. If Fawkes didn't do that, then Voldemort could just maintain Fiendfyre until either he or Dumbledore makes Fiendfyre disappear by ending the spell or by using a counter-spell.

*TL;DR: Magical exhaustion is bad writing because it adds limitations that didn't exist. Magical cores are even worse in that regard. Nobody gets tired from using magic, no matter how difficult the spell is. Magic can be used over and over again without being tired. If a character is tired while using magic, its not due to them using magic, its due to other factors (e.g. the Boggart-Dementor). There isn't a single instance of a character being unable to cast a spell because they've "used too much magic", not even with Unforgivables. A character being unable to maintain a spell is a result of being unable to focus on happy memories (the Patronus) or because of the caster being inexperienced (Fiendfyre) rather than exhaustion or tiredness, and with every other spell, they never fail to maintain it.*

**** I never said that magical exhaustion/magical cores were bad purely because they weren't canon. I don't hate those tropes because they weren't canon. This is why I hate those two tropes:

#+end_quote

The main reason I hate the cliche of magical cores and magical exhaustion is because they are inherently bad tropes. They are inherently bad because they are representative of the writer weakening magic because they, for some reason or another, don't like how powerful magic is.

Its not just magical exhaustion/cores, but adding limits to stuff in general like when writers try to nerf certain spells to only last a certain period, or only affect a certain number of people, or only do so much damage. Those type of writers seem like the type who would add really dumb restrictions to everything, such as adding a limit to what can be lifted with Wingardium Leviosa, or to how long the Imperius Curse lasts/how powerful it is, or when people believe that the Unforgivables can't be cast non-verbally.

With fanfiction, the writer generally expands upon the world by introducing new elements to it, or by shining light on pre-existing stuff. There are plenty of ways that this has been done and will be done such as:

- DH from the perspective of the students who were still at Hogwarts under the Carrows.

- Everything that happened between DH and the Epilogue

- Next-Gen stories in general

- Stories that take place prior to the HP series (e.g. Founders era, Dumbledore-Grindelwald era, Marauders era, etc)

- Magical creatures and how they are represented in the world (e.g. House Elves, Goblins, Giants, Vampires, Veela, etc)

- Everything else

Magical exhaustion is not world-building, neither is magical cores for that matter. Those two tropes in particular are bad writing because its just nerfing magic because the writer is really stupid and needs to make everything "logical".

Notice that I never said that a writer can't use magical exhaustion or magical cores. I merely said those tropes are objectively bad and are never good. Writers can deviate from what actually happened since fanfiction exists for that purpose, but there is a difference between making Harry end up with Hermione/Luna/Daphne/Fleur/Tonks/etc instead of Ginny and changing the entire system of magic. I don't think anyone has ever thought that magical exhaustion or magical cores were good, unless they were a terrible writer. Hence why many people here don't like either of those tropes.

Magical exhaustion and magical cores doesn't add anything new or interesting. They are cliche and are inherently bad tropes. Mixing up the pairings, or making a hypothetical future where Voldemort actually killed baby Harry and won the First Wizarding War. Exploring stuff which JKR barely (if even that) went deeper into what attending a non-Hogwarts wizarding school would be like (e.g. Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, etc), or into past times (e.g. Founders era, anything pre-Statute of Secrecy, or when Dumbledore/Grindelwald were young) would be interesting. The pieces had already been set and since there is so much we don't know about, it leaves many possibilities.

I like exploring things we have seen in canon but that we didn't really learn much about (and fanfiction is great for exploring those things), and expanding on that, or all the possibilities for an Next Gen antagonist following Voldemort, or all the events in the HP series pre-1998 that we could have learnt more about.

*TL;DR: Magical exhaustion isn't bad for being non-canon, its bad because its a representation of terrible writing and only serves to add pointless limitations. Personally, changing the plot is very different to changing how magic works. Magical exhaustion only exists to weaken the way magic works. Weakening magic means a writer isn't able to do as much with magic as they could, and limits the possibilities of the story. Changing the plot (e.g. AU stories, Next Gen stories, stories taking place in any era that isn't 1991-1998, etc) can potentially allow for better possibilities and explore unique characters/places.*

***** While maybe magical exhaustion isn't the way to do it, adding limitations to magic isn't necessarily a bad thing either. In fact, there's many great stories, fanfiction or published books, that impose many restrictions and rules on magic. Changing the plot is, admittedly, different from changing the magic - but both are and should be acceptable things to do. I think that saying magical exhaustion is objectively bad is a very bad statement to make, kind of like saying harems, or Snarry is objectively bad. Yes, they're /usually/ bad, but it's also probably possible to make a good story using those. It'd be hard, and if there's any it's unlikely you'll find them - but it's theoretically possible.

*** Please, if you're going to make a TLDR, actually simplify what you're saying. That TLDR needs a TLDR.

Here's an example TLDR: Magical exhaustion is not present in canon and magic has theoretically limitless use. The 'Magical Exhaustion' trope should instead be explained by other factors such as inexperience or lack of concentration. It sums up your point accurately (well, as far as I can tell) and is simplified. The point of a TLDR is that people want a short, simple explanation. If the TLDR interests Further evidence and reasoning can be found in the main post if people want to read it.

Another example of bad writing is when a writer is unable to concisely convey their point. I know I struggle with simplifying my writing. I meant this post as advice, rather than to provoke any offense, which would be entirely unintentional. In correcting your TLDR I ended up reading your post, and I totally agree with your point about fanfic authors putting handicaps on magic. It frustrates me when they do this. They should be exploring magic to the fullest possible extent, I think that's the most interesting aspect of fanfiction.

** This topic has caused a divide between friends I.

It works well, but not in the typical MMORPG fashion that people have added to it and made it like some sort of wonky mana system where each spells takes a bit of mana and once it's gone the wizard collapses from 'magical exhaustion'. That is asinine and has no place in the HP universe.

At the same time, it works because what's stopping people from throwing hundreds of curses and not tiring from pushing all that magic out? Let's be honest, at least for a moment, what stopped Voldemort from rushing Hogwarts with his group of Death Eaters and threw out hundreds of Killing Curses with no hesitation because he wouldn't get tired or even feel anything from it, assuming he stood still. Why even move? If you don't get tired, just pull up a shield and hold it. Why stop at one? If you don't get tired, pull up three! Assuming you don't get distracted you should be God-like in the ability to slaughter anyone you wanted if nothing tired you. Even if you dashed around, avoided spells and were panting on the ground, nothing is stopping you from flicking up your wand and muttering a curse and killing someone.

I realise that I'm grasping at straws and my opinion is a part of the select few, but it stops characters from becoming God-like figures that never tire from spell casting. In real life we have mental exhaustion, physical exhaustion and a slew of plenty others, why is magical exhaustion so farfetched?

I'd rather read a fic with magical exhaustion than one where magic isn't hindered in anyway and Harry is more powerful than Dumbledore at twelve because his power is limitless. What garbage.

*** As Rufus Scrimgeour said: the problem is the other side has magic too. Unlimited magic is only overpowered against Muggles. Against someone who also has unlimited magic, the two cancel out. One person's ability to spam attacks is matched by another person's ability to spam defences - making spam an ineffective strategy. If your first stunner doesn't break my shield, the next 200 aren't going to break it either. Either you know a stronger spell and try that instead or you're going to have a tough time winning. You win by being better at magic than the other person, not by lasting longer in a contest of stamina.

To me that's much more interesting. It means people have to know a variety of magic and win by being smart. In fact it's the system with magical exhaustion that allows you to win by spamming spells, because if you've got "more" magic in a system with exhaustion then all you need to do to win is outlast the other guy. Whereas in a system without exhaustion, no amount of spamming the same ineffective spell will allow you to win a duel.

A magical duel is more like a game of chess than a physical fight. A person can move a chess piece indefinitely, but that doesn't prevent someone from winning. You probe each other's defences, you see an opening or weakness, you take it.

***** I disagree. The nature of magical combat and the size of the population means that you're very rarely if ever going to have anything like a pitched battle. The Battle of Hogwarts is the exception, not the rule. Far more common are small skirmishes involving at most 20 people on each side, each of them highly mobile, operating largely independently and focusing on achieving some strategic objective rather than going around killing the most people possible. Duels are going to be far more common than any kind of massed battle. The vast majority of magical fights we see in canon are duels.

Furthermore, your example is just bad. For a start, shields are persistent, they don't have to be actively maintained. You can place a shield somewhere, walk away, cast a load of magic and come back to it. Secondly if a stunner has proven ineffective against my shield then I don't need to spam shields, as that shield has proven sufficient to block your stunning spell. Thirdly if a person is outnumbered they're screwed anyway, unless they're a significantly better wizard than their opponents, so it seems like an odd example to use to demonstrate some magical point. It doesn't demonstrate anything about magic.

If shields can be dropped and remain, then that doesn't change anything with regards to spamming - it just means that in addition to conjured walls, you'll have shields all over the place as well, and it makes turtling easier.

What are you basing this off? Almost all battles in canon are duels or devolve into them. The only times we see non-duel fighting is when one side has a significant numerical advantage (battle of Hogwarts) which is not usual. Every time we've seen forces of comparable numbers engage, we've seen them end up duelling, either 1 vs 1 or 1 vs 2 if the lone wizard is good.

Which makes sense. If you've got 5 wizards vs 5 wizards, then if two of your side fight in a coordinated way to gang up on one of their side, that means that the other side has an extra man they can use to gang up on one of your guys. You gain advantage in one area of the battle but lose advantage by a corresponding amount in another area.

It gets a bit more interesting if you allow for unequal abilities. If you've got a single wizard who you're confident is good enough to take on multiple opponents at once then it makes sense for him to engage multiple people at once, to give the other people on his side a numerical advantage against the remainder. But that's kinda the opposite to your point. That's a case where being forced to fight in a coordinated way is a disadvantage.

Also, when I was referring to mobility I was meaning apparition.

Games even allow you to simulate high-mobility battles with "magical defenses" or facimilies of such - including teleportation in some games, like Overwatch. And in each and every case, duelists/lone wolves lose against coordinated fighters, all other things being roughly equal. Tactics simply are that damn important. Unless forced to, no one splits up into duels in those situations because the "advantage" you cite is actually not big enough to compensate against coordinated attacks unless you do the same.

If apparition is not blocked, there will be no fight since the side that's not prepared or starts to lose will flee, apart from desperate "we have to hold this location" situations - but then, if you can apparate, you can evacuate people, so those too will be very rare.

#+end_quote

Absolutely nothing is stopping the person using the Killing Curse over and over again. However, the average user of the Killing Curse (weak Death Eaters) will probably be verbally casting it. Voldemort could endlessly cast AKs because he can perform non-verbal Killing Curses (which we see in OotP). Same goes with Bellatrix near the beginning of HBP against a fox. For the average wizard, they would be better off trying to rapidly cast Stupefy than trying to rapidly cast Avada Kedavra, especially since Stupefy is a general spell which would be easier to use than the Unforgivables.

#+begin_quote
  Why are duels often described as being short in the books if everyone was limitless in their ability to throw around magic?
#+end_quote

The reason duels are always described as short in the books is because it doesn't take one side long to outskill the other side. All it would take is a single direct hit from Stupefy, Expelliarmus, an Unforgivable Curse, or from a strong jinx/hex/curse. Once one person gets a hit on their opponent, they can capture them or kill them from that point.

#+begin_quote
  No wizard turtled in duels to make it last longer, it was all made to end as quickly as possible for no stated reason at all.
#+end_quote

No wizard turtled in duels to make it longer because if they needed to turtle, they were never going to win that duel anyway. In many cases, they couldn't turtle because either the Killing Curse was being fired and that couldn't be blocked by Shield Charms, or because the aggressive duelist was already winning. The only time turtling ever works if the one turtling is holding back so much and is much more powerful than their opponent, or if its just temporary. Dumbledore basically turtled Voldemort in their duel by blocking all those Killing Curses (and restraining both Harry and Bellatrix at the same time), yet he was stronger than Voldemort.

Take McGonagall vs Snape in DH. We see Snape try to block hits from McGonagall, and then then the rest of the Professors showed up. Now in that duel, it ended because Snape fled, and he fled because he didn't want to duel McGonagall anyway. Even if Snape didn't flee and no other people showed up, that duel wasn't going to last long anyway because it wouldn't take long for either McGonagall or Snape to get that one needed hit on their opponent.

Duels are quick because either one duelist managed to escape, or the duel was interrupted by the arrival of another person, or because the winning side only needed one good hit to win anyway (especially if the Killing Curse is involved). The most obvious reason is that the duel was just that one-sided, and the winning duelist was THAT much better than whoever they just beat. HP duels aren't like anime fights where they can sometimes last for very, very long periods of time.

** I don't care if you call it "Exhaustion" or "Magical Exhaustion" - usually, "magical exhaustion" means the character gets physically tired out as well anyway - as long as wizards are not energiser bunnies who can keep casting all day with a bit of training and focus. Because unlimited magic can break a setting far too easily.

*** But wizards ARE "energiser bunnies who can keep casting all day with a bit of training and focus". That is canon. It is literally the reason why the majority of people hate magical exhaustion and magical cores, and also why nobody with common sense believes muggles could even come close to beating wizards.

A wizard could cast spells infinitely. However that doesn't really matter if their opponent outclasses them. Unlimited magic doesn't break a setting unless you are using muggle logic for everything. Unlimited magic would only matter if it was wizards vs muggles. Why would unlimited magic matter if both sides are wizards? It would just boil down to who was more skillful, who had more luck on their side, or which side had the greater numbers.

**** Unlimited magic matters for wizards vs. wizards. Against muggles? All you need is the mind control spell for their leader, or an anti-muggle ward.
