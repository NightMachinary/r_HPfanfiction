:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi,

So there is this fanfic that I've read some months ago and now I can't find it anymore. It was a Harry/Hermione thrown in the past (probably)

Seventh year AU (I think) Hermione is sent back to Marauders era, injured and is found by Sirius and James. She becomes a student again and is quite popular with the students by being helpful towards all and having no prejudices.

She predicts that Harry will come as well, I think at Halloween. which he does. They spent some months in that era and make sure that James and Lily survive.

A plot point was that Hermione was Sirius's daughter (blood adoption before she went back in time) and another was that Hermione couldn't be healed completely at the beginning because of some time paradox or smth (same for Harry).

If I recall it was also finished and posted on FanFiction.net but I've searched for it in my favs and follows but couldn't find it so there's a chance that it might've gotten deleted from fanfiction.net.

I also searched normally for it but again could not find it.

Any help is appreciated.


** I'm pretty sure it's linkffn(The Winds of Time by ausland)

It has all the plot points you listed except for Hermione being blood adopted by Sirius. The only H/Hr fic I remember that happening is The Last Casualties by muggledad.

  A slightly different purchase planning during his first visit to Diagon Alley means that Harry meets a completely different person than Draco Malfoy at Madam Malkins. How will this encounter change the fate of the world? And will two restless souls together be able to find some happiness and love in a ruthless world? HP/DG
