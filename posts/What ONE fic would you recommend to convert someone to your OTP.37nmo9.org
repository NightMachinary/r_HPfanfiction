**** In addition to these three, all in my top HP/DM... Azoth. Quoted from my previous post on this sub.

#+begin_quote
  [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1049966/chapters/2100285][Azoth]], by zeitgeistic (faire_weather) - HP/DM, rated R

  Author Summary: "Questionable career choices, fantasy Quidditch, apprenticeships, bromance, Alchemy, Animagi, pining, a snarky portrait, boggarts, and Harry as a hot mess. There is a surplus of cats in this story. It wasn't planned, but when are cats ever?"

  The story follows Harry and Hermione as they go back to Hogwarts for their 7th year, after defeating Voldemort.

  The characters seem vivid, real, and alive. To me, there's a huge difference in fanfic that writes the characters well and allows them to grow and develop vs fanfic that just devolves characters into caricatures of themselves. I loved the characters in this story. Harry really comes alive as a character, rather than just a medium for storytelling. Hermione has quirks beyond just being a bookworm. Draco is similarly well developed beyond just an aloof bastard. The secondary characters in this fic shine. There were moments in this story that literally made me laugh out loud. The humor is clever, the little details make it work. The story has a lot of charm and emotion woven into the humor scenes. I've read a fair bit of fanfic, but this is my favorite 8th year fic. I thought the concept and plot were fairly fresh, creative, believable, and well written to boot. The aforementioned character development and humor and emotion really sold this for me.

I'm not a huge fan of dark fics either, but I can do one every now and again. It's like reading/seeing GoT. If I'm in a mood where I want to see everyone I like die, then I love GoT.
