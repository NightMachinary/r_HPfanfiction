I've already finished the Albus Potter and the Global Revelation series and it's one of my favorites. Any other stories that are really good over 100k words? Btw for those who haven't read it, super positive recommendation for that series


** The Stygian Trilogy is probably one of the best. linkffn(8255131)

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

** There's a really famous one called Linkffn(Hogwarts houses divided). It's really well done but there's only the one fic, as the author out their talents into the Alex Quick series afterwards.

There's also a professional quality set of fics starting James Potter by Norman lippert, the first one of which is titled "James Potter and the Hall of Elders Crossing". Not on ff.net, but the PDFs are free and easy to find.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?
