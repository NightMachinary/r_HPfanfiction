How long do you guys prefer your chapters to be. I've been writing a new fic for a while now and I went and looked at the chapters and they're all around 1000 words which seemed pretty short to me. What are your thoughts, how long should chapters be?

Edit: Seems I should've looked into this more, I didn't mean to be redundant.

** I'd say that a chapter should have at least 2 or 2.5k words because it makes stories more cohesive. A single A4 page has 600-800 words and if your chapter os not even two pages long the story tends to be very fragmented and pressing the next page chapter button all the time gets annoying.

My own chapters are 3-5 k words long and just for arguments sake I split them up following scenes, resulting in some very short (<400 words) chapters. While still the same story the reading flow really suffered.

** This was asked earlier this week in the context of how long is too long. I would say that it sort of depends. Some writers have very short chapters where only a single concept or scene is communicated and some do much longer.

With the serial nature of multi-chapter fan fiction, I tend to feel that longer is better---sort of as a reward for waiting. I have some that are 10 and 12k words and some that are only 4k.

Don't try and pad the word count because you feel like it's too short. If you feel your chapter does its job in a thousand words, then that's the right length.

*** It wouldn't be padding the length really it would be more like just combining them. The entire fic is finished, and it's right over 70K words, I just tend to end a chapter when the event is over instead of extending it into the next day/major moment

**** I think that's perfectly fine. Ending at the conclusion of the major action is good and I think helps the story keep the overall focus if things aren't bleeding into one another.

** A thousand words is a minimum; I'd rather have ones over 3000 (I, myself, force myself to do no shorter chapters, and it's worked out well for me), but some stories work better with shorter. On the opposite end of the spectrum, I suppose I /like/ 10k chapters, but only on complete fics, because for obvious reasons they tend to go along with really slow updates, and I'd rather have weekly or biweekly updates with 2000-to-5000 words than one chapter every three months.
