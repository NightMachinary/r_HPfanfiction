  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

  Harriet Potter finds a trunk in her Aunt and Uncle's attic and finds a book called the Marauders Compendium along with her mother's diary. And from that, she learns way too much about potions...In which, Harriet Potter is the Neville Longbottom in this universe, and she learns how to prank fantastically well. And uh, Neville Longbottom is off saving the world and what-have-you. (We don't really focus on him that much.)

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

#+begin_quote
  Speaking of dumb monkeys, Harry had never realized how many foreigners there were in Europe these days. People from failed African states and backwards Middle Eastern ones, every variety of sub-optimally cultured human. Which idiot thought it was a good idea to open the gates for the barbarians? London even had a Muslim mayor for fuck's sake.

  Learning this little tidbit had genuinely shocked him. It was true that he hadn't paid as much attention to the mundane world as he'd intended to years ago, especially after moving to Spellhaven, but missing a veritable invasion of dubiously civilized third-worlders into Europe was a bit much.
