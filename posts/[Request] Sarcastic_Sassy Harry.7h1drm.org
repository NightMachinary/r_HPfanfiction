So there's this post from like 2 years ago ([[https://redd.it/3cpk97]]) about how there aren't enough fics that keep the best part of canon Harry. I saw it, agreed, got excited, and then was extremely disappointed when I got to the comments and there were barely any recommendations. So please share if you know a fic where Harry(or others) are actually sarcastic or sassy. I'll even settle for bordering on asshole if it's clever.

The recommendations from the previous post were linkffn(6892925;9118202;8202739;9932798) to save anyone who cares the trouble.

#+begin_quote
  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Life never stops trying to tear her apart, but as everyone soon learns, Iris Potter bites back. Five unique tasks. Animagus and eventual reasonably powerful fem!Harry. Fourth year.

  My take on Harry's first year starting with him getting his letters. Add a lot of sarcasm, stir, and serve cold.

  Sequel to "Weasley Girl"! Potter's Gang are back for their second year at Hogwarts, and face a dramatic escape, a mysterious diary, a strange cat, a "loony" girl, a hidden monster and many past secrets coming to light. It looks like this year will be at least as eventful and dangerous as the previous one.

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. She was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived. (Fem!Harry) Mostly canon-compliant, diverging in book eight

  Dudley's face wrinkled in confusion at the phrase "Sausage factory." What did Harry's favorite breakfast have to do with anything? (And Dudley knew it was Harry's favorite breakfast, because every time his mum cooked sausages, Harry would loudly proclaim them to be "the best thing in the history of ever" and make a big deal out of eating his. Instead of cutting it into bite-sized pieces, Harry would gently pick his up and slowly bring it to his lips and stuff as much of it into his mouth as he could. He wouldn't bite it, though. He would just suck on it before pulling it out. He would repeat this process until dad threatened to lock him in his cupboard for a month. Harry would then give mum and dad this stupid look that he clearly intended to convey innocent surprise. This would only raise dad's blood pressure further, and he would slap Harry around the head. Harry would gag on the sausage still in his mouth, rub his head where dad had hit him and mumble something random like "I like it rough." Whenever Harry opened his mouth, unless it was to stuff in a sausage, weird comments were sure to come out.
