*** We also know she's a pure blood, and she has a younger sister that marries Draco.

But there's a lot of fanon built up around the character, too. You generally expect certain tropes going into a Harry/Daphne fics. Hence the whole 'ice princess' thing, as an obvious example. Though a lot of fics avoid that one.

Also: you didn't really answer the question. Do you not like her because you don't like OCs?

**** I mostly don't like her for three main reasons:

1) Her OCness. OC's generally fall into one of two categories: Mary Sues that solve the events of canon easily while never facing many (or any) setbacks, or thinly veiled SI's that hook up with one of the main characters. Usually either Snape or Draco, because no one in this fandom reads the books. Speaking of the second...

2) Daphne is almost always used exclusively as eye candy for Harry. I don't give a shit who's fucking who - I come here for magic, not terrible teen written drama.

3) Daphne's personality is almost always the same. Ice Queen of Slytherin, “”””””””””””grey”””””””””” pureblood family, blonde hair and blue eyes. Where's the Gryffindor!Daphne? Where's the DeathEaterandProudOfIt!Daphne?

***** In answer to your 3rd point. Daphne is canonically a Slytherin so no Gryffindor Daphne unless the author chooses to change that. And as for death eater and proud do you mean Pansy? or the Carrow twins? there are plenty of Slytherin girls who are happy to be death eaters so why make up another. I definitely agree with your first two points though.

No, she isn't. This is the only mention of Daphne in canon:

#+begin_quote
  As small groups of students were called forward in alphabetical order, those left behind muttered incantations and practiced wand movements, occasionally poking one another in the back or eye by mistake.

  Hermione's name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle, and *Daphne Greengrass*. Students who had already been tested did not return afterward, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.

** I'm going to share my personal experience becoming aware of the Daphne Greengrass fanon character and not answer your question.

As a newer HP fan fiction read, I was curious about this random character people were discussing that I had never heard of. At first I didn't pay it any attention and then after a few months I decided to search for more details about DG and looked for recommended HP/DG fics. Now, several months later after devouring DG fics, I have yet to come out of the DG rabbit hole and am firmly the HP/DG shipper category.

One downside is that too often the DG stories involve bashing one or more of the Weasleys, but I guess you get that often enough when Harry is paired with not-Ginny.

** Canon, Daphne is a pureblood Slytherin and the Greengrass family is one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. Thus she provides canon-plausible options for Harry (magical, economic, historical, legal, political, social, etc.) that would otherwise be unavailable (in the same way that Susan Bones opens up a political/law-enforcement path with her aunt Amelia). There's a lot to explore/invent there and Daphne is the most interesting option.

Pansy and Milicent are also S28, but Pansy is usually not a canon-plausible partner for Harry and Milicent (despite being a S28 Bulstrode) is a halfblood. Tracy Davis is a non-S28 halfblood (halfbloods can be interesting characters given their dual background but its harder for them to be as option-expanding as an old-family pureblood---Harry's already a halfblood himself). And the Carrow twins are usually seen as ... weird (which has possibilities though).

*** I'd just like to add that all of that is Pottermore-canon, not book canon. And the Carrow twins are just movie-canon. Pretty much everyone accepts all of it as canon when writing fics, but I think part of the confusion some people feel is not understanding why everyone else seems to know so much about a character that they don't remember from the books.

Also, Milicent is out for being canonically unattractive.

*** It's worth pointing out that the Sacred 28 isn't anything official within Wizarding Britain, it was created by some snobby pureblood who wanted to create an "in-crowd" of pureblood families. It was even noted that a number of families included in the list objected to said inclusion.

Not to mention that families that should have been included were not for a variety of reason, such as the Potters (either because they had a "Too Muggle sounding" name, or because they expressed their "Pro-Muggle" opinion a bit too much.

** Fanfiction grows in the spaces between canon. It's really as simple as that. It is much like the old advice that horror directors 'don't show the monster' for the reason that the monster the viewer can concoct within the realm of their own mind is far scarier than anything you can depict on screen. As soon as you show the monster, and it has spider legs or octopus tentacles, a section of the audience will go 'oh, phew, well it's not quite as bad as I thought'. So too is it true for more general stories and fanfiction.

Whilst an author can create a wonderful, fully realised character, it is impossible for that character to appeal to everyone. Some people love Hermione, others hate her, but no-one who has /only/ read the books or /only/ seen the movies has any opinions on Daphne Greengrass.

So that leaves us each free to imagine her for ourselves, and it is a simple fact of the human condition, borne of the variety present in the human psyche, that no two people exactly share a set of interests, just as they do not share a set of fears. So we are free to create in the empty shell of a character named Daphne Greengrass whatever we want, whatever it is that we feel creates the most interesting story or personality.

Ultimately, a lot of people would have liked to see more nuance in the characterisation of Slytherins. Rowling threw the smallest bone their way in Deathly Hallows when Slughorn returned at the head of reinforcements (which may or may not have included more Slytherins than just Slughorn), but a lot of people wish there had been more. So, to fulfil that wish they insert into the empty vessel of Daphne's name, the character of a typically good, yet still stereotypically cunning/ambitious girl who can add some depth and nuance to the Slytherin mindset.

Why, you might ask, do they not simply concoct a wholly new character to fulfil that role? Well, it's still fanfiction, and OCs are still often looked down upon (particularly in 'starring' roles). OCs are also not really searchable. Better play it safe and use the next best thing.

That was how it started, anyway. A large number of stories did this, and because of the aforementioned wish, the writers created a very similar character each time. The result of this was that Daphne, within the particular realm of fanfiction, has at this point become every bit as much of an established character as, say, Tonks.

** As others have said, she's a way to have a Gryffindor / Slytherin interaction without details getting in the way. Especially if you want to show that not all Pureblood Slytherins are evil (much like Neville and Ron do this for Gryffindor). Pansy is more well known, but she has a role in canon as Draco's hanger-on and love interest.

So you either rewrite Pansy's role or keep it and use Daphne Greengrass.

I actually like her stories, even Ice Queen stuff, but think other options are fun. Like one I read recently where it jokes about it and she's basically the utter Genki Girl who can be scary if you push her.

  Daphne Greengrass: Hogwarts Sweetheart, is the Slytherin Softie, with a penchant for flowers, coffee and cute animals. She's also VERY interested in one Harry Potter, and she wants ice cream...no I said ice cream, not ice queen, dang it! Also, throwing coconut pie is a legit way to win a fight against Dark Lords and their followers. Non-Crack. Super Fluffy.

** Precisely /because/ she has zero lines in canon, and you have to go to Pottermore and other extended-canon to even find out which house she's in.

She's a blank slate for the fanfic author to literally do whatever they want with, an OC you can use without having to use the dreaded OC tag (a lot of people avoid OC-inserts because of Sturgeon's Law applying full tilt for them).

Remember the most popular fanfiction character is fanon Draco, who not only has no lines and isn't mentioned in canon but has an actual character named Draco that has to be totally ignored and overruled for fanon Draco to exist.
