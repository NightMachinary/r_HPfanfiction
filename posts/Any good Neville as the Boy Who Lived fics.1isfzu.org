** This one is pretty good (warning: Neville isn't portrayed as complete awesomesauce): [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]] by Kwan Li.

*** I just started reading it. I'm on chapter 3 and it's pretty confusing AU. Lot of stuff is changed from canon for no apparent reason, even characters personalities.

Worse is that it starts in 5th year and no god damn background is explained or given.

**** Meh. I certainly didn't intend to infuriate anyone when I posted. I would contend that any story with Neville as Boy Who Lived is bound to be an AU of some sort, so differences are to be expected, but I get that the story is not to everyone's tastes.

I'll take a break from posting in this subreddit for awhile. I'm probably spamming more links and such than is appropriate and it's not clear that my tastes in fanfiction align well with others' anyway.

***** I didn't say it's bad. On the contrary. I'm on chapter 9 now and it's starting to look amazing, but just in the first 6 chapters, nothing made sense and it was confusing as hell. More so that most of the character changes were unexplained.

PS: But what i hate about this Fic and have to turn my suspension of disbelief to maximum is that "Ministry drafting kids into war" premise. It's so incredibly idiotic.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By_the_Divining_Light][By the Divining Light]] and its sequel, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodhs_Song][Conlaodh's Song]], are five star DLP fanfics.

They might not be what you are looking for because they are still quite Harry-centric. Basically Neville is like canon Harry "Boy Who Lived" and Harry is more like a young Albus Dumbldore or Tom Riddle.

** Well while [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4417534/1/Darkness-Falls-Upon-Us][Darkness Falls Upon Us]] is a Neville as BWL its more of a dark Harry story with an arrogant Neville as BWL acting as his antagonist. I have enjoyed it and the only downside to me is that the author is on hiatus right now
