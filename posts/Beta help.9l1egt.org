I agreed to beta for someone and the story is awful. I don't know how to proceed. Has anyone ran into this before? I don't want to ruin their vision, or stifle their creative process, but its just bad. I feel like to make the story readable, I would be rewriting giant sections of it and cutting so much that they would just be offended.


** I've had this problem lots of times before. In the end, this is how I learnt to deal with it:

- Not your story, not your problem. You can help, but you shouldn't be rewriting stuff. You'll never get it Perfect, you just improve it a bit at a time and they learn

- Explain why you are making changes. I often write little grammar lessons and link to sources about writing.

- Be encouraging but honest. People see through false compliments but there is usually something you can find, and as things improve you praise their effort and progress.

- If all else fails, pretend you got a new job and don't have time anymore.

** If I were the person I think I would appreciate you discussing it with me. Don't go straight in and change it, but ask questions to get them to consider it for themselves. As colespot has said say what you can where possible, but I think a gentle discussion to try and help them see the flaws in the narrative, style and so on would be a good way to go.

** Had a smiler situation but they improved with each chapter to the point of no longer needing me.

Point out what you can, techniques and decisions but also explain them in a way that can be applied in the future. If your explanations are good, you should see them improve.

** If you feel like rewriting sections, step back and make sure your criticisms aren't just stylistic differences.

With those eliminated, go for notes on grammar, spelling, continuity, and clarity.

** Be honest about it, but explain your reasons. Just saying "You write shit, I'm outta here!" won't do any good, but something like "I really don't think that a Harry/Giant Squid/Basilisk soul-bond fic can be done well due to X, Y and Z. X is especially problematic because of Q." would work well to get your point across.

If the author then says that he believes that an m/m/m/m/squid gangbang can save his concept, tell them that you will no longer assist them in this venture. But maybe they will see your side of the issue and make changes. Or you might end up killing the story, which is what I have accidentally done to "Castles in the Sky" when I pointed out that no one would be interested in 50k words of training montage with just Harry in isolation.

** How long have you been doing this and how well do you know the person? Maybe take a step back for a while and then talk with them and proceed.
