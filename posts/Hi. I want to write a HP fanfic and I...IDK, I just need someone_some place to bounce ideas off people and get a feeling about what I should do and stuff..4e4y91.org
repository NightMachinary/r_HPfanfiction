Dunno if I can really explain it, but basically I'd really love it if someone would agree to be - not my beta, nothing even that serious I guess - but basically, someone I could message with "Hey dude, what do you think about [x] plot twist do you think it's kinda dumb or would make my character too Gary Stu-ish?" etc.

If anyone's interested: My fanfic is kind of slice-of-lifey, for lack of a better genre. Basically, it follows a guy named Patrick, whose parents fled to America at the start of the war, and the fic starts with him about to transfer into third year at Hogwarts five years after Voldemort dies. He's a pretty bookish sort of guy, will be sorted into Ravenclaw, and he's a Charms /genius/. The story follows his life and the life of his classmates as Hogwarts /really/ begins to rebound from the war (I'll probably be taking a way more optimistic view on this than Hogwarts Houses Divided). As the characters grow older, there is going to be romance (and almost certainly references if not depictions of teenage sex so if you're squeamish about that =P).

I have not really managed to describe the soul of what I want my fanfic to be; idk man I'd write a thousand words if I really got started so I'll leave it at hat- but note that romance is going to be a major aspect of it once the characters get older. Something to be noted is that my writing style can, at times, be weird. You'll find me skipping three months at a stretch and writing five chapters taking place in a day, and you'll find me having a weird, pulp-thriller kind of writing style at times (sorry, what can I say- Lee Child is a big inspiration for me to start writing.) But there are two main reasons I'm writing this fic: One is the characters, the other is the dialogue. I'm bad at writing both, and I want to improve by writing a character-focused story instead of a plot-focused story. I don't even know if that really makes sense.

Anyway, if you read all that, thank you. Let me know if you're interested, or know a forum where I could do this stuff. I don't want anywhere serious- I'd get ripped apart on most "serious writing" forums, and I don't want that - so yeah. I'm on Steam, Skype, and gmail.


** Ideally, your beta /would/ be your idea person, but it's understandable if you already have one or don't really want to get one. Good betas are hard to find.

Otherwise, I would just post questions here. You get multiple viewpoints and it doesn't really require personal commitment from anybody.

*** That's fair enough. I don't even have a beta, though, and honestly I'd never heard of the concept until a few days ago. Maybe if I ever get around to posting my 'fic and it actually gets a lot of views(unlikely to happen) then I'll consider getting one.

Kind of weird questions, because they can be super specific at times. However, here's a silly question I have. As the narrator, I think I'll go with using the character's parent's name- so, instead of "Dad gave him an extra ten galleons, just in case." it'd be "David gave him an extra ten galleons" or "Emma hugged him before he left." However, obviously, the character is going to refer to them as mom and dad.

Is this weird? Because it's weird to me, but it's a good weird, and I kinda like the style. It'd feel weird to me to refer to them as "Mom" and "Dad", especially because the fanfic starts with a situation where the character isn't even there and his parents are talking to McGonagall, so in that situation I'll obviously name them. Of course this might be par for the course, but honestly, given how little fiction doesn't make a character an orphan...I don't even remember what kind of style is usually used!

**** I wouldn't say it's weird. Some of it depends on your style of writing, some of it depends on the perspective you're using. If you're using 3rd person limited, for example, I doubt it would be out of place, or at least not very much. 3rd person omniscient would be more-so, and I would use their names in that case. First person it /would/ be out of place to use their names, from the perspective of the son. But whatever you decide on, be consistent! Even if people notice it at first, it'll become normal as they keep reading.

**** there are not hard rules for writing only what you can make people feel and think about what you are writing is important for example i am writing a story where Harry becomes female I have Ron switch between him and her depending on the situation as a small nod that Ron is having a hard time separating his Best friend from Cute!Girl!harry

in your case it doesn't matter if your narrator calls them Dad/mom or Dan/Emma (*snicker*) as long as you don't confuse your readers.

who is your narrator? should he call them dad/mom or by their names? does it really matter? what sounds better? is important for your story's endgame?

** First go and get lost in [[http://tvtropes.org][tv tropes]], Particularly, the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanficRecommendations][Fic recommendation]] page.

Find fics you like, then read them. Then Read them again, except this time carefully analyse them for the tropes you have come to know and love.

Then, read [[http://www.accessdenied-rms.net/guide/fwg.txt][this]].

Finally, started writing. Then keep writing. Then Write some more.

Writing is a skill like any other, so you have to build it up. the prior points are just so that you have a place to start.

** In response to the other people mentioning betas, they are correct in saying that is basically who you would want ideally. However in my experience the stories that get the best views, and are marvelous, are already "beta'ed". By that I mean proofed by a person who has no connection to the story. I know it seems a common sense thing to everyone who writes anything, especially here, but you would be surprised how much of a difference it makes in quality, and as a result view rates.

That being said, if a beta is not for you, I would recommend DLP. They are serious, but that only means that they will tell you objectively what is wrong/right with your piece. If it is a minor point/ not a point that would require a ton of background info, you can most likely get opinions in this subreddit. I wouldnt do it daily, or for every plot point since we are most likely the ones who will read your story anyway.

But from what I understand, you would require a beta. If you cant find one, message me on here and I will gladly do the service.
