In the story, people made a prayer to Morgana before each class or during breakfast, can't remember. It's really the only reason why I've managed to retain memory of reading the fic. Voldemort mandated it after he took over Britain.

Anyone know of any other fics with something like this going on?


** linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall) but it will take a lot of reading before you get to the Merlin bit.

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
