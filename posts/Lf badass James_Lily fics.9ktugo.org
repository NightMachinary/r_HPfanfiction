Are there any good fics where James and/or Lily were actually prepared for the fact that they were being hunted by a dark lord? Things like ensuring Harry was actually taken care of, or they survived, etc.

I'm ok with the manipulative dumbledore trope if it's done well.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2634465/1/The-Time-of-the-Turning][The Time of the Turning]] has badass Marauders and Lilly. It's set during the summer after Sirius falls through the veil.

The backstory in this fic is that the Potters and their close friends spent a long time on the run using elaborate diversionary tactics beyond just the Fidelius Charm. Rather than just die, leaving Harry nothing but their name and money, they actually had safehouses and other measures set aside to protect him.

  Post-OotP, AU. Harry's life turns into a whirlwind of trouble, worse than before. He's got to grow up, but will he manage to live long enough to even start his sixth year at Hogwarts? WIP, getting dug out of hiatus box as of Feb'17

  Mr. and Mrs. Evans are killed when Lily's only a girl, and she's supposed to go to a home with her sister. Instead, a relative they didn't know they had comes to collect them, and introduces Lily to manners, magic, and a life that's just the slightest bit different from the life she was supposed to live.Or, an AU in which Minerva McGonagall raises Lily.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.

*** I honestly always hated that story. I like my stories to have some sort of happy ending, and frankly that was just misery compounded in misery.
