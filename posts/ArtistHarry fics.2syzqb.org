I'm craving fics in which Harry is a prodigious (or at least very talented/determined) artist (of any sort!). This can be a non-magic!AU, or not.

A plot bunny: Harry can channel his powers through music.


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] (Words: 1,253,480; Updated: ~7 months ago) the protagonist is being introduced as a painter. /(I haven't read the story myself, though)/

Another one is the [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sacrifices_Arc][The Sacrifices Arc,]] I guess. (spoilers) Here Harry gains a magical ability of singing like a phoenix, but this happens only halfway through the story (~3,000,000words√∑2).

*** PotDK is a very good story. But Harry's drawing is very much a hobby and in no real way important to the main plot, or even emphasized particularly.

*** I've read some of both. Yeah, in Dark Kingdom, Harry's artistic skill is not really important.

*** He looses that singing ability in the last book or so. Sacrifices Arc is complete.

** I can't remember the name, but I will describe it and hope that someone can help. It's post-canon. It starts with Harry going to a bar and meeting a bizarre fairy godfather...and then Harry is catapulted into a different life, where he is/was a woodworker. And then he goes back to his other life again. I think I remember that it was well-written.

*** I think you're thinking of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6435092/1/Turn][Turn]]. That's what immediately came to mind for me when I read the OP. I definitely recommend it! Well-written, and the portrayal of Harry as a craftsman felt perfectly in-character.

** I seem to remember one where Harry gets a summer job and starts making mosaics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2163835/1/The-Refiners-Fire]]

Cant remember how much of the story plot relates to this though.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/610909][With Eyes Wide Open by suitesamba]] has Harry becoming an artist, over time, and with deliberate effort, done in a fascinating way. Not to spoil anything, but Harry starts to rebuild a stone labyrinth / maze at Prince Manor, what he eventually accomplishes makes this story well worth a read, even if you don't like the main pairings (SS/HP).

Author Summary

#+begin_quote
  When Narcissa Malfoy calls in her life debt so that Severus can fulfill the terms of his grandfather's will and secure the Prince family estate, Harry agrees to marry Severus Snape and live with him for a year and a day. But Prince Manor hides a secret in its overgrown gardens, and Narcissa isn't helping Severus out because of her kind heart. Harry thinks he's going into the marriage with eyes wide open, but he has to maneuver around the Malfoys' machinations and come to terms with his growing feelings for Severus even as the magic in the gardens gives his life a new, unexpected purpose.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2917903/1/All-at-Once][All at once]] is a fic where Harry went to Stonewall instead of Hogwarts. It's very AU, writing started before Deathly Hallows was released. So yeah it's kinda different from canon but I really liked it (read it recently), apart from Harry being a bit too good at magic, it's really nice. (also warning, it's really long :p (didn't realise before i started reading)).

But yeah in the fic Harry is good at painting and drawing and stuff, he takes art classes and all and the whole thing is really a quite prominent thing about him in the fic.

** Not sure if it's what you're looking for, since Tonks is the central character rather than Harry, but I write/QM a choose your own adventure style fic aptly named [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tonks-quest-ii-tonk-harder.287117/][Tonks Quest]]. From the word go, the players decided that they'd rather pursue ART and FRIENDSHIP than magic or kung fu.

As a word of warning, it's both wildly AU and a crossover (China underwent its own modernization in the 1800s, Germany won WW1, Tom Riddle confessed to Myrtle's death and was sentenced to military service, Ted Tonks and Arthur Weasley built a wildly successful magitech manufacturing company together, TYPE Venus arrived in prehistory instead of TYPE Mercury, Gilgamesh found another immortality plant, and a few other things.)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1608067/1/][Life, As Experienced Through Your Fingers]] fits the bill. It is a non-magical AU Drarry Fic. Music features very heavily in this story (the setting is a performing arts school) and Harry is sort of a prodigy there.
