I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3553046/1/Spellcaster][Spellcaster]] and really liked SGCbearcub's version of pureblood etiquette, how it differed from muggle etiquette, and the problems the difference made. Do you know of any other fics with a complex, well-thought-out systems of etiquette (not necessarily pureblood--I read a story ages ago that mentioned Harry having to study a bunch of complicated Goblin etiquette that was interesting)?

Edit to fix hyperlink


** Saving Connor series definitely has this, but it's... a bit of a big bite to swallow.

3million+ words, extremely AU (pretty much every character is rewritten, personality wise, and Harry isn't the Boy Who Lived), lots of child abuse...

Absolutely fantastic series, though.

*** Came to recommend this series, (first story is "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]]") as I'm currently re-reading it.

While I agree its drastically AU, I'd say the characters are just variations, how they would be changed in a world as detailed as this one. Different, but not unrecognizable. And where they end up the most OOC is in the final few books, where the prior years of change and hardship has made all the difference.

I had put it off for a long time because it is a "Harry isn't the boy-who-lived" story, which seems so... AU to be not worth it, but the series was so complicated and detailed and fleshed out that you don't feel like it's a "so harry's twin is the BWL and is the best at everything, so harry has to beat him at everything miraculously and then he takes on Voldemort single handed and everyone is happy, the end" which so many of these types of stories become.

You will want to shake Harry by the end of the first story, but you aren't the only one (several characters that befriend Harry share the sentiment).

It truly is an epic and the etiquette, both light and dark, human and otherwise, are well thought out and brilliantly detailed.

Edit: Typos, because something posted at midnight must have them. :P

**** Agh, it's Connor! With an O!

I only care because that's my name, and /everyone/ spells it with an E and it drives me nuts.

Other than that you're totally correct.

*** I thoroughly enjoyed Angry Harry and the Seven, although the last few chapters kind of lost my interest, and it was the first thing I thought of when I saw this thread.

** Going offtopic: Spellcaster annoyed me. The ideas are great, but Snape is pathetic there (and by extension, his use as the reason pureblood etiquette deserves any respect fails). I'd say it is about why Hermione is ten times the witch Snape is a wizard. It's not badly written, I'll give the story that.

*** Yeah, the story itself wasn't my favorite, but the etiquette fascinated me.

**** I liked how the writer borrowed from Bushido (the Samurai code of honor), but seriously, Snape being reduced to little more than a battered housewife when he's supposedly awesome just makes it seem like a culture that should die out.

** I might try the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2473502/1/Oath-Breaker][Oathbreaker]] series. It's what comes to mind when you say Spellcaster [which is great and I love it] but I'll check through my archives later and see if there's other things I'd recommend.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6518287/1/Growing-Up-Black][Growing up Black]] by Elvendork Nigellus probably fits the bill. 250k words, WIP.

  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II in progress.

** I'm not sure if this counts, but Delenda Est provides a pretty realistic view on Pureblood Society and the rise of Voldemort over the typical ALL PUREBLOOD HATES MUGGLE(BORN) view that most writers just assume as default

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1806836/][Radaslab]] has been writing a number of pureblood culture stories that might interest you. I've found most of it to be rather dry though, mostly because he keeps going on and on and on about the strangest things, so be forewarned.
