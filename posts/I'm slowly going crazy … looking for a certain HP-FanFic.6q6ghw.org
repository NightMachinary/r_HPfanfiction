Hi,

I've spent about three hours now searching through both my history, bookmarked pages, favourite and tracked stories and authors, but nothing.

As you can imagine, I'm getting somewhat desperate. I don't know where I've read this story, what the author was named, what keywords the summary had, nor, of course, do I know the title. Maybe I'm even mixing different stories -- I've read so many in the last few weeks, it might be a possibility.

Anyhow, as far as I can remember the basic story was: Harry is in a library in Surrey somewhere, comes across a book about magic, gets taught a bit by the old librarian who then takes him on as an apprentice and takes him onto some island that's under some sort of time spell where time doesn't quite flow as it would in the normal world. He meets Ginny there, trains together, starts to form a relationship (possibly a soul bond story, now that I think about it, not sure though). They become warriors, I think he becomes something called the »phoenix lord«, but that might be bollox, too. Ginny and Harry are glamoured to look like 11 and 10 year olds, get sent back, go to Hogwarts. I think Katie Bell and Oliver Wood are their underlings at Hogwarts. Epic Fights, powerful Harry of course, equally strong Ginny -- Ginny's Grandmother might be on the council there somehow, but idk, that might be a different fanfic, too.

Anyhow, should anybody know the title, remember where they've read it, know the author, I might just fall in love with you. Or at least kiss the ground where you walk. Something like that.

Thanks in advance,

FlawedSyntax

** This sounds vaguely like a story I read early in my fan-fiction days, where Harry(at least) was raised by Morgana le Fay.

I don't remember the name, author, or much else though. It's very likely I'm thinking of another story. I'll keep a look out for anything fitting your description.

*** Can't remember whether Morgana le Fay was in the story -- but thank you nevertheless!

**** I think I know of most of fanfiction.net's stories featuring Morgana, especially those where they are paired. OP isn't ringing any bells for me right now. I'll take a look on FFN tomorrow morning and see if anything looks familiar.
