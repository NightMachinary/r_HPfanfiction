When it comes to giving depth to characters like Daphne Greengrass, Theo Nott, Tracey Davis, Su Li and other blank slate characters what are your favorite common representations?

Personally I have never actually read anything with “The Ice Queen of Slytherin” so I've always enjoyed politically savvy but most hangs out in the background Daphne. When it comes to Theo I am so used to the beat down boy with the terrible father that almost guaranteed murdered his mother that any other representation throws me off.

What are your favorites?


** Bro Cormac McLaggen.

Ice Queen Daphne was fun to read the first few times but it got old quick. Now I enjoy a Daphne that's not super smart or political.

For some reason, I enjoy a lazy Fleur who's still got her haughty pride thing going on.

********* How do you know that?

This is going to get nasty.

Firstly, as others have pointed out in the past, I don't like her because of the fandom's portrayal of her. And that's partially true, actually. I guess it's like how people hate Dumbledore because of the countless fics that have him as an evil guy who sided with Voldemort in secret.

So, she's just arguably the most overrated character in the entire series. She was described as 'very pretty'? Oh, that must mean that she was the hottest student to ever set foot in Hogwarts, can make a dozen veelas look like hags and trolls (I've seen this...a lot) and is just more beautiful than Freya, Aphrodite and Venus combined. If she's slightly above average then it's blasphemy! Lily was the most beautiful girl in her year.

Lily was described as above average at potions? That must mean that she was the smartest girl in her year and had a personality just like Hermione's. Yes, she was head girl but you know what? Head girl isn't just given to the smartest girl in the year. It's either given to someone with decent grades, an outgoing personality and shiny reputation or to someone who was elected by the student body. Simple. There might've been tons of girls smarter and more powerful than her but might've been pessimistic, irresponsible or discriminatory. But no, Lily was of course smarter than Sirius and James and let's ignore that Rowling made it quite clear that they were the top of their year or possibly the entire school. Yep, Lily is good at potions so that must mean she got an O in DADA, and O in Charms, an O in care of magical creatures, an O in History of Magic, an O in divination, an O in transfiguration (her worst subject, mind you. See how talented she is?, an O in Herbology, an O in Arithmancy, an O in Astronomy and an O in Ancient Runes, and she even got the rare chance of studying alchemy also with an O (she used a time-turner, bless her). Lily is /of course/ the most strategic mind and best duelist the Order ever had! She was the talk of the entire school, /rolls eyes/.

People point out thrice defied as evidence of Lily's power but guess what? That's vague and she 99.99% /didn't/ duel Voldemort and thwart him with James. Think about it, a teenager with zero experience who had just graduated Hogwarts isn't going to stand a single chance against the most powerful dark wizard in history who was known to be the best amongst the best and could've put Dumbledore to shame had he had the chance. Oh, he also had around fifty six years of experience. No no no, Lily duelled him and stood her ground of course!

You know what? I personally believe that thrice defied is made quite clear in the books: joining the Order, refusing to join the ranks of the death eaters and getting married. There, no duelling Voldemort and winning.

What about being a muggleborn that Voldemort wanted to recruit? Well, Voldemort didn't only recruit the Bellatrix type, ya know. That wouldn't be strategic and frankly dumb. We know that Lily was an outstanding potioneer so the most likely answer is that he wanted her for her abilities there. Why would Voldemort brew a potion himself while he could have others to do it? She most likely would've been recruited because of her potion skills even in the Order. James would've been the one who was recruited for duelling skills/abilities.

And oh, Lily was head girl, it's already explained above.

But what about her control over underage magic? Well, that was underage and I frankly don't think that you'd be able to do that after having used the wand for a while now. So really, I don't see how it would help her. Unless you're implying that she did use wandless magic on a daily basis? Well, Dumbledore had difficulty in controlling wandless magic, so I don't think Lily was more powerful than Dumbledore. But who am I kidding? Of course she was! It's Lily Evans, the girl who cast a patronus at the tender age of nine, wandlessly and nonverbally, of course.

Oh and Lily is just so awesome that she's the mind behind the Half-Blood Prince (I'm not kidding, I see this).

Now that's the fandom's portrayal of her powers. Don't get me started on her personality. I tried to suggest flaws for her once and got flak for saying she might've been a liar or dishonest or something. Maybe independent to a fault? I dunno, I see her as this annoying classical sibling.

And don't get me started on Petunia. Petunia's entire character is that way just because of Lily. Lily won the genetic lottery. Beautiful? Check. Smart? Check. Magical? /Check/. She also had a very pleasant personality and lots of friends. Petunia? She was horse-faced, ugly, not particularly intelligent and muggle. Imagine that Hogwarts was real and one of your siblings was magical while you weren't. How would you feel? I honestly feel sorry for Petunia in that aspect. She didn't have multiple friends and she had a very unpleasant personality. But my sympathy ends with her treatment of Harry. Nope, inexcusable but a bit understandable.

Don't get me started on her name! Lilies represent grace, beauty, love, devotion, trust, hope, innocence and purity while Petunias represent bitterness, resentment and anger. That's so unfair! Not just because of the names but Mr and Mrs Evans fawned over Lily a lot and she was clearly the favoured child. Petunia must've felt pretty neglected when it came to Lily. Just having a sibling who's magical and you're not. All the fairytales you must've heard your entire life are suddenly true and you're not part of them. Not cool at all.

Also, Lily has red hair and green eyes: the sign of a witch in the Salem Witch Hunts. Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious that it translates into being the ideal witch or something. Not only does she have the pleasure of having one of the rarest hair-eye combos in the world but it's also a symbol of how unique she was.

I wouldn't be surprised if her pet at Hogwarts was a black cat with green eyes called Hecate or something to just show how she was the idealistic witch even though she was muggleborn. Bonus points if her original patronus was a unicorn (which, given her canon personality, isn't far from the truth. My friend loves to look at this kind of stuff for all characters and pointed it out to me. I would've been happy not knowing that).

Also, she was the only person to stand up to Sirius and James when they attacked Snape. Like that was a school of *one thousand people*. One thousand. Are you telling me that Lily was the only person who was decent in her year or something? It wouldn't have been hard at all if Rowling added that a few people tried to interfere but Lily was the fastest or something. Anything to suggest that she wasn't the perfect person would've been okay by me.

Besides, I really want to know how having flaws would make Lily less selfless or not good enough to sacrifice herself for her child. I mean, Molly, Narcissa, Mrs Crouch, Tonks and even that random woman in DH all had flaws but did that make them less selfless or less magnificent as mothers? /No/, in fact, it made them all the more selfless because they had these flaws. Mrs Crouch is such an overlooked character, Narcissa and underrated one and that one in DH who died for her kids almost forgotten in favour of Lily.

I see it this way: You have two characters, one of them is ever-so-perfect and brave and selfless and literally has nothing wrong with them and the other is selfish, self-righteous, cold and aloft. If the first person sacrificed themselves for someone it wouldn't be that surprising although not at all cowardly or something. Still brave but expected and unremarkable. Nothing to sway you. But if the second one had sacrificed themselves then that would make you surprised and you'd feel something. You'd feel that their sacrifice is braver when you compare the act to the person themselves. It strangely seems to be more remarkable and heroic than the first although both are of course brave. So Lily being the perfect mother who made the perfect sacrifice honestly never swayed me at all. Narcissa'a makes me feel emotion, Molly's love makes me admire her, Mrs Crouch's love is amazing and all these women have flaws. They're human. They're relatable. Lily is 1D, she's almost a symbol instead of a character.

So I think having flaws wouldn't detract from her sacrifice but add more to it. I'd feel something towards her just as James. James was made out to be perfect and stuff and I found him boring but when his flaws were revealed I felt he was at least 2D now. He is now actually relatable and as close as human as you can get. Suddenly his death made me more emotional.

Lily is honestly so perfect and even though she's dead and people don't say bad stuff about dead martyrs to their orphaned kids (see? she /can't/ be perfect. People sugarcoat stuff about dead people) she did need flaws to be a truly remarkable mother like Molly or Narcissa (this doesn't sound right at all. It's as though I',m saying that some mothers are worth more than others or that Lily was a bad person of sorts. I don't know how to say it). I guess for me to feel she was a mother who faced hardships would make me think she's braver when you compare the act to her.

And from what we know about her in canon, I don't think I'd like her as a person even as 3D. She was this manic pixie dream girl and sort of like a mixture between Ginny and Tonks (both of whom are characters I don't hold any real emotion for). She was most likely [[https://www.16personalities.com/esfj-personality][this person]] or [[https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality][this one]] and they both stress me out like mad.

I sound really petty and I'm awfully sorry.

********** I will not lie, I read ¾ of what you wrote.

I have to agree with the Petunia points: I feel bad for Petunia up until she treats Harry like shit. I think it's canon that Lily didn't want the relationship she had with Petunia. And it's definitely canon that they were close before she went to Hogwarts, so Petunia is a bitch but if it was me I might be a bitch too. I probably wouldn't marry Dursley of all people or let my life be miserable because of it. But, I still get Petunia's jealousy.

I must say I read a lot of fics where she's /not/ top of the class in everything but Charms and Potions, which were her two top subjects. Most of the time she's serious about her studies, and yes she does become Head Girl, but she's not normally a goody-too shoes.

There are loads of fics out there like that, but I think that's laziness. People make her Hermione, essentially, and that's not who she is canonically. She has a lot of spirit, and I think a lot of people also make her this Ginny hybrid-- but she was friends with Severus Snape for 5 years. I think her true character is wildly unexplored because we know so little about her. Remus, Sirius, and Snape are the only people who interact with Harry and knew his parents as same-age friends. Remus and Sirius knew his father best, and so we know James' personality a lot better. Snape only divulged that he knew James to Harry for 6 ¾ books, so again, our major impressions of Jily was James. Slughorn knew Lily as a teacher and she was his star pupil. Petunia knew Lily as a sister and she loathed her (though I truly believe Petunia buried her guilt until she truly realised her nephew was possible going to have the same fate as Lily). And Snape only reveals the true memories of Lily as he's dying.

We know very little about her, and so I think your assessment of her is unfair, but I think your assessment of FF authors writing of her is fair. She's not some weird mix of Hermione/Ginny (which I think is more accurate than Ginny/Tonks), she's someone else. And I'm sure JK has a much better idea of who that person is.

If anything in the scenes where we see corporeal Lily, she's quite subdued and her love for Harry is what is so important. Lily could love like only a mother can. She didn't like injustice and bullies (which is why she doesn't like James growing up). She was talented at Charms and Potions (one of which Harry inherits). She loved her sister and lost her. She was smart to a degree. And she was clearly proven to be a good fit for Head Girl, so she was responsible. But that's really all we know.

On the lake scene post-OWLs- one thing that strikes me is that it would have probably been just fifth years by the lake. They'd come out of an exam and that's why they were milling about. James and Sirius also decide to start picking on Snape, who is still Lily's friend. We have no idea if she would have reacted this way had it been anyone else (she was probably sick of them picking on each other) and we have no idea if: 1. There were any other Slytherins about to step in for Snape. 2. Anyone else would have stepped in outside of Slytherin house anyway. Tensions would have been starting to escalate around this time at the very least with the war going on. We already know Snape was hanging out with some eventual-Death Eaters. Not many people would be sympathetic to a Slytherin.

Anywho, enjoyed reading what you had to say!

*********** I'm glad you enjoyed it! =)

My friend read my 'novel' as she likes to say and she told me it's as though I'm saying Lily was as stupid ass bitch who didnt know how to do anything on her own. I've started wondering if the implications were true but I don't see it and I don't think that's true at all! I think she was talented but not too talented. Like, I think she'd only have one or two 'O's and the rest is 'A's verging on 'E's and 'E's verging on 'A's.

I don't hate Lily in canon. I hate the portrayal of her. That's it. So I see her as this bubbly social butterfly who only truly put hard work in the subjects she likes and naturally excels at. Which is definitely Potions and most likely charms as well because her wand was good for charms.

What I want to know is how she's always the top in charms. Like, she might've had competition in that subject. You know what I mean? Why can't another girl or boy for that matter (Sirius and James? Hello?) be better than her at it? What bugs me is that a lot of people deny that possibility. It's as though it's set in stone or something. She did have hard competition in Potions (Sirius, James, and Snape) and as for charms most likely Sirius for competition at it among unnamed people.

There are fanfictions that have her as only the top at Charms and potions but the overwhelming majority in my opinion are ones who have her as the top of her year. I don't want to mention names but you know what I mean. Leave space for other people. Someone might've been the Prince or Princess of Enchanters and it doesn't have to be Lily. Sirius, James, Remus, Lily's two beat friends, Peter and Snape were not the only ones in that year. There are people we didn't know and they might've been smarter so it's unfair to make Lily the prettiest,, smartest, most powerful and talented, etc. while the others are just names. For all we might know they might've been competing with Sirius and James for the top spot.

To make my point clearer you have Lily's two best friends (let's assume that they're Alice and Marlene as nearly everyone likes to make). Given the little information we know about Alice in canon and how old she would've been had she been with Lily until she was an Aurora then she would've been much much /much/ smarter than Lily. But you typically have Lily's two best friends: the smart one (who's not smarter than Lily) and the dumb one (who needs up with Sirius. Let's call her Marlene McKinnon).

As for her personality, I based it off the beginning of /The Prince's Tale/ and Slughorn's descriptions of her, which were: cheeky, very funny, very brave, bright, vivacious. Cheeky, funny and vivacious made me immediately think of Ginny and Tonks, not Hermione. There's more than enough evidence that she wasn't like Hermione or Annabeth Chase as another example. People who make her like Hermione just so I can like her strike me as very lazy because smart muggleborn doesn't /not/ equal Hermione.

I see her as not the studious, bookish bookworm and know-it-all Lily in fanon but I think she extroverted and hippie (she /did/ live in the 1970s after all) who'd much rather party and hang out with friends than read a book. Carefree and chill. A daredevil who'd rather live in the moment but also stealthy, a smooth liar and sort of manipulative.

So she strikes me as ENFP (I said that this personality gets on my nerves but my best friend is that and she does get on my nerves).

Another factor is how Sirius and James were always described as the very top of their year (and possibly the entire school) but people reduce them to nothing but flirtatious assholes who couldn't tell left from right without Remus by their side to guide them. Like, Remus was bookish but bookish does not immediately mean the smartest. My two friends are the top of the class and the bookish one isn't the smartest. So wiping off Sirius and James's talent just to make Lily the top and seem smarter and more talented and powerful is going to set me off in a fury.

Many people hate Slytherin (Harry) but Harry would've stepped in for a Slytherin even if he doesn't like him because he hates the entire house in general. It's called decency. Unless what Mulciber did to Mary Macdonald was too extreme that it immediately made Snape and Avery ridiculously unpopular.

I don't see how I was unfair to Lily in canon? Can you please elaborate? It's not like being recruited for potions is a bad thing because killing someone with poison in their cup is much neater than stabbing them in the back. And the thrice defied, well, I looked at the events in canon and found them right under my nose and it's not like I said that James duelled Voldemort and won while Lily stood drooling on the sidelines. Because how could two newly graduated seventh years stand a chance against the most powerful dark wizard in history? /Dumbledore/ could barely hold him off. And Head girl, well, it's /not/ just given to good grades.

I'm sorry if I was rude.

************ Hey no! You weren't rude at all. Sorry, I think maybe I was getting messed up a bit in my response to be honest (it really was a novel length response!).

I do have to say that I think people's opinions of characters gets warped because of FF (/cough/cough* Ron Weasley /cough/) so that was partly what my argument was.

I 100% agree with you. My impression of Lily is exactly what you said from canon: she was funny, brave, bright in both ways. We do know she was very gifted in potions, unless it was all down to Severus helping her (which we have no idea and she probably stayed brilliant at it after they stopped being friends). The Charms brilliance comes from the goldfish story, if I'm not mistaken. She gave Slughorn a goldfish at some point before she graduated and when she died it had vanished. Now that I'm retelling it, was it only in the movies? Also edit: wouldn't that have been Transfiguration? Huh... I need to figure out where this Charms myth comes from. /end edit It really moved me and I've always thought of it as canon.

But that doesn't even mean to me that she was top in that class anyway. We really understand her as a gifted student, first through Remus and then through Slughorn. She was Slughorn's favorite student, potentially of all time. Which, I also think says a lot about her character-- what kind of student is going to be Slughorn's favorite? A demur muggle-born bookworm? I don't think so! A powerful, vivacious, personality-full, charming girl? Yes, I think so. So I agree, I think her true personality was a lot more like Ginny (throwing Tonks in the mix too... I find Tonks a bit too much in one direction with her cheer) than the Hermione comparisons. Which, is what I was trying to say when I said she tends to be molded into people's minds as Ginny/Hermione. That is what I find exceptionally lazy and turns me off of a lot of Marauder fics. Why is she so damn like Hermione so often? Bossy, bookworm, with a less friendly dynamic with the Marauders than Hermione had with Fred/George. She's definitely not this goody-good "enchantress" as you say people like to laud her as. And why does there even have to be so much black and white with Hogwarts on who is top of the class anyway? More than one person can get an O or an EE on their OWLs! She can get two O's, maybe an EE with Charms or not. And the rest be a mix of EE's and A's. It's so frustrating how perfect characters need to be revered as! So no debate there.

James and Sirius were tops in the class in pretty much everything, this is canon. They were brilliant wizards and nothing fans can do to take that away. Sometimes I think it's easier for people to compare them to Fred and George, who were "wasting" their talents in some way. But, the talent they show-off is less overall. What Fred and George really seem to possess is a lot of talent in /potions/ which I can talk about how had Snape not been potion master, perhaps they would have honed those talents for hours. But, James and Sirius are regarded as truly brilliant wizards. Even after years in Azkaban (perhaps this isn't the best example, because she was too), Sirius was able to duel Bellatrix and the DEs at the Ministry with extreme competence. And Bellatrix and co. were a) shooting to kill and b) had been broken out of Azkaban and were probably training somewhere - unlike Sirius who would want to take down his opponent and also was locked up in caves/Grimauld Place for the two-three years he'd been free. So, again- no disagreement. James and Sirius are massively underlooked wizards in most FF. And Lily's (and Remus's) talents tend to get inflated by taking away some of theirs.

I'm shady on the whole thrice-defied thing. I think it can be a very general rule- you needed a couple that was on the side of Dumbledore (so preferably Order) and who was having a child at the end of July. That's literally Neville and Harry- that's it. Not many couples in the OotP at this time, I'd presume, and even fewer who were young and having babies at a time like this. We know what Voldemort's decision in choosing Lily and James was- their son would be a half-blood just like him. And there's little evidence to suggest he wasn't just going to kill Neville afterwards (clearly Bellatrix and co. knew about them and attacked them post-Halloween). He targeted the Potters for sure more openly, but knowing Voldemort, he probably would 'kill the spare' just in case. So I definitely don't follow any BS that somehow Lily or James for that matter somehow fought or even rejected Voldemort's advances.

So the one canon bit, I guess I disagree with you about: I think I was trying to say why her sticking up for Snape post-exams, was less about her being a righteous good person over everyone else and way more to do with Slytherin's rep/war tensions/Snape's general unfriendliness and the fact that Lily was still friends with him so she was probably the first person who did anything on instinct. (Literally the whole series is in HP's POV... there could've been a mob coming to save Snape and we wouldn't have known). I have never seen it about her being this incredibly moral defender- she was just protecting her friend against people who did /canonically/ bully him. I mean, what, a few weeks later didn't Sirius send Snape to the Whomping Willow? So that never proved that's how she always acted or that she was a goody-goody like everyone else portrays her as. We have no idea if that's how she always treated James or that's how Snape and the Marauders always interacted. Heck, we know Snape pulled a lot of shit on them as well. And it was known that Snape was hanging out with potential Death Eaters- it was common knowledge. Nobody but McGonagall stopped Moody from bouncing Malfoy all over the courtyard! He wasn't even a proven Death Eaters son yet! So it's not surprising to me that's how the student body reacted- whereas Lily would never want to see her friend humiliated like that. That's just a friend thing to me... not a hello look I'm Lily Evans the Righteous Warrior!

I'm not sure why I thought you were being unfair to canon Lily, maybe I thought you just didn't like her because of how she comes off in FF? Not sure! I agree about Head Girl and all that stuff. Honestly, don't disagree with you on anything to be fair! I think this response is a lot clearer than the last one to me (I'm also now reading it on my computer instead of my phone!) Hope everything is coming across as friendly as I mean it :)

************* People's perceptions of characters do get messed up because of fan fiction, sadly. I, for one, ADORE Ron Weasley and Albus Dumbledore but the number of fanfictions that bash them is ridiculous. At first know /why/ you actually hate the character and bash them for their canon personality and not the personality you gave them. I actually made an entire post about Ron bashing. He's one of my favourites and it's such a shame he's so misunderstood! =(

I too never understand how Hermione!Lily is supposed to be Slughorn's favourite student as you said. She was so bubbly and full of life. Like this ball of sunshine that gets noticed whenever she enters a room because of her smile or laugh. She strikes me as eccentric too and the type that forbids you to step on flowers because 'You'll hurt their feelings!'. These people do get on my nerves but they're the bed of friends, honestly. Snape may have helped her at potions (but ONLY at the beginning of first year!). I have this head canon that he helped her slightly at first but then she quickly picked up and became better than him at potions. I always thought people loved her and got so teary-eyed when thinking of her is that because she was this happy ball of sun chine like Tonks and her life was just snuffed out of her. I'd

The fish thing was in the movies but I honestly don't count movies as canon since I never liked them that much. I think it's Transfiguration, not charms like you said. But the tale made me tear up! Her wand was good for charms Ollivander said so that might've been a hint of her special subjects. Although I don't believe that having a wand good for something automatically means that you're good at it. I always thought that when a wand is good for a particular subject that means that you're not particularly good at it and your wand - who's supposed to be your friend by now - helps you. It seems cuter in my eyes.

You know, I never gave much thought to Fred and George (both of whom are still alive, by the way!) so thanks for pointing out their expertise at potions. It fits! I honestly think that Fred and George had it right: Use your talents for something you think is worthwhile! That's better and you much more fun out of it and as Hermione pointed out, they used some extremely advanced magic. I honestly love Fred and George along with Sirius and James.

Sirius! I spend the majority of my time fangirling over him (and Fin nick Odair). He's my favourite character and I don't think he was whiny or anything like that. Sort of why I don't like the Wolfstar ship - he's always a whiny boy who can't read without Remus by his side and the ship is always happy and fluffy because people gloss over Sirius and Remus's canon personalities and relationships. It was much more than that if it was canon (which I find unlikely). I'll defend Sirius until there's nothing left to defend. I agree with you 110% on Lily and Remus's powers getting inflated, come to think of it.

I guess I overthought SWM's events. You're right, I guess.

********** Okay, I'll go through your points one by one, if you insist.

On appearances -- every even slightly canonically mildly attractive girl has been described as the most beautiful girl here, there, or anywhere in fanon. Take Hermione, Pansy, and Daphne as examples. In canon? Hermione's bucktoothed, frizzy-haired, and all that rot, but in fanon, she's a shining goddess. Pansy is utterly gorgeous in fanon, despite canonically being pug-nosed & etc. Daphne, who's basically a blank slate, is the hottest ice queen ever of Slytherin. It's not just Lily.

Okay, but no, there's no way that personality's the defining trait, because -- well, Percy Weasley, really? You think he's not pessimistic and doesn't judge pretty damn hard? So there's no outgoing personality there, and he's not well-liked by students, so a mediocre reputation. And then there's James Potter -- sure, he could have matured later on, but irresponsible? Yep. Discriminatory? Yep. Probably pretty damn smart? Yep, so he's the head boy.

I doubt there's anything like elections -- you can't make them inter-house, because that would be unfair, but you can't do them throughout the whole school, because you'd never ever end up with a Gryffindor or Slytherin head girl or boy (neither house would vote for the other with canon's house grudges), and Hufflepuff is laughed at so probably not them either, so you'd just wind up with Ravenclaw head girls and head boys. Just loads and loads of Ravenclaws.

So yeah, is Lily going to get a bunch of Os? Yeah. Is she going to get all Os? Maybe not -- I still think she'd get quite a bit -- but fanon exaggerates everything, so once again -- this /isn't a Lily-specific problem/.

Thrice defied actually /is/ evidence of her power. Otherwise, how many petty things do you think other people have done that would have defied Voldemort? Say you're a healer at St. Mungos, and you keep on healing his victims. You've saved 3 of them. Congratulations -- now you've defied him 3 times!

So does indirect defiance count? No, I really don't think indirect defiance to that extent -- joining the Order, refusing to join, & getting married -- counts. Loads of people joined the Order. So they'd probably have to actually fight it out with him.

Briefly, I'm going to go over the name thing. Plenty of Rowling's names are like that. Sirius Black is named after the dog star, and he's loyal to a fault -- he spends years in a hellish prison because of a mistake, and when he's back, he still just wants the best for Harry. Dumbledore makes a mistake, doesn't bother to give him a trial because war, and he still joins the Order after he's out. Remus Lupin is a werewolf, and his name is almost literally wolf wolf. His parents couldn't have predicted that he'd be bitten, could they? When Hogwarts is invaded, Pansy is a pansy, and tries to give up Harry. Tom Riddle is a bit of a riddle -- we know he's evil, but then most people don't, and it takes a bit to figure out who Voldemort really is. He wants to be immortal, so his chosen name is 'flight from death'.

I really think you're trying to downplay Lily a bit too hard. I'll reply again with the points I haven't gone through later, since I'm multitasking.

*********** I really feel hat when it comes to Lily in the fandom that it's a very soft topic. As I said, and that's my opinion, I feel she's overrated. Thrice defied /is/ vague and never specified. Even Rowling herself said that she coubts defying as arresting one of his henchmen and I did point out the thrice defied in canon and I don't know how to make it any clearer than that.

When it comes to looks I agree that almost every female is described as too pretty than in canon but forgive me when I say that Lily is a bit too overrated when she's the prettiest, smartest, kindest, mos skilled and talented and the most perfect girl in her year. That's too much. Why can't other girls be smarter than her? Why can't other girls be more skilled or talented? Why can't others be prettier? Really, no reason other than to glorify Lily more than she is already glorified in canon.

I only compared the etymology of her name to Petunia's. I would have had no problem if her sister at least was a decent person like Lily.

As for the Head position, I should have said being discriminatory against muggleborn s and half bloods and the such. The 'classical' Slytherin (ugh). We don't actually know if Percy was popular amongst the students of his year since we only see him through Harry's biased eyes. He did have good leadership abilities and could be very charming when he wanted to. We judge Percy because of him leaving his family in the alter books but he doesn't seem like a pessimist. I bit too strict, yes but not a pessimist.

Lily's grades strike me as a bit like Harry's except switch the O to potions and the E to DADA. Granted, they're just opinions and interpretations and that's how /I/ interpret it.

When it comes to the prophecy I think a lot of couples defied him thrice and that was the difficult part to figure out in the prophecy had being born at the end of July not been mentioned.

I don't think I'm downplaying her too much because there's no real evidence that she was the smartest in her year or smarter than Sirius and James for that matter. I guess what bothers me is how Sirius and James get downplayed in /favor of Lily/ while there's no evidence that she was better than them at anything.

************ Why would Lily's grades be like Harry's? Lily grew up the favoured child in a (decently healthy) household, and was probably encouraged to work hard by her parents. Yes, innate intelligence, personality, and your own determination matters, but you can't say growing environment has no effect on academic success; remember that Hermione, while very driven and all that, probably had at least some parental pressure in regards to working hard, because her parents were dentists. Different environments will breed different study habits.

Harry, on the other hand, grew up neglected or abused, depending on your standards, and definitely deprived of food; the Dursleys coddled Dudley and probably wouldn't care about nurturing him in academics. He was basically pushed down and told that he was a freak, all the time, and nobody ever helped him. He couldn't even really help himself out of the situation, because Dumbledore put him there, and Figg didn't really care. Does that seem like a healthy environment that would encourage learning? Even when he gets to Hogwarts, he befriends Ron first, who is patently lazy, so he has no real need or want to excel. We only see him doing good in defense because he needs it to survive, but really, if he didn't need to defend himself from disasters every year, he probably wouldn't have bothered so much (I mean, Harry is just about never proactive, unless he's actually forced to be so). So yeah, comparing a kid from an abusive household to someone from a healthy, normal household isn't exactly fair.

Like I said, it Petunia is named Petunia because she's a petty, awful character. That's it. Because Lily is nice, her name is Lily; because Petunia isn't, her name is Petunia. Because Sirius is loyal and a good friend, his name is Sirius; because Remus Lupin is a werewolf, his name is 'wolf wolf'. You can't say that you don't see the trend.

Once again, thrice defied is vague, but then tell me how St. Mungos healers aren't all prophecy targets if it's that sort of vague defiance. You can't explain that away. If Voldemort tried to kill someone, and they even tried -- not necessarily succeeded at it -- to save that person, then they would be defying Voldemort's wishes.

#+begin_quote
  I say that Lily is a bit too overrated when she's the prettiest, smartest, kindest, mos skilled and talented and the most perfect girl in her year.
#+end_quote

And as I said, that sort of wank has been done over every character. Hermione is beautiful, omniscient, and super skilled and powerful and helps everyone. Daphne is cold, but it's fine 'cos she's hot, and she's super kind when you get close to her and also smart and pretty and skilled and secretly the best witch of Slytherin (and Hogwarts, she just doesn't want to show it). Etc., etc., etc.

If Percy was so memorable, Crouch wouldn't have kept calling him Weatherby. And on discrimination -- who knows? Wouldn't it actually be more /likely/ (at least pre-Dumbledore for Headmaster) that a headboy/girl would favour purebloods, because they hold most of the power in society? Until Dumbledore, I doubt anyone cared all too much.

And is hatred against certain houses not still discrimination? If Head Boy is supposed to be going to an outstanding student that is generally good, etc., then I don't see how James Potter -- bully that probably got loads of detentions, guy with decently violent pranks, and all that rot -- would have gotten it. So tell me -- how are you going to justify /James Potter/ as /Head Boy/, other than pure Gryffindor favouritism, if it's not just grades-based?

Anyway, if you want to talk about judging through biased eyes, what about the fact that we get a lot of info on Lily via Snape (who is utterly possessed with her), or people that liked her and are therefore willing to paint a prettier portrait of her, especially when talking to a poor orphan boy that is also a national hero?

************* Oh my god, thrice defied is still vague and /yes/, the healers at St Mungo's /would've/ been counted as thrice defied had that little extra detail about Harry and Neville not been mentioned. My point is that Lily is an overrated character.

You don't see why Lily would have the same grades as Harry? Well, you remember in the first book when Harry said that he used to get full marks/nearly full marks but Vernon and Petunia /forced him to bring lower than Dudley/, right? The common misconception about Harry being stupid is annoying and his portrayal in fanfiction as this super intelligent guy is frustrating. Harry was smart but he was just reckless.

Most of his grades were 'E's. Tell me that /that/ isn't above average. /It is/. Think about it, Harry had lots of pressure on his head: the DA, occlumency, the visions from Voldemort, Umbridge herself and OWLs. But he still did get mostly E's and an O. Just because Hermione gets 'O's n every single subject except one doesn't mean that Harry is stupid. He's just overshadowed. Every person should know this by now, Hermione was a special case. She spends her free time either knitting or studying.

I should've said that discrimination as in the real world one: like racial or religious or blood supremacy. Not the sllybhouse rivalries. We know that James was extremely popular, cool and loved by almost all. We only have Lily's word that he was a bully an I think his relationship with Snape was more of a rivalry since he used levicorpus on Snape and where would he have learned it had Snape not used it on him? Please.

Percy /was/ memorable. The problem is with Crouch himself. He was the head of a department and arrogant. Really, put yourself in Crouch's shoes. He's an arrogant man with lots of pressure on his head so any new employee he's going to dismiss because oh he's just sooooooo important. Ugh.

I do know the etymology of the names, thank you very much. I said in my ploriginal post that Petunia's character is just a product of Lily being the classical younger sibling that is just oh-so-perfect. I /do/ notice the patterns. There's also Fenrir Greyback, Narcissa (do you see me complaining about her name? No), McGonagall, Hagrid, Regulus, Bellatrix, Dumbledore and Trelawney among countless others. My complaint is that Petunia could've been so much more but she wasn't.

I already said that I do know about that sort of stuff being applied to nearly every character (except poor Ron 😢) but Lily is just a bit too much. Being the second coming of Merlin and the best at everything. She doesn't even have rivals! At least Hermione, Daphne and Susan do sometimes have competition in class but really, Lily doesn't. That's what a I don't like: she doesn't have rivalry and *Sirius and James are reduced to idiots who can't tell left from right just so that Lily could seem smarter, etc.* I should also probably say that I read Marauder era fanfiction more than the era of the Harry.

Your last point, again I already mentioned it before. She's being seen through rose colored glasses and everyone will exaggerate everything about her. That's why I think she's overrated.

************** Is it that hard to imagine that a healer (or a former healer) could be pregnant at that time? It doesn't even specifically mention Neville or Harry. It could be /anyone/ defying him that had a son around that time. "Born as the seventh month dies" doesn't even have to be the last day; it's so vague it could just mean near the end of July. Well, anyway.

Look, did I say anywhere that Harry is stupid? I said that Harry is /unmotivated/, which is different. Smart kids can be unmotivated. Some parents make their kids work harder than others -- and sometimes it fails, but when it succeeds, they have a better work ethic. If Harry grows up learning to hide his academic talents, and then just coasts along on what he has and doesn't actually /apply/ himself, he's not going to get as good as he could. It's like an 80-90% versus a 90-100%, to compare it to our grading systems; sure, you can coast by and get 80s, but if you apply yourself like Hermione, you can get 90s-100s (Os). But /Harry doesn't have/ any chance at an ingrained work ethic for that sort of thing, so he coasts along. Hermione's parents are dentists, and medicine isn't exactly easy, so she would probably have been pressured to work harder and get better marks. Lily grows up in a healthy family, and healthy families generally encourage their kids to succeed -- how? Well, normally, by /hard work./

So maybe Hermione would naturally have gotten 90s, but now she's getting 95s and 100s, and maybe Lily would have naturally gotten 80s, but now she's getting /higher marks/ because she was probably taught to at least do /some work/ in school, by her /healthy, loving family/. Harry? Harry's got no healthy, loving, living family to push him to any sort of success. We see him doing a bunch of his homework last minute, we see him asking Hermione for help all the time, we rarely see him visiting the library to actually study. Harry's coasting by with 80s, because sure, he's smart, but just because he's smart, it doesn't mean he's applying himself.

#+begin_quote
  We know that James was extremely popular, cool and loved by almost all.
#+end_quote

So basically, James is perfect, because bullying isn't a real-world issue and should definitely be ignored? Yeah, okay, tell me another one. You said you acknowledged his flaws, but where's this acknowledgement now? Nowhere. Because bullying is just a school issue, and bullying in school definitely has no consequences later on life (on both the bully and the people they bully). And if you want to doubt Lily's word on him being a bully, where are you pulling this 'extremely popular, cool, and loved by almost all' from? Huuuh.

And the other characters were? Most of the characters had names that at least somewhat fit their personalities, behaviour, etc. How could she have been so much more when she was predestined? Go @ Rowling angrily for her naming patterns if you want to love Petunia so much.

If you think Hermione-Sue fanfiction has Hermione with competition in class -- or in anything -- you're sorely wrong. Same with the other girls you mentioned.

I never said that James is perfect. Never. He's far from that. He was highly flawed but he also had good qualities, you can't possibly deny that!

Those Hermione Sue fics are /not/ what I was talking about. I was talking about her having competition in class in fleshed out and readable fanfictions while even in popular and decent Marauder era fics Lily still doesn't have any competition whatsoever.

As for Lily I think we'll just have to agree to disagree. My point is that she wasn't the best of her year and that's what I believe. We all differ at the end of the day and will never have the exact views and opinions. Just like people go on a rampage about Hermione and Daphne doesn't doesn't mean that others who read different fanfictions don't hold the same opinions about different characters. I see Lily as an average girl but slightly more bubbly and cheerful which makes her stand out and become memorable.

** Marcus Flint as basically a more ruthless Oliver. I've read my fair share of Slytherin!Harry fic, and it's actually a bit disappointing when fics don't use him.

*** I read a fic once where Harry pointed out that Flint was supposed to have graduated the previous year, and asked if he had failed his seventh year. Flint responded that no, he had graduated, he just came back to school for the express purpose of playing quidditch, and that Harry was the only one to notice.

**** I love this! The default is usually that he intentionally failed a year so he could have one last shot at the cup (which didn't work out too well for him in the end), but people somehow not noticing that a graduated student is hanging around to play quidditch somehow just fits the wizarding world.

** I don't feel very strongly on Daphne and Theodore, though something feels off if the former is depicted as Malfoy-level Death-Eater material. On Tracey Davis, I love /HPMOR/'s hilarious portrayal of her as the superposition of an average teenage girl with the (childish) ambition to become a Dark Lady.

*** As far as I remember, she was a Ravenclaw student in the same year as Harry etc., who also didn't appear in any meaningful way. One of those names that popped up whenever they read out lists, like for the exams/hat.

** Tsundere Pansy. It seems a natural extension of her Super Bitch mode that fanon always seems to write her in.

But then, I'm a Parry shipper, so I'm biased.

** Su Li as a very quiet, reticent character, regardless of /why/ she is that way.

I read a fic many years ago which depicted her as nearly mute to a trauma in her past, and I guess the image kind of stuck. Unfortunately, I don't remember the title.

Then there's an R18 fic /Silence Game/ by Silens Cursor where she craves silence. Not my cup of tea (Harry's kind of... psychotic here), but I'm not exactly spoiled for choice.
