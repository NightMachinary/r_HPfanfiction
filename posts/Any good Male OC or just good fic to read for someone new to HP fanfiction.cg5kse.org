** In my case my introduction to fanfiction was HPMoR (which is /technically/ male OC although it's a spoiler) but I wouldn't recommend it for everyone as it does some things really well (logic, creativity) and completely fails at other things (realistic characters) so it takes a specific taste in fanfiction to enjoy.

**** It's the most controversial fic in history for a reason, some love it some hate it. It's got some interesting philosophy in it but if you fundamentally disagree with the author it's difficult to enjoy. It's well written in that there's a lot of effort and details in it, but if you don't like the style you'll probably not like it. Philosophical discussions on the author's forum has created some ideas on consciousness and AI that even Elon Musk talked about (Rocos Basilisk). It's everything but a typical HP fanfiction.

** If you like badass action and slow Harry/Hermione, I'd recommend one of my favorites: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

The first few years are slightly different although it's only hinted at (using Veritaserum instead of Polyjuice), but in the middle of second year Hermione gets framed for theft and can't prove her innicence without revealing that they drugged Draco, so she gets expelled and really wants revenge. She eventually gets it after years of training, the entire Voldemort war where she sees more action than most others without anyone knowing about it, and a slight detour of ruining Malfoy's associates first. Harry becomes an auror after the war to help clean up the Death Eaters and gets frustrated that the mysterious "Night Nargle" that's robbing the rich purebloods always escapes from him.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** I remember really enjoying Death Of Today which is HP/LV. The main character is still technically Harry (named Izar by Lily tho), but he's so OOC that he's basically an original character. It's insanely long but it was a good read. Linkffn(5402147)

  COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.
