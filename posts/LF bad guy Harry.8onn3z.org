Basically the title. Doesn't matter whether he is a protagonist or antagonist or what side he is on. I just want to see Harry who is clearly not a good person without the author making excuses for him.


** linkffn(10182397; 11131988) I'd personally read the prequel first but even if you read the sequel it doesn't really matter.

And in my opinion there is nothing that beats this 'bad guy' Harry fic.

**** I tried reading one of them and gave up. The author tries so hard to make it super-mega-dark, it is almost cracky.

**** Personally, I enjoy the story because it's:

1) Evil Harry

2) Passable grammar and punctuation

3) Relatively unique premise (I haven't seen an immortal, evil Harry anywhere else)

Then again, my standards for fanfic are shamefully low.

** Linkffn(12021325)

Antithesis is pretty good. It is the only good WBWL fic I have ever read. It is still updating and Harry can not only be seen as evil, but his past has also messed him up. Being raised by abusive psychopaths does not make you a normal functioning member of society. It can get heartbreaking at times and the writer does very unexpected but logical things.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** The Prisoner's Cipher linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher).

To put it bluntly, Harry is basically a cackling maniac in this fic (along with another unnamed person...). He is incredibly competent, but ruthless and clearly vicious. There IS a reason, but you have to read to figure out. Its not a redemption fic, in case you are wondering.

** Well, there's always linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived). Also, would seventh Horcrux fit?

And then there's one of my absolute favourite fics, though it's kind of Fem!Harry (an OC one too), is linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus).

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
