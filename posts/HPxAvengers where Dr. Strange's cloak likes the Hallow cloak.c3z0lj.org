I remember reading it before where Dr. Strange and Harry are talking and Harry placed his cloak on a rack and the Levitation cloak went and keep on bothering it causing Hallow smack the other cloak and hiss at it. Harry and Strange has this wtf moment.


** Was it this one? I don't know about hissing, but it definitely has the Invisibility Cloak and Levitation cloak at odds.

***** When you think about it, the Bismark was a king of the ocean and was seen as so strong as to be classified as a male, so since Voldermort likes power, It is %0.5 less weird.

#+begin_quote
  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.
