** They are discussing Dumbledore over there at [[/r/HarryPotter]] too, and my comment is:

To make kids heroes, you gotta dumb down the adults. Death Eaters, the Ministry, and the Order were all paragons of incompetence.

Dumbledore, as the leader of the Order, had to be made incompetent and ineffective, or else Harry and Co would never get their chances to shine.

Those kinds of plot are of course fine for teens and children, but as adults looking back at them, we no longer feel satisfied.

Since we are unwilling to attack JKR, her characters in the Books, Dumbledore predominantly, get the bash instead.

** Dumbledore is a somewhat morally complicated character in canon, so it's not surprising that he gets bashed.

Ron has some moments in canon that make him look pretty bad, and some people focus a lot on that rather than his good qualities. Additionally, he's cast as the friend, and a lot of fic writers probably don't see him as their type of friend, and cannot separate their own desires from Harry's.

I think I see bashing most when a writer wants a character to have new friends or a new romantic interest, and doesn't really understand how to do it.

** There are two things about canon Ron that stand out:

One, Harry enjoys being with him and strongly values the positive qualities he sees in Ron.

Two, his negative qualities are fairly common in teenage males.

And there is one thing about canon Harry that ties into this -

Harry has an emotional attachment to his friendship, his first friendship ever.

Now lets look at Ron-bashing fic fanon. It too gives Harry one particular distinctive quality -

Harry is a narcissist. Friendship has absolutely no emotional value or connotation to him. It is purely a utility for his own personal profit. He is constantly running a cost-benefit analysis on it and as soon as he believes he can't profit from it enough anymore he drops that friend like a hot potato. That may, depending on the author, be ranging from not having Harry and Harry's goals as the top priority of their life (but instead having to deal with their own family problems) to disagreeing with Harry's plans or methods to daring to have their own original thoughts.

** There's nothing wrong with it to be honest. At least for me. But there are conditions attached to it. I want and expect the author to be creative in their bashing. It must make some sense. Reading about Dumbledore or Snape interested in children is just wrong. An example that I'd give is Ginny bashing. I stop reading if they mention Ginny and love potions in the same sentence. Or Ginny and potter wealth. I have key words that I look out for.

So there's nothing wrong with bashing the characters for legitimate reasons. If your story progresses naturally and the bashing goes with the flow then that's fine.

**** A lot of the popular stories on fanfiction.net (as in, lots of favourites/follows/reviews) aren't actually that good. There's a rule called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law][Sturgeon's Law]] that basically says 'most of anything is rubbish'. The reason you don't find all that stuff when looking at actual novels is that the bad stuff doesn't get published - but remove that barrier, like for all of fanfiction, and the bad stuff is mixed in with the good.

If you're looking for good stories to start with, there's some links in the sidebar to various stories that are recommended on here and are in general a good bet for finding decent stories. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/497pp8/general_recommendations_thread/][General recommendations]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3f97u2/the_most_popular_fanfics_of_all_time_in/][Most Popular]], and the [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki//r/HPFanfiction_Wiki][wiki]].

Also, there's a very popular story (on fanfiction.net) called linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality), which has had a rather mixed reaction on here. Some love it, some hate it, but it's worth checking out for yourself to see where you fall. There's even a subreddit for it, but it has a lot of spoilers so I'd advise not checking it out until after you've decided whether you like it or not. It's at [[/r/HPMOR]].

** I saw you were currently reading Harry Crow. I am also currently reading it (a little over half way through), so I completely get what you are seeing, at least with regards to this story. To be fair, this is typical for the author.

However there is an easy explanation for both Ron and Dumbledore bashing:

Dumbledore is often viewed as a sweet old man whos trying to help and guide Harry, but a deeper look shows a very sneaky manipulator who often manipulates for the greater good without much regard for those directly affected. Hes not a bad guy necessarily (although some will argue that), but he does have attributes that make it easy to bash, and provide good reasons for it, and not feel bad about it.

Ron on the other hand is a bit of a different situation. Hes not bad, but lets face it... hes also kinda an un-likeable character at times. He speaks before he thinks, is a bit of a prat, a pig, a snot, and whatever else you want to throw out there. He has the excuse of being a kid (a male teenager), raised in a crazy house with a TON of older brothers. But again, hes easy to bash. The other aspect is that there is a decent portion of HP FF readers/writers who preferred the Harry/Hermione pairing and both because Ron was part of the trio, and Ginny is naturally more likeable as a character or easy to "excuse", he gets dumped on.

To be honest, i got into FF to begin with because I hated the pairings JK ended up writing in. Mainly Hermione/Ron. I always HATED that pairing and I wanted Hermione/Harry from day 1 and when it didn't happen I was very disappointed. The pairings I always desired and felt fit the story better were Harry/Hermione, Ron/Luna, and Neville/Ginny. I am sure many will disagree but the point is that these pairings were what I was "expecting", wanting, and feeling would work.

Also, I completely agree with one of your other comments with regards to "Harry Crow" about Hagrid being "ignored". It also happened to make me feel bad. That said, I think it fits the story. This is not your typical Harry story and he was raised in a much "colder" environment if you will.

I agree on the others, Harry and Hermione kind of just made sense in my opinion (they are good for each other and they can relate because they both know the muggle world and don't need to explain concepts (electricity for example!) to each other etc. - not to mention that she's his best friend, not Ron (she never betrayed Harry actively - unless you count no writing to him on Dumbledore's orders!)) and Ginny and Neville kind of makes sense, too (they went to the ball in GoF after all!)

You should go back and reread the books. Harry barely likes Hermione, without Ron there as a buffer Harry is often annoyed by Hermione and will go out of his way to avoid her. Ron is Harry's best friend, they like hanging out, they have similar interests, they have a similar sense of humor. Most of all they can get mad at each other and everything is forgiven with a simple apology. As someone with a best friend who I want to strangle some days this is a huge factor for me in determining what makes a good relationship.

Harry only avoids her when she sticks her big nose where it's not wanted and where it doesn't belong either (or when she's following some authority figure to the letter, despite knowing that those people can be wrong, too - like when Dumbledore tells her not to write to Harry! It's not like Deatheaters actually know how muggle post works, then there's also the TELEPHONE, too!)

I know about the Firebolt and I won't defend that action, ever! Hell even if it had been jinxed it would still have been NONE of her business - if Harry wants to risk it it's not her job to snitch to the teachers! Ok, let's say we count this as a betrayal, than Harry doesn't have any good friends (!) as Ron's betrayals (GoF and leaving on the horcrux hunt) are much worse as the first could have gotten Harry killed (dragons!) and the second could have killed both him and Hermione!

Neville needed a confidence boost, but yeah they could have gotten together then (she did like him, otherwise she wouldn't have gone to the ball with him, she's headstrong so she wouldn't have gone with anybody just to be able to go!)

**** Ok well to start off I agree its not the "perfect" pairing. But I also think that its a relationship that could of developed late into the books because they both "changed" some with Ron changing far more. I do think there is some logic to it.

Luna did initially have a crush on Ron, and while they may of changed as she got to know him, it was still there initially. Ron and Luna also both have a childish side to them, albeit different types. Luna is also a known factor to the Weasleys and is a friend of Ginny's so there is a bit of a matching of families that could occur. Also Ron does mature over time and later on I think he actually matches with Luna much better then Hermione (Just have to ignore the first 4 books).

Without a doubt I can see Ron/Hermione growing apart and divorcing within 1-2 years because they drove each other crazy and shared few interests, while I can see him and Luna growing to love each other MORE as time goes on and exploring each others interests.

Also while I was sad about Hagrid, I dont disagree. I actually hate him as a character and completely understand arguments against him, but the child in me loves him as well. I really only truly "like" 3 HP canon characters. Sirius Black, Luna Lovegood, and Hermione Granger... and Hermione grew on me. I hated her years 1-3 and then she started to grow on me and I loved her character later. As for Luna, I like her if for no reason than shes a fun character study, and has a side to her that stirs my imagination. Sirius well... hes just so likeable and has so many facets to him.

I think that Ron is too forceful and Luna too otherworldly for it to work well. It wouldn't be a very interresting pairing. A Fred or Georges/Luna would be more interresting, I reckon (Maybe in a post-Hogwarts fic, though). Luna/Neville seems a lazy choice.

Ron/Hermione is another of the pairings that don't make much sense to me. I find it lazy, again. Hermione would turn like some kind of a second mother to Ron. It would work better with Harry, who is more stubborn.

Neville/Ginny makes sense, Draco/Ginny too because of the themes and conflict that comes with it.

Well, I gues anything can work if you tweak the characters enough...

********** Ron is forceful but not overbearingly so later on. I think people get caught up in the mask Ron puts on much of the time. I still think they would work. But you are entitled to disagree of course.

I agree with every other pairing commentary except the George/Fred and Luna. I cant see that working out if for no other reason than the Twins are too wrapped up in their own expectations and plans. They need stronger more independent women then Luna would ever be in my opinion. Its not that Luna couldnt be strong or brave or independent, but her very nature is outside the bounds of such typical things.

Again though, its all pure speculation.

I know what you mean, people have a tendency to overlook Ron's good sides. But I still don't see the point in Ron/Luna. I mean, it certainly can work, but it doesn't seem as interresting as others. It seems a dead-end to me. Though I'd like to read about the interractions bitween Luna and Molly.

I think that Luna is probably the only girl in the cast that could keep up with the twins. Every other girl would only keep their feet on the ground. Which is a shame. Although it would be a difficult pairing to handle.

Also, a Ron/Pansy could be so much fun. Ron needs to be admired and Pansy has shown her hability to provide that with Malfoy. Another one that would be difficult to handle... And would earn you a Fatwa from the hard-core HP Fandom :)

************ Pairings involving the Slytherins are always a bit of an interesting study although many are over done. Whether Hermione/Draco, Pansy/Ron, Harry/Daphne, or any of the other such ones. Although pairing Luna with any of them might be an effort in futility without massively changing Luna.

***** I don't like her (Hermione) - much...I think she has a lot of growing up to do as well! Things like getting over her social awkwardness (she's worse than Harry or Ron in this regard) and her need to correct people all the time and be the absolute best everywhere...not to mention her total trust in books (I am using a shocking example here: Hitler's "Mein Kampf" (My Fight) is a book and it's a load of racist trash!) and authority (Dumbledore more or less sacrificed her friends happiness and childhood - not to mention Harry himself later on (he didn't leave Harry any other choice - ok, except walking away!) - and she still worships the ground he walks on -.-)

I agree on the divorce-thing (and so does the actor who played Ron in the movies...hell, even Rowling admits that Ron/Hermione wasn't her best idea in hindsight!)

Yeah, Ron/Luna might work out - but on the other hand it might not (Ron isn't the most sensitive of blokes - he's more the "Bull in a china shop" kind of person who'd rather barge in somewhere rather than knock on a door!)

I can't even see Hermione having a child early (If at all! Sorry, but IMHO she's an independent woman and ambitious, too so children would only slow her down!)...she'd rather establish herself financially etc. first!

Yeah, the kid in me likes Hagrid, too - but reality doesn't agree with the kid (hell, I liked Dumbledore as well once upon a time - until I realized what a manipulative person he really is...not only that: He's also neglectful and careless...If I ran Hogwarts Filch would be out of a job (wanting to torture students my ass!), same for Hagrid, Trewlany and Snape (his lessons are downright dangerous and he doesn't seem to show ingredient preparation etc.!))

****** I actually hated Dumbledore from the start... even the kid in me did. I think i recognized his manipulation pretty early and kept questioning why he did certain things as they made no sense to me if he was a good person.

As for Ron/Luna... he does get better as the books go on, and I can honestly see him being much more open to Luna's oddness and actually embracing it at times as well as enjoying the possible adventure she might insert into his life (going on trips to find the creatures and traveling the world), rather then things that are more "bookish" and "intellectual". Luna also is implied to enjoy food herself (if memory serves me... at least on a few occasions she makes reference to pudding and things).

As for Hermione... the things you mention are part of why I did not like her at first but came to like her later. I honestly think that pairing her with Ron actually created a situation where she came off worse in attitude/emotional/personality appearance then she would of paired with Harry or even someone else.

******* He can't afford to travel the world :D (sorry, I know making fun of someone for being poor is low, but it all comes down to his irresponsible parents! They should have stopped after the twins (!) - seriously 4 kids is enough - daughter or not...adopt damned if you want a fucking girl!) because he will not inherit money and his grades aren't stellar enough to make much money either!

Maybe - but she even treated Harry badly when she thinks she's right (the Firebolt comes to mind or listening to Dumbledore when he orders her not to write to Harry (sorry, someone who saw people get killed gets counceling in RL - Harry got jack shit!) or when Harry suspects Draco in HBP and she just brushes him of like one does an insect on their clothing -.-)

That's why I like the idea of Harry/Hermione actually (as long as the writer doesn't make him a whipped "Yes"-Man or make her into a docile doting girlfriend!), they compensate for each others weaknesses (not all of them - Harry's socially awkward as well for example!) and challenge each other, too (Harry challenges her believe in authority and books - she on the other hand encourages him to trust people and seek help instead of just keeping everything inside etc.)

ps: She's also damned NOSY, always sticking her big nose into stuff that's none of her god-damned business - NO she doesn't always know better :(

Wizard/Witch. Apparition. Cheap methods of travel. Cheap Wizarding tent. Really all they would need to spent chunks of money on is food.

** I personally don´t enjoy it, specially Dumbledore bashing... I think it simplifies one of the most complex characters of the series (together with Snape in my opinion). Yes is true that Albus made mistakes and seems to look at a bigger picture ignoring the people who might be affected by one of his decision, but to turn this character into simple manipulator old bastard is simple and doesn´t grasp a much more interesting debate about moral and ethics that his character can bring to the table, specially if he indeed have his heart in the right place.

** People opening their eyes -.-

No, really - I liked them both when I was younger, but I've come to realize that Ron's an uncultured, bad mannered traitor (he's a bad friend and he drags Harry and Hermione down IMHO!) and Dumbledore's only worth of contempt (maybe not even that)...putting Harry at the Dursleys (no due process, no child-services involved etc.) is a crime IMHO, not to mention that he doesn't protect Harry from the abuse he suffers at his school (Snape, Umbridge and even his fellow school-mates who bully him on several occasions and or try to kill him (Draco in HBP), not to mention his other teachers (McGonagall isn't a great head of house and likes to dismiss the students concerns and she doesn't either protect them from harm!)) and then thinks he can just sacrifice the boy (note: I would act like he does, but I'd give Harry a lot worth sacrificing himself for - as it is he's lucky Harry didn't decide to go down the same path Voldemort did a few decades earlier!)

** Both Ron and Dumbledore are imperfect characters. They have plenty of faults. The very worst part is that they're ... not Harry.

Harry is (usually) /The Hero™/. Anyone else is fair targets for bashing.

#+begin_quote
  Ron is mostly always portrayed as a right prick with no manners whatsoever
#+end_quote

I don't know about the manners, since it's been a while since I read the books, but he could definitely be a right prick at times in the books. Did he have bad table manners in the books, or is that just a fanfiction thing?

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledoor (sic) seems to have changed into Dick Dastardly
#+end_quote

The easiest explanation for Dumbledore's decisions and actions in the books is that he's an unfeeling manipulator, perhaps even outright evil. He's responsible for most of the plot twists necessary to make Harry the abused and downtrodden /Hero™/.

And the Philosopher's Stone "traps" very much points to either a manipulative set-up, or extreme incompetence on the part of all the adults.

But most of all, most authors are inexperienced and lazy, and two-dimensional characters are much easier to write than bothering with character development.

*** Most of those authors do not understand that JKR didn't really care about characterisation when it got in the way of her plot. Dumbledore couldn't act in-character, or the plot would not have worked and the children couldn't have saved the day in each book. Trying to explain his (in)actions in-character leads to the "Evil or Inept Dumbledore" trope.

** Personally i rather dislike Dumbledore because in the grand scheme of things it felt like he did not much of anything..

Dumped Harry at Privet Drive and seemingly not checking up on him even once..

Did next to nothing to prepare for the return of Voldemort..

Had Snape on staff for a decade with his higher then requires standard when it came to NEWT students, which logically speaking would and should cripple medical and law enforcement staff at the very least.. And a host of other things i will not elaborate on at the moment because touchscreen keyboards suck..

Ron Weasley gets on my nerves because he is loudmouthed, and expects the world served up on a platter.. First year he saw himself in the mirror equalling or surpassing all of his brothers but aside from making a decent keeper he never put in the effort to do any of the things he was hoping to achieve when he was in his first year..
