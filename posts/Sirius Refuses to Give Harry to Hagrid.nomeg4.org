If anyone has any fics where Sirius doesn't hand Harry over to Hagrid that would be great.

They can be a one-shot with just that part. A chapter story with that as the first chapter or a flashback scene. Anything where Sirius does not let Hagrid take his godson to the Dursley's.

I just read a one-shot where Sirius gives Hagrid Harry to hold and Hagrid refuses to give him back but Sirius meets them at the Dursley's instead of going after Peter, something like that is also acceptable.

If anyone is interested, the story I read is called "I'm His Godfather" by Gratiae.

  For Sirius, going through the Veil opens up doors. Pretty much literally.
