OK, so I've been (kind of) outlining an idea for an HP story for a few days now, as it lets me think about something besides another fanfic I've been writing, and a distraction from life in general. Anyway, the short of it is that it begins early on in Harry's life (maybe 2nd year of primary schooling) and he begins noticing the occasional odd thing thing that happens when he's upset or surprised or something (accidental magic). At some point (this bit probably isn't exactly the same as in canon, as I don't remember when it happened) he accidentally Apparates onto the roof of his school, which causes him to conclude he can do magic (or maybe he'll initially think he has superpowers). This makes him realize he could escape from the Dursley's if he can learn to do it properly, which he uses to run away once he can control the Apparition at will. After he gets out, he starts to develop a sort of Riddle-like thing where he has more conscious control of his magic prior to having a wand (not dark though). So before he went to school, his understanding of magic would be more intuitive (since he lacks the framework to understand it in a structured way) and have more raw power behind it, but his control would be less than ideal (at least until he gets a wand).

One thing I want to do is (since this starts off before he goes to Hogwarts (though it'll get there after a little while)) capture the mindset of how a child might interpret and act with this sort of thing happening. So like I would probably have him start off thinking he has (non-magic) superpowers and so that would explain why he'd keep it a secret (even kids know superheroes hide their identities). Would probably have him come up with silly names for certain things (maybe he'd call Apparating "Squishing" or something until he learned the correct term). I might need to make him a metamorpmagus to allow him to hide better, otherwise I wouldn't find it believable that the authorities (magic and muggle alike) couldn't find him.

But there's something I want to do that may be a bit hard since I don't live in the UK. I kinda want to merge the two worlds better. I always felt it a bit boring that they were so separate, and that the inability of many wizards to hide in plain sight in public just seemed ripe for them being discovered. So an idea I had was to have the MoM integrated into the government (and in other institutions, like universities, hospitals and such). This would give them a good chance at keeping the lid on their existence if they are dispersed throughout the system (Legilimency and Obliviation). And I figure this would extend to things like their school (documented under a different name) and curriculum (would include some mandatory non-magical courses so they blend in well and can meet educational standards), and they would actually exist as documented people in the muggle world. But I don't really have any knowledge of either the governmental structure or the education system in the UK, so that's probably going to be a pain to write. It will also probably require to increase just how many magical beings exist in the world, but I'm fine with that.

Anyhow, this would play into Harry's use of wandless magic, as in this case I plan on having the MoM having something akin to the Trace to pick up accidental magic, so they can get a read on the general location of the magic that was used. The reason being it seems like another recipe for them being caught if a kid, say, casts a strong cushioning charm in public when they nearly get hit by a truck or something. Harry would quickly notice how people kept "Squishing" near his location and so he endeavors to be more careful when casting (this is a reason I'd probably make him a metamorphmagus). Primarily, he'd use magic to steal food I suppose, maybe help the occasional person, and it colors his view of what magic should be used for.

Naturally Dumbledore and others would be trying to find him, which Apparition would make hard. Would get caught after a couple of years before being properly introduced to their world (planning on McGonagall to do so, maybe raise him afterwards, maybe hide him away when she finds out about his life with the Dursleys). I think life at Hogwarts would have some similarities, although honestly I'd like to change some things that just seemed baffling when you think about it (the obstacles to the SS, hosting Dementors near the school, etc.), and maybe make some original events other than the canon ones. Since Harry would have more familiarity with trying to use magic without a medium, I figure he might find using a wand a bit bizarre, and maybe harder, earlier on. He'd have more of a pragmatic outlook on what magic is to be used for due to how he used it while living on the streets.

I could go on, though I don't have it planned out to the last detail (just a general outline, pairing settled (H/Hr)), but lemme know what you think (is this an interesting premise? has it been done before?), any suggestions you have, and such. Thanks~
