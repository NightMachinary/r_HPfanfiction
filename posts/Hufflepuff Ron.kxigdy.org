You know how in all those bashing Ron stories, he gets to the Hufflepuff house against his will (he wants to be Gryffindor as his whole family) and he is completely miserable there?

What if he wasn't? What if he found he actually truly is a Hufflepuff? I heard many times that the Devil tempts in areas of our biggest gifts? Are you tempted too strongly in some particular area? Perhaps it is where you may be most helpful. In this spirit, exactly his biggest temptations (laziness and jealousy) are exactly going against his Hufflepuff tendencies: loyalty and hard work. While in the Hufflepuf house his forced by his classmates to be fair, humble and hard-working, and he finds out it is actually area where his life is the best. Gryffindors tend to be glorious shining stars like lightnings of the sky, but they have tendency to die young (James and Lily Potter being glorious examples). However, when he gets over the temptation of achieving fame and glory, he finds out that he really longs for the normal life his parents had. Perhaps being an Auror or some Ministry official (or owner of the shop with his brother), having family, and returning to his wife every night is the best life for him.

Just going against the bashing trope.


** Is Ron actually that lazy in canon? He doesn't do as much as Hermione sure, but I always took canon Hermione to be a nerdy overachiever whose interests happened to align with her schoolwork.
