Looking for a Harry who is detached about being accepted by others and uses his strengths to let no one stand in his way. In my mind I'm thinking that his Aunt and Uncle show him no love but don't show him hate either. I'd also like for Dudley being the one to take him under his wing and be the one coaching him to prepare him for the other world. I see Dudley telling Harry something like "Remember that your Harry Potter, cousin of Dudley Dursley. You don't take sh!% from anyone". And I'd also be fine if he starts school at an older age. (I know that no story may exist like this but would love anything like the title says). Thanks!

A really good story I started reading this weekend, thats being updated regularly. Harry spends a lot of his time studying and learning different types of magic. He becomes very powerful at a young age, but doesn't show off, or care what others think about him. Dumbledore is more like a mentor, allowing him access to the restricted section. The Dursleys don't have a major role beyond what they do in Canon, but its a great story about a powerful and motivated Harry.

*** Seconding this recommendation just for Dumbledore's characterization.

**** I really liked his role in this fanfic, as opposed to the way he's depicted in other stories. He's not overly controlling, or manipulative, like he often seems to be portrayed at. More like a Grandfather figure.

Another great story I was reading recently, unfortunately it hasn't been updated in over a year. Its about a Harry that gets transported to a parallel universe after all thats left of either side is a few wizards, Voldemort, and Harry. He arrives in what would be his fourth year, his family is still alive with multiple kids, and a "girl who lived". Harry gets adopted by the Flamels, and goes to Hogwarts in his fourth year with the knowledge of a 21 year old. He has a strained relationship with Dumbledore, gets placed in Slytherin, becomes good friends with Malfoy, and basically turns Slytherin house on its head with new changes. Very powerful Harry, who doesn't give a fuck. One of my favorite stories I've read in a long time.
