A crossover between HP and the videogame Fate/Grand Order. 8 year old Harry finds himself in the setting of the game and is adopted by one of the characters there, an Assassin named Mata Hari. It's an anthological WIP, with scenarios revolving around Harry and the various characters, as well as the effects that saving the world can have on an emotionally-damaged child, even with a supporting environment. Beware of fluff, hurt/comfort and othe such fuzzy/painful feelings.
