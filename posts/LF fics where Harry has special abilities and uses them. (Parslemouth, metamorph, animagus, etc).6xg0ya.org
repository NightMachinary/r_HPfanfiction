Doesn't need to be a super powered Harry but I hated how in canon Harry almost never talks to snakes or anything, and I've always thought that he whole hair growing back thing was a sign of possible metamorph powers. Bonus points if he uses more then one and or if parseltounge works on dragons


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

Parsletongue, Occulmency, and Legimency play a huge role in the fic(with Metamorphmagic and Animagic too, just not Harry's).

***** Believe it or not I actually didn't notice the othet two. But /Parsletongue/ and /Legimency/ are obviously just actual misspelling --- the fingers hitting the wrong key --- whereas "Occulmency"... a lot of people seem to believe it /is/ written that way, and that it has to do with "occular" (because of the eye-contact thing), even though it's actual rooted in /Occluding/.

******* True. Could be that in this case it was just a honest typo. But I'm so annoyed at the constant misconception (on the same level as calling a Parselmouth a Parseltongue) that I immediately lashed out upon seeing it.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

I'm reading this now, and I'm enjoying it quite a bit. It gets into Harry's parselmouth ability and magic he can use with it.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
