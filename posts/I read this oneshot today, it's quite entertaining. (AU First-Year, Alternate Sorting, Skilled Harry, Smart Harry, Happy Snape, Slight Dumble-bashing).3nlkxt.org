** I find fringeperson's stories to be a bit of a guilty pleasure for me. Particularly like his (her?) HP/Avengers crosses, being a big fan of Loki, as well as Calculation and She Likes Bugs.

EDIT: If you liked Calculation, you might also like linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113588]]), which I think I liked even more.
