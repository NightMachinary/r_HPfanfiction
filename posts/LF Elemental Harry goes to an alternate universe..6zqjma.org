** I know a fic where harry is a water elemental and does visit an alternate universe for a short amount of time, if that helps?

it WAS called harry potter and the elementals power. but it looks like it's been taken down. :( shame too as it was truly one of the better Slytherin! harry fics on this site.

edit: looks like you can read it here :[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4118383/1]] + some other sites if you do a bit of googling.
