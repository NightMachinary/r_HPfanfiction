** The name escapes me at this time, but there was a story where I think the Ring ends up with the Riddle Manor caretaker, and the Diadem ends up with the divination teacher, both getting possessed but eventually getting over it.

*** Souls Abound by Robst. Every Horcrux tries to posses someone with all of them going wrong. For example the locket gets Kreacher who then kills himself and the cup gets a goblin who goes mad with power and gets himself killed.
