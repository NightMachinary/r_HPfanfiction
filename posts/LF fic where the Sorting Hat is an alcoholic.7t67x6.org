** I remember when I started reading Harry Potter fanfiction a few years ago and there were so many things that seemed weird and disturbing to me, with all kinds of strange pairings and things like male pregnancy, or literal god-Harry.

Now I've gotten so used to seeing the weirdest ideas appear on fanfiction sites that I think; meh, the sorting hat an alcoholic, sure.

*** Its a crack fic obviously but it's pretty funny and quite original without being too out there
