I once read a fic where Lily finds a diary that when she writes in it the words appear in the future where Harry is able to write back and respond. I'm wondering if anyone knows of the fic or a fic similar to it that has Harry communicating with the past.

The enchanted chatroom connects people from different times (Marauders' era, Harry's and Next Gen's), unbeknownst to them. As some of them have the same names and/or surnames, hilarious misunderstandings happen.

Contains one or two slash pairings but otherwise it's a gen story. Abandoned.
