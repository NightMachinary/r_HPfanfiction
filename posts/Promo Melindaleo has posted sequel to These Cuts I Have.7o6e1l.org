So one of my favorite authors, Melindaleo, just posted the first chapter of her sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11317075/1/These-Cuts-I-Have][These Cuts I Have]]. It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12787674/1/Some-Cuts-Leave-Scars][Some Cuts Leave Scars]] and it covers the year after the battle.

I haven't read These Cuts I Have in a while but I remember it being good, not great, in part because I had wished it covered the full year after the war and not just the summer. But I felt her 6th year redo fic was one of the best of the redo fics and her 7th year fic, "The Seventh Horcrux" was very good.

If you're a Harry/Ginny fan, I recommend following this story, which will hopefully update regularly.


** Ooooh exciting! Thanks for the heads up!
