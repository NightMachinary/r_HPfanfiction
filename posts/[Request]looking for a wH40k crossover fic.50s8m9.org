  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

  There is only one possible explanation, the God-Emperor had decided to test his faith and his resolve. Why else was his life the mess it currently was. No matter he will prevail to smite the enemies of Humanity once more.

#+begin_quote
  His plans to insert himself within the guts of the Ministry of Magic have been highly successful, his apprentices are proving to be both talented and intuitive, and his efforts to consolidate his position within the mundane world are proceeding nicely. But as he knows all to well, all plans disintegrate on contact with reality...and what is English Heritage anyway?
