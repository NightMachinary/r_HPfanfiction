:END:
Sorry if any of this disturbs you, my apologies also POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD.

I can't remember much but the story was dark and a crutial, and horrid scene had Snape bitten by a werewolf (maybe Remus?), transforming after which he kills Crabbe and mauls Goyle, before raping Draco and one female student. I remember Madame Pomphrey saying Snape's knot had been stuck inside and had to be cut off using a cutting charm. The girl ended up breaking down after finding that she's pregnant.

Another had potions class testing poisons and antidotes, Snape talkin shit like usual, but things escelated after Harry refuses to test Draco's antidote against the poison. Snape uaes the poison on Harry's friend, he attacks Snape, cutting off his hands with what may have been diffindo.

One had Ron being a greedy bastard in Harry's vault. When he went to touch the gold, is latched onto him heating up as it began replicating, burying him in superheated galleons.

The last on my mind had Harry using a plate to win against the dragon. He put runes on it that absorbed temperatures above 40Â°C so as to absorb the dragon's fire, but not absorb ambient heat, say from himself or the spectators. Nickolas Flamel is attending and the two talk shop. Flamel ends up interested and sends Harry an alchemically altered galleon, which is silver, which Harry states should be impossible and that the philosopher's stone is a cheat. Harry also make Fleur a pendant out of gold which redirects her allure back into herself

Sorry for any run-ons any help is appreciated, also before I leave, anyone have any fics where magic is used internally like Kirei Kotomine-esque reinforcement on the body, or martial arts in conjuction with magic? Or dual wielding wands like escrima sticks? I've already read the Oriental Philosophy please no katana!harry, there were other, better swords in asia, like the jian, dao, and tao. Or maybe something that isn't the shiny arming sword (it's not a broadsword, the broadsword isn't even medeival, and was like a straight sabre) of Gryfindor, like a messer or saber. Also any fics where an object has some much darkness and hate that it becomes malicous? Like a wand or weapon that has spills so much blood, is hungers for violence and war? Sorry again guys, got in a ramble. Any suggestions for fics of a similar vein would be great!


** Wow, I am intrigued.
