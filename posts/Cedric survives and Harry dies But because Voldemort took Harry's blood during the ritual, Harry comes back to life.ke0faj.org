How does everyone react? Does Dumbledore end up realizing what happened? Who meets up with Harry in limbo? etc.

*** If enough of Limbo was in his head Harry would have seen his parents in canon.

** I always imagined it being diary!Tom I know a lot of people imagine it being his parents or death or whatever but that never seems to fit right as the Harry who does early hasn't accepted it like canon DH Harry had Tom being there would be such a good mirror to Harry who probably wants to move on once realizes what is happening and see his parents where as Tom wants to go back due to fearing what lies beyond As for everyone's reactions I think the only one that matters is dumbledores who I imagine has to make adjustments to his plans but I see everything else going the same way fudge burying his head in the sand people thinking Harry is a liar and so on. Cedric would be disregarded as being addled like the trio were in third year The only major difference I can see is no Cho romance in fifth year

** This is a great idea. I feel like all the recent fanfic prompts have just been comedy, and don't get me wrong, that's awesome, but it'll never top actual prompts that are this interesting and story-changing

** This is legit interesting. I can just imagine freaked out!Harry and Cedric would be VERY surprised, including Voldemort and Peter, and Dumbledore will try to find a way to plan with it.
