I agree so much! Why is this even a thing? Is it just a justification that explains why Slytherin isn't a bunch of evil people for not coming to Harry's rescue when Draco says mean stuff? Don't these authors understand that even without those rules people prefer their in-group? Most people don't care about the petty squabbles of two kids in school and don't want to emberrass themselves by speaking up anyways.

** I actually asked about the Slytherin 'United Front' thing way back, turns out - if you take Pottermore as canon - there's a bunch of vocabulary in the Slytherin introductory speech if you get sorted there that supports the whole thing, in less poorly-explained terms, and without any BS "because the rest of the school are against us" reason.

Otherwise I'm afraid OP that I can't think of any Gryffindor re-sort time-travels off the top of my head, sorry for not actually being able to answer your request.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)
