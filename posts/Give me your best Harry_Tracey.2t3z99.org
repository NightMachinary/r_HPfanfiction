I don't think I've ever read a good Harry/Tracey fic. Any of them out there?


** edit: I don't even. Wow.

/facepalm/

Kwan Li, you're the best.

He did do Harry/Tracey well though so I still recommend it :D

** I'm currently reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]], so take this recommendation with a grain of salt as I haven't finished it yet, but the quality of the writing is, so far, pretty high.

*** Quality of writing is great. All of the Riddle sections are intriguing. One of the better backstory Tom Riddles I've read. The only thing is that I'm pretty sure I've read this story as I particularly remember the end of the first chapter.

I'll keep reading to see if I've actually read it though.

Edit: Well written story, though I soured towards the latter half of it when Harry loses it. I had read it before, but not in a long time. Thanks for the recommendation!

*** I've read it and finished it. The writing is pretty good, but I wouldn't say there is anything particularly special about the content. That being said, it's better than any other Harry/Tracey that I've read.

I mean there are a bunch of others (that aren't by you) but they aren't the sort of thing I'd recommend. Also I love Hogwarts Battle School, just putting that out there.

You made the same mistake I did!

Look at OP name. Look at author name.

*** Amusing but too much smut for me to take seriously. Got through a couple chapters of it though.

Glad you like HBS! Update should be out later today.
