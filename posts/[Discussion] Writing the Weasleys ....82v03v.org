... and how to write them well?

Writing Ron comes semi-easily to me (or I hope that it does), but in writing an as-yet unpublished fic, I realized that I have little idea on how to properly characterize the rest of the family. Reading character pages online only takes me so far, and, unfortunately, I don't have time for a series re-read.

Examples of what I'm clueless about (when it comes to Weasleys):

Defining characteristics, dialogue tips, what-not-to-dos, and pretty much everything.

Any help would be greatly appreciated -- and some recs for in-character Weasley fics couldn't go amiss either!


** When writing the twin, there are several things you should definately avoid.

- Don't have them switch stealing every couple of words, whenever they did this in canon, they would usually only do it once halfway through the sentence, maybe twice depending on the sentence

- The Gred and Forge joke was only used once in canon and never heard from again, don't make it into a recurring thing

- Don't have them refer to each other as brother mine

*** Those should be the three commandments whenever anyone wants to write the twins.

** Look at what motivates each character. Why do they do the things they do. Don't write too much into a characters main traits though. Its likely to become cliche like many other fanfics do. Could you imagine the characters saying something like what you've written? The movie actor voices may help in this visualisation. Make sure to have your own character development though, even if its parallel to the books, make sure its still there, stories that don't rely on source material for detail and depth are better quality.

*** This is good general advice, thanks.

Sometimes? The problem is that it's been a while since I've gone through the books, and also that I generally don't read a lot of Weasley fics, so my grasp of their personalities isn't the best.

*** He actually managed to work his way into the story more than I'd expected! It's probably since he's one of the least characterized of the Weasleys -- makes for less conflict with canon.

On the other hand, it means that filling in the gaps is necessary since he's practically a tabula rasa.

**** Don't make him a sex God xd

It's how he's usually portrayed in fanon just because he's a blank slate.

***** Yeah, I'm in no danger of writing him like that, fortunately.

** You don't have to reread whole series to get characterisation inspiration (though it's generally desirable when you write fanfics). Just use searchable ebooks or google "Name quotes" to get some quotes that will give you the feel of the character.
