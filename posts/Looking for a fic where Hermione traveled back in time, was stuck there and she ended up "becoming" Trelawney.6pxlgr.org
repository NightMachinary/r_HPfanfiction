I know that sounds bizarre but my friend and I both read this fic a while back and cannot find it anywhere. It was really good, but we can't remember much beyond the fact that she travelled back in time, and there was no way to go back other than letting time pass naturally. Somehow she ended up becoming a professor at Hogwarts and adopting the Trelawney persona as a way to not be recognized as Hermione Granger as she got closer to her own time. It sounds crazy but I think I remember her having fun with being over the top. It was a Severus/Hermione story I think, because that's pretty much all we read, but I can't for the life of me remember why she went back or what happened other than her becoming Trelawney. Anyone know of it? Would greatly appreciate it, thanks. Or if you don't know it but want to recommend your favorite time travel Hermione fics, I'm all ears. Just rewatched POA and that always puts me in a time travel fic mood. Thanks in advance!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795), is by far my favorite Hermione time travel. She and Dumbledore cleaned up the mess real good, without bothering with that 'maintaining time line' bullshit.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545), is my next favorite Hermione time travel. It's a quite fun story, but Hermione was only part of a group that travelled back.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717), is told from James Potter's POV and offers a fresh perspective from the usual time travels.

Finally, I need to mention [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455). It's only an one-shot and not that good at all, but it's the only fic in which Hermione travelled back to Tom's era and SUCCESSFULLY killed him.

  "Knockturn Alley," Hermione breathed, and a rush of relief flooded inside of her. At least she didn't end up amongst cavemen or dinosaurs. Time-turner fic. Sirius Black falls behind the veil, the time-turners are destroyed, and a Gryffindor is going to change history.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
