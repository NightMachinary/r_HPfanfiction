There are many 5th-year stories around where Umbridge is recognised as a problem and should be dealt with. And by far the two most common approaches are a "prank war" or murder, with the occasional "play nice and sabotage the Ministry from within" ploy thrown in between.

Now, I don't have anything against murdering Umbridge for torturing children (you could probably even stage something that would make it self-defence given how quick she is to resort to the Cruciatus). But it is often not a suitable choice for the main cast unless you get Sirius or a defected Bellatrix involved somehow (or Harry is a time travelling war veteran).

So what other ways are there to neutralise Umbridge?

We recognize that children setting people(or their nerves) on fire, mind washing them, mind raping them or indeed putting them in solitary confinement is wrong. There should be a system of law enforcement and government that deals with crimes so children don't have to and that they SHOULDN'T be able to in the first place.

​

But that just doesn't exist in the HP universe. What that says about the personalities of the people who do things like that, well...

More fics should explore this to be honest. I'd imagine muggleborn(specially the ones who are smart/good with spellwork) would go quite mad with the kind of power the WW gives half educated teens.

Who exactly? Quirrel makes the attempt on the Stone after the students finish their year-end exams. Lockhart does his thing when there's roughly a week left. Lupin - well, can't say about Lupin. Crouch Jr stays until June 24, the night of the third task - the students leave in a couple of days time. Umbridge, Hermione and Harry take her to the centaurs after their OWL exams. Snape flees either during late May or early June.

As for the respect from students part, look, I've had freshly graduated teachers in college who were just a few years my senior. That didn't stop the class from treating them with the respect they were due, and college students at 18-20 can be a lot worse than 16-17 year olds in high school.

That's actually kind of my point: within thirty years, Dumbledore had already scratched the bottom of people who were simultaneously good at Defence, good at getting students' respect and attention, and not evil. All the teachers hired by Dumbledore in the books display at least one characteristic, and he may have thought they had the others:

- Quirrell was really good at Defence, but lacking in charisma, and also secretly evil. ((Dumbledore didn't know Quirrell had gone evil, nor that he would be such a pathetic wreck of a man; since that was a disguise put on to fool people into not taking him seriously as a threat, it's likely that when Dumbledore knew him as a student he was much less jumpy and pitiful.))

- Gilderoy Lockhart was very charismatic, but turned out not to know much of anything about Defence, and also to be kinda evil. Not very much compared to Quirrell, but still.

- Lupin looked like the mythical three-in-one, charismatic and good at Defence and not evil, but unfortunately, the "not evil" part only concerns the times of the month when he's /not/ a furry hellbeast.

- ‘Moody' was great at Defence and inspired respect, but was secretly evil.

- Snape is certainly not lacking in authority, he's not evil per se, and he's certainly competent at Defence. How unfortunate, then, that he hates children.

In all cases it was probably a choice of evils, you know? There was no doubt someone more charismatic than Quirrell, but they were probably really evil. There was surely someone less evil and more competent than Lockhart, but they were probably a weak-voiced half-Goblin old lady with a face full of warts.

*********** You still don't get it.

Both Quirrel and Lockhart were rather poor teachers, meaning that no one would have batted an eye if Albus had chosen someone who was average or below average at teaching for 1995-96. The students weren't really expecting anyone good by that point, and literally anyone who was sane would have made for a better teacher compared to Umbridge.

Even Crouch Jr isn't that good of a teacher seeing as he uses human transfiguration on Malfoy as discipline for what is the equivalent of a schoolyard fight - while this is understandable from the POV that Crouch was a Death Eater with a corrosive hate towards all who forsook Voldemort, the remainder of the student body would still be too wary of him to actually foster a decent student-teacher relationship.

As for Snape, he knows his stuff, sure, but couldn't care less about his students. Again, a mediocre to bad teacher.

From all this, we can clearly see that hiring someone who was good at Defence, but not so great at teaching would have OK. In short, anyone not named Umbridge.

Which is why there might've not been anyone at all who wanted it. Who knows if Dumbledore even knew what kind of person Fudge would place at Hogwarts.

He reported her blood quills to Dumbledore right away, who then memory charmed Umbridge and made her think she had cowed Harry into submission. Later, when Dumbledore was still forced to leave the school, he took Umbridge with him and turned her over to an allied paramilitary organization, who interrogated her exhaustively. After determining it was her who had sent the dementors, they executed her by slow hanging.

** I'm rather disappointed with how Rowling wrote Hermione in some moments. I mean; Hermione doesn't try and let the other Professors know that Harry is being forced to use a Blood Quill during detention, but she gets all huffy when Harry uses the Potion book that the mysterious Half Blood Prince, used? (That actually helped Harry in class); That's kind of some messed up priorities there.

I mean yeah, Harry would have been upset about it; but if someone (Not even Hermione but Ron or someone) had told the Professors about the Blood Quill being used on Harry, maybe they could have done something about her earlier.

Also; I forget, was it ever confirmed that it was Umbridge who sent the Dementors to Harry where he lived? I can't remember if it was ever confirmed; but that was a headcanon of mine. Maybe Umbridge could accidentally let it slip out that she did it, and they arrest her or something as well.

** The problem with killing Umbridge is that the Ministry will just send someone else instead, and this someone won't necessarily be any better.

Creating a scandal using Skeeter is probably the best option. This way Fudge will want to distance himself and the Ministry from Umbridge, and it will show whoever comes next that they don't have a free hand to run Hogwarts without consequences.

Alternatively, the Order can always take a leaf from the previous professor's book, doze her with a sleeping potion in a secure location and have somebody impersonate her under Polyjuice

And I'm sure that the Ministry could find someone just as bad. Umbridge couldn't have climbed as high as she did if it wasn't rife with corruption and turning blind eye to all sorts of sociopathic behaviour. Imagine everyone celebrating getting rid of Umbride and the Ministry sends McNair instead, another employee of the year.

** Arrange to get some hairs from Remus Lupin while having his furry problem. Add to Polyjuice potion. Feed to Umbridge. Retreat and see what happens.

Option 1: changing into a werewolf is so stressful that it kills her

Option 2: while raging through the school in a combination of animal rage and sexual dysphoria (since she's now also a male werewolf), the staff is forced to kill her

Option 3: because it's partly inhuman hair in Polyjuice, she stays that way even after the hour is up. Confronted with the fact that she will live a life as a werewolf without even the respite of most of the month being human, she commits suicide

Option 4: somehow by accident this leads to a permanent cure for lycanthropy. Umbridge is made the poster child for werewolf rights. She commits suicide (or becomes a better person, which essentially solves the problem anyway).

** The biggest problem with Umbridge is she is a master at using the rules, but also feels no need to be beholden to the rules herself. So any sort of clever tricks to use the rules to your advantage should pretty much fail outright because Umbridge doesn't actually care about the rules.

Really the only way to deal with her short of ... /illegal actions/ is to drag her into the light of day. The problem with that is that the ministry is in her pocket and the newspaper is in the ministry's pocket.

There's only a few people we can be sure both have sufficient power to deal with her /and/ are not under the sway of those who support her. One of them is Dumbledore... and he doesn't have sufficient power to deal with her. Apparently. There's nobody both willing and able to hold that flashlight to see the cockroach for who she really is.

Her literally torturing kids with the quill is something of an open secret among hundreds of children (some of which are children of very influential people) as well as adults who, theoretically, have a responsibility to keep such things from happening.

Probably your best bet is to try and arrange it so that someone like Amelia Bones is present when Umbridge tries to do something hella illegal like using the cruciatus on a child.

You either have to kill/long-term ward at st. mungos her, or get her into such a position that there would be literal riots if she didn't end up a lifer in azkaban or worse. Anything less means you get a Dementor to the face, courtesy of her viciousness and connections.

** Getting her caught using her blood quill is probably the easiest solution, but my my favourite that I've seen in a few fics is why Harry plays ball with Fudge and convinces him that Dumbledore's real plan isn't to raise an army, but rather to leave the Ministry defenceless by sabotaging future auror candidates through abysmal defence teachers and by having Snape block people from getting NEWTs in potions.
