It could be something major, like Harry being a Horcrux, or something more minor like Hagrid being half-giant or Snape becoming the DaDa teacher in the sixth year.

I'm curious to see the different ways that people managed to conclude and implement their predictions into their own stories. Correct guesses with different results or different paths.

Harry is a Horcrux. That's probably the easiest one to have predicted though.

  The war against Riddle has finally ended, and Harry has lost all of those that are most important to him. Fate has a little surprise in store for Harry Potter though, and it plans on helping him along the way.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux][The Seventh Horcrux]] is really close to DH. Some Chinese publisher even sold it as the 7th book before DH came out.

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl
