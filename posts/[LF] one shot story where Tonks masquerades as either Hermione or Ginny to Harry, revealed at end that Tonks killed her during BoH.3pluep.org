I can't remember who the pairing is, but she is dating/married to Harry and we don't see she's actually Tonks until a bathroom scene


** Oh! I know this! It's from [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7231737/18][Chancing Chaos by Ell Roche]] ch 18.

Taken down from FFN but still surviving on other sites.

Some of the stories are okay-pretty good, this is one not.

  Oneshot. Her face it may be, but the light behind those eyes is you. You'll give him something she never would. You are a 'Puff after all. Friendship, loyalty means everything. Mind the rating, it's intended.

Could be a soulbond, I hear those things are just lying around everywhere, make people act crazy. /Stun the target, feed them Tonks flavored polyjuice, toss them at some Death Eaters, marry Harry./

**** I read your comment three times, and it's making less and less sense. Maybe I'm just this stupid.

Help.

***** I'll admit, my comment didn't give off an impression of sanity. I mentioned soulbonds because there are some fics where a character goes crazy thinking that Harry is they're soulmate and does anything to get with him. The rest of my comment was a guess at how Tonks would do it. I don't know if my explanation has helped any. Sorry for hurting your brain.
