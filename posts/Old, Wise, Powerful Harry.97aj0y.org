** Some of the time travel and MoD!Harry crossovers have this. linkffn(Basilisk-Born by Ebenbild) and some of the sci-fi crossovers (future based things like Mass Effect) come to mind.

*** Is there a pairing in that story (The basilisk one)? Also how much bashing? It'd be nice to see a strong Harry that didn't also bash Hermione. It is almost like authors have to bash her in order to make him seem stronger.

**** It's been a little while since I read it but I'll answer to the best of my ability.

Although there are pairings with Harry, I don't think any of them are serious; they're not the focus of the story. Saying more would spoil the premise I think. Treat it as mostly gen with occasional fluff in terms of relationships.

Dumbledore is bashed but I don't think he was particularly bad in this fic (manipulative, but trying to do the right thing, I think), and Hermione and Ron are both in character and good people. Harry gets pretty OP and has a lot of changes to his character that worry his friends, though.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

** First one that comes to mind where Harry starts out the way you describe is Wizard of Harrenhal linkffn(11255223)

Its a Game of Thrones crossover, though you don't really need to know much about it. It could spoil a bit of stuff though. Like what the main plot is about. Or S1 in the show.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.

  In one world, an old man's life ends. In another, a foolish wizard performs a ritual and calls upon the Master of Death. And in both, there is a sound-a sound like an oncoming train. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.
