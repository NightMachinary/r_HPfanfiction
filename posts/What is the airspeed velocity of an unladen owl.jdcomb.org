** Marginally slower than muggle post. Mrs Weasley's letter with all the stamps in GoF gets to the Dursleys just before Ron's letter by owl does.

*** Ah, but can we take Pig as representative of all owls? I would expect a tiny fluff ball takes longer than, say, an eagle owl.

*** So over a day for 240 km? Damn that's slow.

I wonder if there's a market for magic powered drones that can autonomously deliver letters significantly faster than owls and with lower upkeep costs. Take a small jet engine, enchant it to not need fuel, and the Devon-Surrey route can be done in 20 minutes.

**** Haha yeah from this one example it does seem really slow, doesn't it? I don't know how representative this is for the whole of the owl population. Hedwig took several days to deliver mail when Sirius was on the run iirc, but he could have been on the other side of the globe.

** Depends on the owl. The Great Horned Owl is about the fastest at 30-40mph. Smaller owls tend to be 10-20mph.
