No one in the family is actual metamorphmagus, and she can shapeshift at will, while the ability is also inherited by teddy lupin. So, is it a stretch to have Nymphadora to be someone who disguises herself as a child? A memory charm here and there and she can assume the identity of nymphadora tonks. Of course, fooling hogwarts letter may need sufficient confundus charm or something, like they did the goblet.

So, any fic like that? Looking for thriller/horror, but anything works.


** There is a young Sirius Black (time travel) x Harry fanfic, which has heavy undertones of Remus x Tonks. Great little fic.

Also written before Deathly Hallows, so it's an interesting interpretation of JK's books.
