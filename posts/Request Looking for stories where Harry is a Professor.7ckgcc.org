I love the idea of Harry as a Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor, it just suits him and the fact that he was really good at teaching with the Dumbledore's Army was just great. He really seemed to come into his own. I like the idea of him being an Auror, don't get me wrong but I just think that after a while he would be tired of fighting bad guys and would want a break.

And as a extra note it doesn't have to be him teaching Defence, it can be about him teaching in general about whatever subject. Since someone recommended me a story where Harry wasn't a Defence Professor but instead taught something else.

I would like any well written, believable (and hopefully completed, but if not a bunch of chapters is fine) of Harry being a Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor. Can be as Canon as possible or as AU as possible or anywhere in between.

Am fine with any rating, Het/Slash/Femslash

No character bashing, I'm tired of reading it. No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione but any other pairing is fine.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8125531][/Hogwarts, To Welcome You Home/]] Very nice. Short.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12184104/1/Lone-Traveler-Professor-of-Defense][/Lone Traveler: Professor of Defense/]] I'm pretty sure this is mostly self-contained, so you shouldn't need to read the other Lone Traveler works.

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I don't even have my O.W.L.s. Between everything I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

** Not explicitly what you requested, but linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero) is an alternate-dimension Harry who is forced into teaching and decides to go with Divination (mostly for the giggles) and it actually makes Divination into a fascinating subject. It also has some great scenes of him teaching, both in the classroom and out of it. Highly recommend it :)

Edit: Whoops, forgot to note as well that it does have Dumbledore bashing, which might exclude it for you, but I was able to get past it and like to think I'm fairly sensitive to bashing.

*** I'm not certain that Dumbledore's portrayal in 0800 can be caracterised as "bashing"; he is not a perfectly "good" character, but how could a general in a war where a society is at stakes be? He knows some of his acts are reprehensible, and can go just a bit too far (as in the scene with Fawkes), but Tonks explanation puts him in not sa bad a light.

****** I wasn't saying that it wasn't justified, I was just trying to explain the type of bashing present in the fic. I do think what the order did in the fic was not right and Harry had every right to be pissed off at them.

I am just not a fan of bashing when an author makes Dumbledore particularly manipulative, for the greater good figure that does unreasonable things and acts OOC just to justify bashing him and his actions as much as possible. This fic is good though since while there are bashing undertones present, they are fairly minor and make sense for the situation.

  When he looked back on it in later years, Severus realized how much worse his life could have gone. Those few short months in Sixth Year were of much greater importance than he could have ever known at the time. Then again, it was hard to have perspective on something like that at 16, when his daily existence consisted of constantly dodging hexes and being ignored by Lily Evans. The Professor had known, though. That's why he'd come.

Basically, Harry and Draco are both professors at Hogwarts, and still have a mild rivalry going. It's told from Draco's perspective, but you see a lot of both people's characters. I figured I'd include it even though there's (eventual) slash, and it's from a different point of view than Harry's.
