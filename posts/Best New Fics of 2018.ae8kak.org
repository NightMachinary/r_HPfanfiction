  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

** Linkffn(13108396) is the only non smut link HP link I've saved this year. Its appeal to me is firstly that it's completed, so no worries your fic will suddenly stop receiving updates just after a cliffhanger. It is short, clocking in at a lean 35k words and 5 chapters short, perfect for one afternoon and free of extraneous details.

Quality wise, it is a Dark!Harry and Hermione fic where the Canon divergence is the Year 6 Poisoned Mead scene. Here, Harry goes to extreme means because of this divergence but he still remains fundamentally good. Canon characterizations are kept intact. This fic is more than happy to rely on the original books where Canon stays the same, which was a strong factor in its short length. Overall a fic I would recommend for its brevity that is still a solid and riveting fic to read

** I'll reiterate my recommendation for linkao3(Rise Above by Straight_Outta_Hobbiton) and it's sequel linkao3(The Mercy Seat by Straight_Outta_Hobbiton) It is, hopefully, one of the new generation of fics. I've been in this game(as a reader) since the early 00's and while I love most of the tropes of fandom, and find them comforting, it is so refreshing to see a story that is so /real/ and.. full bodied.

And I really belive in the authors characterization of people desperately trying to survive a dystopia.

Also, I love Luna in this. Well, love might not be the right word, but it begins with a Luna we all know and love and lets us see what she might become when confronted with the incredible ongoing moral quandary and mortal peril that comes with marrying into Death Eater family. The pairing is Draco/Luna. And Voldemort attends their fucking wedding and she handles It like a fucking MVP.

#+begin_quote
  Everything is going very well, until it isn't. The ballroom of Malfoy Manor goes dark and cold when only moments ago there was summer sunshine, the tall, stained glass windows flying open with the force of a dark wind. Smoke billows into the ballroom, forming itself into a thin black funnel before dissipating, revealing...

  Luna goes very, very cold. A pale face, red eyes, thin, lipless mouth. She never thought about what the Dark Lord might look like, but now she doesn't have to, because he's standing in front of her.

  Wait.

  She keeps her expression flat, focusing on the man as he turns slowly to take in the ballroom. There's... an afterimage. Nothing visible to most wizards, but then, no one has the same natural talent with glamours that Lovegoods have. Granted, it's a good one--- she can't discern any actual features of the man that lies beneath--- but to know it's a glamour is something of a comfort, paltry as it is.

  His eyes find her and Draco.

  The noise he makes is one of satisfaction.

  “And here's the happy couple,” he says. His voice is soft and so utterly alien--- another glamour, Luna suspects. “The young Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy.”

  Draco bows low, an exaggerated greeting better suited to a house elf than an heir. Luna curtsies, careful not to wrinkle the folds of her wedding robes.

  “We were not expecting you, my Lord,” Lucius says, stepping forward with a bow almost as deep as Draco's. “We apologize, but we are ill-prepared---”

  She sees a spark of fury in the Dark Lord's red eyes. She moves almost thoughtlessly, laying a gentle hand on Lucius' elbow. Regardless of how cold the man may be with her, he's her father-in-law now, and Narcissa seems quite fond of him. Better to save him from becoming a gibbering mess in the middle of the floor. Not on her damn wedding day.

  “Thank you, my Lord,” she says, not sparing Lucius a glance. “For joining us on this joyful day. I was uncertain as to whether or not you would attend, but I made certain to leave a place for you at the family table. I was told you are close with the Lestranges.”

  Luna can feel the prickle of fear emanating from her husband, but she doesn't turn her head, doesn't look away for a moment when the Dark Lord turns his focus on her.

  “Not at the High Table?” he asks, tone deceptively smooth.

  She smiles.

  “No, my Lord,” she says. “I felt that--- should you have been unable to attend--- it would have thrown off the careful symmetry of the room. For all that a wedding is a bond between two people, the bride is always the centerpiece, and I felt it best that I be displayed properly. I am a stranger to many of our guests, you understand.”

  The Dark Lord's lip twitches up into an odd, humorless smirk.

  “A very practical young woman,” he remarks. “But there is a flaw in your reasoning.”

  “Is there, my Lord?”

  “Indeed.” He steps closer. Lucius instinctively backs away, but Luna stands firm. “I have, in fact, arrived.”

  “You have,” she agrees. “But as I said before, my Lord, I am the centerpiece. It is my day. And as bright as I may be---” she gestures at her sunshine yellow dress. “--- I felt, sir, that should you arrive, you would draw the eyes of every guest in attendance. Pardon my forwardness, but I'd like to remain the center of attention today.” She smiles at him, her face a perfect impression of a dreamy, somewhat silly girl.

  None of this is true, of course. She set a place for the Dark Lord as far from herself as possible without endangering herself by offending him. She wouldn't have even allowed Narcissa to send out an invitation if it weren't for the fact that Lucius was Inner Circle.

  (She wouldn't have any of these people here, actually, but at least they're not the Dark Lord himself.)

  His smile grows wider, and a moment later, he lets out an odd, hissing laugh. Yes, she thinks, his voice has definitely been altered.

  “You are a bold girl,” he says. “Tell me: are you afraid?”

  “I am,” she says, honestly. “But you are a reasonable man, I think, and a reasonable man has no reason to harm me now that I've explained myself properly.”

  He continues to stare. She stares back, resisting the urge to react to the prodding of his Legilimency when he meets her eyes. Instead, she allows her Occlumency shields to become smooth and slippery, like oiled glass.

  Finally, the Dark Lord nods.

  “An odd choice for a bride, Draco,” he says, turning to the Malfoy heir. “But an intriguing one.”

  Draco swallows, moving to stand beside her.

  “Thank you, my Lord,” he says, inclining his head.

  “Would you like me to show you where you are seated?” Luna asks, an earnest smile fixing itself to her face. “I am sure a moment of relaxation can only be beneficial. I imagine you must be very busy, most days.”

  The Dark Lord seems taken aback by the offer.

  “... My, my, you're quite proper, for a Lovegood,” he remarks. “Narcissa has taught you well.”

  Actually, it was her father, but Luna feels like correcting him is pushing it.

  “Thank you, my Lord,” she says, curtsying again. “Please, your table is right this way.”

  She doesn't expect it when he offers her an arm. Regardless of social customs, there's something incredibly jarring about the man wearing a snake-faced glamour who is slowly killing off nearly two-thirds of the population holding out his elbow for her to take--- which she does, against her better instincts.

  The walk to his table is an eerily silent one, all eyes following their progress across the ballroom. It isn't until he's seated, robes gathered properly around him, that the world seems to jerk itself out of its shock. The music starts up again, the quiet hum of chatter begins.

  “Yellow does not suit you,” the Dark Lord says before she can excuse herself back to her husband to hyperventilate. “Were you a Hufflepuff?”

  Luna shakes her head.

  “A Ravenclaw,” she says. “But my father believes yellow is good luck to wear at weddings. You might have noticed, but Draco is wearing a yellow under robe as well.”

  “A silly belief,” he says simply.   “Perhaps,” she agrees. “But every little bit helps. Draco signed on as a Snatcher nearly a year ago, now, as I imagine you're aware. The Mudbloods---” Oh, Merlin, the word makes her feel like she forgot to brush her teeth this morning. “--- have been known to get rowdy, I've heard. As skilled as I know Draco to be, it makes me nervous to think of it.”.

  The Dark Lord smiles.

  “He is taking the time to prove his talent,” he says approvingly. “I am sure you have little to worry about.”

*** Here is my old recommendation:

#+begin_quote
  What about one where he runs of to America, refusing to become a child soldier? linkao3(Rise Above by Straight_Outta_Hobbiton) and he and his friends find a better life, but in doing that they leave the British Wizarding world behind to burn. The story takes a lot of minor characters and flesh them out and introduces a lot of OCs and it /works/ the author is so skilled. Stylistically(if that is even the right word) once the trio leave British shores the story steps away from most fandom conventions and tropes and does not hold back any punches. I love it, so refreshing.

  The second part really focuses on Britain turning on muggleborns and gets dark and gritty and /realistic/. A totalitarian regime rises and genocide begins and characters behave and feel like real flawed people slowly whittling their souls away in an attempt to survive. Collaborating. Death of the boiling frog. Killing children.

  Maybe I'm over hyping it but I love seeing this new generation of fandom writers that goes at the possibilities from a new angle.

The Potters, the Weasleys, and the Black-Lupins are well.If only we could all be so lucky.Percy is a Weasley in a farce called the Ministry. Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnegan are on the run. A Muggle detective named Rosier Bishop has a new partner who sees things and a series of murders that they just can't explain. Draco and his new wife Luna are stepping through a minefield of friendly Death Eaters who visit for tea after murdering children. Neville's working with crazy people to try and integrate the Magical world with the Muggle, and oh, yeah, Dumbledore's dead along with most of the rest of the Order.

  If Harry Potter could alter the past, he isn't sure what he'd change, but he knows he'd change something. If Severus Snape could hold history in his hands, he knows exactly what shape he would mold it into. Albus Dumbledore might flatter himself enough to think he would walk away from such power. But Delphi Riddle isn't here to serve any of them. (Rating for some really prolific cursing and very little else.)

Basically 5 versions of Harry in alternate dimensions with different backstories can communicate telepathically, and since they are all dealing with the same similar to canon HP plot events, they help each other out as they discover new information. It sounds like it would be a huge mess, but the author does an amazing job making all 5 characters distinct and easy to follow, and it just works really well.

*** Just reread it, think the last time I did so it only had a few chapters, and it's top notch. It's part post-war fix fic, part coming of age story, and part slowburn-romance. If you enjoy politics/Wizengamot-heavy fics, you'll love Novocaine; if you don't, it's worth slogging through those parts.

And as much as it seems fluffy and light-hearted at times, it's not afraid to take off the gloves and throw some deep stuff at the reader. I LOVE this quote from Harry's thought process during one of the chapters:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore had been too afraid of power after everything, and Voldemort had sought nothing but power. A pureblood whose father had murdered Muggles, a half-blood whose father had been a Muggle. A wizard who had accidentally murdered his sister, a wizard who had killed over and over, including his own family. Two people deathly afraid of the other, both of them betting their survival on a boy. The two most powerful wizards in their history, and the two men who had shaped Harry into the person that he was.
#+end_quote

It can be a little over-dramatic at times and I think some characters (Ginny and Ron, mainly) get the short end of the stick, but overall this is really a great fic.

****** I'll list off some of the things that I liked about the fic, even though I'm not OP:

- It's a better take on redeeming Malfoy than the Draco-In-Leather-Pants trope. He still feels out of character compared to canon Malfoy, but I can believe that it's his personality and we've just never seen it from his perspective before.
- I'm a fan of the canon relationships, but if you're going to break them up, how the author handles Harry/Ginny in this is the way to do so. It's how actual adult relationships can end in the real world. I think Ron's shortchanged as a character here, but that's true for a lot of fics, so I don't hold it against this one specifically.
- I like being a party to Harry's decisions about who he'll be post-Voldemort. His entire life in canon revolves around Voldemort; it's a good question what he'll do and who he'll become once Voldemort is gone and I haven't read a lot of post-canon fics that I think do this well.
- It has the right amount of Old Magic info-dump, at least so far. Unless it's linkffn (Prince of the Dark Kingdom), a fic should not spend chapters detailing the intricacies of the Old Ways and how amazing and misunderstood they are.
- The story also serves as a cautionary tale about how easy it would be to take over the Wizarding World post-War if Harry was less inclined to make the world a better place. It makes me wish linkffn(Made of Common Clay) was less cracky.

** One that I've really been enjoying is linkffn(13098062). It's a killer AU based around a really talented witch and her fight against a stupidly scary witch that's lived in captivity for thousands of years. All the main characters are OC's but they actually feel like real characters with their own flaws etc. One of the best bits about the fic are the different types of magic the author introduces throughout and how everything is given a somewhat realistic consequence for its use, especially the more dangerous/powerful types of magic. Definitely recommend giving it a go if you're looking for something new to read.

  Nearly thirty years on from Voldemort's war, the world is no less unforgiving. Pyrrha Clay has lost all that mattered, yet one distant hope keeps her clinging to the earth, and she will set herself against evils within and without to realize her life's purpose. The Nightmare Queen will oppose her at every turn, haunt every corner of thought, until one of them breathes their last.

** The best one imo should be linkffn(12980210)

No pointless drama, no pointless romance, no bashing, great expansion to HP's magic and potions.

*** What's bothering me a lot is that in the Russian version the disclaimer is plagiarised from HPMoR without giving credit, which makes me wonder just how original the whole thing is.

Also, I am fazed and confused and in stitches about the number of translations this remark involves: this is a fic in English translated from a fic in Russian which contains an unattributed quote from a fic in Russian translated from English so yeah....

***** Well, I wonder what else was plagiarised by the author. I don't want to read works that are partially stolen Also, if the author felt the need to steel the disclaimer, his skills as a writer come into question.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power. Translated from Russian.)

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14527497/chapters/33565593]])\\
This one was my favorite that seems like its actually going to be completed/not abandoned. Very AU. Harry/Voldemort. Don't read if you're not okay with the pairing.

  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.
