:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Tbh, all I really remember is that it was on FFN and one of his spells was 'FUS, RO DAH!' which I found out in my search for this fic is a reference to... something? I know it isn't much to go off of, but I'd really appreciate any help.


** I'm pretty sure FUS RO DAH is a reference to 'The Elder Scrolls' and I think the fic might be '*So How Can I Weaponize This?'* by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5290344/longherin][longherin]]. If I remember correctly it is completed.
