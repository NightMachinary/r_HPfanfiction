*** I feel you. I'm not a fan but it's not a hard limit for me. One of my no-gos is watersports and anything related

Tags are the main reason why I mainly read on Ao3. I'd rather have some of the surprises spoiled than sudden golden showers ruin the whole fanfiction for me.

**** I can see how surprise watersports might ruin a fic for you :)

Im not a fan of slash (on the account of beeing a straight male, i identify with the mc, so him beeing gay is jarring me out of the mindspace im in when reading) so reading on ao3 is difficult. 80% is slash. 75% of slash fics is not tagged as such, and removing draco and snape from characters will still give you Harry/draco/othermale for some reason.. FFn any day of the week!

***** Funny how different our experiences are. I don't mind slash but I'm not a huge fan of fem!slash so I just exclude fem!slash and never had a problem this way. Same goes for the other way round. If I wanna read a fic with a male/female couple I only include het relationships within the filter options.

****** Might be user related on my end then :p whenever i try ao3 i always end up with 75% slash, and as most fics are on both ffn and ao3, i see no reason to keep trying ao3. Plus the ffn app just makes it so much easier :)

******* That's true. I really miss the ffn bookmark option especially within long chapters.

******** I just really like that the app updates the fics themselves whenever a new chapter comes out, so i dont have to keep track of it myself, or have a million taps open :)

********* I'm not patient enough to read ongoing fics. The very few I'm currently trapped in, happened to be parts of a series that I didn't check beforehand if the series is finished and one was the only decent long fic within my filter settimgs and curiosity got the better of me.
