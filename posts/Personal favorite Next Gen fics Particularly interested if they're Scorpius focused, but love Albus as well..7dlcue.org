After reading the fan novelization of Cursed Child I'm really interested in what people consider their favorite Next Gen fics! Slash and het are both welcomed, and gen is more than encouraged. I also am totally here for pre-CC materially that took the little we knew about the character at the Epilogue and ran with it --- same with EWE fics! A healthy length is prefered, but if your personal favorite is like, twenty whole words I'd still love to see it. Thank you!


** The series starting with linkffn(put your guns away, it's tea time by frombluetored) picks up right after Cursed Child and is an absolutely adorable Scorpius/Albus fic featuring the entire Potter family (and Draco). It's really well written and delightfully sweet! It gets actiony in the second story as well.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

  Far away and long ago,

  Passed on those mighty four,

  But spirits shake and magic wakes,

  The lion will walk once more.  So sings the Sorting Hat before the first years of 2017 are sent to their houses for the first time. Against their expectations, Rose Weasley and Scorpius Malfoy both find themselves in Ravenclaw, where the Sorting Hat's strange parting words are seen as just another riddle to solve. Their first year at Hogwarts begins in the normal way, with new friendships, old rivalries, and loads of Transfiguration homework, but soon they realise that someone at the school is practising Dark Magic --- and whoever it is, they're planning something big. When Scorpius's best friend is attacked, he and Rose must put aside their differences and find her assailant, before the Sorting Hat's prediction comes to pass.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

  Scorpius isn't on the Hogwarts Express at the start of seventh year, and Albus discovers that he's become very ill over the summer. Determined to find out what's wrong with him and how to make him better, Albus starts doing some research, and discovers Moramortia, a fatal illness with just one cure. Together, Albus and Scorpius (with some help from Rose) set out on an adventure to find the ingredients to make the potion that will hopefully save Scorpius's life...

** For me there's only one answer: Hogwarts Houses Divided. Granted, it's about Teddy Lupin's Hogwarts days rather than Harry's kids, so the Cursed Child stars are too young to be at Hogwarts yet, but I still count it as next-gen.

Scorpius doesn't actually appear, but his older half-sister Violet (an OC, natch) is one of the main characters, and she does mention him in one surprisingly sweet scene where she says he's learning to talk and has started to call her "Vi-vi."

** Vekin87's Albus series is probably my favorite. His characterizations/plots are great. All of the kids feel like they could be the OC's kids while still maintaining their own personas. There are grammatical issues, but the stories rise above it. linkffn(4380964)
