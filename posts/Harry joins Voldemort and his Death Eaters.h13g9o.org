Would preferably like Harry joining them in the graveyard of book 4. With the horrible treatment of the only muggles he really knows (his relatives) and his two best friends and the whole student body going back and forth on liking him/ hating (maybe too strong of a word but you get the gist) him he finds acceptance in the 'dark' side. Would prefer not to have any unrealistic bashing, but beggars can't be choosers

Thanks!

** This is a Harry brought in from another dimension story, where he decides Voldemort's side is the better option. linkffn(Snake Pit by VicVivi).

When Harry is dragged into the new dimension, he of course doesn't know what's going on and assumes he's being attacked, so he starts fighting. The Order of the Phonix naturally fights back at somebody firing spells at them. A few Order members are killed and Harry ends up in the infirmary when they finally take him down. While he's in there somebody poisons him. He manages to escape. Between the summoning, fighting, poisoning and being held prisoner, Harry has no love for this Order.

  "He was summoned as someone who 'wants to be here' and 'is capable of defeating' you, my Lord." -- "That does not mean he has to." -- Desperate, the Order has reached across dimensions for help against Lord Voldemort. However, with Harry Potter involved things don't go as planned.
