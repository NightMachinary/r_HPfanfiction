As in the AU with the most changes from canon.


** Probably one of those Muggle AUs. Doesn't get much more alternate than taking out the most defining factor in HP.

***** Agreed. It's like all-human AUs for Twilight. I've read maybe /two/ that were worth reading, and about the same for non-magic HP AUs. Just... 90% of the point of the universe is taken away.

***** Exactly, there already in "the real world" and there already in high school (sort of).

This isn't some manga like Naruto that takes place in a fantasy world.

  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

** SCHOOLED! found on AO3 [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/384445]]

I'd like to say that while this is not a rec, I really enjoyed summarizing various chapters for the benefit of my friends. I don't understand how this can be considered fanfiction.

Technically, no.

Crossover merges two universes, while Alternate Universe does what the name says, it alters one universe.

** This was the very 1st AU fics that I ever came across when I first started reading fanfiction back in 2009. And to this day, it still remains one of the greatest fanfics that I've ever read. It is currently being redone, and posted up on the HPFF site now. But I started out reading/reviewing this story years ago when it was posted up elsewhere, and then over time I actually became pretty close friends with the author. He is such an amazing and passionate writer, and this story definitely deserves WAY more love & attention than what it is getting on HPFF right now... So please read and show this wonderful author some much-needed love!! <3

  While Luna simply smiled and nodded, Harry couldn't seem to wipe the expression of shock and disbelief from his face. Finally, he spoke. "And...if this plan goes wrong, and we all end up dead?" Michael rubbed the back of his neck. "Well, there's worse things you can be in life than a cautionary tale."
