I was reading linkffn(Time Turned Back by TaraSoleil) and I *loved* her writing style!

Since I'm writing my own fanfiction, I'd like to read works with this style to get inspired and learn how to write better. Some suggestions? Or If you don't know this fic at least something that you think is *really* well written.

#+begin_quote
  Broken & angry after losing Sirius fifth year, Harry recklessly puts himself in harms way, dragging Hermione along for the ride. Now they are stuck in another time with very familiar faces. Will the time spent with lost loved ones help heal Harry or only damage him further? HP/SB with a touch of HG/RL to relieve the overbearing angst.
