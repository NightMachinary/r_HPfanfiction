Basically, I'm just looking for a Harry central stories in which he takes the train in book seven and finds himself in another universe: marvel, dc, whatever. Harry doesn't need to be magical, using spells and stuff. It's just his character, somewhat enhanced so he isn't the scrawny kid he once was bit that isn't necessary.

Recently, I have been looking for ones where he is in the marvel universe. Taken as a child due to being an Enhanced by either the Soviets or Hydra and making him into an assassin, like the other winter soldiers in Civil War.

Don't need to be pairing but I would prefer no slash. If there are, possibly no characters from the hpworld. Possible paring include: Black widow Scarlet witch Spider woman Maria hill T'challa sister- can't for the life of me remember her name. Wonder women Supergirl Alice Cullen - don't bother asking Rosalie Hale - don't bother asking Katniss everdeen - with this have harry as a mentor to her or a competitor in the quarter qwells.

Those are the preferred paring but anything other than a male, suggest some with a female character that was originally male in canon if you want.

Edit: maybe some Elsa or Anna with him? Or other Disney Princess.


** You know what, I think I actually know one story where HYDRA attempted to kidnap toddler Harry. However, this is where they sent Bucky AKA the Winter Solider to get him. Instead he defected into helping Harry. It is absolutely an interesting and intense read.

  When HYDRA sends The Winter Soldier to bring them the four-year-old Boy Who Lived, the outcome is not what they expected.

** The question is, why even bother with Harry if you're just going to remove everything that makes him Harry? Can't you just read some self-insert fanfic from that other fandom?

*** Well, canon Harry is a rather disappointing character... I understand his point. Honestly, it is always better when they use an AU Harry for this things.

I also get your point, both with HP and Naruto many times people just give a random dude in another world that has nothing to do with them their names, but only look similar without any memories or abilities. Utter crap.

**** The question still stands, though. Why use Harry at ALL, if they're just going to turn him into a completely different character, and not even include the wizarding world for him to interact with?

***** Because if you use him as a base for a character you get access to stuff like the hallows, the basilisk, the sword and countless other things that could be inserted into that character with little fuss like metamorphic magic and gold. With a few small changes you can get the perfect character for your story, it is easier for both the author and the reader, and a better Harry is always popular.

It doesn't have to be completely different, you just have to alter a few events and some of his Ronald-tendencies, once you get rid of that moody Harry full of laziness you have the Harry from before Hogwarts so it isn't that much AU.

****** So basically take away everything that made him even remotely interesting as a character and turn him into a bland and overpowered Harry Stu? Yeah, I'll pass. Harry is already the blandest character in the story, he doesn't need to become more perfect and powerful.

******* Then clearly the kind of story OP is talking about isn't for you.

I like reading stories featuring characters who I already know (even if most everything about them is different) simply because it helps jumpstart my imagination. Once that happens I'm free to view him as an AU version of Harry or an OC with the same name and appearance.

******* But Harry is neither perfect nor powerful, he doesn't have any merit to speak of aside from learning the patronus after months of personal tutoring and holding a sword upright while being attacked by a big snake... Truly his victories are always by luck and plot armor, his personality is that of a moody teenager with anger issues and suicidal tendencies. You don't need to make him powerful or perfect, just salvageable.

******** Exactly. Harry ISN'T perfect or powerful, and in my opinion that's one of the best things about him as a character.

I mean, Harry is pretty bland and dull. He doesn't have half the personality that Ron or Hermione do. And yeah, this is mostly done on purpose; Harry is bland so that it'll be easier for the readers to put themselves in his place, and so that he'll provide a contrast to the more interesting side-characters. But it doesn't make him all that engaging for someone like me, who never gravitated to "main character" type chars.

What makes Harry even marginally interesting is the duality between the "chosen one" that the wizarding world sees him as, and the just-slightly-above-average wizard that he in reality is, that's what saves the character for me. He gets by not because he's /sooo awesome,/ but through a mix of luck and a knack for improvising when things get bad. and I'll take that over DBZ-style "he trained really hard and now he's super-powerful and can blow up the moon" type of characterisation any day.

Replacing him with "generic kickass vaguely Americanized action hero #7403" does not seem like an improvement to me.

***** Some authors, when thinking of Harry think of how Daniel R. looked when portraying him and they want their character to look like that, to be better than canonHarry but still look like him. Weird. Right? Others simply find the idea of a prophecied martierd hero that can use magic nice and tske the concept of Harry and remodel it to fit their needs.

** I don't think I have read a story where Harry had been taken by HYDRA, but I read a story where Luna was kidnapped to the Red Room. It's one of the most unique read I ever came across. Would you like to read that?

** I think I remember one where he was taken by the hydra. He was given a brutal training on everything from guns to martial arts. When he entered puberty he was repeatedly forced to have sex with both a woman and a man. Towards the second month, he was starting to crush on the male seducing teacher. I dropped it pretty much there. I don't have a problem with slash but harry crushing on the male teacher pretty much killed my interest. Also, harry in the book was pretty much OC while still carrying the same name.
