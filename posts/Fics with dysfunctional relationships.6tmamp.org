Please give me recommendations for the most fucked up, dysfunctional, unhealthy relationships you've read. It doesn't have to be romantic; I'd love to read dysfunctional friendships and family relationships as well.

Slash is fine (no mpreg please) and I'm willing to read incest if it's really good.

Thanks.


** I take it you've read the well known linkffn(8262940). One of best written fics in the fandom and features an unhealthy relationship. While it is one of the best written I wouldn't call it the most enjoyable however.

  Secrets of the war, a murder and a fatal attraction: After his victory over Voldemort, Harry became an Auror, and realised quickly that it wasn't at all like he had imagined. Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** "The Unfixables" linkffn(11262352) Barty Crouch Jr. and Luna's relationship starts from a very effed-up situation. "What We Have Instead of God" linkffn(11993963) is a cousin-cest fic between Albus and Rose. They acknowledge how weird it is they like each other. "The Things We Do For Love" linkffn(12070491) is full of screwed-up relationships. Though, this is a multi-chap mystery, to say much on them could give away who the murderer in the fic is...

  They were happy. They were whole. They should have known it was too good to be true. It began with a murder of one, and it culminated in the rise of one of the most notorious serial killers to walk the streets of England since Jack the Ripper was at large. To think, though, that it all began with a bitter heart, a bottle of bourbon, and a very, very sharp knife. [Murder Mystery]
