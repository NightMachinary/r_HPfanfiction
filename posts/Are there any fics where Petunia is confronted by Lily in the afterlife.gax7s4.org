Any fics where Lily is waiting to confront Petunia when she dies, to ask her how she could treat a child like that, let alone her nephew? If the situations were reversed, you know Dudley would have grew up to be a far better man than he was being raised by his own parents. To lock a child in a cupboard for 10 years and treat him like a slave because of a resentment for someone he had never even properly known? Barbaric, and I'd like to read a fic where Lily just lays in to her.

****** Ooh, another take could use Norse mythology: those who do not have an honourable death and die in battle go to Hel (one L, also called Helheim, located in the realm of frozen mists). If James fought back before he died, he probably didn't go there. I find James's last minutes very honourable and I'm sure the Norns or whoever decides whether the death was honourable or not would agree.

Some say not only does the person have to die in battle but they also have to die with a weapon in hand (Rick Riordan is adamant about that detail in his Magnus Chase series). A potential author could use that detail and say Lily was too busy blocking Harry with her body to think about lifting a wand, Petunia died in a car crash and therefore they both ended up in the same place. I've seen some authors say James left his wand on a side table in his rush to confront Voldemort so maybe the author has him spend eternity with Lily too giving Petunia Hell.

Oddly enough, this is actually canon. From DH, when Harry is seeing Voldemort's memory of that night:

#+begin_quote
  He was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall. It was easy, too easy, he had not even picked up his wand ...

  "Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off!"

  Hold him off, without a wand in his hand! ... He laughed before casting the curse ...

She deliberately avoids mentioning religion throughout the series, despite the whole sacrificial protection theme.

********* The graves have Christian quotes here because it's just "something people do". Likewise, people go to Church just long enough to be Christened to get married in the scenery of a church, then are barely seen again. Similarly, parents get their children Christened just so their children could get married in a church without that rigmarole.

Generally speaking, we do know what people's religion's are. Most people here are not very religious. We're now up above 50% of people having 'no religion' and a vast majority of Christians being non-practising. In addition, many parents (from a research perspective, not anecdotal) report only attending Church to get their children in particular schools. Some people put Christian on the census because it's 'how they were raised' or because they feel it's the proper thing to put down.

The books, of course, were not set 'now'. So, the 1980s - when the Potters died.

1980 - 11.1% of the population attend Church on a given Sunday. (Data from Christian Research)

1983 - 31% of people describe themselves as having 'no religion' and 65% described themselves as Christian. (British Social Attitudes Survey)

Also, the rates for Church attendance and religiousness has been falling so it's not that there was an increase, it's that literally there were plenty of people who called themselves Christian despite not practising or otherwise engaging with it outside of weddings, funerals and christenings. There are some who pop in for Christmas and Easter, of course.

So, in short - it shouldn't be obvious most characters are Christian, because 9/10 of them wouldn't have been doing anything particularly Christian beyond opening presents for Christmas.

****** It never sounded like that to me.

In the story the brothers 's gf's spirit was sad because he was holding her in the living world. I don't think she ever told him to join her, it just was to much for him to see her but never be able to truly be with her (to me it sounded like it was torture for both of them).

I also think JKR treated the spirits Harry saw in the woods as a true comforting presence, which makes me suspect they were supposed to be the spirits of the actual people.

It seems what makes the ring dangerous (pre Horcrux) is not the magic itself, but people being unable to let go of the past and those they lost.
