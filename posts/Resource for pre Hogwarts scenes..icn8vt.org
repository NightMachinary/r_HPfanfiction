There are often scenes in HP fanfictions involving young kids which are often criticized for the children sound like adults.

As I want to write my own fic someday I decided to do a little research.

I found a [[https://tomdrummond.com/looking-closely-at-children/children-conversations/][website]] with transcripts of conversations between young children.

Maybe it's useful for somebody else too.


** Be very careful with things like transcripts when it comes to writing dialogue. This is a really useful resource for getting a sense of a child's usual vocabulary and issues which concern them, but when writing dialogue we don't always want it to be perfectly realistic - just as we want to cut the filler words and fragmented sentences people use in every day speech, we also want to make sure that child characters actually make sense. Of course we know that children often don't, but that doesn't make for good reading.

*** I think both this resource, and your caveat, are good points. As someone who's typed up a load of transcripts, I found myself for a while erring on the side of realistic. And it wasn't a strength. Live dialogue stutters and shifts in a way that requires a lot of attention to its form, rather than its content, and it becomes disruptive in fiction. Kids don't make sense so as fiction writers we will seek to make them make sense. But transcriptions will give a great feel for how long their sentences are, and how their attention often behaves in conversation.

Of course, reading some transcripts is still very helpful, at least for thinking carefully about how people interact and talk. Figuring out different voices, too, is greatly assisted by transcripts. I never realised generational differences so distinctly until transcribing. Dumbledore genuinely speaks like an older man very secure in his power. Snape is kind of insecure even though he's dripping with contempt. After coming back to JKR I was so impressed how she nailed all those different voices.

For anyone else interested in transcripts, I advise you to nosed around google scholar. Any transcript topic is fine. Look at how women speak versus men. Transcripts of lawyers and judges show how patterns of power play out heavily just in things like pronoun usage and sentence structure. Doctors and patients are also fascinating. Small things can be big tells. But yeah, like Floreat says, you're not seeking to be true to life, but to draw out themes of life and craft them into a good story.

*** You are completely right, this is only useful in the aspect of vocabulary and sentence structure.

But it shows us a glimpse in the world view of children, how a different land is the mountains, or over the sea. They understand the concept but can't completely apply them.

Additionally I think having children not make sense is a great way to show their age. For longer sections it would probably get old fast. I guess there's a reason you mostly don't read books about young children.

**** I think there's a time and a place and it shows their purpose in the story. If you're trying to show a character not quite fitting in with the Weasley family and realising that perhaps they don't want to marry into that brood, you could have a small next gen child come up to them and babble absolute nonsense at them while your character is actively thinking "is this going anywhere? This is unbearable."

But then if you're trying to show a small child unwittingly displaying something profound or something that triggers grief in the adult characters around them, you might want to age them ever so slightly so the reader isn't too exasperated trying to make sense of them, but still trying to keep hold of that childish vocab and understanding of the world around them. So, I had a short fic where I wanted to show George talking to his son about grief and mourning, so I did it through his son being very upset about the death of his hamster and asking questions common in children experiencing loss for the first time - can you make him better, when is he going to stop being dead, etc. But yes, it's very challenging to write young children for a long period of time, especially from.their perspective. I think an important thing to do is to resist, at all costs, writing out baby speak phoentically. We don't need to see baby Harry saying "Unca padfoo'" or shit like that, it's just annoying and we can imagine how a young child talks.
