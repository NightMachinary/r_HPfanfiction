As in, I was literally in the shower when I thought of this (no idea why).

So Line Theft is one of the sillier tropes in the fanon wherein trying to marry and/or seduce the Heir of a Noble House by underhanded means is an extremely serious crime, usually involving Ginny trying to undermine a Harmony pairing. Even though patriarchal societies have dealt with bastard children pretty much forever. Bonus points if polygamy is allowed in the story anyway.

However, there is a law very much like this in real life, except in the opposite direction. /Even today/, under British law, having an affair with (or assaulting) the monarch's wife, daughter, or daughter-in-law such as would call the legitimacy of heirs to the throne into question is considered [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_treason_in_the_United_Kingdom#Offences][high treason]]. If this were applied to the Noble Houses, then Line Theft would not be a girl trying to seduce or love-potion Harry. It would be a boy trying to seduce or love-potion Harry's /wife/.

To be fair, I think there are a few fics that do this with evil!Ron, but far fewer than the opposite version. I don't think I've seen any that use a boy other than Ron.


** The weirdness of it in fanfic mostly comes from how everyone knows what it is, and treats it as an extremely serious crime, /up to and including Ginny and Molly, who was complicit in supplying the love potions, being dragged off to Azkaban for it/, when no word of it was ever spoken or implied in canon. It's just one of those things invented to give worldbuilding "depth" to bashing and/or political Indy!Harry fics, like the Light-Grey-Dark faction separation. Or Blood Adoption, which fanon shows in Charlus and Dorea Potter inviting Sirius to live with them when he ran away from home, therefore giving Harry the Potter-Black lordship by right.

"Wards" and "Notice-Me-Not" charms in fanon get a pass because there are elements in canon that function the same way, and the fanon is limited to being just a shorthand catch-all name, instead of being made up wholesale.

If any boy was guilty of perpetrating Line Theft, it would be Severus Snape for masterminding his big ol' plan to turn Lady Potter into a Dowager Regent and seducing her, while getting rid of the legitimate husband and heirs. You saw it here first, guys!!! THIS IS WHY SNAPE IS 100% UNFORGIVABLE.

*** I normally hate fics with this trope, as I love Ginny more than I love myself, but that Snape callout was gold.

You ever given [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353683/1/The-Girl-Who-Loved][The Girl Who Loved]] a shot? I've never quite been able to tell if the author meant it as a serious fic but it follows your thought process (sort of).

** I thought I was on [[/r/crusaderkings][r/crusaderkings]] for a second.

(Figured it out when a post on line theft didn't end in sibling or horse marriage :( )

*** Well, there's no reason why Harry couldn't travel to the past and Seduce his mother. Conversions to Zoroastrianism are optional.

**** Does that make Dumbledore leaving Harry on a cold doorstep a failed assassination plot? He should know better than to plot while he has the 'Hero +100' modifier.

I mean it is possible to try to gain immortality via insanity and cannibalism, so you have ol volde covered....

** There are two pieces worth calling out here:

1. The casual inclusion of rape potions (or indeed, general magical bespelling or mental alteration) without any comment on its social acceptability. At best Canon treats love potions, confoundus, and obliterates with careless indifference. It is entirely natural that fanon hones in on these issues.
2. Despite canons hard focus on 'a whimsical world mostly like ours but slightly different', there seems to be a huge desire in fanon to go with "an entirely different world with different cultural norms". I'm not sure why it is, it's like they want it to be more like a fantasy world or a trashy vampire novel where you can handwave socially unacceptable behavior with "this world has different rules".

Maybe it is as simple as wanting to write socially unacceptable behaviors (eg harem) and thus it became a fanon trope? But for some reason, a lot of fics index on the slightest hint of differing norms (Noble house black, wizards not knowing what goes on in the muggle world) instead of all the evidence suggesting it is a very close analog to the muggle world (parlament, not noblese gov system. Radio, train, bus, candy (even foil wrapped), cops, etc)

*** For me I see it as the magical world has been separated from the muggle one for longer than America has been a country so it seems logical to assume that the countries would be different. While muggleborns are introduced into the society my headcannon that it would be considered on them to integrate rather than trying to force the magical world to be just like the muggle one. Magic being a thing would mean that the magical world probably didn't have an industrial revolution means that that's another huge difference in culture. Basically what I'm saying is that it's been over 300 years for the Magical word to have evolved differently than the muggle one. So while they have similarities it makes sense for there to be differences just like there are differences between countries.
