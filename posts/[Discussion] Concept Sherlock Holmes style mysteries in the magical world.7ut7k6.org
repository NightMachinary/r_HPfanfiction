So this is something I really want there to be more of. So we know the magical world is pretty ignorant in regards to muggles and the technology they develop. Meaning they are also most likely unfamiliar in crime cover-up and forensic methods. The concept I thus bring, is a halfblood or muggleborn, obsessed with the Sherlock Holmes stories from a young age, who decides to make himself the official consulting detective to the aurors. I think magic and its combination with muggle methods gives room for so much creativity in terms of crime stories. Does anything like this exist? I think it could really work as an anthology, with people writing separate mysteries for the same universe. Basically I just really want to read this because I imagine it would be so much fun


** I've read story where Harry was like Sherlock. He even did consulting for Aurors and solved several cases. It was a long time ago though. The story was deleted a few years ago. Neville played Doctor Watson.

** This is probably not what you're looking for because this story is essentially a crossover with Sherlock, but I think you'll be interested anyways.

I made a recommendation post awhile ago for my favorite Sherlock and HP crossover that has both excellent writing and execution. I'll just quote myself here:

  Definitely read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12447494/1/Sherlock-Holmes-and-the-Adventure-of-the-Seventh-Safeguard][Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Seventh Safeguard]] by Charlotte Ann Kent if you're into well written mystery type of stories with a magical twist.

  Basically, BBC Sherlock Holmes and John Watson (both are completely muggle) helped the trio find the horcruxes from the Deathly Hallows in a Conan Doyle detective style story. I don't want to spoil much, but there are other muggle â€˜aquatints' that help as well. (Plus, the author somehow incorporated helicopters... as amusing as it sounds.)

  Don't let the first person POV style derail you from reading the story. This is one of the rare stories that was actually written like an art form. When I say it's like a Conan Doyle book, I really meant it. The suspense and mystery is all there from John's relatable, yet insightful, perspective.

As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

*** Ohh this was an amazing read. It wasn't Sherlock per se but the mystery and detective element is there. Lovely characterizations as well. The author already started on the sequel.

** This basically exists, though maybe not as muggle focused as you'd like. Daphne is Watson (and probably an eventual love interest). Hasn't updated in a while though. linkffn(12373224)

  Daphne Greengrass wouldn't realise that a chance encounter at the age of eleven could have led her to have a life of adventure. Fourteen years later she meets Harry Potter again, this time over a dead body, but will she walk away or stay? He's a consulting detective and she's a healer, worlds apart from some, but for others, it could be just the beginning. AU.
