** Herbology and potions. If you need some plants, buy one. Potions might be a little bit more useful (whip up a quick boil cure) but you can still buy them. At the very least, you are probably still buying the ingredients instead of farming them. And if you mess up the potion, you might be poisoning yourself. If you mess up a charm, you might have just destroyed an object but not yourself.

**** Not everyone has money though, and being self-sufficient is a good practical skill.

Also in our first-world society, everything we need is mass produced and cheap, while in magical Britain it seems like mass production is not so common. So buying every potion you would ever need rather than just making them yourself would probably be a massive waste of money compared to taking care of a garden and brewing things.

Most of the simple, useful things they were taught in Potions class were able to be made over the course of a one or two hour period; other potions take a long time to simmer or steep rather than requiring constant attention. I would equate simple potion-making to cooking an elaborate meal- you might have to slave over the stove for a good few hours, but then you have a cauldron's supply of product you can slap a stasis charm on and add to your potion cupboard for when you need it.

More complicated potions are also more expensive, so it still makes more sense to brew it rather than buy it.

****** Well, identifying them is probably irrelevant. Even in Herbology at school, they were only raising the plants from what I assume are seedlings. I doubt that you can really walk into the woods and find the magical plants you want given how the statute is still intact. They seem incredibly rare in the wild.

Then, the plants had to be handled with care so they didn't kill you, and yet had to be kept alive. Harvesting them was usually another ordeal entirely. It also took weeks to months to raise them, weeks of care and dedication.

Why spend the weeks cultivating plants for ingredients when you can just go to the store and buy some? I learned to garden at school, but I buy groceries instead of farming.

***** Percy pulls it off just fine with a jinx which transfigured Thicknesse. Cedric manages to create dogs who can easily be used to attack or distract. Hermione pulls off an attack with birds and Draco conjures a snake in his second year. Incarcerous conjures ropes and is as good as any direct attack.

While I don't think that transfiguration will form the base of most people's attacks, it's clear that it can be useful. You can conjure birds to attack your opponent before you get into range/sightline of him. You can directly transfigure your opponent. You can transfigure your opponent, etc etc. It's certainly not limited to the highest levels, especially when some transfigurations and conjurations (like snakes and birds) are much easier.

That doesn't even get into the convenience of other transfigurations. Need a comfy chair? Transfigure one. Need a cup? Transfigure one. Desk broke? Transfigure a new one or fix it with a transfiguration.

******* Let's say I'm in a room with a closed door. In the next room is a death eater.

Option 1:

I open the door and enter a duel with him. I block, redirect, and use protego to defend myself and respond with stunning spells. He and I are essentially on equal footing from the start. I win if I'm more skilled; he wins if he's more skilled.

Option 2:

I transfigure dogs and birds first. I open the door and enter a door. My animals take spells for me. They attack him. He deals with the animals easily, as any competent wizard would. But he has less opportunity to strike at me and I have far more opportunities to attack him. I can probably win, even if he's more skilled simply because I have the advantage from the start.

Option 3:

I transfigure dogs and birds. I open the door and have them attack him. I then close the door and run for my life. I can probably survive as he has to deal with the creatures.

Option 4:

I open the duel and enter a duel with him. /He/ has transfigurations and they charge at me. I have nothing. I'm distracted by dealing with his transfigurations and still have to deal with the spells he casts at me. I'm probably dead.

Option 5:

We both transfigure before our duel starts. We're back on even footing but if one of us hadn't transfigured, one of us would have had an advantage.

â€‹

Incarcerous is also more effective on inferi. It's probably more effective than some direct attack spells on other magical creatures as well.

I think you also over-estimate the competency of most people. Exceeds expectations means above-average. Average also means that 50 percent of people are below average. Most ministry employees can't cast a good shield charm. A good transfiguration can probably take out multiple incompetent opponents that are hiding, behind cover, in different rooms, etc.

They're also better at lower-level duels. I'd take a conjured snake over Tarantallegra.

Edit: And again, of course, that says nothing of the usefulness of transfiguration in daily life.

We saw that in Canon, the answer is to use a spell and have it break through the door and take out the death eater.

Also transfiguration doesn't make the animals you create obey you, you need separate spell for that and you opponent still has the option to turn the animals against you either by taking conrol of them or just transfiguring them into something they can use against you.

#+end_quote

That's highly dependent on the death eater's position (I believe he was right next to the door in canon), and very unlikely to occur every time you blind fire a spell through a door into a room where the death eater could be anywhere. If the death eater has also transfigured an animal, chances are even greater that he'll be fine as a transfiguration can take the spell. To rephrase the scenario so you don't emphasize the irrelevant aspects, I'm in a situation where the death eater and I will not begin to duel for three minutes. All options follow with changes made to fit the rephrased scenario. Advantage goes to the person who has transfigured entities.

#+begin_quote
  Also transfiguration doesn't make the animals you create obey you, you need separate spell for that and you opponent still has the option to turn the animals against you either by taking control of them or just transfiguring them into something they can use against you.
#+end_quote

I don't quite think I remember control being over-ridden without a transfiguration. Hell, Dumbledore uses a snake against Voldemort. And said transfiguration into another entity is time spent, time that you could spend stunning them.

#+begin_quote
  Much less useful than just using fire.
#+end_quote

Given that fire can be transfigured into other things (like you mentioned animals would be vulnerable too) and that fire is also transfigured as an attack (McGonagall, Dumbledore), it seems a bit odd that you would mention this. In addition, incarcerous is still better than stupefy or sectumsempra. My reasoning for other magical creatures was this: a giant that would shrug off a stunner, would probably be inconvenienced by ropes.

#+begin_quote
  How is me saying most wizards aren't good enough to effectively use transfiguration me overestimating wizards competence?
#+end_quote

You earlier:

#+begin_quote
  transfigured animals barely pose a threat to any competent wizard.
#+end_quote

My point is that most wizards are not competent by this definition, and as such transfiguration is a more than adequate method to employ against them.

#+begin_quote
  Unless you are one of the top users any transfiguration you can do against them would be inferior to a stunning spell or body bind curse.
#+end_quote

Good luck getting that stunner ahead of you, turning corners, striking opponents behind cover, and stunning more than one person. Someone can simply hide behind a desk to avoid the stunner but they're going to need to do far more to deal with a dog. And before you suggest a blasting spell, the corner and different rooms aspect still applies. Not to mention that the most successful blasting curse we see in canon killed 1/5 people with a point blank explosion in a group of 5, and even pushed a few people away to kind prevent follow-up spells. A transfigured entity like an animal can not only take out more than one person, but they can also get to places without a required sightline.

Transfiguration at the highest level is as good as a direct attack. Transfiguration at lower levels is a win-more. If you go into a duel with transfigured entities ready to go, you go in with an advantage.

And you still have yet to address the convenience of transfiguration in daily life.

It's not even like the Trio is especially bad at transfiguration, Ron and Harry had both good grades in it and Hermione had great grades.

Sure if you are in the top one percent at Hogwarts it's a great skill to have, but I imagine the average student would get little in the end out of it, with them probably considering it a waste of time since they can later just use money to purchase whatever they want instead of transfiguring a mediocre version of it, no to mention that with bought version they don't even have to enchant them themselves.

Honestly, it's ridiculous! Put a unit in Charms about detecting cursed objects, and a unit in Potions about detecting poisons (since they already learn to brew antidotes anyway), roll the dark creature bollocks into Care of Magical Creatures, and then make dueling an elective for all the mad thrill seekers or people who want to be Aurors someday.

I can't remember if it was exclusive to the movie, but there was also one that turned a pet into a goblet, which still gets an O in awesomeness, but a T in practicality.
