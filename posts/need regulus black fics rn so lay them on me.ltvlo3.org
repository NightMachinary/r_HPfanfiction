  Regulus Black comes out of the black lake quite mad, very much his mother's son. Hogwarts will keep him safe, says Dumbledore, who offers him the post of Charms professor.But Regulus hasn't stopped drowning (lungs saturated with water, mind torn apart) and the face of Harry Potter, who looks too much like James, makes him realize the war is never over.

#+begin_quote
  The underlying fact is that Professor Black is the brother of the mass-murdering, You-Know-Who supporting, escapee: Sirius Black. And Harry's feelings are quite mixed---because Professor Black was never really a teacher Harry got along with yet, at the same time, Harry knows too well the feeling of being blamed for something you didn't do. (In which the events of PoA are retold with a surly, sneering, Slytherin Charms professor).

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.

  Regulus was five when he learned that his mother was a cruel woman. Fresh from the cave and with revenge burning bright in his heart, Regulus was determined to restore his honour and rectify his mistakes - starting with his brother's godson. Faced with the inevitable return of the Dark Lord, Regulus prepared as best he could, but not even he foresaw all the consequences of his decision.

#+begin_quote
  At the end of the war, one man lost his freedom and one child went missing. Regulus was unable to act at the time, out of touch with his brother and unaware of the Dark Lord's actions. Now, nearly a decade later, Regulus's world changes again when his brother is released back into his care- damaged but alive. Regulus can do nothing for Sirius's sanity now, but seeing his brother reminds him of who Sirius used to be. A fighter. A Gryffindor. A proud man. A good friend. A strong ally.A godfather.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.

  I'm going bonkers, Harry thinks to himself as he tears through the pile of Muggle pamphlets. He scowls at the titles, things like ‘Foolproof Guide to Losing a Loved One' or ‘Navigating the Stages of Grief.' Like another tasteless advert in the Daily Prophet: Muggle Therapist Version.But what can he do? One, he's desperate for any answer, magical or not. And, two, he's pretty sure that it is not normal to cope with Sirius's death accident by hallucinating his dead ex-Death Eater little brother as his personal pet ghost.Which is why, as he checks over his shoulder, he's hoping really, really hard that the problem is gone. But---“Loath as I am to say it, Potter,” drawls the flickering, irritated spirit of Regulus Arcturus Black, “I'm inclined to believe that we are stuck together. Indefinitely.”...( Or, a foolproof guide to mourning your dead godfather, getting haunted by his dead brother, befriending snakes, smashing lockets, and defeating the Dark Lord in the process. )

  Regulus waits for hours. For hours, he stands on that cursed cliff, the black waters churning and gushing and crashing far below. Even as far up as he is, the air is heavy with spray. He breathes in the salt, and tries to cast his mind back to childhood visits the seaside. He can't. It smells too much like blood.There is an odd noise behind him, inhuman footsteps, nails on rock-Regulus spins around and finds a large, wet, dog. It's huge, and black. The dark eyes are wide and intelligent; far too intelligent to be a convenient stray.  Regulus laughs hysterically. He has been sent a Grim. An omen of death that should be sent to the unwary, not to someone who is attempting what is tantamount to suicide.   The Grim walks closer, eyes wary, and Regulus tells it helplessly, "It is alright, I already know." His voice doesn't waver, and he takes a moment to be viciously proud of himself for that. "I am going to die."Or:Regulus hopes for a chance to say goodbye to Sirius, and somehow that changes everything.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

** If you haven't read all the rest of the Divine Comedians work after Blackpool, you should go do that first. TheDivineComedian does the best Regulus you wont regret it. Age of Lies and Styx I think are my favourite. They're Hiding inside me has my favourite Regulus ever even if he's only in it for a chapter. But he's all royal and cunning and eugh!

linkao3(The Dog Days by MarieKavanagh) - Marie Kavanagh writes a lot of Young Black Family stories, all of which are wonderful.

linkao3(Someone We Used to Know by JanuaryGrey) - JanuaryGrey also has some Regulus stories though he's not the focus. He's good in this story though. And this story has the best use of runes too =)

All the other ones I know have been recced already. Face Death in the Hope is really good but sorta stagnates. The idea of a pensieve infection is really interesting though. The summary in my excel file for 'Who discovered your secret' is just 'Regulus is the worlds most awkward neighbour' which is the most accurate summary for a fic ive ever written.

  "Every dog has his day, unless he loses his tail, then he has a weak end”---June Carter Cash Ten-year-old Sirius Black cannot understand why the rest of his family seems to dread their annual summer holiday to his grandfather's Suffolk country estate. With it's rolling meadows to run through, thick forest of jobberknowll-filled trees to climb and kennel full of crups to play with, to Sirius a visit to Noire House during the dog days of summer is the highlight of the year. But when Sirius's idea for the perfect summer holiday souvenir goes awry, the consequences of his actions are more chaotic (and unexpected) than he'd thought possible...

  After being expelled from Hogwarts for his dangerous prank on Severus Snape, Sirius Black vanished without a trace. The official story was that he ran away from home, but his closest friends always believed something far more sinister must have happened for Sirius to disappear without so much as an owl.Five years later, as Voldemort's attacks grow bolder and more deadly, Remus Lupin spots a familiar face while on a mission for the Order of the Phoenix, the face of a man he believed to be dead. What happened to Sirius Black? Why did he disappear, and, more importantly, why is he back?

  Regulus Black died twelve years ago and was transported to Hogwarts, as a ghost. It's not the place he would have chosen to linger for all eternity, but he supposes it's pleasant enough.Winner, Best of 2020 [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]] Awards

  For someone who planned on dying, Regulus Black hadn't given much thought to what would come after. For him, it's becoming a ghost, and hunting horcruxes with his idiot brother and company. Yay.
