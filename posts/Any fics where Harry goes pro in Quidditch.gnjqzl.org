We've never seen each other naked. That's all I'm saying on the matter.

No, not all his stories have a pro Harry. Letters does eventually; Vitam Paramus does; Twelve Days does; The Quidditch World Cup does.

Pureblood Princess doesn't; Limpieza de Sangre doesn't and neither does the sequel, Cleansing the Sins of the Past; Ithaca doesn't.

None of the stories are directly related although some of the same OCs reappear. Titus Button is pretty constant throughout the stories, Jason Parker varies heavily as just two examples.

************ Limpieza De Sangre is the best fic I've done where Harry plays professional quidditch.

Joking aside, Qudditch World Cup, Vitam Paramus and Twelve Days all feature varying degrees or Professional Qudditch as a plot point. They are not connected and none of them are really 'about' quidditch.

I've also planned a 40,000ish word sequel to one of them that is currently 72000 words and should be published sometime between tomorrow and Christmas. However, literally no one on this reddit will like it. And the main character of it will probably give most of them nightmares.

  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.
