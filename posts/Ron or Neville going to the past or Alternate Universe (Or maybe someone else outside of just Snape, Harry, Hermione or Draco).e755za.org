I'd like to read any stories that have either Ron Weasley or Neville Longbottom going to either the past or an alternate universe.

Would rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine.

Would also be interested in reading any time travel or going to alternate universe stories where it's not Snape, Harry, Hermione or Draco in general as well.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Lily Luna (Potter) going to the past with a faulty time turner. It's a closed time loop, just like how the time turner worked in poa. It's cute, but remember that Lily is from after the war, so she can't fight nor change the past. I should start recommending it more, I doubt you've ever read something like it.

  Read and find out.

From the description. NEVER DO THIS! This isn't what the description is for. Putting "Read and find out" into your short description is like writing "effects will be revealed once ingested" on a medicine bottle.

It's almost as bad as people copying a random paragraph there so it looks artistic or something.

  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out. (Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone)

**** I think so yes! :) Is that the one where Ron goes back in time and then saves Luna's mom? :) :) I like that one! Except when Ron started getting all big headed and stuff. :( And also the weird stuff that showed up later about a mental demon or something. I really wish it had just been totally canon compliant!

***** It's the first part in a series where some unknown single point of departure leads to a world without Harry, which is in the description. There are three published so far, with a fourth updating regularly. It's basically my favorite series at this point because Ron is one of the main perspectives.

  The war is all but over, and the wrong side won. Worse, the Wizarding World's hero and Ron Weasley's best friend died in the fight. When Draco Malfoy offers Ron a way to go back and fix things, he jumps at the chance. But can he anticipate how his changed moves will affect the board? How long can a king masquerade as a pawn? [Trope stew: read the authors' notes.]
