I've read one or two of these and they're super good and interesting. One of them I read had the students of Hogwarts do a dance that basically portrayed the HP series, but the characters kept forgetting the lines between what was real and what was part of the script (it was compared to the movie black swan , which I haven't seen) and it was really good actually.

So anything that continues along the same vein?
