I found [[https://x-slytherinpride-x.tumblr.com/post/152289107682/midnightfuckingmayor-im-a-total-sucker-for][this idea of a writing prompt]] the other day, and now all I want to read is a story where Harry, Ron, and Hermione embrace their ambition and cunning. Has anyone found stories like this?


** [[/u/Flye_Autumne][u/Flye_Autumne]] has a fic sort of like that linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) with a Slytherin Trio. Part of an ongoing series too.

  Chessmaster Volume I. AU. Harry discovers that cleverness is the best way to outwit Dudley and his gang, which leads to a very different Sorting. While Harry and his friends try to unravel Hogwarts' various mysteries, the political tension in the Wizengamot reaches new heights as each faction conspires to control the fate of Wizarding Britain. Sequel complete.

**** Unfortunately I can't answer that as I haven't got around to reading yet. It's open on one of the 90 or so tabs on my phone of stories I plan to read one day aha but I saw your post and remembered it. I heard it was pretty good but I have no anecdotal evidence to verify that.
