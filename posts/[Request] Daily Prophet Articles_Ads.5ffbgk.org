*** I don't know how to sticky? #imanidiot

And thank you for the quick response!! Yes, 2016/2017 for the year is what I had in mind. :) As for editing and such, I will be taking all the text and manipulating it in Photoshop to fit the paper/formatting etc, but for the text all the authors have free reign. If there is anything in particular that needs to be tweaked, I'll let them know and start a dialogue. (I.e. any chance we can trim a couple words here and there?)

**** Your not an idiot, i'm 99% sure that sticky is something only the mods can do.

I believe sticky makes it so the post stays on the front page, but I could be mistaken.

***** Ah, I thought that might be the case! :) Thank you for the explanation. As much as I use reddit, I mainly just lurk and read the occasional thread.

** when in the timeline is the paper supposed to be from? Or do you want something generic (timeline agnostic)?

*** Hello!

Sorry for the late response. I mentioned to another interested individual that I was originally thinking 2016/2017, but for the side pieces I was looking for things that would be slightly more generic. If there was something specific you had in mind, I can PM you or mention my sort of "world state" at the moment in case you wanted to name drop.

For example, Neville is teaching at hogwarts, and Ginny will likely have stepped into a role as a sports editor for the daily prophet... Does that help at all?

***** I'm honestly open for anything. I'm looking to fill up a number of pages... honestly, it depends on the content and how many responses I get.

If you only want to do the wording for a quick ad, that will work just as much as a 500 word blurb on a recently string of gillyweed robberies.

** I was thinking about an article discussing the impact of Brexit on Wizarding Britain. But I'm afraid that would be a very salty article.

Maybe an ad about a new Dragon Reserve in Austria... I'll see what my mind spits out. But I think you'll see something from me.

Do you want pictures, btw?

** Hey, best of luck to you.

I would be interested in writing a wrap up from the final regular season Quittich match. Do you have any particular ideas for how the league is setup run ect and canon characters involved with any of the teams?

*** Hello! Thank you for the well-wishes!

I will send you a PM in a couple of hours with a more specific run down... I hope that is OK! Sorry, I'm just on mobile at the moment... I'm really excited that someone is interested in the sports piece. :D
