I would make Alchemy an elective for third years as well as the older grades, as well as magical theory or ancient studies. For students who want more experience in sixth and seventh year they can take extracurricular courses like household spells and simple healing.


** Well, I would first expand Hogwarts in both size and shift the age for it to be more secondary school/university, but that's me ;)

In terms of the other classes/options, I've always thought that dueling, magical theory, and something akin to geography/an overview of the current world would be useful. Economics, healing/biology, language, literature, home economics, political study/civics, performing arts of some kind (choir, dance, music, theater, etc), arts in general, and the like would all seem like good inclusions. But for them to be offered as actual courses in Hogwarts, the school would need to be much larger - probably at least 150 students per level.

For clubs, I think there should be a huge number of them! Enchanting, chess, DADA, literature, art, gaming, sports, research... There should be a ton of options there IMO.

I'd also then switch classes to have lecture and practical components too - like potions is analogous to chemistry, except if all you did were chemistry labs. The students should learn theory in these courses I think - most of the classes they seem to have a quick description of what they're doing and then go off and practice, instead of having a longer lecture on /why/ they're doing it that way / the theory behind it.

not really, they seem to have to do a lot of reading for there classes and write a lot of essays about them, for the summoning charm alone they had to read 3 books just to prepare themselves for the lesson. They just seem to practice the spells after they were

**** They do reading outside of class, sure - but almost every example of classes in canon that I can remember involves the professor giving a minute of description and then almost entirely practical based ones. Eg potions are always just brewing, transfiguration is almost always transforming the item, and so on.

There's a difference between having a professor teach, and having to read books outside of class on it. There's a distinct lack of theory in how Hogwarts is taught imo, or it's really brushed over

***** I think you missed something when reading the books, they learn a lot more about the spells than they practice, its just that we as reader dont really see much of what they learn. In general the characters in the books know a lot more magic than we as reader do, because most of it is irrelevant to the story.

****** Think about a chemistry class in real life. In terms of theory/teaching vs practical (lab) experience, what will it be biased towards?

In Hogwarts, there's a reason basically every class session that we see is practical. Like every potion one is trying the potion on the board. Every charms class is them trying their new one.

Yes, there's some background theory to it, but it's almost entirely off screen, so to say. You are taking a much more lenient view of what canon implies of the theoretical learning they do

******* I am not being lenient, thats just whats literally in the books, theory makes up a big part of class, we just dont see whats in it, because its not interesting. There are frequent mentions of teacher assigning theory to read and to write, asking questions, or just explaining things.

Even in the first practical class we ever see in canon, they still had to learn the theory first and write down a lot of complicated notes, before they were allowed to try transfiguring their match to a needle.

******** You're being lenient in viewing theory as being a large part of the teaching process, in my view. Sure, they get essays to write, they have some explanations. But basically every mention of, say, Flitwick's class is going to be entirely talking about how they practiced x spell.

Perhaps part of it is how everything appears to be taught - like a series of toolbox spells and techniques, instead of more unified theories and explanations. They learn a series of charms in order, they have a set of transfigurations they do in order, they brew potions depending on what's being asked for that class - but it's not presented as a unified curriculum/theory, at least not without a lot of papering over from what's shown in the books.

And I disagree with it necessarily being /boring/ to not show any of it. Like the summoning spell, that you mentioned having multiple books to read for it, and that they took weeks/months to learn. It's thrown in there, yes - but is it boring to have a paragraph on /why/ it's so hard to learn? On the way they use magic for it beyond just using the right incantation and wand movement? Even when Harry 'gets the hang of it', we don't actually know why. I'd argue it's more boring to just have him randomly try it for a page and have it suddenly click with no real 'breakthrough' in the way he's doing it/thinking.

** More sports teams would make sense, since there are fewer than thirty positions available across the entire school, but there don't seem to be many magical sports, in general, so that's tricky. Maybe a dueling club? A newspaper club would be a great idea, maybe one that tries to instill a sense of journalistic integrity, since that's clearly something wizarding news outlets are lacking. There are also the obvious picks, like clubs for chess and gobstones and suchlike. Optional classes in the later years are an interesting idea, but given how intensive the coursework for OWLs and NEWTs are, I imagine that they'd be limited to courses for certain specialist fields, like healing and curse breaking.

** Woodworking- Like Muggle shop class, except it explores the use of magical woods in crafting various objects (wands, brooms, etc). It would be fun to see what a door, house, trunk, or boat made from magical wood could be capable of doing. Maybe a lesson on fire-making? If magic was around before/at the same time as early human development, besides accidental magic one of the first expressions of purposeful magic could have been fire pits. Maybe woods have different magical effects when burned like showing visions, understanding of other languages, perhaps even something like a rudimentary floo network.

Cooking- If there are magical crops or herbs, how could those be integrated into meals and what kind of magical effects could they have? What about an entire subset of tea-brewing magic?

It actually is canonically an elective for third years and up, so long as there's enough interest from the students.

** Muggle studies mandatory, but only for one year, at fourth year, students old enough to want to go to out and about, but before exams. Arithmancy and runes mandatory for at least a couple of years. They are supposed to be powerful for everything but are optional because they are hard? Is Hogwarts an elite school or what?

Annual trips to muggle world to get students exposed to non magical people and de mystify it. Occlumency lessons instead of Divination (you have the gift or you don't. Do they teach parseltongue?) Helps with self defense, memorization, focus... Obvious.

And someone needs to reverse engineer the Ravenclaw diadem so students can learn faster.

** I would introduce a Wizard equivalent to Muggle Studies with a bit of History of Magic sprinkled in.

It must be really frustrating for Muggle-borns to have to play catch-up with their Pure/Half Blood classmates.Muggle-borns don't really spend much time in the Wizarding World outside of their days at Hogwarts --even when they are at school they don't really get around much. It would be nice if they had a class to teach them more about the politics and the society of the Wizarding World.

I'd also establish a Teen Support group for the students to acknowledge any,uh,changes or address issues that bother them.

Maybe Madame Pomfrey is willing give them The Talk?

** Pretty simple but I think extra English and maths classes would be good, I'm not saying full on subjects maybe just extra lessons or tutoring when they can, I saw it in a story once that they had normal muggle subjects along with magic ones with the muggle subjects just not as often and I think that'd be useful so I keep it as a headcannon.

** 1st Term:

Reading & Writing- Helps students with reading comprehension and introduces them to writing essays and writing with quills.

Introduction to Potions- Teaches about commonly used ingredients, ingredient reactions, preparation and measuring techniques. Proper brewing safety.

Introduction to the Magical World- For Muggleborns & Muggle-Raised. Learning about the Statute of Secrecy, Ministry of Magic, magical oaths & contracts, basic laws, magical transportation, important locations and sports.

All Terms:

Cultural Studies- Studies the culture, customs and history of the Magical & Non-Magical Worlds. Two different courses that switch off days. They actually teach them how to blend in if they are ever in the Muggle world with currency, clothing and correct pronunciation. Also about safety rules like how to cross the street correctly.

Language Studies- I would require at least one foreign language.

Arithmetic

Ethics & Philosophy- Required class. Just because you can use magic doesn't mean you always should.

Art & Literature

Life Studies- Teaches cooking, Household Spells needed in everyday life, and how to properly manage money and time.

Class Counseling - Give students actual counseling on their classes before 3rd Year.

Electives:

Enchanting

Alchemy

Spell Creation- Snape & Lily created their own spells other students should be able to too.

Healing- Even a basic first-aid course would be good. Focus on basic healing spells, potions and treatments.

Wandless Magic(?)- It's clearly possible.

Sports/Clubs:

Broom Racing- Something I think Harry would have enjoyed more. Speed racing on a course and through obstacle courses.

Obstacle Course- Have obstacle courses students can go through for extra credit/points/etc utilizing spells they have learned. Varying difficulty. Would also give teachers a chance to show off their own talents. Hell have some teachers go through obstacle courses, showing off advanced spells and techniques.

Dueling Club

** The class selection is horrendous, but my biggest pet peeve is actually the number of teachers... who must all have absolutely batshit insane schedules.

Take potions, a low demand subject. With two classes per year until owls and one class per year for newt level, that's twelve sections per week. According to canon, students take potions for three periods each week... which would be either an hour long or (more likely) ninety minutes as there's only two classes before lunch. That's 36 hours on the low end and 54 hours on the high end for in class time per week. Plus marking the billion essays that they have to write.

And then there's in demand classes like Charms, or Astronomy with classes at midnight, or... /throws hands up/

Or the fact that kids that are THIRTEEN YEARS OLD are expected to choose the electives that will affect the rest of their lives. Seriously though: third years should not be picking electives. That's stupid.
