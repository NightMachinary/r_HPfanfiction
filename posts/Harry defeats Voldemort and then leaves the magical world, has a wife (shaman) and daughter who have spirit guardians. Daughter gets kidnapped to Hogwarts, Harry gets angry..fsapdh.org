This fanfic is sort of set in the future. Harry has defeated Voldemort by working with the magical (?) government on the condition that they would leave him and his family alone afterwards. Harry then marries an American (?) shaman/hedgewitch and together they have a daughter. She has some sort of spirit guardian that watches over her.

Ron and Hermione now teach at Hogwarts. There is scheme that has been implemented that any muggleborn (?) child or family that refuses to be taught at Hogwarts. The child is kidnapped and forced to go to Hogwarts and then placed with a separate family. Ron and Hermione turn up at Potter's house while he is out on a mission/assignment, and state that the daughter needs to go to Hogwarts to learn. Mother and child refuse and they take the girl and stun the woman. The daughter ends up at Hogwarts, still with her guardian watching over her and she informs Dumbledore that he will be sorry, when her father hears about this. Harry gets back and finds out everything and then storms off to Hogwarts, where everyone realises what they have done.
