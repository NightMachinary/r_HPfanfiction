Golden Trio or solo Harry stories are good, but I'd quite like to read some with a wider group. Ones where they're basically a group and grow and expand their dynamics beyond in canon. Ones where they end up in another world/universe/time would be especially awesome. Not necessarily interested in Hogwarts set ones, or if they are, not just rewrites.
