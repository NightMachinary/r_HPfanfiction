:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey. So I read this fanfiction some time ago. I think on ao3 not sure.

The base of it is that Voldemort is dead. And harry lost the soul piece in his head. And are tired of the ministry being as it is. So jr gives hermione some time. Like 10 years to fix it. Or he will. And he ends up learning dark magic. Like necromancy or something darker and starts attacking. Hermione realizes its him but wont tell. Until he kills ron. Also think most of it is written from hermione pov.

I cant remember the name but I think the story is rather short.

Anyone?

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.
