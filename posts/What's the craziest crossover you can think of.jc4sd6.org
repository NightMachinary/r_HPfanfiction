  "My name is Harry Potter and I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight wizards. Eight Muggleborn wizards.

  Now, y'all might've heard rumors about the big fight happening soon. Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier. We're gonna be dropped into Scotland, dressed as purebloods. And once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhackin' guerrilla army, we're gonna be doin' one thing and one thing only... killin' Death Eaters.

  Now, I don't know about y'all, but I sure as hell didn't kill a giant Basilisk, escape Voldemort, fight my way through half the Department of Mysteries, or fly a goddamn Thestral to teach the Death Eaters lessons in humanity. Death Eaters ain't got no humanity. They're the foot soldiers of a Muggle-hatin', mass murderin' maniac and they need to be destroyed. That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearin' a Death Eater cloak, they're gonna die.

  We will be cruel to Death Eaters, and through our cruelty they will know who we are. And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered, and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us. And the Death Eaters won't not be able to help themselves but to imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels, and the ends of our wands. And the Death Eaters will be sickened by us, and the Death Eaters will talk about us, and the Death Eaters will fear us. And when the Death Eaters close their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us they are tortured with. Sound good?"

  "YES, SIR!"

  "That's what I like to hear. But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors. When you join my command, you take on debit. A debit you owe me personally. Each and every man under my command owes me one hundred Death Eater scalps. And I want my scalps. And all y'all will git me one hundred Death Eater scalps, taken from the heads of one hundred dead Death Eaters. Or you will die tryin'."

** Dumbledore knew Harry might have grown up a bit weird living in Pawnee, Indiana but since his mother's sister wouldn't take him, her cousin was the only option.

His first encounter with the boy was very strange and somewhat off-putting. The boy was rather intimidating to the other children his age and didn't seem to like anyone. Dumbledore offered the boy some tea but Harry simply picked up the cup and slowly poured it out onto the floor next to him without saying anything or breaking eye contact.

"So, uh, you want me to live in England-"

"Scotland," Dumbledore interjected.

"Same thing, and you want me to learn, like, magic or whatever Mister, uh, Dumbledude?"

"Yes."

"And, my original parents were, like, murdered by this wizard nazi dude?" He asked.

"Indeed."

"Cool, or whatever. So, what's the school's policy on pets? Especially, like, the rabid kind."

Yes, Harry was a strange child indeed. His personality didn't resemble that the people who raised him in the slightest. A shame since they were such cheerful couple. Although, his personality was the spitting image of his two older sisters, particularly April, the oldest. Dumbledore had to wonder how to such a happy couple could raise three children into the kind of people these children were.

The only thing the headmaster was sure of was the fact that his school, students and staff alike, would not be ready for the arrival of Harry Ludgate.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

Along the way, the Fab Five realize that Hogwarts itself seems to need their help just as much as Hagrid. YAAASSS QUEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!WINNER for 2018 Beyond the Nook Fanfiction Awards, Best Comedy!

** Two Ravenclaws, exploring the castle on a weekend afternoon, stumble across a room in the the dungeons that looks like it hasn't been touched in centuries. They venture in, look at the old, decaying things on the shelves, before finding an egg in the corner that looks in better condition than most things in the room, under a shimmering blue mist. It twitches, then [[https://youtube.com/watch?v=Uf1NX7e8Gao][the top of the egg unfolds like a flower, and something flies out onto one of their faces]].

As it did once, centuries ago, Hogwarts seals off another part of itself forever to protect the remaining students. The students currently in that part of the dungeon, including everyone attending the latest Slug Club gathering, are none-the-wiser until they try to leave.
