:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was a parody crossover fanfic. In this fic Superman tries to apprehend Harry for some crime but instead is labelled as Pervert.

Moreover Superman and Batman have masochistic tendencies which are fulfilled by Lois Lane and Wonder Woman respectively.

It was a funny fic. And I also remember that Harry cut off Joker's hands and joked about how he disarmed him.

Can anyone help me find this fic?

I wanna know if it has been updated. If not, I would still read it again.

Thank you.


** It's chapter 127 in Odd Ideas Rorschach Blot.
