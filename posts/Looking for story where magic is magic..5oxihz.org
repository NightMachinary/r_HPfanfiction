Hi i'm looking for any harry potter stories where magic is actually magic. You can do anything with it as long as you have the imagination, will and power for it, i mean no set of standard spells maybe even no wand but that can be optional, look at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12026631/1/]] to understand what i mean, it's just there doesn't seem to be a lot of these type of story out there, sure there is op!harry ones where he gets powerful via a set of spells, and wandless magic, but that always seems so restrictive to me and how i imagine magic.

Edit: Should have put this in earlier. I would rather the stories have a minimun of 30k words.


** Magic is spells, incantations, wands, and staffs everywhere. For example Doctor Strange, he regularly uses spells, and objects of magical power. And there are objects (staves, sceptres, wands) that can encompass even his power. There is no such thing as 'magic is magic' unless you mean the trope of constantly overexplaining magic in fics, then I agree.

*** I understand that but i'm also looking at it as it is. A reality manipulating energy that always breaks the rules of reality. Maybe i should be clearer i don't mind the spells. What i'm looking for is a story where it's all about your will-power as well, therefore making new spells on the fly when needed. I also want different, more inventive spells.

** Sounds more like what you're looking for is a powerful, open ended magic system with an emphasis on willpower and imagination

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

** Linkffn(7287278) has a mystical feel to Harry's desperate learning of wandless magic.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7145009]]) Tom runs away to a secret magical orphanage run by a mysterious green eyed man. Again, a mystical feeling.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5366507]]) Harry is limited only by his imagination and magical knowledge in the world of the Avengers. More down to earth than the others, but still not a 'firm rules of magic' type of fic.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6177703]]) Drarry fic set in Grimmauld Place, which is more magically aware than Harry realized- and angry with him.

  There's a sanctuary headed by a green-eyed man located in the outskirts of Scotland. Tom would rather risk it than the Orphanage.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  The new reality had no wizards or magical nations -- but it had a whole boatload of powerful and occasionally inept sorcerers. Who were usually semi-public and sometimes very popular in social media. How it worked, Harry had no idea.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
