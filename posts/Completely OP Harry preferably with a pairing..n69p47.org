I much prefer Harry with Daphne, Hermione, or Luna. If any of those pairings have a completely OP, or god like Harry I'd love to read some of your favs.


** I wish I could remember the title, but there was this story about Harry and Tom being literal gods that have been fighting since the beginning of time. The caveat was Harry was always stupidly powerful with stagnant power, while Tom started out with basically no power but could accumulate it over time. If I recall correctly, they'd be reborn each time Harry defeated Tom, but the story being told was one of when Tom's steady rise has equalled Harry's and was about to surpass him while Harry freaked out about finding a way to stop it from happening. Something about the universe ending if Tom won, or similar. And I do believe ‘love conquers all' is the eventual message, likely Harmony.

This basically turned into my own request thread, sorry. But I swear whatever this story is /does/ fit your desires.

Edit: it was this fic: linkffn(4841247)

The first is the original, the remaster is the author correcting grammar/spelling errors and probably giving it a bit more pizzazz. It's not fully done yet, halfway. The *original is complete* though so donut worry.

*** De-rec, for the original. It is simply not good. That's expected, as it was apparently the author's first story, but on a level higher than spelling and grammar the quality is severely lacking. Characterization is out of whack, events are tenuously strung together like a bunch of Christmas lights haphazardly flung over the front porch, and the prose is ... well, it /tries/ to be a clear window into events, no accessories, no dross. And that style can be done very well---Brandon Sanderson is an example of an author who's famous for it. But this isn't that. The POV shoots around like an amateur filmmaker who just discovered angles exist, and it is not pretty. The writer of this fic had a vision for what they wanted, and their skill just wasn't up to seeing it realized.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** Stupidly OP Harry? Linkffn(Savior of Magic; International Triwizard Tournament; paid in blood)

There are going to be lots of heavy tropes in almost any of these, but these all strike me as somewhat different in one way or another.

Any of the full length fics by [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/][Jeconais]] feature a very OP Harry in a lot of different ways. I don't remember any with the pairings you specifically asked for, but I think you might enjoy them regardless

*** De-rec. Standard quality for this type of story, with an author who wants a powerful protagonist and sacrifices everything in the way of quality to realize that goal. It's almost meta, the way the writers of these kinds of fics mirror their protagonists. Core Threads even has the standard Lord nonsense, as well as this lovely little section:

#+begin_quote
  Nagnok looked at some more parchments that appeared in the drawer before looking Harry in the eyes. "My clan historically took care of both the Peverell accounts and the Potter accounts over the years. You can approve either myself, one of my clan, or any other Goblin you wish at this establishment if you have found some fault in our service."

  Harry tilted his head. "The Peverell accounts?"

  He nodded. "The Peverell family became the Gaunt family, which became the Potter line." He leaned back slightly. "My ancestor was the account manager for the Gaunt family for most of his life. It was a sad day when they passed."

  The boy thought. "Private Clerk Nagnok, would you be willing to become the Potter Family Account Manager?"

  A bright, sharp smile crossed the goblins face. "I would be honored, Lord Potter. As I understand you have an afternoon of shopping planed, we will get you your new keys created before you leave today and a full report of your holdings will be made, reviewed, and I will send you a list of options to your address. With your blood on file, we should have no issues contacting you from now on, mail-block or not."

  Harry smiled, and stood, shaking Nagnok's hand. "I am sure you will not let me down sir. Now, what do I need to do to access my school funds? Is there a way to access the money without visiting every day or so?"

  Before speaking, he turned to the teacher. "Professor, we thank you for finding our missing Lord, but as you are aware family business must be handled in secrecy."

****** Your coal is somebody else's diamond. Fic is free. You get what you pay for. Bitching about completely free shit reeks of entitlement.

If you're tired of seeing the same recs over and over again, how about you recommend something you DID like? Your solution is to throw something under the bus that didn't suit your personal tastes? Why is that?

I know nothing about the fic being discussed, but encouraging creativity is always going to have a better outcome than trashing it.

I miss the days of "don't like, don't read." Guess I'm too old-school for whatever the fuck has happened in fandom in the last few years.

I don't look down on fanfic because it's lowbrow or whatever, in fact I believe it's a very cool, low cost route to get into writing in the first place.

Now, eventually you're going to want to improve your technique, but initially you want to just get your foot in the door, so to speak.

Just coming back for one more thing, because this highlights just how much you are misunderstanding what fic actually is: every author writes for a different reason, and many of them are NOT interested in writing professionally. In fact, I know of /several/ authors who have used writing fic as a way of processing trauma and abuse that they've suffered.

Putting criticism of what could very well be someone else's therapy in the public sphere is a choice. I choose to not trash their effort. This is a very easy choice for me. I hope it will be for you someday.

I like to just use the URL button for this (the loop rings thing), but the bot can sometimes get it with the exact title (albeit if there are multiple fics with the same title you need to specify the "by author" or you might get the wrong one) or you can use the number that's part of the URL, in this case I believe Linkffn(6254783) should work

*** Good lord that is some tropey garbage. It's like the author spent the first several chapters speedrunning all the worst tropes they could come up with.

Dumbledore bashing? Check, though surprisingly not as bad as I'd expect.

Hermione bashing? Check.

Room of Requirement used in non-canon ways? Check.

Harry becoming more magically powerful and good at everything because something something horcrux? Check. (better than something something magical limiters, but not by much)

Goblins being ever so impressed by basic decency? Check.

House elves are miserable because something Hermione something clothes? Check.

Marriage contracts? Check.

Daphne, the "Ice Queen of Slytherin?" Check, literally word for word.

Claim to <insert founder> family? Check, twice over.

  In the aftermath of a peaceful summer comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually. And now, a free remastered version is coming to my website!

First one Harry in the new host for The Specter. AKA the spirit of God's Vengeance. One of the most powerful beings in the entire DC universe.

Second one he winds up, due to blood adoption, as a Half-Saiyan with a creature inheritance. It's a harem, and the writing is a little rough, but it's pretty entertaining.

Last one he's raised by his mom's distant cousin, Saitama. Also trained by Saitam, Genos, and the hero associations two most powerful espers.

non crossovers afaik:
