Hey, I'm wondering if anyone has come across any fanfiction with specific reactions to the Goblet of Fire selecting Harry's name:

1. Harry outright refusing to acknowledge that he has to compete, because he didn't enter his name. Rather than buying the adults claiming he is in a contract, he just decides not to compete and let whatever happens happen.

2. The adults being responsible and saying, "okay we know he didn't enter himself and someone is trying to kill him. What is the bare minimum he has to do in this tournament to keep him alive? Can we just immediately judge him straight 0s at the start of each task..." etc.

I've tried to search for these two but my search fu is weak and the majority of alternate goblet fics I find have alternate competitors or something similiar.


** 1) Harry and Astoria simply ran away in *Finding a Place to Call Home*, linkffn(9885609), and the Goblet actually punished one who entered the name. Harry just gave some effort in *Harry Potter: Unchampion*, linkffn(3793741), and purposely lost the tournament.

2) The adults were going to try that in *The Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(9863146), but Harry's ambition got better of him and he actually went for the win. The bad guys also had Plan B in case Harry decided not to touch the cup.

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

  What if Harry's rebelliousness started a year earlier, because Dumbledore wouldn't let him go stay with Sirius in the summers? What would a rebellious teenager who was entered into the Triwizard Tournament do? H/G

  [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4yqea0/any_stories_in_which_harry_deliberately_flanks/][Any stories in which Harry deliberately flunks the Tournament tasks after being roped into it?]] I don't see how even a “magically binding” artefact could make him not merely participate in it but aim to win as well.

    - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3793741/1/][/Harry Potter: Unchampion/]] (25,236 WL; Complete) --- the most realistic outcome portrayed. In other stories Harry's decisions of non-competition suddenly ends up being beneficial for him in various ways. Here it's mostly what it is, him saving himself the trouble and risks attached to TWT.

    - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11610805/1/][/Muggle-Raised Champion/]] (106,020 WL; WiP) --- technically well-written story and interesting to read, but unfortunately also has wishful thinking elements. Harry decides to waste minimal effort on each task, but somehow the odds end up on his side each time and he ends up winning without even planning to.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
