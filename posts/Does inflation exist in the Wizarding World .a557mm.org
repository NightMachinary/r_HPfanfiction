In the real world, salaries increase (or decrease) more or less regularly to follow the inflation (and deflation) of the economy.

Does this apply to the Wizarding World, or at least the European/British part of it given that from what we see in the books the economy is neither very much developed nor in a booming state (IMHO) ?

.

Or, to phrase it differently: how developed and unstable the economy in HP is ? Given that they use currency based on solid ore, can it be compared to an XVIIIth century economy (before the first industrial revolution) ?


** Depends, its up to the writer really. Are galleons just gold coins? In which case yes, yes there is as more gold is mined, buying off the muggles, the philosophers stone alone could create tones of money.

If there is more to a galleon than being a big gold coin then its more complicated. Are they enchanted and thus harder to replicate? Then it comes down to the institutions in the world, do the goblins or ministry mint the money? If its the goblins do they hate wizards and want to destabilise the economy? If the ministry mints the money does fudge trigger hyper inflation to fund the war against Voldemort?

Sorry for the shitty formatting, I'm on mobile.

** Note that the inflationary nature of the world economies is very much an intentional, engineered situation.

Reduction in the value of currency reduces the value of savings and debt, encouraging borrowing and investing and discouraging 'under the matress' saving. It is a positive with countries with large national debts.

For all intents and purposes, HP seems to lack any form of monitary policy...

** There was a mention in "Quidditch through the Ages" - 150 galleons in 15th century would equal more than a million in present day..

** Given that the goblins act as currency traders between the magical and muggle world and a shitload of wizarding consumption /HAS/ to come from the muggle economy, one can infer that the wizarding economy must suffer from all the troubles of the muggle one (to some degree) from sheer virtue of connection to it.

** It likely does. The currency is made of gold and thus likely relies on a gold-standard. With more gold being mined, the gold itself loses value and so does the coin. Of course, all of this is speculation because we don't really know anything about the economic situations of Wizarding England.

** Gringotts has at least some connectivity to the Muggle world since you can exchange Muggle money. With this in mind, it's very likely that the Wizarding World also deals with inflation.

** I would say not, or at least not much.

The reason for this is that one of the thematics of the Harry potter setting is that the wizarding world is slow and rather resistant to change. It's steady. It's not really willing to change things up, so I would expect that a loaf of bread today costs about as much as it did 100 years ago.

The prices of individual goods may fluctuate... for example:

- The muggles cut down forest X, so Herb Y only grows in a few places. Most potion suppliers are growing it in a greenhouse now. Price goes up.
- Potion suppliers get pretty good at growing it (Specialized spells and potions to help it grow strong, as well as understanding WHAT the plant needs to thrive).... price goes down.\\
- Herb Y is struck by a blight that destroys many of the plants that have been growing. Only a few people who have been sourcing their own unicorn-trodden earth escape the blight. Price goes up.
- Potion suppliers figure out that Herb Y2 from africa is BASICALLY the same as Herb Y, but more potent, EXCEPT in healing potions. Price gets confusing. :P

or, for example... (something I tend to put in my stories)... While parchment (which is actually animal skin!) is totally the way to go for formal writing, some enterprising muggleborns started a stationary store and sell fancy PAPER like you'd buy in a muggle store. While they carry fancy papers with colored fibers and print on them, the bulk of their sales comes from good old fashioned lined and unlined paper, typically sold as note-taking paper and scrap paper. It's incredibly inexpensive compared to parchment or even paper made the traditional wizarding way, yet they still make bank off of it. (They're quick to express to muggleborn families they they'd probably be just as good going to the store for their paper, THOUGH they have enchanted the paper lightly to improve durability and make it easier for ink to be removed from the surface... but you would probably be more interested in our line of Nu-Quills for the Nu-Wizard, which help teach a young writer how to get used to all this nasty quill-and-ink business....)

So... individual stuff goes up, goes down, but generally speaking... I imagine that a young professor dumbledore was getting paid about as much as a young professor snape was, and about as much as a young Professor Longbottom will be paid. More or less.

** The currency has a fixed value, which means there is no fluctiations in salaries and prices of certain goods. As long as the ministry is not swimming in debt, it's stable. Only way to destablise it would be with an infusion of astronomical amount of gold, enough to devalue it and to do that, one would need to be Bill Gates rich. I doubt it could happen.

**** Wouldn't affect it too much because trade between two currencies would be limited from the start. I doubt wizards would depend heavily on Muggles for their food or clothing when multiplation of food is possible and magic would make them better and more efficient farmers.

A hudred or so elves could farm enough food for more than ten thousand people.

The most likely items wizards would buy from muggles are luxury items, not the essentials and with their aversion to technology and automated products, even the luxury imports would be pretty low.

Sure but that wouldn't mean shit. Half-bloods and muggleborns aren't gonna limit themselves to traditional wizarding british fare all the time, they're gonna buy takeout and whatever brand products they like from their local muggle deli. Muggle clothing (which every wizard who isn't a blood purist certainly owns) is unlikely to come from Mme Malkins either, wizards don't have the numbers for pret a porter. Most durables are likely gonna be muggle too. Autarky might well be possible for the wizarding world, but it sure as shit wouldn't be probable as the setting is described

****** Actually, if I'm remembering the books right, pretty much everyone wore robes. Yes, half-bloods and muggleborns are more likely to buy muggle goods but as they assimilate, even their shopping and eating habits will.

And you are forgetting there is a thing called Magic and that in epilogue, Ron spoke of bewitcing his driving instructer to pass the exam. I highly doubt most wizards would care for paying the full price for anything when a wave of their wand would lower the price easily, if not eliminate the price completely.

I think there would be a muggle stores in Wizarding side that buys the desired items by bewitching the muggles and sells them to wizards.

Besides, why would anyone chose to buy massproduced goods of low quality when they could buy custom made items? No, I think he even Harry aand Hermione would dress in robes.
