I posted this in another Harry Potter reddit but in case you guys aren't in that one I wanna see what you all think

in Chamber of Secrets Tom Riddle was nearly completely resurrected by his horcrux and Ginny's life/body. He was strong enough to order the basilisk around and wat not. My question is how would he know which students were Muggle-Born, Pureblood and Half-blood. especially Muggle-borns and half-bloods. The basilisk could never have figured it out himself, it's just a snake.

So how did he know all of the students blood status and who to attack? (Rowling said there was a 1,000 enrolled in hogwarts), and furthermore if he knew how did he know when to attack them? Did Ginny have to be nearby to say 'she's alone now'. As the basilisk if present wouldn't only just affect Muggle-borns (Nearly-Headless nick was petrified and he was a ghost so if a pureblood had been around then he too would have been affected) so he'd have to know when to attack as most, if not all, the attacks had muggle-borns alone in a secluded spot where they weren't found until after the fact. So not a busy part of the school. Which is why I assume there wasn't more attacks.


** As far as we know, Diarymort generally picked out his victims from what he'd been told by Ginny/read in Ginny's mind. And yes, he was presumably following the Basilisk around actively, not just releasing her from the Chamber and then just sending Ginny's body back to the dormitories. It's not unreasonable to assume that Ginnymort and the Basilisk encountered several non-muggleborns on the way and Ginnymort memory-charmed them. (It's also the best explanation for why no /Portraits/ saw anything.)

Oh, and ---

Don't underestimate Potterverse snakes --- even the very existence of Parseltongue is enough to show they're more intelligent than we muggles give them credit for. And even then, if Slytherin could "wire" the Basilisk so that she would only obey his true heir by blood rather than any ol'Parselmouth, it's not that much of a stretch that he could have given her some more magical way to know a student's ancestry.
