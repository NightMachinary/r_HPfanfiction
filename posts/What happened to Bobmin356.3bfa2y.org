Bobmin356 is probably my favorite author. Their last update was in October 2014, when they were updating pretty regularly for the previous 9 years. Does anyone know what happened? Are they alive? Abducted by aliens? Joined a Buddhist monastery and took a vow of silence? What happened?


** They updated on [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/][FanFicAuthors]] on January 12.

They favorited "A Second Chance At Life" by JasonZ that was published on Feb 15.

I believe Snorkack is Bobmin, and they were active on the [[https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/snorkack/conversations/topics/31116][yahoo group]] earlier this week.

So I'd say they just haven't gotten around to posting recently.

** Perhaps they got bitten by the Karma beetle?

The Bobmins are responsible for basically killing off FFA back in the day. The site rules* for accepting new authors were that decisions for admitting a new author had to be unanimous among existing site authors. For years, they refused to consider any new authors, several of whom (nonjon, e.g.) were entirely deserving.

It's a bit ironic that they often don't really even go to FFA anymore with their new stuff (and that the place is, as they'd perhaps intended, made into largely a ghost town).

*That Kinsfire is now in charge of new FFA authors is little by way of improvement. If you're not a rabid Harmony shipper, don't bother.

^{(Yeah, maybe a tad bitter at having never received an invite.})

*** I just went to FFA for the first time in a couple years because of this post. There are only five active authors, and one of them is Viridian, who is barely active (His stuff is worth reading, just has to be the worst update rate of anyone I've ever read.) It's definitely become a bit of a ghost town now days.

**** Agreed, and the other authors aren't much better. Of the other "active" site writers, Ishtar updated recently for the first time in about seven years; Whydoyouneedtoknow is steady, though you have to be invested in her rather bland (and weird gender politics) million-plus word series to follow; Jeconais is a pale imitation of his former self (one of the HP fanfiction giants back in the day); and while Deluded Musings/Clell is steady, I don't find his stuff particularly inspiring. A lot of Viridian's luster was lost when he went through a multi-year posting desert, then asked for (and apparently received) donations for his fanfiction writing on his private website.

The site only has two legitimately active writers, with most of the traffic coming from re-reads of old material posted there uniquely (most of Jeconais's stuff, e.g.).

*** I dunno about any of that, but the whole "unanimous consent" thing seems like it was always going to be broken. If it wasn't the Bobmins, it would have been somebody else. Doesn't make it right, but that kind of administration would never work for very long.

** Their ego probably got so big, they were bitten by the let's publish our own original novel.

*** They're good enough authors that I'd read what they wrote. At least I'd look into it.

**** they are just my gripe with fanfic authors giving up on uncompleted fics to go write original fiction.

** As of their last Dragonriders update, they mentioned how taking care of Bob's father's estate has turned into a real hassle, like far more of one than should ever be expected. Add on top of that they live in the middle of nowhere... I'm hoping things are OK for them
