Looking for fics where the so called â€˜Wizards-duel' in first year that Draco didn't actually appear for and sent filch after Harry actually has more meaning then was intended.

I remember reading one where Ron ended up with Millicent Bulistrode because Crabbe (or Goyle) was Draco's second and lost his inheritance to Ron because Harry and he actually showed up for the duel.


** One might argue that duel was one for the ages and took 6 long years to resolve completely, and even involved an Elder Wand.

Old Man Harry loves to tell the tale.

"Ever hear about the six-year-long duel and how I became master of a Deathly Hallow?"

"Papa! You've told this story a million times and it's super long."

"Oh, Hufflepuff. It's a good story."

*** I guess...

I wonder if someone could have made a fic about it. Where he duel itself is continuous and grows throughout the years of hog warts, as the central topic instead of all the other stuff happening, though it all still happening of course.

**** Could be. I just like to think of it as a partial reason why Harry always seems to have a leg up against Malfoy in most violent circumstances, and a sort of magical reason why they grow to hate and distrust each other so much after First Year.

I had bullies growing up, and we mostly just grew up and stopped caring about our differences. Harry and Draco have a long standing feud that sort of exacerbates everything whenever the two get involved in the same scheme.

Link? Please? That sounds hilarious. I can just imagine them being forced to sit next to each other, pouting, in the Great Hall while the Weasleys and Bullstrodes have a serious discussion about the ramifications and loopholes that would allow for an annulment, while Fred and George throw rice at them and yell Mazel Tov and Peeves shatters dishes.

*** I don't remember the fic. But I'll search for it.

Though the scene you mentioned would be hilarious.

I can just imagine Molly yelling at the twins for throwing rice and causing a ruckus.

  What if when Draco challenged Harry to a duel at the beginning of first year it had a lot more significance then either realized? A duel not only for bragging rights but for injustice and eventual love. Harry/Harem
