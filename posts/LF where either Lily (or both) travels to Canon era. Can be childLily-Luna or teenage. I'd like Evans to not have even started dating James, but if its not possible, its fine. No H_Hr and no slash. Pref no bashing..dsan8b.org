#+TITLE: LF where either Lily (or both) travels to Canon era. Can be childLily-Luna or teenage. I'd like Evans to not have even started dating James, but if its not possible, its fine. No H/Hr and no slash. Pref no bashing.

Also, not exactly related to this, but there was a fic where Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco (and maybe someone else) kidnaps a 16~17yo Lily from the past to help them win the war. I don't remember the name of this fic and would be glad if someone did.

Edit: I'm not asking for incest fics. Don't care about the pairing besides what I stated on the title.


** Ananke has a 19 year old Lily travel to 1997. It's a Snily story.
