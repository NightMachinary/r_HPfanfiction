Hey, so, there's this really cool looking fic on fanfiction.net but it is [[https://goo.gl/oogE6d][improperly formatted]]. Do you have anything that can help me? An app that re-formats the text on screen?


** I am not sure I understand what exactly is improper about the fragment you posted. Is it the indentation at the start of every paragraph?

At any rate, I do not believe there is a technical problem requiring a technical solution. The easiest is probably to contact the author and ask nicely to fix it, explaining what and why is wrong.

*** The author hasn't been active for years. I figured someone would probably have an app that fixed it... there's an app for everything now.

**** Well, in this case the following tampermonkey (in Chrome, but something very similar or even identical would work in greasemonkey in FF) would fix the indentation issue:

#+begin_example
  // ==UserScript==
  // @name         Remove paragraph indentation
  // @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
  // @version      0.1
  // @description  try to take over the world!
  // @author       You
  // @match        https://www.fanfiction.net/s/885644/*
  // @require http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js
  // @grant        none
  // ==/UserScript==

  (function() {
      'use strict';

      $(document).ready(function() {
          $("p").each(function() {
              $(this).html($(this).html().replace(/^(\s|&nbsp;)+/, ""));
          });
      });
  })();
#+end_example
