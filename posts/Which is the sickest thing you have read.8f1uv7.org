** There's a series of short fics in which Harry kills Hermione and rapes her dead body.

I've read Renegade Cause, was really surprised at that moment lol.

A lot of the time travel fics that have sex in them are kinda disgusting, like 30-40-50 year old Harry having sex with like 13 year old Ginny or Hermione or something. (Even if you have a younger body you still have your life experiences dude, it's disgusting.)
