I think I may add this to my Darkness!Harry story in second year with Creevey pleading to be Harry's since it fits the school changes happening within it.


** I'm surprised to actually see this mentioned. You bought up some tales I almost forgot about.

I went to an all-boys' private school, and this was a practice, just kept quiet. I got in solely because of my doctor who recommended me there, stating that it may help me. The first thing to remember is that it was a christian school and I don't believe in God. People soon realised that I wasn't praying and I got it when the boys all got out of eyesight by the teachers. Rather hypocritical because none of them really did either, they were just wealthy and attended the school that cost the most.

It wasn't called 'fagging' here, because that was far too close to the homosexual word and heaven forbid they be gay! I'm going to skip a lot of the unneeded stuff, but I essentially waited on hand for them and as I got older, it got more and more sexual. It started with being asked to 'prepare' someone so he could 'enjoy' himself. At that point, I was just so used to doing whatever they asked, I didn't even question it.

Long story short, it helped me find my sexuality and I wouldn't change it no matter what... Okay, I derailed this thread, but I'm also interested in any fics you guys have.

Edit: I may do this for my next fic.

** A-ha! Time to recommend this old gem again. Linkffn(705541). I'll always praise this for how well it manages to convey pureblood and school social interaction, in a subtle, interesting manner that manages not to become overbearing or pretentious.

Fagging is included, although the tradition is of course called elfing here.

I see you writing this all the time. I feel duty bound to inform you that "darkness" is a noun, not an adjective.

*** The Darkness: an elemental force that allows access to an otherworldly dimension and control over the demons who dwell there.

Adjective: a word or phrase naming an attribute(in this case, Wielding the power of the Darkness), added to or grammatically related to a noun to modify or describe it.

Because it modifies the Harry to denote it's my Darkness story, it does work as an adjective, even if the word, traditionally, isn't. I could use Wielder!Harry but too many morons would think I meant welder.

**** The word "Darkness" still refers to the thing itself - the force. It doesn't become an adjective just because you (incorrectly) place it in front of a noun. It would be like writing "magnetism Harry" or "gravity Harry".
