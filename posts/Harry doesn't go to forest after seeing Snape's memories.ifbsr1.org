I believe the story starts with Dumbledore being given chance to meet Harry in kings Cross because he had once held 3 hallows briefly and when he meets him, Harry was old. When asked why Harry replies that he didn't trust Snape and Dumbledore and kept the secret that he was horcrux from everyone including his friends. In the end Harry goes to his next adventure and albus is seen fearing what could be his next adventure
