Title explains all. Just wondering whether there's a significant difference in prose flavor/texture and would like to find out.


** Speaking as a non-native author, probably the biggest difference is that we don't have an instinctive sense which word to use, which might lead to some odd word choices. Then there are the national differences, like German using a lot of long sentences.

Be the judge how prevalent those things are.

PS: IIRC, Starfox is Swiss and Achille-Talon French, so if you want to conduct further studies, check out their works.

*** Yeah, Swiss here - native German speaker. Random capitalisation is my bane. And my English teacher, back in school, once told me after a test that I had a very good French vocabulary :P

Count yourself lucky. Mine failed me for a creative writing assignment with no limits whatsoever because there was too much random violence. Looking back, I was trying to deal with childhood trauma (I had been kidnapped for 8 hours once). The next teacher (one year later), couldn't speak English properly and often told us to speak German to her (that was during my last two years of High School).

** Some nonnative English authors I can think:

LeQuin is Dutch, writes English very well, but lousy H/Hr fics with tons of ridiculous Potters and Weasley bashing.

Starfox5 is Swiss German, writes English very well, but the style in his earlier fics (Marriage Law Revolution, Patron) feels quite different than later ones (Dark Lord, D&E). Starfox5 has an extremely dismal view of magical governments and is known for writing â€˜revolutionary' fics. On the other hand, Dumbledore is generally portrayed as competent and good, while Magical France is generally depicted as a bigger shit hole than Magical Britain.

White Angel of Auralon is German, has some issues with grammar and spelling in earlier fics (Beltane Child), but has improved a lot since then. This author will bash Ginny in H/Hr fics, and Hermione in H/G fics.

Hellstrike is German, writes good English (no surprise), and hates Ron.

Marquis Black (author of Emperor) is from Panama, writes English very well. This author dislikes the US and loves the British Empire.

  Growing up on London's streets and having nobody to rely on has led to a different from canon Harry Potter start his first year at Hogwarts. Add an ancient and mysterious pendant, pureblood pricks, a scheming headmaster and a goddess as his mother-figure in the mix and you have a genuine Alternate Universe. Grey, asshole Harry.

** I have a couple favorite authors whose native language isn't English.

Ultima ratio by Winterblume Linkffn(5034546) She's German.

Masters of Manipulation by Nerys Linkffn(3736817) I believe she is Dutch. The only thing I noticed is her stories use apostrophes vs quotations around dialogue not sure if that's just a formatting difference in her text program or what.
