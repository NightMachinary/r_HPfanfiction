I would like some recommendations for good and complete stories that focus on Draco, I am up for reading almost anything with the exception of Mpreg, Next-Gen and Muggle-AUs.

Smart!Draco is preferable and family fics as well! I love Astolat, Olimakiella and Shanastoryteller works. I also love Draco being a cheeky brat like in Roachpatrol's When The Wolf Comes Home


** This is hands down the best Draco-centric fic I have read: linkffn(6432055).

It's very introspective, and explores Draco's character in an almost intimate way. It shows us his journey post-war, as he grows and changes, struggling to reconcile the world around him with the prejudices he held growing up. There's almost no connection with anything or anyone magical. It's just Draco, alone.

I really, really liked it.

#+begin_quote
  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
