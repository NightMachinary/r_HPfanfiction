How many people are actually in wizarding Britain. I've seen rough estimates of Hogwarts being about 300 ish students (which is basically nothing) and the fact that the world of wizarding communities isn't described as large at all in Rowling's Britain. There really can't be many Wizards?

But then on the other hand the snatchers in the movies (I understand they can't be completely realistic and are mainly for the dramatic effect) were by the hundreds and wizards also live for long periods of time with (highly likely) few disease/accident related deaths.

But can a community sustain a population with a large civil war and entire families being wiped out, along with all that inbreeding.

I'm pretty confused.


** Rowling is, by her own admission, really, really bad at math. I think I read somewhere in an interview that she saw Hogwarts at around 1,000 students, we just don't get that many named characters to go off of.

** I think it's just mostly JKR not being super accurate with math. It would all make more sense if she had made the magical population larger. But I've also heard the same about hogwarts total number of students being around 3-400, so it's probably safe to say that the total magical population in Britain is only about 3-4000.

** Hogwarts has about 850-900 students(How I got to that number is written [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/euotnx/how_bigsmall_is_the_harry_potter_universe_in_the/ffrkizq/?context=3][here]]), thats at least 120 per year. If we go by a average life expectancy of 100(we know wizards frequently become older than this, but just use this as average) then there would be at least 12000 wizards and witches in Britain, so it basically has the population of a large town, without including all the other magical beings( creatures like Hags, Goblins and Vampires) that live in Britain.

The civil war also becomes more viable if you actually look at the numbers on each side, like neither the Order of Phoenix nor the Death Eaters even have twenty members each, and we know Aurors only recruit the best and often spend years without recruiting people, so they probably have similar numbers. Also the Death Eaters weren't just randomly causing mass slaughters among wizards, they specifically targeted those who opposed them and their loved ones, overall I doubt they killed more than a few hundred, which in a population of 12000 is still devastating, but not impossibly so.

yeah, i'd that is is true, cause Dumbledore was 115 and still fine besides the curse, Bathilda Bagshot was already an adult at least by the time Dumbledore was a kid and if Voldemort hadn't bothered her she would of been fine for a few years yet, the unnamed trolley witch is 190 by the Epilogue, and then there's Griselda Marchbanks who was already graduated and working as an examiner by the time Dumbledore does his owls/newts, and is still alive and doing fine by the time Harry does his owls (don't know for newts cause it never shows harry doing those) and then there is also newt scamandar who was born in 1897 and was still alive by the epilogue/2017

** The Rowling Hot Take numbers, as usual, make no sense, so let's throw them out.

Inbreeding shouldn't be a problem as even with a population as small as 160 it can be effectively controlled.

We can do some calculations:

Start off with Hogwarts having 40 students per year, 10 per house. We know that not every magical person gets a spot at Hogwarts, some get homeschooled, some go to other schools. To try and establish a cap, let's say 50% of wizards in Brittain go to Hogwarts. That means there are 80 new magical people per year. We also know that aging doesn't quite work the same. Dumbledore is quite old and one of the examiners mentions she was the examiner for him when he was in school, so magical people seem to be able to live very long. Let's say 100 years is typical barring violent death, or a potential population of 8000 in Brittain with Hogwarts as a sole school. This could put us at 1,000,000 wizards worldwide. If we say that Hogwarts is the premier school, but not the only one in the UK, we can adjust this arbitrarily high.

I like to think of the magical population being fixed, rather than proportional to the broader population, which allows us to sidestep issues of a vanishingly small population as you go back in time. I like to think that exactly 7001 magical children are born every year globally, because it's a fun prime number and gets us to a reasonable point for 40 new students at hogwarts every year.

*** In my head canon Harry's class is smaller than the average class and Hogwarts isn't the only school in Britain. To me the idea that the magical population has been around 2,000 plus years and that there is little to no population growth is crazy. They have magic to help with crops, hunting, healthcare and many other things so there is no reason the population would be so small.

Like you said Rowling's math wasn't great.

**** That's why I like the idea of a set, constant number of new magical births per year. It explains why the population isn't larger and sidesteps it being too small in the past

***** Ya that is fair. Maybe magic can only support so many users at any given time. It is weird because it seems like the average family has 1-3 kids so maybe the growth is just incredibly slow even taking into account muggleborns.

** The smallest it could possibly be is 9-10k via [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/numbers.htm][this guy's semi-canon reasoning]] but I headcanon it at 15k (18% Muggleborn, 37% Pureblood, 55% Halfblood. 2% of the pure and halfblood make up Squibs).

** As many as JK Rowling/You need there to be.

Now for Rowling that was as many as she needed at any given point, but a lot of writers and readers like more consistency then that, finding it in fanfiction when you can't find it in canon.

The main basis that most people use is Hogwarts. The population of Hogwarts is anywhere from 300-500 based on various estimates from canon indicators. While some notes or tweets or interviews mention upwards of 1000.

Based on populations, roughly adjusting for longer lifespan as well as population downturn due to three wars over the course of 40 years, a Hogwarts population of 300 only accounts for a British Wizarding population of a little more than 3000. Not quite the feeling that most people expect from the Magical World.

Popular adjustments are that the vast majority of magical children are home schooled and only some go to Hogwarts (due to cost, family ties, talent, whatever).

Or other magical schools exist in Britain, but Hogwarts is the premium school and not everyone can get in.

Or these other magical schools aren't boarding schools and a lot of parents prefer to keep their children at home.

Or a lot of British students attend school out of country

Or Harry is an unreliable narrator, and Hogwarts is significantly larger than described, with many students not being mentioned, and other teachers covering the same courses, Harry only talking about the teachers he has for all six years.

I have seen it done where the magical population really is that small and insular, and that its like a small backwards village, except the population is spread out in small groups around the country.

â€‹

Personally, I enjoy Hogwarts as written, with one teacher per subject as in canon. This requires a small school population in order for those teachers to handle the course load. So the 300-500 seems fine to me. I like to imagine that a lot of families homeschool, and that a lot of them send their kids to wizarding "public schools" where they can floo over for the day and come home at night. The teachers at these schools not being the experts like Snape or McGonagal, but still decent enough to get students through standardized OWLs. Adding a number of these public schools allows the population of magical Britain to jump up to a point where canon feels valid.

I still think that the small town level of wizarding population makes the most sense though. How big of a population can possibly be supported by two main shopping centers? 10 to 30 thousand witches and wizards spread over the country works for having a few population centers like people living above shops in Diagon Alley or offshoot Alleys, as well as in Hogsmeade, and then smaller groups off of already small muggle villages such as Ottery St Catchpole and Godrics Hollow. The rest scattered throughout the countryside and isolated homes in muggle areas.

*** I think the Harry is an unreliable narrator idea helps the most with this. The main character sees a much smaller sliver of the world compared to a normal person so naturally we wouldn't know a lot. For all we know there are multiple shopping areas, communities, schools etc but since Harry was never curious enough, through Rowling, we have no idea.

Most families in canon seem to have 1-3 kids so population growth would be slow but with the injection of muggleborns it would grow.

**** Population growth is the real issue I think. It just doesn't fit with the rest. The math can be made to work for 10s of thousands to hundreds of thousands of wizards existing in the 90, but it doesn't explain such a stagnant population. With longer lifespans, wizarding population should grow decently well. I know a number of fics use the "witches generally only have 1 child" and "inbreeding caused infertility" excuses, but a population this small in the 90s doesn't make sense. Inbreeding is avoidable in populations greater than 50, genetic drift at 500. Wizarding population should have outgrown muggle population given longer lifespans. The only explanation is regular wars that cull the population, or a natural population equilibrium that is balanced by the births of squibs and muggleborn.

***** Ya only thing I can think of is maybe on average 1/4 or so kids that are born to magical parents actually have magic themselves. So the kids we see at Hogwarts are the lucky ones. As for war those would have to be some big/frequent wars to constantly suppress the magical population for thousands of years. Maybe the witch trials in the middle ages did more damage than we thought and culled the population?

** First off it is difficult to estimate because of how inconsistent and horrible JKR is with numbers.

However we are led to believe that Hogwarts is the only magical school in UK. Considering that it has roughly 300-400 students (40 in Harry's year * 7 + round up a bit). Secondly wizards have only a single purely magical village, which is not even a town and a single proper shopping street in London. While I am sure there are magical corners, nooks and crannies all over the place, it is still telling.

11 to 17 year old are about 9% of the total population (in UK), however due to longevity of magicals we can probably halve that. With that in mind - about *10 thousand witches and wizards in UK* does sound realistic.

Add to that various other magical races (goblins, centaurs, hags, house elves, ...) who don't attend Hogwarts. However all these races appear to be a minority themselves.
