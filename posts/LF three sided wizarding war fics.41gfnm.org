Im looking for complete three sided war fics. example would be Harry's side (grey) Voldemort(dark) and Dumbledore(light).

EDIT!!! I feel I was unclear... I was merely giving an example. another example would be in Denarian Renegade. Harry is definitely dark and while he sides with dumbledore sometimes, he is not on the same side. that in my mind would be the same as a three sided war. Thanks for the recs so far tho, they look amazing.


** Linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) has a three-way conflict between Voldemort's followers, Dumbledore and his followers, and Harry, who is living in the Muggle world and is part of the military. It's good. :P

**** It's set before the tv series, so there's only one Slayer, though the Watchers have a couple wizards, as well as squibs (who can do the magic rituals from the tv show). They wouldn't last long in an open war against the Ministry - the Slayer got a frightening reputation among wizards, most think she's a myth from the time of the witch hunts, but it's mostly a bluff the Council used around the time of the Statute of Secrecy's implementation to keep the wizards from meddling with them.

The Ministry's still ignoring Voldemort's return as in canon. They got the numbers, but they are riddled with Death Eater sympathizers and idiots.

Voldemort is building up his forces as in canon, and recruiting demons of all kinds as well.

Dumbledore's more ruthless here than in canon, and prefers to take risks himself rather than risking his students. He also gets to show why he's the only one Voldemort ever feared.

Harry, Hermione and Ron have central roles, though the war's key decisions are made by Dumbledore and Travers.

** linkffn(The Reluctant Lord by SmallBurnyThing) does that and is a fun read, at least.

linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth) has Harry building his political and social connections independently of the Order. He and Dumbledore are still very much on the same side, but both have misgivings about each other. There is no third side, however.

Overall, I don't think I've seen a single fic like what you describe that doesn't mischaracterize and bash Dumbledore, and if there is, I'd like to know about it.

Basically, in canon, there is no "light" side as such. Rather, there are those who practice Dark Arts on the innocent and the helpless and who seek to deprive Muggleborns of magic; and there are those, like Amelia Bones and Albus Dumbledore, who fight them, often using ruthless and even Dark means. (Remember, Aurors were allowed to use Unforgivable's during Voldemort's first rise.)

Therefore, fics that explicitly postulate three sides (Dark, Light, and "Grey") have to be somewhat heavy AUs, but few writers go to the trouble to make the AU sufficiently rich and coherent to contain a good story. (For example, are there any where staying "Light" conveys very real advantages. Say, Grey!Harry starts practicing Dark Arts regularly and suddenly has to fight the horcrux in his scar for control of his mind, because his mother's love can no longer protect his tainted soul?)

Other three-sided fics? I'll search my library.

#+end_quote

Exactly. It's gotten to the point that I reflexively close the tab on any fic that refers to Dumbledore as the "Leader of the Light" or whatnot.

Though I disagree with you about three-sided fics being AUs. Canon itself has three explicit sides, especially in the first war. The Ministry and the Order of the Phoenix are not on the same side; they merely have a current common enemy whom they bypass and sometimes even actively work against each other to defeat (if they were truly on the same side, the OotP wouldn't have needed to be formed in the first place). And what we see of the Ministry is a heck of a lot greyer than what we see of the Order, from using dementors as jailers to sending people to Azkaban without a trial to the appalling way other magical beings and beasts are treated to using propaganda against a child (Harry).

Of course, the Ministry falls early in Deathly Hallows, returning the books to a two-sided battle, but just from the opening chapters it's pretty clear that while Scrimgeour would fight Voldemort tooth and nail if he'd lived, he would have also opposed Harry's (and by extension the Order's) independent involvement. I have a WIP where Harry takes Scrimgeour up on his implicit offer to work together at his 17th birthday party, alienating himself from the rest of the Order in the process.

#+end_quote

It's bashing if NewlyIndependent!Harry confronts Dumbledore and shouts his litany of ways Dumbledore has failed, while Dumbledore mumbles something about the Greater Good as he wilts under Harry's wrath, or, alternatively, screams invective at Harry and tries to attack him, usually failing; which is how it usually goes in these sorts of fics.

It's not bashing if Dumbledore calmly points out that if Harry didn't live with the Dursleys (with Dursleys freely choosing to let him live with them) he would probably be dead; that 4 Privet Drive was and is the only truly inviolable sanctuary from Voldemort and his agents; that, while Dumbledore might have been able to sequester Harry under guard, such a childhood would have been even more isolating than that of Dursleys, and far riskier, since, to paraphrase IRA's message to Margaret Thatcher, to keep Harry safe Dumbledore would have to get lucky every time, but a renegade Death Eater only had to get lucky once to kill him. (And, Dumbledore does kinda have other demands on his time.) He might also recount that at the time he had made this decision, the Order had been decimated from the war, its survivors exhausted, one of its most trusted members had just been revealed as a traitor, and Bellatrix and the Carrows were still at large; and later, many Death Eaters escaped justice.

He would point out that Harry has a mental link of a unique and unknown nature with the greatest Legilimens alive; and that if he weren't kept in the dark and Voldemort /were/ able to read his mind, it would have been a disaster. (And, he might also note that, in retrospect, that the reason Voldemort couldn't do it was that being in contact with Harry's pure and loving soul hurt him more than he could stand --- and that the "Grey" path would have robbed him of that protection.)

He would also explain that while Harry is a talented young wizard, there was no way he could be trained up, in a decade and a half, if ever, to fight Voldemort --- an out and out genius, with decades of experience --- in a pitched battle. And, that being able to inflict violence using magic was a Power Voldemort Knows Better Than Anyone. Whereas, the Power He Knows Not --- love, honest friendship, kindness --- cannot be trained: they can only be /cultivated/ through having deep friendships, helping and being helped by them, hanging out and arguing, playing on a Quiddich team, wronging and being wronged, forgiving and being forgiven, dating and having one's heart broken. Which of those should be given up in favor of combat training?

As for sacrifice, he might explain that as long as Voldemort lives, Harry will be in danger, and Harry's life is keeping Voldemort alive. Yet, Dumbledore did all he could to set it up so that Harry could live anyway. (Of course, now that Harry knows, they'd have to find a different strategy. Maybe Harry would consent to being Obliviated?)

To say that Dumbledore hadn't looked --- off screen, since it didn't involve Harry directly --- for other ways to remove the horcrux from his scar, is an interpretation of Dumbledore so uncharitable that I believe that it counts as bashing.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Dumbledore is a man with many responsibilities who fears his own power, and rightly so; and I think that he would freely acknowledge that he is not a paragon of anything. However, he does the best he can with what he has --- because you don't just throw away the protection offered by magic that has just slain one of the most powerful wizards alive by stopping and reflecting an unstoppable curse, subject to not becoming Dark Lord Dumbledore and not leaving behind a society where Might Makes Right.

***** Yeah right, Dumbledore can cast the FIDELIUS at well and be the secret keeper, much better than those despicable Dursleys (If I'd have been Harry, I'd have mailed Voldemort their address, so that he can kill them or arrange an accident while they are not at the house (those wards shield the property as far as I remember, not the individual Dursley))

I agree that the confrontations aren't really well done in most fictions (sadly enough)

Back to the Dursleys: Dumbledore could have created another Tom Riddle by leaving Harry there, so he's quite stupid IMHO (or neglectful!)

Yeah "other demand on his time" - you could say he's stretched himself too thin (taking on 3 important positions and not wanting to give any of them up -.-)

Yeah, metaphysical nonsense (sorry, but IMHO it was Harry's willpower (he doesn't even react to the Imperius-Curse so he's got tons of that) that forced Voldemort out, not any love or any such hogwash -.- (that's Dumbledore-speak)) and even if it was true:

Harry's "friendships" are a sham (remember 4th year or Harry using the Prince's potions book!), too Ron is a hanger on who wants some partake in Harry's glory (Mirror of Erised anyone - and worse, he even got his wish: How else would Ron have ever become a prefect? Even Neville or Dean were better candidates. Being friends with him also drags Harry down, he adopts Ron's attitude towards learning, when normally someone offered to learn magic would probably try to be the best student they can be!) and Hermione, while surely useful/helpful just sticks around because she really does not have other friends (and she doesn't act much like a friend, more like a damned mother with her being bossy and being a nag etc.)

Well, Harry would have had to be lucky only once, too (and have element of surprise on his side) - give him a huge dose of Felix Felicis and teach him how to cast a damned Killing-Curse...or teach him magic so obscure (or from other countries) that Voldemort does not now and therefore can't counter easily -.-)

Why not bash him, being an accessory to child neglect/abuse (hell, I'd love to know if he even had the authority to place Harry with the Dursleys or if he overstepped his authority!) warrants some bashing IMHO

Where do you get that? - I think Dumbledore LIKES his power (hell: revels in it!)!

No, he does not the best he can, he does what is easy in most cases (stick Harry with the Dursleys and not check up on him (He doesn't even send REMUS (!), let Harry be bullied (Heir of Slytherin, "Potter Stinks"-Buttons etc.), Media-Slandering, Torture with blood-quill in the school under his nose (ok: Professor McGonagall and the others are guilty here, too but he's the headmaster, so it's on his watch!))

It's not even conclusively proven that the protection reflected the curse (!) - it could have easily been fate (I mean there must have been more parents who sacrificed themselves for their children -.-) in this case: The prophecy (Voldy must mark him, he hasn't done so, so he can't kill him yet - or: He's not Voldemort's equal yet, so he can't be killed by him yet?)

You could make a good case for Dumbledore to be an uncaring puppet-master, so in essence he could very well be a Dark-Lord!

Harry is important, but he isn't more important than raising the next generation of wizards into competent and decent human beings as Headmaster; trying to steer the British wizarding society, with its complacency and gullibility, away from doing something irreversibly stupid; and guiding the international community which is probably even worse.

Nonsense? It's a theme that pervades the whole damned series, starting with "Power that He Knows Not".

I don't think Imperius resistance is the same thing. Imperius is euphoric, "floating", gentle persuasion that subverts will rather than crushing it. (It's what makes it so insidious.) What saves Harry is instinctive stubbornness and rejection of authority regardless of consequences.

Just to name a few: PS: Ron sacrifices himself so that Harry and Hermione could go on; PoA: stands up on a broken leg to tell a (he thought) mass-murdering Death Eater that to get to Harry, he would have to go through him; DH: a pureblood who could have sat out the war, sticks with Harry throughout, and it takes a horcrux around his neck to give him a bare moment of weakness. Harry could have done with more "hangers-on" like that. I think that Ron can be forgiven a teenage tantrum when he thought that Harry was holding out on him. Friends forgive friends.

Re: Prince's potions book: Hermione not appreciating academic cheating even if it's her friends doing it? Who knew?

Anyway, yes, that's friends. Friends help each other, friends argue with each other, friends sometimes hurt each other, and friends forgive each other. That's what distinguishes them from minions. It's almost like you /want/ Harry to have been more like Riddle. If so, what are you complaining about with respect to Dumbledore?

Re: prefect Ron: Neville could barely do magic until OotP and we know almost nothing about Dean. Ron is probably the second-best male wizard in his year from his OWL scores. And, would Harry have been able to actually perform prefect duties with all the things he faced and was doing?

#+begin_quote

The nice thing about magic is that you need to work /less/ to survive and even thrive than a Muggle would. If you want to dominate like Voldemort or crusade for the greater good (both capitalized and not) like Hermione and Dumbledore or find joy in applying your magic in clever ways like the Weasley Twins and the Marauders or fight for respect and recognition despite your humble roots like Snape, you have the option of working harder and getting more out of it. You might notice that many of these people weren't pleasant to be around and even downright dangerous. (Cedric was nice, I guess.)

Not everybody who gets a smartphone when they're 11 get inspired to become computer programmers or electrical engineers or even use all of the features that they could. The same holds for most Muggleborns and Harry. Ron has little to do with it.

#+begin_quote
  and Hermione, ... really does not have other friends
#+end_quote

Given the group she was able to gather in OotP, she seems to get along with people from other Houses off-screen. And, nagging people to be better wizards and better people is how Hermione expresses friendship.

Also, "bossy"? In fanfics where Harry behaves like that and worse, they call it "leadership" and the ladies love it.

#+begin_quote
  Well, Harry would have had to be lucky only once, too ...
#+end_quote

Speaking of Felix Felicis, that sounds like a /great/ way for a Death Eater to assassinate Harry under Fidelius. Just the thing to help him or her locate someone who's in on the secret, to help him or her cast the best Imperius ever, etc.... And, if that doesn't work, Felix can help them intuit or stumble onto an even better plan! Good thing epic magic like Sacrificial Protection probably trumps Felix Felicis, huh?

And, repeated uses of Felix Felicis are toxic, so it doesn't work as an ongoing defense.

If it were that easy, Dumbledore could have taken Felix and gone after Voldemort himself. It may help Harry escape, but win? And, even if he does, there are Horcruxes.

Well, with Sirius in prison, it may well have been the case that Harry's closest magical relatives were the Malfoys, or some other random wizarding family.

He does? He could have stayed with Grindelwald and co-ruled the world both magical and Muggle; he could have become the Minister of Magic; he could have probably just plain taken over the way Voldemort had, any time Voldemort wasn't active; and he could have probably had Lucius Malfoy assassinated after CoS, if he really wanted to. He did none of this. He didn't smite Fudge when Fudge doesn't do as he wants: rather, he tried to persuade. He rejected the Ministry's authority to arrest him, but he did go into exile rather than burn down the ministry. Does this sound like someone who likes power?

  No, he does not the best he can, he does what is easy in most cases (stick Harry with the Dursleys and not check up on him (He doesn't even send REMUS (!),
#+end_quote

Where are you getting this? Remus was too busy wallowing --- I don't think Dumbledore encouraged or discouraged him. (Got canon evidence?) Dumbledore did have Arabella Figg watching Harry. Yes, he knew that Harry's childhood sucked, but it was the least bad option with respect to keeping him alive.

#+begin_quote
  let Harry be bullied (Heir of Slytherin, "Potter Stinks"-Buttons etc.),
#+end_quote

Would he have benefited from or even appreciated Dumbledore's intervention at that point? Frankly, I thought the end-of-year point-dumps probably hurt his ability to help Harry in this. (A Dumbledore who speaks up for Harry after having shown favoritism to him before is a Dumbledore who is much less credible.) For example, Heir of Slytherin was about Harry being feared. Do you think Dumbledore could have stopped people from fearing him?

#+begin_quote
  Media-Slandering,
#+end_quote

And, how do you propose for him to stop the press from libeling him? Sue them with no non-secret evidence? Threaten them with violence?

#+begin_quote
  Torture with blood-quill in the school under his nose
#+end_quote

The very same instinctive stubbornness that lets Harry resist the Imperius also kept him from keeping a low profile when it was wise to do so. Dumbledore's intercession would have been politicized, and in a political clash between Dumbledore and Umbridge at that point, Dumbledore would have probably lost his seat. So, his choice was to lose his seat to little gain or go Dark Lord Dumbledore. When Dumbldeore did quit Hogwarts, it was to keep Harry from being outright expelled.

#+begin_quote
  It's not even conclusively proven that the protection reflected the curse (!) - it could have easily been fate (I mean there must have been more parents who sacrificed themselves for their children -.-)
#+end_quote

When both Dumbledore and Voldemort agree on something being a fact, it's probably true unless there is a lot of evidence against it. In particular, usually, those who are out to kill children don't offer to spare the parents if they step aside.

Prophecy has little power of its own, except to drive those who hear it into action. Dumbledore said explicitly that most of them don't come true (which is an empirical claim, so if it's not true, he had to be outright lying), and it was only Voldemort's choice to act on the prophecy that gave it power over him.

#+begin_quote
  a good case for Dumbledore to be an uncaring puppet-master
#+end_quote

Only a very poor case. If he is a puppet-master, then to what end? He risked, even sacrificed himself to give others --- Harry in particular --- a chance to kill Voldemort, and did his best to make it so that Harry could do so and live despite being one of the things keeping Voldemort alive.

** The best three way war fic must be the *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185). [[/spoiler][Unlike most stories, even the muggle world was significantly AU. Most of actions took place after 2008, and three major sides were Harry, Order of the Phoenix under Nicholas Flamel/Ginny Weasley, and Death Eaters under Voldemort/Lucius Malfoy. All sides were ruthless, competent, and capable of mass murders. By 2018, Voldemort had abandoned death eaters and seemed more interested in controlling muggle governments directly, and Ginny had fallen out with Flamel.
