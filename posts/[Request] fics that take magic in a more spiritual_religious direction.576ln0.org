  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

**** It is weird, riveting, maddening and /dark/. Dark as in, it will twist your insides, nothing to do with magic. Thinking about it years later, what this fic does, is follow the consequences of horrific child abuse to their (super)natural conclusion. Almost a deconstruction of the abused!Harry trope.

** Fics with religion are going to end up two ways:

One, really good with only borrowing things from religion.

Two, super priest dude that will cuss you out for saying anything bad about their god. Seriously, some religious people can get annoying.
