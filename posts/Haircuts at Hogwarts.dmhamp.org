This is just an interesting little thought I had.

So the school year runs from September to June with the only times for students to go home being Christmas and Easter breaks (according to the Fandom wiki article). Either way it is a boarding school and the question arises of how the students get haircuts.

For upper years the answer is easy: there are probably hair styling and grooming charms, but what about first years? It seems unlikely to me that they would be able to do these charms and yet they also can't just let their hair grow for 2-3 months before having to chance to get it cut at home.

The options I see are:

1. The Head of House or Madam Pomfrey handles it.
2. Older students are expected to help.
3. There is some sort of enchanted object that does it - although this creates a problem for muggleborns.
4. Hogsmeade has a barber, who I guess comes up to the castle since first years aren't allowed to visit the village.

Any other ideas?


** I think the House prefects have that as one of their duties, though they can recruit others to take care of it if their Charms skills are lacking.

Watching the style changes in the movies, you almost get the sense that the Gryffindor experts all left school after Harry's third year, and Ron took over when he became prefect, though his style options were very limited and basic.\\

* Hermione proved barely competent at it when she and Harry were alone during the secret camping trip

Fuck. Why does this make so much sense?

** A magical hat just like sorting hat. Reads your mind to know what style you want. Simple and effective.

** Maybe the elves trim their hair while the students are asleep.

That's not the least bit creepy.

** Most likely, there are spells for it. Spells invented by barbers and such, sold for outrageous prices, which cut and style your hair in a specific way. There's probably even a charm to fix your hair into one specific position, so it always slowly reverts back to the state it was in when you cast it.

So barbering is literally just casting two spells and done.

** Every student cuts their own hair as they brew their secret, illegal stashes of Polyjuice Potion. Hell, it's a challenge to keep presentable amounts of hair. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are actually quite unique in that they only did that once - it's normally every week, with rotating batches, for all the other students. They're lucky they got Crabbe and Goyle in their own bodies. I understand Parvati had to apologize for weeks to Neville after she got in trouble trying to stop Harry and co. from losing more House points in first year - she had to give him all her Cho Chang-impersonation time slots for the next year before he forgave her.

On the other hand, Malfoy's Patronus Charm was really benefited by all those times he attended DA sessions as Zacharias Smith.

**** In the 7th horcrux, Harry/Voldemort keeps himself under the imperious at all times, so that no one else can imperious him.

Maybe with polyjuicing as yourself, any hairs someone steals from you wouldn't work in a polyjuice potion, preventing anyone from impersonating you.

***** Now I want to read a story where Harry goes back in time to his fourth year and tries to expose Moody, showing the his flask is full of polyjuice, but it's not actually Barty crouch jr. It's just Moody polyjuicing himself into himself.

** I kind of see a little chamber near the kitchens that's manned by one tiny house elf with the sharpest barber knife known to mankind and wizardkind with a grumpy personality to match. Outside, on Saturday mornings, the queue to get a haircut or shave is massive.

** Well, there is a possible implication that, like Harry during his time with the Dursleys, wizards and even younger children can subconsciously control physical aspects of their bodies like hair length or nails. For larger endeavors they probably need something more nuanced (ex. hair-growth potion), but as magic seems to be partly directed by both conscious and subconscious intent, its entirely possible that they don't /need/ haircuts unless they are going to do something large (like Charlie having to almost completely regrow his hair after Mrs. Weasley cut it).

Thats kind of how I see Hogwarts actually: there are some rules that students must follow, they can be punished for breaking them, but as long as they follow those criterion the school/teachers allow the students to manage themselves accordingly. I mean, they let Harry and co. travel to Hagrid's often, despite knowing the general danger associated with that. Students swim in the lake with a Giant Squid and are often otherwise unsupervised.

The message seems pretty clear to me: follow the rules, turn in your homework, don't get out of hand, and you have free reign.

** My headcanon is that Harry's hair is always the same length, that the Weasley's get their hair cut at home and that many others don't get haircuts while at Hogwarts during term.
