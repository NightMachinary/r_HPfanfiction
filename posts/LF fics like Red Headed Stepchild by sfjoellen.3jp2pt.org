The fic involves a couple of idea that I find really cool right now. LF fics that emphasize one or more of these elements:

1) People at Hogwarts band together against the purebloods pushing the school into anarchy

2) The use of mundane weaponry with magic by the opposition against purebloods

3) the 'light' being brutal in its vigilante justice

4) Gender-transformation

While this particular story is not quite well-written and contains far too many cliches standard to the overpowered!Harry trope, are there others out there that do it better?

** Have you read Saint Potter? James didn't marry Lily, Harry is born female and her great grandfather was the vigilante [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Templar][The Saint]].

Starts with linkffn(7883569) with additional offshoots from different viewpoints. Very slow updates unfortunately.

  Sophie Theresa Potter. Grandfather/guardian: Seamus Tombs. Parents: James and Selene Potter, deceased, purportedly in a gas-explosion, Hallowe'en 1981 - except it turns out that actually they were killed in a battle with dark wizards, that Sophie is a witch, and that one 'Albus Dumbledore' wants her at his school and isn't likely to take 'no' as an answer. Alternate Universe.

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.
