I recently read The Changeling by Annerb on ao3 and it was just so amazing that it totally introduced me to a new type of fic in this fandom that I'm now craving. So, does anyone know of any 15k+ word fics with the main character either being Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Fleur, or Lily? Preferable during their school years. I don't read non-magic AUs. Most important is that romance can't be more than a very minor element of the fic, whatever the ship.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

The first fic is 530k+ words, and fantastic writing. Key difference is Hermione is a genius, but especially at maths, and therefore Arithmancy, and it takes off from there. Highly recommend.

** i loved the changeling too!

haven't really come across anything else like it, but if you are looking for female character centric fics, there's an awesome series of one shots written by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/dirgewithoutmusic/pseuds/dirgewithoutmusic][dirgewithoutmusic]] on ao3 that covers the experiences of a lot of the female characters in the potterverse.

It's called [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/136245][we must unite inside her walls or we'll crumble from within]]

** Here's a few that haven't been mentioned yet:

- [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][/Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire/]] by Coulsdon Eagle. Originally published on porkey, due to some magic, Hermione's name comes out of the goblet instead of Harry's. It's Harry/Hermione, but that's not really the focus of the story. Hermione is the main character. I really enjoyed it. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]]

- /Resistance/ by lorien829. Hermione-centric in a world where Voldemort won the last battle. She goes on to be bad ass. Again, HHr, but done very well. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance]])

- /Notebooks and Letters/ by chem prof. Probably the most romance-focused story on this list. It's Hermione telling her daughter the "true story" years after the fact. Very HHr. If you don't want any romance, this one isn't for you. But otherwise, this is the first real HHr story I read and it showed me that the pairing could work. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3867175/1/Notebooks-and-Letters]])

- /Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus/ by The Carnivorous Muffin. It's a fem!Harry with godlike powers and a rather unique and interesting story. Worth reading. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus]])

- /A Question of When/ by vlad the inhaler. Romilda Vane is the main character, and while the story is focused on her pursuit of Harry, I don't think I would call this a romance. Time travel is a big element. It's also short, a one-shot with only 5,800 words. But it's /very/ good. Worth reading. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407725/1/A-Question-of-When]])

And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

** These tend to be the types of fics I enjoy.

Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass linkffn(12188150) is a Harry/Tonks fic where Tonks goes back in time and poses as a student. It is very character centric, and I think would hit your criteria well.

​

Escape linkffn(11916243) is a Harry/Hermione fic where Hermione decides to run away to America and drags Harry along. The romance is important, but not the basis of the story (It is mostly an adventure).

​

A Little Child Shall Lead Them is entirely Hermione centric linkffn(10871795). However it is not set during the school years, it is set during the... baby years. ... yeaaaa... Trust me, it is worth reading...
