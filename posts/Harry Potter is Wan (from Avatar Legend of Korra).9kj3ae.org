Harry gets dropped or is reborn in the Avatar world and takes on the name Wan. He doesn't have a wand and as per canon wandless magic is too difficult for him. He gets in trouble as usual, puts his nose where he doesn't belong, releases the dark spirit thing, and eventually follows what we know of the story to become the first Avatar.

*** True... but HP fan fiction seems to be more popular.

** What makes this a Harry Potter fic then, if said Harry Potter is unable to do Magic?

*** It's more the character/personality of Harry. Also, Wan is kind of similar to Harry - they see a problem, try to solve it only to get into a lot of trouble, and stumble head first into a situation they have no business being anywhere near. Also, it would make sense that the only person capable of bending all four elements would be someone built for magic. I'm thinking he won't have magic simply because the Avatar world wouldn't have magic the way Harry's world does, like magic as an element would not exist.
