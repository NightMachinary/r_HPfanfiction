  This is him. I keep telling myself, This bloody IS him. Or should it be This bloody is HIM. Either way, it's hard for me to believe what is in my sight right now. He's turning around. To me.

  He wasn't sure how. He wasn't sure when. But it had become difficult to tell the monsters from the men.   One shot. Nominated for a Judges' Pick in Season Five of the Quidditch League Fanfiction Competition.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407442/1/Luna-Lovegood-and-the-Dark-Lord-s-Diary][Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary]] by The madness in me is one of the most amusing stories I have ever encountered. It's surprisingly well written despite what format the author had chosen. Anyways, it involves Luna getting her hands on Tom Riddle's diary instead of Ginny. linkffn(12407442)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12490736/1/Come-Together][Come Together]] by oniforever. I still have no clue how many times I've recommend this one to others, but I will do it again. This is a crossover fic with Captain America: The First Avengers. It's where sixteen year old Tom somehow ended up fighting alongside the Allies in World War 2. linkffn(12490736)

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasly looses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane.

  It begins in 1943. Tom Riddle searches for his place in the world, and ends up getting captured by HYDRA. After being saved by a crazy muggle in spandex, he must learn to adapt to the new playing field, and have some odd friendships along the way. AU. Soldier!Tom Riddle. No pairings. Starts in CA:TFA but will spread to the other films.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11663343/1/The-Ouroboros][The Ouroboros]] by lokilette is a particularly unique fic. It's where Tom is reborn into James Sirius Potter after getting tangled with the one known as Death. It's his consequence for his past transgressions so to speak. linkffn(11663343)

#+begin_quote
  Tired of human stupidity, Death decides to teach those who sought to be Masters of Death a lesson. Thinly veiled as a favor, Death offers Tom Riddle a second chance, the opportunity to be born again and live a new life. Some things are just too good to be true, and Tom soon learns there's a catch. There always is. Rated T for swearing.
