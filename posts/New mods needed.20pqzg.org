** I guess I'll throw my hat in the ring. I comment here fairly often and I read a lot of fanfic, like /a lot/. I beta one as well. I also have experience moderating/running online communities (a WoW guild). I like the ideas [[/u/zhiyu]] mentioned and would definitely be up to helping them implement them. I'm also a web developer, I could see about creating a custom style for the subreddit.

** Hey [[/u/AccioInternets]],

I'm really interested in being a moderator for this subreddit! I have a lot of plans, specifically plans to give the subreddit a custom style and flair. I currently moderate [[/r/Terraria]], a community of over 40,000 users so I have plenty experience when it comes to actually moderating a subreddit.

However, I feel like that pales in comparison when it comes to my absolute passion for fanfiction. I love fanfiction, I read it all the time. I actually read more fanfiction than I do regular published works.

I consider myself rather impartial when it comes to disagreements and I try my best to look at both sides of an argument, a skill I believe is vital when moderating any community.

I would love to introduce monthly or even weekly events or 'book clubs' to help bring old users back and bring in new users as well in an effort to keep things fresh.

All in all I'm very excited at the opportunity to become a moderator and I hope you agree with me!

** Hello,

I am interested in becoming a moderator here! I only discovered this subreddit recently but I believe it is a good place to both discuss and discover fanfiction amongst like minded peers (at least for me because I don't know anyone else that reads fanfiction). I've been an avid reader since 2007 and so I have knowledge of the past and have kept up with the evolution of the genres over the years. Some ideas to improve this subreddit might be to host weekly/monthly recommended fics, suggested by the community. Another idea may be to develop a repository of highly recommended fanfiction, again suggested by the community, which will allow new viewers of the subreddit to quickly find some of the best works and hopefully develop their interest in fanfiction!

Thanks for your consideration.

** I would also like to volunteer to be a mod of this sub. I have another account for my primary reddit posting, reserving this one solely for [[/r/HPfanfiction]] posting.

With respect to the fandom, I've written more than twenty stories of Harry Potter fanfiction (though I've never shared my author identity here), including a novel-length piece with nearly 2k reviews; I've also beta-read for several notable popular fanfiction authors who are cited frequently here. I have been reading HP fanfiction avidly since 2004 and have a good sense of the history of the fandom. My post history here should indicate my overall taste in stories: I'm not big into ships and gravitate toward somewhat darker stories with a good bit of literary polish, preferably ones with adult characters.

** I'll just throw my name into the hat for consideration I suppose. I read a lot of fanfiction for Harry Potter, wether its a crossover or just straight Harry Potter. If someone's needed, I would be glad to do it.

** I spend a bit of time on here and reading fanfictions. I don't have much else to do these days so I am willing to help out. I have run several pages as a mod before so I have a little experience there. Ultimately I just want to help this subreddit because I'm always looking for new fanfics.

** I'll toss my hat in the ring! I've been involved in the fandom and fic since I was 13 (so... almost 11 years, wow). I write a lot and read even more. I'm pretty rad, really!

** I am interested in doing it, because I spend most of my reddit time here. I post a lot (for this reddit) and I think I can be fair to whatever problems come up here (which is like never.).

** I'm happy to volunteer. I am good at locating old fics by plot when people request them. I have read a great deal of fanfiction, first from 99-2004, then from 2010-present. I check reddit multiple times per day. I will remain fair and impartial in case a fight/drama breaks out, and have a great deal of tolerance for all the different sorts of fanfic fans.

I have a number of ideas for the sub that I'd love to implement, but they seemed inappropriate/demanding/a lot of work just as suggestions: Weekly threads about all updates to various fics, making a sticky "book club" thread (two attempts at having a club have been attempted), perhaps some goofy fanfic related flair (Evil!Harry, My Immortal, Mary Sue, A Ship, A Sinking Ship, Snape with a Halo), thread tags for easy sorting, a revamped sidebar (link to [[/r/fanfiction]] and the tvtropes recs page at least).

So yeah, I'd be happy to volunteer.

** I'll toss my hat in. I think I'd be good for this. Literally read some HP fanfiction every day. Currently writing my own snape/of story as well. It'd be cool to have this sub pose questions about different fics. I'd love to see this sub be more active in general, aside from the random question about a specific fic or ship.

** I am more than willing to be a mod. I've been reading HP fanfiction for years and am even in the process of writing my own. I am also pretty strict when it comes to rules but can be lenient if necessary. I am also willing to work with other mods about any ideas they may have or if one of the subscribers post an idea I'll look into it and talk it over with the other mods.

** I'll volunteer! I'm a validator at one of the moderated fanfic sites. (PM me and I'll give you proof - I use a different name here.) I'm a beta and writer as well. I have no experience running websites or online communities, but I am a quick learner.
