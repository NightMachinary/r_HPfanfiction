* Hi, HPFF!
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: hi-hpff
  :END:
I know you probably don't know me. (Those on Discord will recognize me, hopefully!) My name's Pony and I recently approached the mods of this subreddit to take over the wiki, especially after seeing Psantium_ disappear again. A moment of silence for them, please.

To share a bit about me: I am impressively active in [[/r/HarryPotter][r/HarryPotter]] and the corresponding common rooms. I am an Eagle (Ravenclaw!) at heart. I'm a professor over there as well, so I'm responsible for creating extra credit assignments people can participate in if they so choose. I'm an English major and while I love to write, I don't think I'll be an HP fanfic author for a while yet. That being said, I devour fanfic like crazy - this community has been great for discovery so far. I want to make it even better!

My only mod permissions are for the wiki and modmail. I will not be doing any other content moderation on this subreddit. (No mod aboose here!)

* Goals
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: goals
  :END:
Primarily, I want to be as transparent with you in this process as possible. I want to make the wiki what the community /wants/, not what I think it should be. So, I will be making threads (again) to get a feel for what you want.

*ETA:* You will likely see some of the wiki pages completely disappear over the next....however long while I start work. Please don't be alarmed. Consider the wiki closed for renovations!

* To-Do List
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: to-do-list
  :END:

- Have the wiki host the fic information instead of linking to massive reddit threads

- Maintain the user-curated lists (such as Taure's Best Of) and link back to the OC

- Update the book club archives and maintain the book club on a regular/semi-regular basis

- Update the Writing Center to be actually useful

- Create an FAQ for the subreddit that answers the threads like pet peeves, ship names, etc. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9f92ia/the_third_installment_of_the_wiki_project_begins/e5v0rum/][Post FAQ suggestions as a reply to this comment.]]

- Create a new monthly megathread: *WATCHLIST* - new, currently updating fics that show a lot of promise!

- Reorganize everything so it makes sense

* Book Club
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: book-club
  :END:
I am taking over Book Club for the foreseeable future. More information will be coming soon. Thanks for being patient while I transition into this stuff :)

*[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/index#wiki_book_club_threads][New Book Club Rules can be found here.]]* We will be resuming in October with the current "next" fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment][Realignment by PuzzleSB]]

Submit fics [[https://goo.gl/forms/y60X6vHRLwFTFfYq2][here]]!

* Your Turn!
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: your-turn
  :END:
If there is something /missing/ from this to-do list that you would like to see implemented, please toss it below. Let me know what you want to see. I repeat: *this wiki is for the subreddit, not for me.* Therefore, I want you to have an input in everything that goes into it.

--------------

I will keep you all updated on the progress of this wiki as I keep going. I'm hopeful this will become a great resource for the subreddit in the future!

*I do not know what happened to Psantium_. Please send some good thoughts their way and hope they will make their way back to us again.*

**** Perhaps add a short information on what we would/would not beta. I would definitely be down for some beta work, but if someone asks me to beta their Harry/Snape fanfic, the one thing I would be adamant about changing would be the pairing. Or make Harry less powerful in OP Harry fics.

** Maybe something separate for prompts so that there's something where people can quickly look up the latest/most popular prompts from around here (Lavender as fourth Champion, Andromeda as Mafia Boss, the imposter founder portrait).

Also, while on the subject, perhaps hold monthly writing challenges with ideas which are popular around here (trope subversion like Not Ice Queen Daphne or Harry being wrong about manipulative Dumbledore, positive depictions of Lavender, a real Harry&Hermione friendship which stays true to their characters, Golden Trio Triads).

If manpower is the issue, I have time to spare.

A prompts list will likely live inside the *Writing Center*.

For now I am going to focus on reorganizing the wiki, but I think some weekly or monthly megathreads would be a GREAT addition to the subreddit. I will hold onto these ideas.
