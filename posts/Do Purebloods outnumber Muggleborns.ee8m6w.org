What is the population of Muggleborns? [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/numbers.htm][Following this write-up of the wizarding world's total population]] and increasing it slightly to around twelve thousand for the sake of diversity (with Muggles outnumbering wizards 5500:1). If most wizards are half-blood (50%+), what would the remaining demographics be? 25%/25% doesn't seem to fit, but making either group larger than the other doesn't work either. Purebloods are dying out in canon, but Muggleborns aren't overly populous either. The Muggleborn population would have to be populous enough to be a threat to the Pureblood faction, but small enough to be oppressed (a la linkffn(A Wizard's Guide To 'Banking')) Thoughts?

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

** Yeah, it's a weird setup. My sense is that wizards have had their [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition][demographic transition]] centuries, perhaps millennia ago, so their population has been stable for a long time; but that would mean that the Muggle-Wizard ratio has increased dramatically over the past century or two, so you'd have more Muggleborns relative to wizardborns than historically; but there are so few of them now, why would they even be on Salazar's radar back at the Hogwarts's founding?

One possibility might be the Statute of Secrecy: before it, wizards interbred with Muggles much more---and that included "illegitimate" children, who would show up as "muggleborn". After the statute, the frequency of wizard genes (however defined) in the Muggle pool dropped. This would be because any Muggleborn (or illegitimate half-blood) would get snatched up and assimilated into the wizard society, removing their genes from the Muggle gene pool. So, while there are more Muggles relative to wizards, their individual chances of producing a Muggleborn are much lower.

** By what metric? Canon/the books? In that case, Rowling's classlist is representative, so you get a ratio of 40:40:20 pureblood:halfblood:muggleborn (with the "official" definition of pureblood, so all magical grandparents, not whatever the Malfoys would postulate).

In any other case: Whatever you want to make up.

*** If the official definition is all your grandparents are magical, then Harry and Ginny's kids are pureblood, while Ron and Hermione's are halfblood?

**** That would be the implication, yes. But I'd venture it's all sorts of confusing in practice -- see the Sirius quote OP referenced, about how there are little "purebloods" left. That has to be some other kind of definition, in which a pureblood family is one that only ever married other purebloods (or was skillful in hiding outliers), and of course by that definition, the Potters aren't Purebloods and won't be for a long while.

And then, finally, you can make a case that some care more about /family history/ than actual "pure blood", so the name Potter having been around for centuries makes Harry a "pureblood" by virtue of his name.

** If you go by the common definition of pure-blood = all-magical grandparents, then the vast majority of wizards would be pure-bloods. Consider the example of Lily Potter: her son was a half-blood, her grandchildren are pure-bloods. So the "impurity" which a Muggleborn introduces into a family disappears after a single generation, unless the children go and marry another Muggle/Muggleborn.

** I generally think of “pureblood” as having a few different definitions: the most liberal, where it's just a child of two magicals; the most conservative, where it's someone with no muggle ancestry at all (supposedly); and the compromise position of all-magical grandparents which is sometimes mentioned by Rowling.

In the sense of simply having two magical parents, they are probably a very significant majority; I can't imagine muggle-magical relationships being common (something like Dean's parents' situation would be the usual story, I expect), so it would just come down to the incoming muggleborns of the generation. That doesn't prevent purebloods from “dying out” in the traditionalist sense, though---with the population explosion and vanishing gap in material conditions between worlds it seems very likely that people would care less and less about purging their family tree in the way that is needed to maintain a pureblood image. There might only be a few families left doing that by the start of canon.

I can't find the calculations I used but I believe I went with a ~10% muggleborn ratio based on Hogwarts students, with that being a relatively recent development (it used to be lower). Children of muggles and magicals would be very rare, so halfbloods by the grandparent rule would be ~30% or so. This means the world is 60% ‘pureblood,' which explains the general apathy towards muggleborn rights we see in canon, but again most of them don't care about their family history like the Blacks and Malfoys. This matches decently closely to an obvious real world equivalent---white people have an outright majority in many countries, and as such racial issues often go unaddressed, but outright white supremacy is still relatively rare.

** The number of muggleborns actually named in the books is really small. When you consider just the ones that go to Hogwarts while Harry is there, it's even smaller. The ones named in Harry's year can be counted on one hand.

*** I went off Sirius' statement to Harry in OotP.

"The pure-blood families are all interrelated. If you're only going to let your sons and daughters marry pure-bloods, your choice is very limited; there are hardly any of us left."

** Size of wizarding world was unknown. If we go by canon 40 people per year then total population would be around 3000. Which was not viable. Seperate government, currency, war and schools for 3000 people? That would be complete failure.

I always assume there were 500k wizards in Britain. Neither big nor small.

** "10 generations pure" are pretty rare, only a few inbred families. "all 4 grandparents magical" are a lot more common and call themselves pure whenever it suits them. Those and halfbloods (not pure but at least one magical parent) make up the majority of the population, while muggleborns with no close magical ancestry at all are also quite rare.
