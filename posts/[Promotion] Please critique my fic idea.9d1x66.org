** I think that this is a great idea but may be a bit overly ambitious for a first story. I think this is a great idea and should be pursued and just from looking at what you've shared you have poured quite a bit of passion into this and just that fact will make the story better.

I hope it goes well

** Ambitious doesn't begin to cover this for a first story. You're going to be walking a tightrope of tropes the whole time.

Person vs person conflict is much easier to write than person vs inner self. Inner self is a dangerous place to go because its easy to drown your reader in angst. Human nature and all that is complicated and somewhat controversial and now you want to bring werewolves into it? In canon, Lupins is the only werewolf we see that isn't a monster. On that note, it makes perfect sense to use Greyback as your antagonist. Its not lazy at all. We have an established monster who we know goes after children. We know very little about Greyback, there is still a lot of work for you to do in building him as a villain.

Beatrice gets in the way of Harry's rivalry with Draco by antagonizing him even more. She would likely take interest in protecting Neville (who I love dearly, can't get enough neville) due to a combination of Hufflepuff tendencies and anger management issues. - Doesn't she have enough to deal with? You have an interesting side plot that can work along side canon. There is so much to be explored. If you want to write a good story avoid this. If you're writing because you have some wish fulfilment plan you want to write then keep it.

OCs are iffy. Your OC stands a chance if you keep the story as a subplot of the major HP plot. Wade into canon events and your OC becomes Draco's twin sister who knows all about muggles and isn't evil at all or Harry's twin sister who marries malfoy because he's just misunderstood. Avoid those. The more your OC can stand on her own two feet the better.

Now, fanficition in general. People are idiots but they still have no obligation to read your story. Your reader numbers could be crap despite the hours you put in. Just check out linkffn(13050311) (betrayed), compare those numbers against the fantastic linkffn(12631584). Quality means nothing to some people. Some people get more views for trash than for effort and that can get you down if you let it. Don't try and find reason in it. Sometimes good stuff gets lost.

Beatrice, I didn't roll my eyes, I went to close the tab.

  It should have been a simple task. Escort Ginny Weasley to her Quidditch match. But it all changes when Harry Potter rents the wrong car. What started out as a simple road trip between two friends and past lovers quickly turns into a hellish game of cat and mouse, and Harry and Ginny find themselves running away from a mysterious and deadly group of mercenaries.
