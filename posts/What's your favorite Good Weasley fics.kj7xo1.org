The Weasley's often get bashed. Where the Weasley's use Harry for his fame/and fortune, where Ginny gives Harry love potion, etc. What are some of your favorite good Weasley fics?

Anyone can be the MC/Any site/Any Length/Old or New/Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes, doesn't have to focus on pairings.


** Love the Weasleys. Here's a nice family one with Arthur as the main character. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13524997/1/Must-Be-One-of-Arthur-s-Boys]]

Also I really like 'Crossing Lines' with the twins, they are quite in-character as are a few others. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993367/1/Crossing-Lines]]

** Linkao3(Rose Petal Red) Heavy focus on the Weasley family. Rarely seen BAMF!Arthur.

Linkao3(The secret language of plants) Best Percy in the fandom.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?[ CURRENTLY ON HIATUS ]

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
