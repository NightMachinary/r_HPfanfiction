As the title says, I'm looking for fanfics where Harry is raised by his paternal grandparents, whether they be Charlus and Dorea, or Fleamont and Euphemia.

I don't particularly mind if Harry is in a relationship or not, but if he is I'd prefer no slash.


** Raised by a very protective grandfather in Fruit of the Golden Tree.

  Thanks to the desperate actions of his wife, Fleamont Potter survived his dragonpox. Now he finds himself awake again in a world where all the members of his family are supposedly dead---except that the Potter family tree tells him that his grandson lives yet. Fleamont sets out on a search for his grandson, and then a quest to keep him safe once he's found him.

** There was a WBWL fic where the Potters gave Harry to Dorea. Sirius got the boot for that, and Harry became Hadrian Black, Hadrian being both a pureblood and star name. He still looked out for his twin though IIRC.

linkffn(Hadrian Black the other twin) I think that's it.

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Update: May 2020 --- This story has been getting a lot of new readers lately, so I wanted to let you know that, yes, this story is currently on hiatus. As with many writers, I struggle with mental health issues, but I am working on them AND working on getting back to this story as soon as I possibly can. I sincerely thank you for your sweet comments and patience*

Charles 'Hawk-Eye' Potter, retired Sniper of her Majesty's Army is surprised when his adopted grandson turns out to be his own flesh and blood.
