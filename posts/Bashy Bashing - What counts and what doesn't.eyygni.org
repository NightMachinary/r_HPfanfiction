So, I was reading a comment from an older thread and someone pointed out how 'bashing' is a really relative thing. Despite there being a specific definition, many people view it in a different way and see things in different lights. What is bashing to one person might not be bashing to another. It got me curious. So, prithee, do tell. This is, to be clear, more of an opinion poll than a challenge. I'm interested in what people think about this, not starting a confrontation, so please be polite. Be scathing and insulting, if you must, but be polite about it. :)

Feel free to add examples to illustrate your point. No limitations, any pairing, het or slash or femslash, weird shit, tropes and cliches, etc.


** To me, bashing means that a character is behaving worse than he/she should reasonably act with canon character development for no apparent reason.

Reading other comments here, I seem to have a slightly different view on what constitutes bashing -- however, I will say that the examples given are the worst cases of bashing, even if IMO they aren't the /only/ ones.

With my view on what bashing is, what you say is entirely possible -- a character's actions can be interpreted differently by different people, meaning that their "bash point", or what constitutes as "worse than canon behaviour for no reason" would be different.

One thing that comes to mind regarding this that I could see be interpreted differently is GoF Ron. Harry has lived through childhood emotionally abused. It would not be unreasonable to have Harry take Ron's actions in GoF as a betrayal of friendship and a major loss of trust that cannot easily be undone after the First Task. Ron would, obviously, not take such a reaction well, and would probably be rather angry, possibly fracturing their friendship completely. This is IMO a completely understandable reaction with what we know of his character at this point, and while obviously a character flaw, doesn't mean he's an evil person, just in the wrong here. However, someone else might consider such a reaction Ron-bashing.

*** I generally use the same definition, but I think in some cases the reference point shouldn't be canon. Namely, if everyone is made much more mature than canon, except one character who acts with their canon flaws, we still get a story which reads like bashing.

** It's more of how prolonged they make the bashing. If it's done to explain why the character won't be in the rest of the fic, or if they realize their mistakes and change from who they were, it's easier to tolerate and serves a point to the plot. However, in the cases that are disliked, the characters continue to make the same mistakes and are hated for it, making supposedly smart characters unable to realize they're in the wrong. In most cases this is often tedious because it feels like the same story happens over and over again, and the protagonist feels like a perfect and/or powerful character who can do no wrong.

** Bashing is taking an established character and then emphasizing one or more negative traits into the absolute extreme. Bashing begets bashing, too, as seen the "gold-digging weasley" trope, an idea completely springing from fanon.

For example:

Ron is a treacherous coward because of the triwizard thing. He was a glutton and a pig. He was only after Harry's money. He conspired with ginny and molly to give harry a rape-potion. Etc.

Dumbledore is a diabolical chessmaster who works from the shadows, controlling everything. He knows about the scarcrux and has set Harry up to die. The Greater Good is his ideal. He's stealing harry's money to fund the war. etc.

Hermione is vain and nasty to anyone who does better than her. All her strengths are actually flaws and her confidence is actually insecurity. She's only after Harry's recognition. etc.

I could go on, but I think this makes the point quite nicely.

**** No, they aren't.

1. Dumbledore doesn't control anything from the shadows. In fact, he works quite openly.

2. While he did know that Harry needed to die, he did not work towards that as a goal and actually tried to find solutions that wouldn't require his death. Many of the reasons Harry survived are actually his doing. (master of death, the blood connection to voldemort, etc)

3. He never stole Harry's money. While we don't know how much he has himself, his will doesn't name any, but he holds three very high positions. It's likely that he used the entirety of his own savings and salaries to fund the Order.

4. He doesn't believe in the greater good - in fact, he actually espouses it since it was gellert's ideal.

The only thing he would be 'guilty' of is putting Harry with his wicked relatives, and knowing they'd treat him bad. Remember though that dursely abuse is mostly fanon (the starving and locking in rooms is canon, the rest decidedly not) and that there was a legitimate reason for it: Nothing else would have worked. Harry just came out of a broken Fidelius, the second most powerful defensive spell, which can obviously be overcome. Death Eaters are still at large, and the familial connection to Malfoy, no matter how tenuous, could have resulted in them gaining custody of Harry, with the insertion of a few bribes here and there. Once Harry is in their hands, he's gone forever - either dead as soon as he could write (diary, and the dark lord is released once more), raised abused or raised a datk wizard.

#+end_quote

He basically told Harry nothing about his plans and what was going on until 6th year, and even then he spent all year only giving Harry some information on Voldemort and not much else. Perhaps he shared a lot of his plans with the Order, but we don't see that, and we know he didn't tell anyone but Snape about the Horcruxes so he definitely kept at least some plans to himself and very few others.

So... is he a master manipulator or not? Does he work behind the scenes to ensure his plans come together or is he very open about the fact that Harry has to die? In any case, he certainly didn't plan on Voldemort using Harry's blood in a ritual, giving him a thread to the living world, nor did he plan on Draco disarming him and Harry disarming Draco, thus making Harry the master of the Elder Wand. That's actually one of my biggest problems with DH, that Harry only wins and survives through a series of huge coincidences and contrivances. In any case, Dumbledore certainly knew Harry had to die, and had Snape share that with him at the very last second, knowing that Harry would be vulnerable and willing to sacrifice himself for his friends. He hoped that things were set up so Harry could survive, and he was right, but he wasn't certain.

The last two I agree with you on, but that's 50% right there. Now, don't get what I'm saying twisted, I don't think canon Dumbledore is a villian or nearly as bad as fanfics make him out to be. I'm simply pointing out that some of the fanon traits are based on his canon characterization. If I reread the books and really analyzed his character (which I might do in the future) I'm sure I could point out a lot of the good and bad traits of his character and show some of the sketchier things he's done. Some of which, I'm sure, wasn't put in intentionally but rather by the way JKR started the series, then changed the style and realism of it halfway through, thus creating some unfortunate implications in the first few books. But, yeah, he's definitely not intended to be interpreted that way, JKR's just not that great of an author.

In regards to the Dursleys, while fanfic authors do tend to overexaggerate the abuse compared to canon, what they do is still abuse. Being locked in a tiny space, isolated, being forced to cook and clean, starvation, either turning a blind eye to their son beating up Harry or potentially encouraging it, and possibly physically abusing him as well (Petunia does try to hit him with a goddamn frying pan, which doesn't explicitly show physical abuse but does imply that they're willing to go there), not to mention all of the emotional abuse like name calling, calling him worthless, degrading his parents, and letting Marge's dog chase him into a tree and keep him up there for hours. I'm not going to say Dumbledore definitely knew what was going on, but let's not pretend that the Dursleys only did a fraction of what they actually did and that there was absolutely nothing Dumbledore could have done to prevent it. At best he's guilty of not checking in on Harry and assuming the best of the Dursleys, at worst he simply ignored the abuse and couldn't think of a better option. The latter seems more probable considering what he says at the end of OotP.

Harry looked at Ron as the food fell out of the side of his mouth and down his shirt front. What had possessed him to spend any time with this jealous, lazy, treacherous fool? He could have been a great scholar and had friends from all the other houses if he hadn't let this red-headed leach batten on him.

** My definition of bashing is when the characterization of a character is written in such a way that you as a reader can tell that the author just doesn't like that character. It's hard to nail down with any specific markers other than how things come across to the reader. I can read a story where Gryffindor Ron becomes an antagonist to Slytherin Harry, and as long as the negative traits that are emphasized in this version of Ron exist for a reason, it doesn't feel like bashing, it feels like the author is trying to tell a story. Conversely, if scenes with the character serve no purpose other than to attempt to make you, the reader, dislike the character, then its bashing. The author wants you to feel anger, indignation, and irritation with the character and that is all.

Bashing is most noticeable and atrocious when it comes in a sudden characterization shift from canon to the fics starting off point. Also very noticeable when there are constant repetitions of the bashed character being beaten down by the hero and beckoning more stubborn, angry, manipulative, baggy, self righteous etc every time.

** I do agree it's relative, however I'm fairly certain there's some touches or themes that's the same for most if not all fics considered "Bashy".

For me personally I consider bashing when the author goes to extreme lengths to discredit a character without there being any favourable trait shown. The greatest example should be the "Dumbles" trope where he's usually portrayed as a truly evil person with no moral compass, completly focused on only doing what's in his own mind considered "for the greater good". And I feel like [[/u/slutforpotter][u/slutforpotter]] and [[/u/TheHeadlessScholar][u/TheHeadlessScholar]] both has great points.

** To me it's about how it affects the plot. A lot of the Ron bashing stories you could kill him in the first chapter or remove him altogether and nothing would change with the story. Just look at Draco in the Philosopher's Stone. Draco comes off very poorly in the book but every interaction either gives Harry/the reader new information or pushes the plot forward. Another good example is linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) In that story both the Weasley twins and Krum are portrayed negatively. If you remove the Weasley twins subplot from the story nothing really changes. The rivalry with Krum however pushes the plot forward and helps push Harry and Fleur's relationship. The twins are bashed, Krum is a villian.

(Edit: I may be wrong about The Lie I've Lived, it's been awhile since I read it)

*** To continue my thought: I've been reading a lot of crossovers recently. Many of those stories have Harry end up in another universe at the end of the first chapter but still take time to bash characters. Then never mention them again. linkffn(The Difference One Man Can Make) is a good example. Harry goes to Westeros at the end of chapter one but the chapter still spends a paragraph or two talking about how much of a loser Ron is. It is unnecessary and makes me like an otherwise good story a little less.

** To me, character bashing can be summarized as "Character A's entire characterization is being a cunt". Usually the character being bashed has no redeeming qualities, is consistently a butt monkey, and do not change when a reasonable person would, but really if every scene with them could just be explained with - Character A is being a dick again -(the exception is for outright antagonists, which won't count as bashing to me if they ever succeed in some lasting and not instantly reversed way/show intelligence/show growth/are very obviously parodies and not serious characterizations) then thats pretty much bashing. As an example would a fic that I literally just started and dropped reading today - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922615/10/Harry-Potter-and-the-Last-Chance][Harry Potter and the last Chance]] . Ron has no purpose other than to be a dick. He accomplishes nothing other than inadvertently screw himself over by being a dick.

Another example is a fic I dropped reading after the first paragraph set off all my alarms for bashing ; linkffn(7104654) after the first paragraph mentions he can't trust Ron after the GoF thing. Other commentators have told me my senses weren't wrong at all, and the fic bashes characters heavily.

Just my two cents.

Edit: Went a bit more in depth on what I'd say counts as exceptions to bashing.

B) It starts in Order of the Pheonix time, well after canon Harry and Ron got this shit sorted without any changed details being explicit. They patched up. It was done, and this fic bringing it up without saying why is a red alarm that Ron's suddenly going to be a worse character without any explanation either.

****** It's funny how people can have a totally vision of the same events. For me, Ron was mad at Harry, not because he managed to enter into the Tournament, but because he thought he did this behind /his/ back (low self estem, fear of just being the "sidekick" . . .).

This conflict could have been easily resolved, if Harry had just said something along the lines of "Maugrey think that someone entered my name into the Tournament to kill me", rather than "You are an idiot if you think I did it" (even though, the morning of the Champion selection, so like 12h before, they had talked about it and Harry said it would be nice to "win the Tournament".) Ron is not omniscient, he knew Harry was interested, that he had a potential mean (the cloak), and that he did become Champion.\\
Even after this night, the conflict could have been resolved before the 1st Task, if Harry had not added oil to the fire when he stopped his conversation with Sirius. Yes he was angry that his appearance cut the conversation short, but Ron could not know this, and yelling at him and throwing a badge to his head is not a good way to make up.

Anyways, my point is that, in my opinion, Ron apology after the 1st Task is not a "I saw you almost die and I magically trust you that you did not cheat to enter", but rather a "I saw you almost die, and I decided that, even though you have at least 50% of the blame for this dispute, you are still my best friend and I don't want to loose you so I will be the bigger man and apologize even if it's akward".

**** On it's own you are definitely right, that isn't bashing. However, it is totally a red flag for bashing. If an author writes a scene of Harry feeling that way, in the moment, it reads more like they are approaching an emotional issue not fully developed in canon, with a resolution likely to follow. If an author writes a scene where Harry suddenly has a realization later about the motives and actions of another character, it almost always prefaces bashing.

In this example, Harry suddenly realizes in fifth year that Ron's actions of a year ago mean he is untrustworthy. Given the best benefit of the doubt, the author then has Harry approach Ron, they discuss the issue, and resolve it. The entire scene is pointless. Another option is that the author wants Ron out of the story but doesn't want to bash and has Harry cut ties because of this sudden realization. Not bashing, but a sign of poor writing. Lastly, Harry has suddenly thought back on to how he can't trust Ron because of his previous actions. The author is very likely going to follow this up with Harry thinking of other times Ron has been untrustworthy in a bashy internal monologue, and they are very likely to give Ron opportunity in their fic to prove that they are untrustworthy with future bashy reactions.

That last formula has been followed by so many bash fics that it is a pretty decent red flag.

This story has the love potions, but they weren't uselessly bashed. At most, Ron acts the same as the Yule Ball/Triwizard cup tantrum he threw for similar reasons. The epilogue seems like bashing at first, but you have to consider the fact that he didn't have the final three books worth of change he had in canon, so he kept on the course of 4th year attitude.

** To me, it's character bashing if the character's characterization is off and the other characters' view of that character is inconsistent with canon for no particular reason.

For example, it's pretty in-character for Ron to say something insensitive, causing a fight between him and Hermione, and Hermione leaves the fight fuming about him being an idiot. There are multiple instances of that in canon and that occurring in a fic wouldn't raise an eyebrow for me, even if the fic were from the perspective of someone who fought with Ron often, like Malfoy or Percy, and thus would showcase the worst side of him often. But if Ron suddenly went off on how Hermione was inferior because she was muggleborn and Harry mused about how he hated Ron all along because Ron only made friends with him because he was rich, that would be blatant bashing to me. Plus, it just comes off as bad writing if the only way you can justify your hate for a character is to twist them until they're not that character anymore.

** This is a great question. I'm not sure myself at times.

I think it is about an unrealistic bad or evil presentation of a character. It takes away complexity from the character and focuses on their flaws (real or invented by the author or fandom) in an out of context way. It is about out of character behavior of the character and the character around them.

​

What is not bashing to me is shining light at flaws of characters or let other characters 'bash' a character if it fits their character like Harry expecting the worst of Snape or Draco... Even showing a character mostly negative isn't necessarily bashing either, as long as it is realistic. You can write a story about a teenager falling in with the death eaters and even commit horrendous crimes without bashing the character.

​

Other people seem to think that every negative or mostly negative presentation is bashing. In a story, I wrote somebody said that I bash Snape and I can't agree with that. In this story, I write from Lily Evans' point of view and how it was not just one word that broke the friendship between them, but years of going in different moral directions. I show him as unwilling to admit if he is wrong or doesn't know something and covers it with being rude at times or socially awkward and it shows how the friendship turned more and more toxic for Lily with time. I don't think it is bashing but others maybe do if they like Snape a lot and don't agree that those are realistic flaws or that he never agreed with the death eater ideology and was completely forced into joining against his will.

** When it's prolonged and over the top, like in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion). Also, compare and contrast the bashing. If such treatment/criticism was placed on your favourite character, would you object to it? If the answer is yes, it's probably bashing.

*** I'd say that's a pretty bad example of bashing. Not because it isn't, but because it's clearly a parody that uses over the top bashing for comedic effect. Most more serious fics with bashing included won't be close to as severe in the level of bashing that Champion's Champion has.

Which is usually done with the Weasleys and Dumbledore. I have never seen such OTT bashing with anyone else but them and maybe Fudge/Umbridge.

Links? The only fics that have 'reasonable' bashing (according to some people) of Hermione that I've read are linkffn(4776013) and linkffn(3226536), one of them nearly unreadable due to the spelling mistakes and punctuation errors.

***** Maybe I should have been more clear, my mistake. Yes, there are plenty of fics that use over the top bashing, but it's meant to be serious and not for comedic effect. Also, when talking about the severity of bashing I was talking about both how over the top it was /and/ how prevelant it was throughout the story. I find it pretty rare in the fics I've read to have that level of bashing consistently shown throughout the story, typically if there is bashing that's that over the top it will be a few moments in the entire fic, with less over the top bashing in the moments between those OTT moments, and the bashing isn't the entire focus of the story but rather a small part of it.

Although, even just talking about how over the top it is, I've /never/ seen a fic that characterizes Ron as being so utterly stupid and humiliated as he's portrayed in TCC. Some that have a few moments that compare to the less over the top parts of TCC, yes, but never the characterization as a whole.
