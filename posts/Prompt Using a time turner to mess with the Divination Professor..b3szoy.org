Basically spending the entire class predicting things that happen right afterwards.

** Time Turners are weird. You can't use one unless you already have. The entire concept is basically impossible at a fundamental level even ignoring the physics. If you haven't used a Time Turner, then you can't go back in time because you haven't used it. And if you haven't used it, then you won't use it.

*** You won't know if you used it, until the decision to use it. That decision tells you whether you used it or not.

**** No, because you already used it. The pst already happened with you using the time turner, so you have to use it. But that doesn't make sense because it means the future is already plotted.

There is no decision whether or not you use it because following the events of the story they theoretically already used it

***** But you haven't used it until you decided to use it, the event is still in the future, unaffected by what the "future you" are doing. Harry and Hermione didn't go back because they knew they would go back. On the contrary, they went back because they thought they failed. And more importantly, Hermione's explanations implied changing the past is actually possible. Meeting yourself and going crazy is something she was warned about and against.

** This doesn't even make sense because to predict everything in the class you have to be in the class and hear everything, and then the second you that goes back in time also has to be in the same class to hear everything. And time turners can see each other, although they would probably just assume polyjuice if they first see each other.

So that wouldn't work

**** That wouldn't work because then you'd see yourself go in, and be in there. Only if you didn't peek once but if you happened to glance then you'd be screwed. Too many holes

*** I thought it was more Hermione would predict things that had already/would be happening in her Arithmancy class, or around that time. So if she, at 3 pm, left her arithmancy class, saw Lavender trying to fix her singed hair, turned the hourglass back to 12:55, left the bathroom, went to Divination, warned Lavender to be careful as it appeared something would ruin her hair, at 2:50, Lavender accidentally sets her hair on fire with one of the scented candles. Hermione is proven a seer.

Of course, that might count as changing the past, but who knows. I imagine there's at least some tiny thing she could see if she waited ten minutes before going back - I.e., she sees a first year Hufflepuff trip down the stairs and spill his books, quills, ink, everywhere, and in class, warns people to avoid that staircase because of the mess. Next class, everyone would have heard it'd actually happened, and she'd be revered.
