Personally, I'm not against them. I've found a few good ones in different fandoms so I know they can be executed well. I haven't found many good ones in the HP fandom, though. In general, I dislike how canon characters seem to act like cardboard cut outs in many SI fics.


** Personally, I think there are way too few Self-Insert fics for HP.

*** It's sort of weird, really -- the fandom is huge and yet there are tumbleweeds when it comes to SI fics.

** The problem with SI characters is that they are by nature OC and not actually the author. This is because, while we know things about ourselves that others don't, we don't know how we would react in a multitude of situations that the story would force us to react to, whereas with an original character, we can mold their personality to react a certain way.

In something like Dragon Age, everyone on this subreddit would die a horribly messy death, with the exception of a few lucky sods who would die quickly and cleanly. In Harry Potter it would be somewhat different because it's mostly schoolwork, but the end-of-year adventures would still kill off a good number, and no one wants to admit they would be one of the casualties. SI's naturally become OC because in order to have a good story you /need/ to scale up the average person's competence to a level where they can survive, and the fact of the matter is, the average person can't.

Also, because the author inserts themself into the fic, they are naturally biased toward their character. Any criticism toward the character becomes criticism toward the author, and if there's one thing people do not like one bit, it's being told they're not good enough. This leads to SI's becoming Stus.

*** A lot of good points. I definitely agree on the part where you have to scale up competence. Although, I think that it could be flawed thinking in some cases. If you can acknowledge that you're not going to be slaying a Basilisk anytime soon or capable of dueling Death Eaters, I think you just have to tackle the problem in a different way.

On that last note, I love having flaws. It gives me something to work on, so having someone notice something wrong with the character (bias to me is a flaw, so if that caused the character to be unrealistic, I'd consider it something to work on) and then point it out would be wonderful.

** I've seen some good self-insert fics in Planetary Annihilation (which tends to be a fun roflstomp crossover with everything vaguely sci-fi under the sun). I've seen some good ones in the DC Comics universe (primarily power ring users, like Green Lantern). Maybe one or two in Worm.

The problem an SI has in the Harry Potter series not taking over within months. An SI Harry Potter can take out the ring, the locket, the diadem, and the diary destroyed, the basilisk killed, Pettigrew captured, and Sirius freed within six months. The cup will take a little longer, granted. An "accidental" trip and fall with a basilisk fang (wielded while under the Invisibility Cloak) and Quirrell is dead.

With the DC Universe, you have an ongoing universe with many story arcs and no single central conflict. The source material encourages you to move from arc to arc and from antagonist to antagonist. With Worm, there are already characters with powers nearly equivalent to self-insert knowledge -- extra information only goes so far. With Planetary Annihilation, they plan to chew through other series' central conflicts in 10k words or so before moving on to the next world.

You can invent your own conflicts and story arcs, but then you're pretty far divorced from the canon stories, so it doesn't work quite as well.

*** An SI Harry? Like a person being reincarnated into Harry's body? That's an interesting premise, but it certainly does seem to make things too easy.

I like making things as difficult as possible for the protagonist. I'm considering a blind Protagonist (incurable even by magic).

**** In D&D, the most overpowered skill is diplomacy, because diplomacy allows you to convince people to help you. An SI who is moderately skilled with diplomacy could probably get Harry to help out with access to the Chamber of Secrets.

If you can't get the Invisibility Cloak to off Quirrell, you can still get Harry to the Chamber of Secrets in good order. And a bit of ingenuity can probably kill him elsewise -- I don't think he practices CONSTANT VIGILANCE!

** I like them and actively search them out in most fandoms that I read, along with OCs, but it's hard to find one that's substantial enough to make for a satisfying long-form read.

*** Same, I find very few that are enjoyable, though.

Dreaming of Sunshine (Naruto) is what drew me into them.

**** That was my first one, and it seemed to have exploded SI into that fandom. I think it is just a lack of a really good one to kick start look alike fics. Plus there is so much less known of the world than in Naruto.

** I do like them but they can tend towards the ridiculous. This is my favorite "realistic" SI and what I would probably end up doing: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2748992]]

** Just as long as there's no romance and enough actual conflict. One of my favorites is "Echoes" by BlackDeviousRose, where the character has depression and is completely apathetic about the world because of her death. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11763334/1/Echoes]]

** I'm against SI fics on principle, as the author is biased toward their SI character and 99 times out of 100 you end up with either a Mary Sue or, like you said, the other characters fade and become essentially nothing. I'd rather see something like what fans do with characters like Daphne or Susan, use something mostly undefined in canon and create your own details. Those kinds of characters are basically OCs, seeing as how outside of 'Susan's aunt is the head of the DMLE and has a large bust' there isn't a whole lot of info there.

The exception to my 'No SI' policy is in a fandom like Fire Emblem or Mass Effect, where the main character more or less is a self insert anyway, and the OC can be used to create changes in the world, rather than '...and here I marry my waifu/husbando.'

That being said, I have read a couple of fics, and I mean literally two, maybe three, where an SI doesn't suck, but because the author just positively dumps The Troubles on their character, instead of creating their New Jesus Figure. I actually remember reading a fic where an SI committed suicide, the event being a major moment of development and motivation for the actual main character. And if I were to make a self insert for myself, I'd be the Q to the main character's Bond. I'd be Harry's account manager or a reporter, somebody that CAN affect the plot, but not really direct where it goes.

Anyway, short version is no SI OCs unless the source allows for it (i.e. Mass Effect) or is only tangentially related to the plot, if they even are at all.

Edit: Forgot to say, no SI OC in a relationship with a actual character, ever. It passes bias into pseudo-nepotism at that point.

*** I also love to see underused canon characters make a splash in the fandom as well (interpretations of Daphne and Astoria are among my favorites).

I love to wreck my main characters. :)

One of the reasons I'm looking into this is I want to practice first person for my original novel, and it's easier to do it a fandom that has a lot of fun stuff going on.
