:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember in this fic that he visited the dursleys with Ginny on his motorbike, they asked him to bring Dudley back for his birthday. Dudley has a girlfriend who believes she is a witch(but she's really not). And there was also a mess with the auror business. Somebody got killed I think and the killer tried to frame draco by disguising himself as him. There is also a cop who started stalking harry and his friend and found out about the wizarding world. Send link pls of you know what fic I'm talking aboutüò¢


** ‚ÄúFriends and Foes by Northumbrian‚Äù linkao3(3068435). I really like this story (there is never enough of Bobbie Beadle, and this is her introduction), unfortunately it is unfinished (and given the current state of Northumbrian, it will probably never be finished).

  Harry and his friends finally know who killed Ginny and Luna's classmate, Colin Creevey. It is 2001, and the search has been ongoing for a year. Will those final few foes who escaped justice at the end of The Battle ever be brought to justice?
