Any non-slash pairing is fine.

A good example would be [[https://www.quotev.com/story/5791757/Poisoned][Poisoned by potterheadcharles]].

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

**** I'm 4 chapters in, seems to me like a generic cliche fic, sorry. Betrayed by Weasleys, MoD Harry can't die so he goes back in time to over-abusive Dursleys just before first year to change everything, first thing first - goes to Gringotts and unseals his parent's will, that Dumbledore didn't want him to know about... I think I've seen this lots of times already.

***** Nope, it was abandoned in 2015, but the rest of the storyline can be interpreted.
