Help!

I'm looking for a fic I read a while back and it was fairly long, I'm pretty sure it had something like 'fire' in the title. Harry returns to Privet Drive during the summer where he gets a muggle girlfriend, who is then killed by death eaters. After this Harry becomes ill with a rare magical illness that only Dumbledore and Merlin have survived. When Harry wakes up he is much more powerful. This fic also had Dumbledore training Harry and guiding him through the process of controlling his new powers.

I have searched all over for this fic and can't seem to find it! I loved reading it so would be very grateful if anyone could point me in the right direction! Please help!! Thanks
