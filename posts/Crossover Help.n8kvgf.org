Yo, I have a story where a MoD Harry is put in Azkaban, you know the trope, but I'm doing my own spin. It's not his friends, the ministry, or Voldemort.

Anyway, he stays there for centuries as the wizarding world falls, and eventually the wards hiding the island fail. Muggles come and break him out.

He's the last Wizard.

Now! I want this to be a crossover, but don't know what universe would be best. I was thinking MCU, I can easily manipulate dates and such to make it fit.

But I want your input! Tell me what universe you'd like to see!


** Honestly mcu is a dope crossover lol

** MCU would be good, I've been trying to make one where the data leak reveals magic to the muggles because shield would totally have their creepy know everything thing all over that. So that could be interesting, maybe there are some hackers or a justice group who were trying to get to all of the illegal prisons, and Azkaban is one of them? But obviously that wouldn't leave him in there for centuries though...

Alternatively the accords could have some stipulation that all illegally incarcerated supers must be handed over and they'd take them on or something? Again that doesn't leave him in there for centuries. Maybe someone did some sort of times wimey dimensional thingy with his cell that took him out of time so that he's experienced centuries but the world has only experienced two decades or however long?

** A Firefly prequel, if you're feeling particularly inventive. Have the prisons emptied onto one of the ships abandoning earth, and make up some history.

Otherwise, MCU is always a good choice.
