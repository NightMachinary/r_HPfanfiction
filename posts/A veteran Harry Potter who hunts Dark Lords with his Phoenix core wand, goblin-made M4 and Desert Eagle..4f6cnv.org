  What do you guys think?

Nothing good, I'm afraid. This all sounds like a very overpowered Harry roflstomping Dark Lord after Dark Lord.

Stuff like "corrupted Patronus" and "worth three Bombarda Maxima" let some serious alarm bells ring in my head. There have been fics like that and they have all been horrible. Why? I think that comes from the fact that great magic in the HP universe has very little to do with explosions and fancy lightshows. Wielding power in the HP universe was equal to wielding knowledge. Your proposed magic is all too... physical? I think thats the right word.

Also, the Goblins using muggle designs for their weaponry rubs me the wrong way. /If/ you need Harry to carry a rifle, think of your own, not one made for the US military. The Desert Eagle... sigh... If you're looking for a "cool" gun, go the full way and just hand Harry a Magnum.44 so he can be Dirty Harry.

**** I gotta agree and disagree. The ar-15 platform is a bit boring as much as i love my .458 SOCOM in it. And Deagles are hella played out. But a 1911 or, better, a sutiably modified Webley would be cool.

He's coming from a future. So have him wield something from the future. Look at media with lots of gun play that happens in the near future then utilize a fictional weapon. OR have him having built his own magical firearm.

E.g., my Darkness!Harry story has firearms in it. Harry is introduced to the Beretta 93R by someone. And he thinks it's cool so that's the gun he uses. Had I wanted to go to rule of cool, I could have said a Kriss vector and just said "well, it was developed in the eighties instead of the '10s" in the story to facilitate its existence.

"Bang" the rune-gun went off, sending bits and pieces of the malicious Hag flying everywhere. "Shoot!" Harry yelled, as he waited for the runes to recharge, al the while running and dodgeing the Hag's friends claws. "Why doesn't this piece of crap have more than one shot?" He asked. "Why did you lose your wand?" Hermione replied, sending back ineffective stunners, which only seemed to encourage their attackers. After what seemed like an eternity Harry was able to squeeze off another shot, the sickly purple blast taking out another hag. Soon the hags where upon them, Harry vainly using the but of the blunderbuss to keep from getting pulled apart. After an exhausting 10 minute struggle they where finally able to get back to the civilized part of Knocturn Alley. Harry complaining all the way about how crappy the blunderbuss that saved their lives was. Hermione's first stop after they got out was Ollivander's to get Harry a new wand.

*********** In my Darkness!Harry story, Ollivander is hired to design a wand/gun hybrid where the receiver of a firearm is made from wood while the slide and barrel and other components are normal. Instead of using his normal woods and cores, he uses stabilized leprechaun gold and I think ironwood to create the receiver. The firearms also receive a specialized fitting that resembles a gunlight with toggles on it, allowing the wielder to select between various functions of the firearm. It could then be used by a muggle as a regular firearm or as a magic 'caster by a magical person, throwing specific spells by buttons selected or switching between various combat loads.

Harry is preparing for a future where Humanity is no longer confined to one planet in the story.

  The recoil will be a nightmare, not mentioning the reloading process.
#+end_quote

Granted, the Eagle has a magazine, so reloading is easier. But for recoil its barely less. A Desert Eagle isn't a pistol. A desert eagle is a one-hand howitzer, with the recoil appropriate for such a gun. If you go for practical give Harry a Walther PPQ, or a Beretta 92... something along those lines. Even those 9mm will have enough recoil that using them in tandem with a wand is impractial at best.

#+begin_quote
  And what's wrong with a weapon made by goblins?
#+end_quote

You misunderstood. I'm cool with a weapon being made by the Goblins. I'm not convinced that the Goblins would just take a muggle design and be done with it. If you make this, give Harry a "Gringotts AR-5" or whatever you'd name it. Or lets even think this further: Why use a explosion based gun at all? Why not make something like a handheld Railgun with the bullet being expelled from the rail by some sort of locomotion charm? Or a Gauss Gun which would have absolutely zero recoil (or close to none, anyway).

#+begin_quote
  And God forbid I become a little creative in the way he fights.
#+end_quote

Then scrap all you wrote and come up with something truly creative. Shields, overcharged spells, silence fields, reverse patroni,... that has all been done, more than one time.

The only thing I have never seen is that Harry employs magical animal constructs (they're obviously not humanoid constructs so not homunculi). But in the end they're doing the same as conjured or transfigured animals.

Anyway, I'm not trying to discourage you. However, I am saying that the way it is now, the story isn't something I would like to read.

**** Firstly, I would like to apologise for the typo I made. Instead of talking my fanfics, I was actually referring to fanfics in general.

Your choice of Harry being already matured is quite a nice touch from the usual Harry rapidly turning into an adult in a year, which is good. It is really nice to see a different style of the obtaining of power in the mountain of fast unrealistic development Harrys. It would be wise to remember the relationship between the characters that exist in both the past and future such as Dumbledore and other older order members. Overall, your plot seems believable and well structured at the beginning and towards the middle, so what harm is there for you to start writing even if it a bit cliche. I know that I have a guilty pleasure of a powerful Harry versus a powerful dark lord. I look forward to reading it!

I personally wouldn't be interested in reading this because if Harry is as powerful as you say he is then I can't see him getting into any danger, which ruins the story.

** My thoughts:

13 dark lords is a freakin' /lot/ of dark lord story arcs. I am completely sure I'll get bored of this story with that many story arcs, especially if Harry has the same capabilities/resources in all the arcs. It's also such a huge undertaking that you're likely to get bored and start something else. Find some ways to drop it down to a more manageable 3-7 story arcs. Since Harry has effectively traveled back in time he can eliminate some as babies. Some dark lords can team up and be defeated in th same story arc. One dark lord changes their mind and becomes a healer. Etc. Also, plot out the whole thing beforehand to make sure you actually have enough ideas to fill all those story arcs.

If goblins made firearms, wizards would simply cease to exist. And I simply see no reason for a "goblin-made" firearm. Just use a regular firearm and put some charms on it to: protect it from damage and the environment, reduce/eliminate recoil, ever-filling magazines, targeting aids, etc.

Like others have said, dial Harry way back for the first few dark lords and let him rebuild his capabilities/resources as the story progresses. Also, defeating dark lords isn't just about being a super-soldier -- it's about information acquisition and control, gathering and training allies, denying resources to the enemy, etc.

Aversion to magic, yes, desirable. But I reiterate: if goblins made /magic-proof/ firearms, wizards would have been wiped out long ago. Unless you're planning to make your goblins a persecuted race who just want to be loved.

Wand-carrying wizards are basically armed with single-action pistols and grenades (and stunners and some other stuff). Goblins haven't successfully taken over because they're only armed with swords, pikes, bows, etc. But if goblins can make firearms, that opens up grenades and RPGS, mortars, dragon-dropped bombs, land mines, etc. It's just a can of worms. :)

** I'm all for epic stories, but no. You can't just start off with your protagonist kicking ass. It has to be earned and bled for.

Creativity is great when it comes to magic but do not do guns. Use the framework of the series and build on that. Do not tear everything down and replace it with your own stuff because it will suck if you do.

Don't focus too much on how to make your protagonist awesome. Focus instead on making the villain awesome and by having Harry overcome him, one step at a time, he will in turn become the sort of bad-ass you're clearly shooting for.

Another thing is character. Don't turn him into some growly macho-man who communicates in nothing but one-liners. A real characters has strengths and weaknesses, friends and enemies, likes and dislikes. They're sometimes petty, they're sometimes wrong and they won't just shrug off any problem. Best of luck.

Use your imagination. Transfiguration allows for awesome stuff. You can introduce things like necromancy - that's fine - but it still has to fit in next to the other kinds of magic.

Most importantly, there has to be a reason why it isn't commonly used.

**** Oooh, ideas for dark wizards, huh? I think I can help.

- I'm assuming the Yellow River is in reference to the man-made flood in 1938? WW2 would have been an absolute festival for necromancers. Concentration camps in germany, Russian battlefronts like Stalingrad and Moscow, mass graves due to Stalin's purges, etc, etc. If you're going to have necromancers, make them from Russia and Asia. I wouldn't be surprised if the magical gov't had those areas protected. I would also be unsurprised if those protections were meager and useless.

- Serial killers and all around insane people who consider their killings "art"

- Puppet masters - people who enslave others through the imperius and other such spells, and have mastered the art of legilimency and possession.

- Political terrorists like Voldemort, or a magical version of ISIS. Warlords like those fighting over African countries.

- Those in pursuit of immortality by any means. Horcruxes are far from the only way; there are tons of myths on immortality. Don't be afraid to get ideas from other magical systems in different books.

- Beastmasters - dark wizards daring and insane enough to tame Nundus, basilisks, and dragons, and use them for their own ends. There would also be plenty of illegal breeding and chimeras.

- Alchemists - those in search of immortality, gold, or something else. Look into other works of fiction for ideas, for I have little in this area. You could go the FullMetal Alchemist route and make it so that creating a Philosopher's Stone requires human sacrifice.

- Blood mages - dark wizards that use harvested blood and human sacrifice to power an assortment of dark magic, curses, and rituals.

- Cultists that worship dark gods, similar to Cthulu or Jashin from Naruto. Invoking their name in a ritual could grant the cultists powers beyond what is normally possible.

I'm sure there are more.

If you want to write epic fight scenes that's obviously awesome. The important thing about those scenes is /who does what to whom/. With what is very much secondary.

Harry with a gun is cool. If he has an even gunnier gun, then that's even cooler. And if the goblins gave him the gunniest gun of them all -- well, who gives a fuck? Can you write awesome fights? If you can, fuck the details. If you can't, fuck your idea.

** As others have said, an overpowered protagonist makes for a less interesting story. Good stories are about conflict - specifically, the conflict created by a protagonist overcoming obstacles while pursuing some important goal. If everything is easy, there's no conflict, no feeling that the protagonist might not succeed, and thus no story.

Some people still like overpowered protagonists, especially when they are shown crashing through all the original obstacles. So there will be an audience for what you describe. Some people will enjoy it. If you want to stretch your skills and write a better story, however, you won't let your protagonist have it easy.

One option is to start with an overpowered Harry then weaken him. He's being summoned by Death Eaters? Well, I can't see them summoning aid without taking steps to ensure that said aid stays under their control. What sort of control will determine how your story proceeds. If it's some sort of binding that weakens him, then Harry is forced to rely on finesse and skill rather than just blowing stuff up, at least until he achieves his intermediate goal of loosening or eliminating his bonds. Something stronger, like a spell that prevents him from hurting anyone with a Dark Mark, would make things harder on Harry, forcing him to act indirectly for a while. He's got super-powerful magic, but can't use it directly against the people he most wants to eliminate - how frustrating will that be!

In effect, the more overpowered he starts, the more frustrated he'll be when he's leashed. Maybe you can start him out relying too heavily on his power, perhaps causing lots of unnecessary damage, thus allowing for growth as he learns to depend less on power/luck and more on skill/planning/finesse.

** You know what, a lot of people seem to be not very into this, but I would definitely read it. While the overpowered thing can be annoying, it's really not bad when the story is well written and the main character doesn't have a completely perfect personality to go with it, and I can tell you've put enough thought into this that you're probably not going to go that route.

I'm getting the impression that your veteran Harry is an adult that has been forced to learn over the years. There's a badass lone wolf vibe with the possibility of seeing some traveling (maybe even some exploration around the Wizarding World?) and it sound pretty fun. You could do so many things with this story, and all of them would be cool. Good luck with this story, and if you're not comfortable promoting it, please pm me when (or if) you ever start posting it!

** The biggest rule to remember: make sure your villain is on par with the hero. There needs to be real challenge, a genuine struggle for the story to be relatable. I've seen a lot in fics like this where Harry just gets too good and steamrolls over everything.

** It sounds pretty fucking stupid idea to a shit plot, but if your going to give Harry a gun you should at least let him make one and instead it being the top of the line you should give him a Thompson contender or something like that and carve runes on it with a magazine capacity of infinity since magic can do that, and the bullets should be made from the ashes of different dark lords. And when Harry shoots at wizards it completely bypasses their protegos and when it hits their body's they can't use magic anymore till they get the bullet out of their body's.

** Don't let the other comments discourage you from writing or uploading this fic. There will always be an audience for whichever genre you choose and which tropes you use and/or abuse. As long as the grammar is decent, and the story makes sense in the context of your world, people will read it and probably enjoy it.

Personally, I'm of two minds about roflstomp fics. In general they make me happy. Every now and then I just want to read about a character kicking ass and taking names. On the other hand, if you introduce distractions, deceptions, vulnerabilities, and hazards to keep an element of suspense and danger present for the protagonist, you might keep more people interested.

**** I wouldn't worry too much. About the only place your work would be "ripped apart" is the DLP forums and here, to an extent. If you want a thorough, tear-your-writing-apart criticism, go to DLP.

Also, I would emphasize the "vulnerabilities" part. If you're going to make something even close to resembling a roflstomp fic, your stomper is going to /need/ a clear, if not apparent, vulnerability that the enemy can take advantage of, whether it is physical or emotional. Otherwise, there is no point. It becomes a battle of attrition, with no opportunity for tactical and effective strikes, and that's boring. Others have said that, I'm reaffirming it.

On the topic of this post:

#+begin_quote
  a veteran of wizarding civil wars and fighting at that point has become his whole motivation to live and addiction, basically the opposite effects of PTSD. But being sent in an alternate timeline where all the people he still cared about, where his Mum and Dad survived, gives him a different reason to live for. I'm not going to the overused, and for me annoying, 'They're not my real parents so I should stay as far away as possible from them'. Again, what he saw in the mirror of erised when he was young still rings true and that there is nothing more important to him than family itself.
#+end_quote

This is good, but there's one thing I think you should consider. Changing his motivation for living from killing dark wizards to connecting to his family is one thing, and entirely possible; motives change all the time. But if you are making him /addicted/ to fighting - literally, physically /addicted/ to the adrenaline, joy, and empowerment that comes from destroying evil- then this /will/ clash with his desire to connect with his family, especially if his family does not want him to put himself in harm's way. Because addiction is not like motivation; it is not easily changed. Addiction is like chains wrapped around your mind, it is a very real and present feeling of "I need this to feel alive!" Breaking the addiction is like cutting through those chains with a broken and rusted metal file. It takes effort, self awareness, ungodly determination, and self denial.

So yeah. If it's his motivation, change it after he meets his family. If it's an addiction, he better struggle and waver like a flag on a windy day, or else it won't be realistic.

****** Yes, although I think the motivation for his family should be the small voice and the addiction should be the large voice. He's been alone for how long? Thirty, forty some years? Killing and eradicating dark wizards for so long, his reasons would have long ago turned from "because I should" to "because I can". Now a small voice is saying, "wait, but now I have what I've always wanted, I need to stop this", but he rationalizes that what he's doing is protecting his family, so he keeps on indulging himself. But of course, this sort of violence scares his family, so alienating them would clash with doing what he loves.

Thoughts?
