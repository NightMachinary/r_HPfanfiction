** There's a fic where Hermione is "reborn" as James Potter's sister and she encounters many of the death eaters and is able to subvert them to her side. Besides it not being about Harry it should be what you're looking for.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself... Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? Warnings within and please note that this is a very dark fic.
