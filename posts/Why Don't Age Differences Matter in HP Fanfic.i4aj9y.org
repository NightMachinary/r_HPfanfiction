I'll be the first to admit that I'm very picky when it comes to pairings. I'm a die-hard Harmony shipper, and I can't be talked out of it, and I don't think that will ever change. I'm comfortable with that. I don't understand Dramione shippers or Theomione or any of those.

BUT...They make a hell a lot more sense to me than fics that pair Harry or Hermione with people who are several decades older than them(or the other way around). I saw one today that had Hermione paired with Teddy Lupin. I don't understand. She's 18 years older than him, which is technically old enough to be his mother. Snape/Hermione or Snape/Harry along with Marauder/Hermione are ones I see all the time too. If it's time travel, sure, but a lot of the ones I see aren't. Why doesn't the two-decade difference between Remus and Hermione (or any of the other similar ships) bother people?

*Despite my dislike of other pairings beside my OTP, I'm a big proponent of ship what you want to ship, and eff everyone who says otherwise.* And I guess if the age difference doesn't bother you, that's fine. I guess what I want to ask is: why doesn't it bother people? Is it because wizards live longer? Or is it just that people have crushes on actors/actresses and want to see them with their favorite characters?

​

PS > I'm not ship bashing. I really do feel like you should ship whoever you want to ship. I'm just honestly trying to understand why the ships with age differences are so popular.

** I don't care what consenting adults get up to in their private lives. Just keep it under 65 years difference to pass the Anna Nicole Smith test. I'll just skip over the gross parts.

I don't care what older teenagers get up to in the privacy of their broom cupboard. I just don't want to read it. It feels skeezy since I've gotten so fucking old. I'll just skip the gross parts.

I'm not interested in your adult/teenager romances. It's skeezy no matter how old I am. Non-adults can't consent. Period.

Even if a student is technically an adult, the power dynamic of them boffing their teacher makes the relationship problematic at best. Keep that mess to yourself.

If you're writing young-teen and pre-teen sex junk GTFO.

#+end_quote

Depending on where you live, the age of consent is, for the most part of the Western world, between 14 and 17 while adulthood is generally at 18. And by your definition relationships which were fine under the previous point become skeezy for a year before being fine again.

If there's a power imbalance, that's a different story.

** A lot of the ones I see seem to incorporate time travel which often negates the age difference issue. Someone gets stuck or reborn in Riddle's era or the Maruders Era. I don't really have a favorite ship and I'll read most anything, so I'm typically there for the plot. I've read some odd ships that make perfect sense in the context of the fic, but seem very odd outside of that. Sometimes it's a physical vs mental age thing. I mean books about 100 year old vampires dating 16 year olds are popular, so I don't find it that surprising.

**** Yeah, I've seen it often enough in reincarnation type stories. If the MC lived to the age of 30 in their past life, then I often consider them to "mentally" be 30. I could see then why they wouldn't want to date within their age group because of the immaturity and lack of complex life experiences.

Of course, the older love interest's justification should probably also be addressed, especially if they don't know that the MCs mental age is different than their physical age. But since we often only see from the MCs POV, sometimes that's ignored and still considered okay by the reader.

** 1. People want to work with existing characters instead of OCs, and branch out to the teachers to widen the potential mates.
2. With wizards living longer life spans, age gaps become less important /once everybody is an adult/.
3. Many writers are young, and have not yet figured out that a teacher who allows/encourages a student's crush to advance is a really bad thing in the real world. Or they do realize that, but don't let it affect what they write in a fictional world.

***** That would imply that Lupin had actual contact with the trio to be classified as a friend, which definitely was not the case (canon also implies that Harry did not raise Teddy).

If Hermione dated James S or Lily L, I'd get the complaint. But who was Lupin to the trio? Harry (unjustifiably IMO) idolised him, but his actions could have hardly been more distant. Its not even a "Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?" moment but actually a "under which fucking rock did he disappear?"

** I don't care about age differences between consenting adults , /but/ there are some pairings I find still squicky:

- If one character saw the other character grow up, possibly changed their diapers, helped them with homework, etc.(And especially if there was continuous contact) - That's too close to feeling like a family relationship for me to accept it. ( Its why I can deal with Rermus/Tonks in canon, where i don't expect they had much contact while Tonks was growing up, but not in an AU whe Sirius takes Harry early on and due to this Remus somehow had a lot of contact with the Tonkses).

- Any relationship where one character is another character 's teacher.

- incest (especially with large age differences).

--------------

Otherwise I am about as unfazed by romance with a large age difference than I am by any romance. Not my cup of tea, but there is nothing making it categorically always a bad thing.

** It amuses me that every time this topic comes up, people start this some fans are just creepy refrain. In canon there are age gaps too, not huge ones, but they are there. I don't particularly mind them, though I have my limits. In time travel I don't even notice it. If both characters are adults and are mature enough, I have no problem with this. I have more issues with canon pairings. If in the relationship it feels as though one of the characters acts like a teen while being an adult while the other person is older than their years,, then I'm not going to like the pairing no matter what. People aren't bothered by this most probably because they just like the characters. When you like something, you're more oblivious to things other people see as problems.

** Just talking about Snamione, where Snape could literally be her father, because her parents were in the school while he was; yes, it was a Muggle school. I believe it is a product of teenager girls watching the films and falling in love with Alan Rickman (I am not a teenager anymore, and I am a bloke, so don't ask me to understand it). Given they mostly identify herself with Hermione (or Ginny if they are more sporty and less academic, but that's another point; I would like to meet, or more I am afraid to meet, any girls identifying themselves with Luna ;)) the result is Snamione. Rational arguments about such relationship not having any sense whatsoever and is even a bit disgusting are put aside. There is not much logic in teenage crushes: see Dramione for another example.

**** She was 22 (-ish, depending on her birthday) in OoTP and Lupin was 35. Two years later, they married. Obviously it's less weird because they were at least both adults at that point, but Tonks is a lot closer to Harry's age than Lupin's age. And plenty of Honks fics shave another year or two off her age for good measure.

I still wouldn't want a 15-year-old to date a 20-year old in real life, but I'm willing to accept it in fiction.

****** That too.

Although the age of consent in the UK is 16, so if the romance doesn't actually start until HBP, I think that pairing Tonks with Harry instead of Lupin might actually be less weird and equally legal.

And apparently the age of consent in England when the Statute of Secrecy happened was 12. Whether that was changed and by how much in the magical world is completely at the discretion of the author. So someone writing an OoTP Harry/Tonks or even a CoS Hermione/Snape fic could claim that it was completely legal by the characters' standards. Though I, like most readers, would be very much against the latter fic.

*** I like Harry/Tonks and Harry/Fleur too, sometimes. Harry/Fleur, I don't think really bothers that many people because the age difference is only three years. As long as Harry is age of consent, it's fine. Tonks is a little more problematic, but her character is so unused in canon, she can basically be any age. But still, the best ones for her are ones that start post war and never had a glimpse of her relationship with Remus Lupin, the bloody coward.

​

Edit: In canon, Tonks is basically only used for three things: Comedic relief in OOtP, redeeming the cowardice of Remus Lupin, and popping out a godson for Harry. That's it. For such an interesting character, she has no real purpose in canon, which is a damn shame.
