** "lives independently pre-Hogwarts" - so, before he even turns 11? Wow. That'd be one self-reliant little kid. But I'm intrigued by the concept!

**** You know, now that I think of it, there was a thread here a while back asking for stories where Harry was raised by animals or magical creatures - close to what you're asking for. Here's a story where Harry is abandoned and becomes a forest elf, plus a story where he's raised by unicorns:

This is the closest I can find to what you want right now, but if I find something closer, I'll let you know.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** Those two are the ones which pop in mind with those tropes :

linkffn(3995826) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3995826/2/The-Hidden-Hero]]

I read The Hidden Hero quite some time ago, but I do remember that Harry was independant and had to work in the Muggle world before going to Hogwarts, having been made to get out of Privet Drive after having the Wizarding World explained to him by his aunt. I's not the main focus of the story, though, as it concentrate more on his Hogwarts years as an under-cover Harry (nobody knows that he is the Boy-Who-Lived). (I do remember a scene where Dumbledore do a house call during the summer holidays and Harry has to make disguise as the own "father" of his false identity)

linkffn(2869936) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2869936/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Hero-s-Path]]

I've read this one quite recently and I thought it was an awesome read. Harry run away from the Dursley too early to get his Hogwarts and thus spend several years independently in the Muggle world, with friends he made along the way, before being kind of forced to go to Hogwarts. It is abandoned though (DLP forum is speculating that the author may be dead, actually...) but you do have 200k words of goodness to read ;)

(First time posting here... I hope I've used the bot correctly...)
