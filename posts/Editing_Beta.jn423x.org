Hi all you aspiring writers out there, I've read so much from the community, many great fanfics (often in their own ways), some not so good, and want to give back. I've tried writing as well, but after a few on and off bouts of depression frankly I've been unable to contine it for some time (I'm trying to go back to them), but I also wanted to help those of you with something to write! I can do:

Developmental feedback: run through your plot, run through sub-plot ideas, where you should focus your content, what needs to be cut, etc.

Copyediting: grammar check, language consistency

Ideation: chat on plot bunnies and how to develop them into ideas, where a story can go if you're in a lull

DM me, I'll try to respond within a couple days, happy writing y'all!
