** You really captured the sass factor when describing things from Harry's perspective. I could see myself very much enjoying this and hope it remains fluffy and fun, just to spite canon.

** Chapter 3 is now up, once I get in a rhythm I'm hoping to settle around 3k words per chapter, but I'm trying to keep my momentum up. I apologize if there are any cliche's I may borrow, this is my first major attempt at writing a fic other people will actually read. But I hope that I bring enough original ideas and entertainment and humor to keep everyone interested. Really loving the reviews and interest, thanks so much.

And I see you're also having fun with the worldbuilding.

** I'm a bit worried that there doesn't seem to be much emphasis on Dobby (or rather, Dobby's deeds), seeing as it's his marvelous scheme, but otherwise, good looking so far!

A question, though, will you have Dobby hiding Ron and Hermione's letters from Harry, or will he let them go through?

I was just thinking that the latter could be used to justify Harry going to Beauxbatons, since after all, he can still write, and visit once he learns about floo powder/apparition.
