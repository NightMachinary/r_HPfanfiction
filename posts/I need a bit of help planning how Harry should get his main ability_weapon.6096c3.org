** How about having his mind shatter before he blacks out and wakes up naked in the middle of a forest in Australia with a human sized platypus corpse and the book glued to his arse. He is also batshit insane with rabbit ears on top of his head and rinne-sharingan in the middle of his forehead and MEoDP and uses strangely insightful but absolutely fucking insane logic and gets the whole goes crazy because he understands reality in a manner that should be beyond human capabilities.

Also writes and speaks gallifreyan cuz why the fuck not.

Also give Voldemort a goddamn Death Star since we gave "frodo" a "lightsaber"

Also . What. The. Fuck. Did. I. Just. Write!

*** I'm potentially stealing Frodo with a lightsaber and crossing him with American Jedi for my Literary High series.

** Not interested in looking up this anime but perhaps an anthropomorphic being givesit to him to level the playing field if demon or another ab gives it to Riddle?

Or he could find it while looking through a book shop for a gift for hermione. And when he turns back after leaving the shop, it's gone.

Or a family prophecy is relayed to him by remus or sirius or someone and he has to to on a minor quest to attain it.

Or, while looking for something to have Janet Jackson sign, he picks up a book in a give-away bin outside a muggle bookstore.

Or, one day Hedwig arrives with it. No other explanation given in story. Ever. Let people speculate madly.

Or he finds it during a canon event. The basilisk expels it while dying. Or the mirror shatters and it's what knocks him out, not the death of Quirrelmort.

*** Why would I start with how Voldemort gets Gate of Babylon? This is about how Harry gets the spellbook.

And no, Harry will not be able to use UBW. Noble Phantasms are usable only by a specific person.
