Mine's the one from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9340220/1/Crosswinds-of-Fate][Crosswinds of Fate.]] The guy's manipulative (relatively subtle), politically savvy, and still manages to project an aura of senility. He's pretty much what I wish every Dumbledore was. Here's an excerpt from immediately after Umbridge begins her inspections of classes:

#+begin_quote
  3rd Period.

  Double Potions.

  As Harry and the other students entered the classroom, they found themselves witness to an argument. Unusually, this particular dispute took place between two staff members.

  "What are you doing here?" Umbridge demanded bluntly

  "Oh? My presence here is but a natural consequence of yours," Dumbledore replied easily while stroking his beard. "I am here to learn from you."

  "Learn from me?" Umbridge repeated in confusion. Her high pitched voice did not help matters, and Harry cringed at the sound.

  "Why yes!" he confirmed with a bright smile. "As High Inquisitor, appointed by the Ministry of Magic no less, you no doubt have much talent and experience in educating young children in the fields of magic."

  Peripherally, Harry noticed as Snape rolled his eyes.

  The old wizard continued on. "As such, the next logical step would be that I shadow you in your inspections."

  "Shadow me?" Umbridge again repeated.

  "Indeed," the headmaster confirmed. He then extended out a small tin quite familiar to Harry. "Lemon sherbert?"

  "What? No, I don't want a lemon sherbert," the witch answered exasperatedly. "I believe you have many duties to see other than to shadow me."

  "Oh, on the contrary, my dear Dolores," Dumbledore responded genially, a twinkle in his eye. "Now that I am neither Chief of the Wizengamot nor Supreme Mugwump of the ICF, I suddenly find myself with plenty of free time. Years... no decades of balancing my duties and priorities have made my organization of temporal resources quite efficient, I can assure you. And what could be a higher priority than ensuring that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom everyone can all repose their confidence?"

  Having just heard the Daily Prophet's article read aloud by Hermione earlier that morning, Harry easily recognized that the headmaster was parroting phrases from it almost verbatim. Silently he wondered if Dumbledore had prepared for this conversation ahead of time. It seemed logical in hindsight.

  Umbridge visibly struggled to form a coherent response. "If that is the case, why did you not shadow me when I taught Defense earlier this morning?"

  Dumbledore blinked before another wide smile formed on his face. "Why, that is an excellent point! Thank you, Dolores, for pointing out my error. Clearly I was correct in this decision to learn from the Ministry-appointed High Inquisitor. I shall endeavor to correct this oversight from this point forward. Undoubtedly your teaching methodology shall revolutionize the education at Hogwarts."

**** I'll address the issue of redemption here, we'll see about the other points, but many seem more of exaggerated fanon tropes from '03 than anything... we, twelve years later, have two more books and a lot less hate for the man.

The only person (CMIIW) he really "redeems" in canon is Snape, and maybe he tries to do some stuff with Draco. In DH he mentions that he's going to die anyway, so wants Snape to kill him rather than Draco since he doesn't want the kid's soul to be maimed further. Him planning his own death and not being concerned that Draco is after him isn't the problem here for you, I think.

It's that Katie Bell, Ron, and perhaps others are endangered in poor attempts at killing Dumbledore. But remember that Dumbledore also makes sure Snape keeps as much an eye on Draco as possible to make sure nobody dies in the crossfire like Katie almost did, but Dumbledore doesn't want to interfere and get the kid killed or worse, alienate him further into the arms of Voldemort.

Perhaps one could argue that he should've cracked down on Draco more, but imagine it from his perspective: he's seen several students, especially in the Marauder Era and especially those like Snape, walk the path of the Death Eaters. He doesn't want Draco to leave Hogwarts and do even worse than his amateurish attempts at assassinating the Headmaster will do in collateral - which could easily happen should he try something too heavy-handed. And Draco (mentioned in the later chapters of DH, again) doesn't exactly trust Snape, seeing him as usurping Malfoy Sr.'s position, so Dumbledore doesn't exactly have many tools available.

Turns out that the boy was having regrets and doubts even in HBP (bathroom scene, and of course stuff happens later in DH) and it turns out Dumbledore was very good at measuring what he should and shouldn't do regarding redemption...

Dumbledore is the commander who'd encourage the Christmas Truce of 1914, because he respects, understands, and grasps the humanity of the opposing side - especially after his experiences with Gellert Grindelwald. And he tries to live redemption every single day because of what he may or may not have done (but still certainly caused) with his sister.

So now we get to Snape. There are many complaints about how Snape, when performing his heel face turn, doesn't give a whit about Harry and James, only Lily, and is extremely selfish, and isn't truly redeemed, etc. For these reasons, apparently, Dumbledore should not trust Snape - or at least, should be harsher than he seems to be in canon.

But what we forget is that at the end of DH, we see that Dumbledore hit the nail right on the head and essentially guilt-tripped Snape into fully renouncing his ways while still not letting Snape forget his mistakes.

#+begin_quote
  "You disgust me," said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little. "You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?"

  Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore.

  "Hide them all, then," he croaked. "Keep her - them - safe. Please."

  "And what will you give me in return, Severus?"

  "In - in return?" Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, but after a long moment he said, "Anything."
#+end_quote

He doesn't seem very pansy-redeeming right now, does he? These scenes are precisely why I love canon Dumbledore - and because he's actually very wise.

EDIT: getting the hang of quote formatting.

I haven't noticed anything that the reader would be missing because of not being familiar with DF, and even managed to enjoy the story to a certain degree (Harry was being a tool at a certain plot arc, like one of the linked reviews complained about DF, but that was it). There was no technical or background knowledge that the reader was expected to know from DF, even the faes\faeries\or whatever were reasonably explained.

Not a ton of actual "demons" in DF, but one of the major groups of villains are a clan of Fallen angels, sealed inside 30 pieces of silver, that give great power to whoever holds the piece.

** I am yet to come across a story that features a purely manipulative\“evil” Dumbledore without making him an overpowered moron. I think this is because if he was both evil /and/ smart\wise, the author would have no chance of realistically making the protagonists win against him.

That said, there are three stories that I'd like to mention here:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] (Dumbledore) --- Even though Dumbledore /is/ manipulating Harry and others to his needs here, he's not portrayed as a 2-dimensional figure. He has a well-developed net of driving motivations, and even manages to gain Harry's trust by the later chapters despite all the conflicts that they were forced to go through.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]] (Flamel) --- Here Dumbledore's character starts out as the clichéd manipulative headmaster who is trying to return his main piece to the chessboard, but eventually manages to at least deviate from it. I mention this story because it had the best characterisation for Nicolas Flamel, and the best scenes with him.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son][Firebird Trilogy]] (Dumbledore) --- a smart and emotional character that continuously manages to protect Harry's life and interests against overwhelming odds and in a world that is hostile both to him and to Harry by its very nature. For reading rec. seekers: warning that this story's world is a shithole (even if the story itself is relatively well written).

*Spoilers for Worm Ahead*

Sounds about right. It's sorta like Coil and Alexandria from Worm. they had to get arrogant/stupid, before they could get dead. Though my head canon for Coil's death is that each time he uses his power there's a Coil that gets screwed over by the choice that the surviving Coil chose not to make meaning Coil's life looks sorta like the bottom panel of [[https://xkcd.com/931/][this xkcd]], so the Coil that got shot was just another one of those failures. My head canon for Alexandria's death is that Contessa had her removed becase her tarnished reputation made her more valuable as a sacrifice to appease the masses and maintain the integrity of the PRT and Protectorate than continue operating under her own will.
