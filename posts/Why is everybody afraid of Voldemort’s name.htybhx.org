As far as I know there wasn't a Taboo in the first Wizarding War. At some point people must have said his name without fear or nobody would even know his name. So what changed? Did Voldemort murder people who openly said his name?

My theory though would be a curse on his name that makes everybody too afraid to say his name. Similarly to the curse on the defence position at Hogwarts. Only powerful witches and wizards would be able to break the curse, like Dumbledore.

What do you think?


** You didn't know who had been placed under the imperius curse. So, an innocent conversation mentioning Voldemort. Instant target. Pattern emerges, anyone who speaks the name aloud, dies.

After years of this. The fear in ingrained, then taught to younger generations.

*** That's a good idea! For that everybody would have to know that the Death Eaters put people under the Imperius though. I don't know if that was public knowledge before Malfoy used it as his defence.

And I'd doubt that many would recognize such a pattern. What if a pure blood supporter says “Voldemort is doing a good thing with murdering muggleborns and blood traitors!”. Does he have to die? If not, and only people who oppose Voldemort are forbidden from saying the name, the recognizable pattern would be “publicly speaking out against Voldemort”.

**** I'm not sure how common the knowledge would be. Law enforcement would know, and as the war went on. The knowledge would proliferate. To what degree, idk. Not even mentioning it is an Unforgivable. I feel like most people know what they are. Covered in DADA 6th or 7th year?

100% agree that they would have started with those who spoke out. However, for the theory to work. It would need to get to the point. Where the utterance of the name, could have you killed.

I don't think a Death Eater would call him Voldemort. Instead, they use the term Dark Lord. Supporters of the cause wouldn't be targeted, for obvious reasons.

** My explanation:

#+begin_quote
  "There's something I still don't understand," Harry began slowly, not wanting to step on any toes. The others looked at him expectantly, so he went on. "The first war, from what I've heard, lasted for years--"

  "From 1970 to 1981," Hermione added. "According to most books, at least."

  "Over a decade, then," said Harry. "And yet this time, Voldemort's followers have infiltrated the Ministry with ease."

  Remus ran a hand through his greying hair. "That's a complex issue," he said. "One thing you should realise--especially you, Hermione--is that the history books have been written with hindsight. At the time, even well into the seventies, people had no idea what was happening. Certainly they wouldn't have said they were at war."

  "It began slowly," said Arthur. "I was just starting at the Ministry back then. Every few months there'd be an obituary in the paper, or an article about some tragic accident, but none of it seemed connected."

  "Except that they were all powerful witches and wizards. Some of them could have even given Dumbledore a fair run for his money," added Remus. "And not just in Britain, either... all over the world, powerful people were dying."

  The puzzle began to fit together. "Voldemort was eliminating rivals," Harry said with dawning horror. Tom Riddle had systematically assassinated every witch and wizard on Earth capable of challenging him in a duel. This was the man Harry had to kill.

  "We know that now," replied Remus, "but at the time no one had ever heard the name 'Voldemort'. By '75 people were beginning to connect some of the deaths, but no one had any idea who it was."

  "No one except Dumbledore," added Kingsley.

  "That's right," said Remus. "Dumbledore formed the Order of the Phoenix to gather evidence of Voldemort's activities. Containment seemed feasible, back then... everyone assumed that if only the killer could be exposed, the Ministry would have no problem bringing them to justice. But Voldemort proved to be far too slippery. As far as most people knew, /You-Know-Who,/ as the papers started to call him, was simply a particularly dangerous serial killer. Life went on as it always had."

  "That all changed in '77," said Kingsley, "when Voldemort revealed himself."
#+end_quote

Basically: people called him You-Know-Who because they /didn't/ know who. There was obviously a shadowy figure out there, going around and killing people, but no one had any idea who he was until he'd been doing it for many years already. By which time "You Know Who" had stuck as a name for what was essentially a boogeyman serial killer.

**** Not me. The second time around, Voldemort came back due to his horcruxes, and an entirely new body - two, actually, if we include the homunculus - had to be magically created for him, including the brains.

A great deal was clearly lost. This would also explain why there appears to be no elite class of horcrux users dominating the wizarding world, openly or otherwise, with their combination of ruthlessness and centuries or millennia of wisdom and experience.

I see clearly the presence of the trope that the Dark Arts might be an avenue to quick power, but in the long term they will inevitably betray the user. In Voldemort's case, making horcruxes, and even moreso actually using them to survive his first Darwin award, have eroded his decision making severely.

And I'd say it's visible throughout his life. Sure, he was a sadistic dominator already at 10, but if his ultimate goals became immortality and to gather all the magical power he could in his person, obscurity would have served him much better than the path he took. And he was more than smart enough to realize this - at least at first. But maybe that choice was lost to him as early as the first piece of his soul he tore out.

*** Hmm, that does explain the term You-Know-Who. But in PS, Hagrid doesn't /want/ to say Voldemort. And it isn't just Hagrid, if my head canon wasn't too much influenced by fan fiction.

By your explanation shouldn't people be afraid to say You-Know-Who in the same way as saying Voldemort? But the actual name is even more fear inciting.

Edit: What are you citing there? That isn't from the books, is it?

**** The idea is that there was a long, multi-year struggle to find out who Voldemort was. During that struggle, anyone who got close to the truth was killed.

Imagine that knowledge of Voldemort's identity was the wizarding equivalent of having the Death Star plans in your pocket. If the wrong person finds out that you've got it, you make yourself a target.

**** PTSD???

I'd imagine that in such times people wouldn't want to be talking about Voldemort at the dinner table and it wouldn't be a casual topic. So the only time people hear the name Voldemort spoken is right before an attack.

"It's Voldemort!" and all hell breaks loose.

After years of this it becomes a natural instinct to run when you here the name Voldemort. Even after the war people still flinch at his name. The trait was picked up by the next generation by learning it from their parents.

***** I can't believe I didn't think of that. That's probably the best explanation for the fear.

While I still think that doesn't completely explain Hagrid's behavior in PS one could blame that on over-dramatization by Rowling to make it more mysterious (which totally worked, of course).

** I like the whole "names have power" trope.

Like in hpmor (ch. 3):

#+begin_quote
  "Voldemort?" Harry whispered. It should have been funny, but it wasn't. The name burned with a cold feeling, ruthlessness, diamond clarity, a hammer of pure titanium descending upon an anvil of yielding flesh. A chill swept over Harry even as he pronounced the word, and he resolved then and there to use safer terms like You-Know-Who.

** I wrote in one story about the first war that this fear actually started out of compassion. People/students were only talking in hushed words or about 'you-know-who' because so many people already lost someone they loved to him and his death eaters and any mention of the name could people around you just to break down in tears.

And that leaded to people feeling uncomfortable at saying the name at all and that tense feeling and the fear of him and his men grew and kind of united itself with this uncomfortable feeling and with time only the fear stayed and nobody really remembered how it started to not say the name

** I don't think you need a curse. Voldemort is a prodigious wizard. What would you do if you knew with certainty that the only reason you are alive is because Voldemort did /not/ decide you should die? I'd be circumspect as all hell. Do I know if he has managed to come up with some bit of magic that allows him to listen in on me if I talk about him? I'd not say his name, in fact, I wouldn't discuss him (publically), period.

The flinch-when-name-spoken is a bit over-the-top, but then again, Fanon has extrapolated this to ridiculousness; it wasn't that bad in Canon. /Plus/, it does scale with power -- Sirius uses the name, for instance, your average wizard (that can't even produce a simple shield charm -- keep this in mind for *how vast* the gulf in power is) does not.

** I would think it's a mix of Voldemort's secrecy for most of his entire activity, nasty accidents that happened to people who might openly oppose him and the fact that he had performed so much dark magic on himself that even his name oozed of it. If we piece the timeline together from the information given in the books, it would seem that Voldemort was more of a charismatic political activist for most of the entire first war. According to Sirius, his terrorists attacks that made a lot of the non-Death Eater blood purists (such as the Orion and Walburga) back out of supporting him would have happened after Regulus joined the Death Eaters (sometime in 1978) - as an aside it seems like a lot of the older wizards, including the Potters, Abraxas and Orion died of Dragonpox in an outbreak in 1979 so that could have been planned too.

Therefore I would think that Voldemort started having a reputation as a dark wizard even in the 60s (Dumbledore heard of him) but was mostly dealing with political activism. After a while, if you are too vocal on a certain matter, you will get some rivals and people who openly criticize you. From what we know of Voldemort is that he was quite capable to harm people without the incident ever being linked back to him. As such, I think that people started associated his name with a curse that brought harm upon the caster. Not quite unlike, how in folklore around Europe, the devil should not be mentioned by his name because it's considered a curse.
