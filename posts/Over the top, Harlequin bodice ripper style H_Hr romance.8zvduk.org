I am looking for some Harry Hermione pairings in the style of the trashy romance novels of the 70s and 80s


** I've occasionally seen this type of story mentioned metafictionally (i.e. books that exist inside the story a la The Monster Book of Monsters), usually either featuring Harry (to his eternal mortification) or secreted away by some of the female characters. Or both. I've never seen someone write a fic in this style though, sorry :(
