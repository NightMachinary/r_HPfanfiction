Sorry if the spellings incorrect, but how come there aren't more cool arty spells? Snape made that cool one, so how come we only hear about the same ones?


** The best explanations are efficiency and difficulty.

For the former, here is an example from the Standard Book of Spells Grade 1: the Levitation Charm. There are alternatives that exist like the Hover Charm or the Rocket Charm that do similar things, and yet people only ever use the Levitation Charm. The explanation is that the Levitation Charm is simply better at creating the desired effect than the others, so why bother using them. And spells have a range based on experience and skill, where one can achieve far more variable outcomes than previously. New spells are created when one wants to do something so different that they cannot really accomplish it with an already existing spell easily.

For the latter, /magic is hard/. The best way to understand it is that only really gifted people like Dumbledore or Voldemort really have a good enough understanding to tinker and experiment successfully. Not only that, but from what we know of Pandora Lovegood, experimenting with spells and magics is extremely volatile and dangerous. If you aren't careful, it could even kill you.

** What's the point? If there is a spell for all occasions why make a new one that does the same thing? I'm sure that over time there have been plenty of spells created to solve problems but how many problems occur enough to make a new spell?

** Presumably, because spellcrafting is more or less as difficult as inventing new technological gadgets is in the real world.

(But of course, if you get right down to it, /all/ spells were invented by someone once; /Pottermore/, the video games and other spinoffs have a lot of information about the background of even the most common spells.)

** You could ask why don't all Muggles invent new technologies? We all have the same capabilities to do it, but we focus on other things in life, take different classes that teach us different things. The ones with the interest and skill do it, and if there is a wider need for that spell, I'm sure it will start to gain traction.
