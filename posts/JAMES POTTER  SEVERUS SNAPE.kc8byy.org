** The HP fanfiction discord have a "Was Snape good or bad?" discussion pretty much every other day, it's easily the most discussed character in the entire fandom there with a fair share of people on both sides. Is this going to become a theme in the subreddit now as well?

Interestingly, it seems like there's plenty of people making "Snape sucks!" posts, but very few who make the reverse, despite opinions usually being roughly equal in comments. I wonder why that is?

For what it's worth, I think both were just as bad during the early years (although James started it), and I truly believe that James played a big part in the reason why Snape fell in with the Death Eaters in the first place. Doesn't excuse the decision, obviously, but still.

While I have a hard time feeling any sympathy for Snape after he became a Death Eater and later a teacher bullying children, mostly just pity, I do very much sympathize with young Severus. Fanfics where he turns his life around during Marauder-era before he makes the decision to join the DEs, is one of the types of fics I like the most, and is a major reason my OTP is what it is.

** Warning: Lost post incoming:

James was a bully but grew up, enough to even warrent Lily Evans being interested in him. (Note the whole James asks Lily out repeatedly is simply fanfiction, nothing more)

As a Severus Snape fan, this hurts me but if I'm to be as unbiased as possible:

Severus grew up in a horrible childhood, while James was dotted on and was given everything he wanted, thanks to having two older parents, who couldn't have children, before he came along.

Severus was poor, had a horrible father, and a mother who loved Tobias, or was too afraid of Tobias, to leave him.(Maybe even a mixture of fear and love).

Severus, only asked to spare Harry's life, when he realized that Lily was in danger, heck. If anything, he asked Voldemort and Dumbledore both to protect Lily, whereas Dumbledore brought up James and Harry, and Severus agreed with them too.

Severus, meanwhile, for 6 years of Harry's life, termented Harry and other students. Poor Neville's Boggart, was Severus Snape himself, instead of Voldemort or Bellatrix.

Severus, who was the adult in the situation, could have been the better person, could have changed, could have seen that Harry was much more then James Potter, but he let his hatred over James take him too far.

For those who say: Well he was a spy, he was supposed to act like that. I think, that's a rather poor way to think. If anything, Severus didn't deserve to be a teacher, not saying anything about fanfiction, but the way he made fun of Hermione, will always stick out to me as being cruel for the sake of being cruel when he said he saw no difference in her looks after an attack by the Slytherins.

I like Severus Snape, because of how complicated he is, if more people wrote him from the abused boy aspect, instead of the obsessed Lily aspect, that'd be more interesting to me.

But: If we are trying to be unbiased here: James realized what Sirius was doing (Either overheard or maybe Pettigrew told him, or Sirius himself told him, who knows)

Even though he hated Severus, I highly doubt James would want to see him dead, and certainly not because of Remus. He saved Severus, despite their mutual hatred of each other, James grew up past being a bully, dated, and married Lily Evans.

Severus Snape is an adult still stuck in childish pettyness.

McGonagall sent 1st Years (10-12 year olds at the most) into the Forbidden Forest as a detention, when there was a known unicorn killer on the loose, with a half-giant not known for his tact or definite control of his magic.

She punishes Neville & practically locks him out of the common room when there's a mass murderer (to the school's knowledge) on the loose.

Trelawney drinks cooking sherry enough to smell of it (--- she's probably an alcoholic ---) & hits students, as well as "predicting" their deaths in class.

Hagrid laughs whilst his own animal breeds attack the students.

Lupin endangers the school by not telling anyone that Black is an animagus, that he knows the secret passages & forgets to take his Wolfsbane Potion on a full moon night (though the last one is more understandable, given his panic at the time).

Quirrell hosts parasictic Voldemort on the back of his head, directly tries to kill Harry (or Voldemort using Quirrell) & releases a mountain troll into the school as a distraction.

Lockhart purposefully tries to /Obliviate/ 2nd years simply so he could be a coward & get away with his crimes.

Umbridge uses a blood quill, to torture students, & enforces ridiculous Ministerial Decrees.

"Moody" should be obvious, since he was a Death Eater working to resurrect Voldemort, but he also physichally assaulted Draco Malfoy by transfiguring him into a ferret.

The Carrows, again, are Death Eater "teachers" which use the /Cruiciatus/ curse (the literal torture curse) on students & give them Dark Lord Propaganda 101.

EDIT: There are things that I've missed here as well, I'm sure of it.

Well, we had the Cool Girl, and the Cool Poor Person, so I guess the Cool Victim was to be expected. Although I highly doubt anyone who thinks overcoming trauma is as easy as going "Yeah, I choose to get over it" actually has any serious trauma.

Childhood abuse affects brain development, and trauma victims often have physical, sometimes violent and impairing reactions to triggers, but I guess they can just choose to ignore that.

Too bad nobody told all the victims who end up killing themselves that they just have to make the choice to get over it. Someone should also tell all the poor people currently using food banks that they should choose going to Oxbridge instead, since that would noticeably improve their lives.

Having symptoms of PTSD/CPTSD following abuse is not a failing and does not make one a failure, certainly not in the sense that being unable to resist ice cream is a failure if your stated, express goal is to lose weight. Also, you'll be glad to know that mentally unwell and bitter as Snape might have been, he was still able to cast a dazzling Patronus, and I find this evidence of internal fortitude and strength much more impressive than living some socially sanctioned predetermined version of a full life.

None of these things were available to Snape, on the contrary, Dumbledore wanted Snape was stuck on his part as possible so that he would forever feel obligated to atone for Lily's death. Snape divided his time between Spinner's End where he was abused and Hogwarts where he was abused.

Something over nothing... such as... fighting to make sure your best friend's death wasn't in vain? To save lives? To end the war that resulted in so much loss and agony? Or even to... try to save your ex-bullies' lives? Who in their right mind could say Snape did /nothing/? And why is it that bitterness, and not cruelty, is the quality you judge so harshly?

I was abused. I'm merely fortunate that no cult recruited new members in my bedroom because I suspect I would have signed up like /that./ I had many opportunities to improve my life that Severus never did. I have good friends, a solid relationship, a good job. /Still bitter./ I didn't choose to have lingering mental illness.

Seriously. Snape is why Harry's parents died, and he still treated Harry like shit. And yet Harry did not stew in bitterness, he forgave and moved on. So yeah, I'll sooner be inspired by Harry and his compassion and forgiveness than by your platitudes.

************ I expressly stated I don't want your life story because that is a very rude thing to ask someone and I only pretended to ask because you made an example of yourself, which means it was fair game. I am sorry about everything that has happened to you, and glad you're making progress, but it's irrelevant to the argument that not everyone has a ~choice to not be bitter. You've addressed none of the other points I raised.

Snape is one of the only representations I know in popular media of someone deeply traumatized and flawed who, while still obviously traumatized, managed to do good in the world and live a life of meaning and purpose, even if no one knew, even if he believed no one would know his story. It's important. Reducing this to "he chose to stay bitter and not live life to the fullest" is absurd. Sure, after the first war he could have taken credit for bringing about Voldy's downfall and fucked off to live in South America on the beach, but then Harry would have died on his first Quidditch match and we'd all be celebrating Voldemort Day. But I mean, as long as he's not /bitter/...

Since you demanded details, I was raised by a single mother, a mentally ill one at that (diagnosed biploar and borderline, possibly narcissistic[1]), who was absent for work for half the month and left me in the care of paid nannies, at least one of whom was physically abusive (mom didn't tell me who my father was until I was 18); my mother was also prone to name calling (greatest hits include: "worthless", "whore", and "selfish piece of shit"), doing drugs in front of me, and I was essentially the parent in the relationship. I don't know if you're aware of the terms enmeshment or parentification, but that's me :) I was moderately bullied at school as well though I largely got over that, even if I still struggle with finding my place in groups and such. Then you throw in a member of the extended family of the child molester persuasion who threatened me with actual death if yours truly didn't comply, and you get quite the heady mix :) hope this satisfies you! And thank you, thank you, thank you, for this platform to speak out, because I can't even bring up this last bit in /therapy/, even though I'm on /medication/. But I guess, if love and a desire to improve oneself won't do, there's also the urge to score points on the internet...

[1] Which of course was also her ~choice to have her life completely ruined by mental illness despite the fact that she was religious about her medicine and therapy and really, actually tried her best. It's her fault she never got over multiple horrific traumas, I guess.

My point is (and I do have a point, believe it or not), is that what my mom accomplished was a hundred times better than nothing, and so is what I'm working on accomplishing, despite the very acute possibility that I won't "get over it" until I'm dead (my mom certainly didn't).

****** The same Lily who was already taking James's side over Snape's while calling him an "arrogant toerag", who smiled at James tormenting Snape, and who, according to JKR, already had the hots for James while he was still a bully? The Lily who thought Peter was a great person? That Lily?

And it's canon that James lied to her and continued abusing Snape behind her back so... he manifestly did not grow out of anything.

He also tanked Lily's relationship with her sister, and laughed at Muggles whose lives he endangered during a chase so... what growth? Where is it? Where's the remorse for abusing Snape?

******* Fucking hell they were all bad, James was an arrogant bully who amongst his friends was actually a great guy, Lily was a smart and optimistic girl who saw the best in everyone and snape was a man stuck in the middle of dark arts and love. Lily eventually realised that snape wasn't the guy she was friends with and even James was better than him, about the hots I have no clue and he didn't tank anything: their relationship was terrible already. All James did was stand up for wizards which was what Lily, due to her love for her sister, couldn't do. James grew up. Lily realised that and realised that she loved him, snape tried to become a death eater but couldt hurt lily so he failed. Of all of them Lily is the best and there really isn't much you can say against her in my opinion

******** Bellatrix was also a great girl among her friends, how is that relevant?

Point is, Lily marrying James says absolutely nothing about him, it just shows she's either a terrible judge of character, was kept in the dark about James's actions, or she was just bad enough to have the hots for a bully.

And yes, James ruined her relationship with Petunia. They were on speaking terms, they met so they could introduce Vernon and James to each other, and James started laughing at Vernon and flaunting his inherited wealth.

James wasn't even better than a trashcan, let alone Snape.

******** Yes, exactly. The point is that thinking someone is a good person does not make them a good person.

The reason Lily married James was the she either did not know he was a trash person, or she was fine with it. The reason was not that he magically did become a better person (I mean, it's canon he didn't, since Lupin and Sirius outright admit he lied to Lily and went behind her back).

James tanked plenty, he mocked Vernon and flaunted his wealth, leading to Petunia no longer speaking to Lily. Both that and the chase are short stories written by JKR shortly after the publication of DH.

**** Uhm. But... Snape was a bitter adult that unleashed his aganst with somewhat restrained verbal mistreatment of his students ( bad and immature behavior yes, but ultimately when it came to action he protected students at the best of his abilities , and we cannot say he was not prickly and unpleasant to adults as well. As a youngster he was racist yes, but in a context of a traumatic childhood that gave some kind of motivation for his racism, and we cannot say his â€˜conflict ' with the marauders was not motivated.

On the other side, James was a genuinely cruel and entitled kid that judged others on the ground of superficial labels despite of being well loved and justly treated. His idea of fun was undressing another student before a crowd and his choice of close friends included a cronie -Peter-, an guilty enabler ( Remus), and a bully even worse than him.

I am not a fan of the argument â€˜he hated Snape but he did not want to use his friend as a murder weapon to see him dead, therefore James is somewhat redeeemed/a good person deep down â€˜. I don't think he should be rewarded golden stars for stopping the killing of someone he hated and I don't understand at all Dumbledore â€˜s / Rowling speech to paint that as saintly and heroic behavior. It was just a decent thing to do, that just happened to be entirely convenient for him and his friends as Remus was likely to be executed for eating another student, and Sirius would have some legal troubles if his family did not bail him out of it.

Now, let's say you are a normal high school student and your class includes a semi vocal Nazi symphatizer and a bully who targets him pretty regularly with the intent of humiliating him. Would you stop and think which is worse? They are two rather different kinds of evil, but evil nonetheless.

The â€˜he grew out of it' argument for James is just on the same level as the â€˜Snape Reformed later on â€˜ so we could argue that they are still on the same level of anything.

*** Yeah, the Marauders were bullies. But they (eventually) grew out of it. Snape, on the other hand, stayed bitter for years, to the point of being someone's worst fear.
