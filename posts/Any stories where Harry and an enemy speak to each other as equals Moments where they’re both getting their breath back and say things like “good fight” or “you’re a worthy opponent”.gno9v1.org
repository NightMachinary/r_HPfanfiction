Yes they're trying to kill each other, but that doesn't mean they have to spend the entire time screaming and growling at each other.

Harry is supposed to be marked as Voldie's equal, so it'd be nice if he was treated as such.

Extra points if he's actually capable of being equal to voldie in some way.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
