Hi I'm looking for recommendations of good Harry/ female OCs.

Either longer stories (preferable) or one shots would be greatly appreciated.

Thank y'all


** I've been waiting for this for my whole time after reading this fic, It's my second most liked fanfic, ever. Any fandom

Linkffn(harry potter and the elemental's power)

I love how the relationship develops in the fic, if a bit obvious, you'll most likely know who it is when Harry finally meets her.
