Looking for Fiction where Harry learns exotic magic;

Native American Shaman magic, Voodoo from New Orleans or Haiti, Japanese Onmyoji, Norse runes and smithing, Eygptian curses and hieroglyphs.

Maybe even Magic that most don't think about; Tattoo magic, Summoning of spirits and demons, Puppetry/golem creation.

Preferably stories above 20k words and at least update within a year.


** It's hot garbage written well before I'd developed much talent in writing, nor did I have any sense of how much edge was too much, but there's the story I wrote titled "Harry the Blood Demon."

Basically, Harry kills Dudley and in the process unlocks a weird variant of the Animagus transformation, which convinces him that he's a "Demon." He ends up stumbling across a murdered wizard with a spellbook on blood magic and goes a little bit crazy developing it into a powerful form of magic.

It's currently dead, but I may re-write it if I ever figure out A) where I want the story to go and B) how to do it without sounding like an edgy teen again.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

** With You by My Side, linkffn(7801230)

They are prodigies. They study, research, experiment, publish their findings, and spend holidays abroad researching foreign magic. The whole time they are doing this, they are also pushing forward magical theory. A few parts are forced, but the horcrux situation is a unique way to do it. OH YEAH! The Durseleys aren't that bad in this one. They tolerate each other.

​

They learn druidic magic, from the native americans, from south america.

  Harry and Hermione are 'child prodigies'. Destiny managed to throw them together and they form a bond far stronger than any seen in the wizarding world. They use their intelligence to bring innovations into the world that have not been thought before.
