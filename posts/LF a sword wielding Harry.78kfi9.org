It's not a bad fic if you can get past the first few chapters which are kind of edgy. Harry discovers and wields several legendary swords throughout the story. I don't know about "well trained" though, as it focuses more on the swords' magical powers rather than actual swordplay.

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.

What? I dropped that fic because it never seems to stop being edgy.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

*** 1) It could be a magic sword that cuts through magical protections. The old "melee is stronger than ranged" adage.

2) I haven't killed anyone with a sword recently, but I have to assume they are more stealthy than magic, so better for assassinations.

3) Sets up a much more dramatic tone for an execution!

4) You can blatantly rip-off star wars and have the sword reflect spells back to their casters. Or be a bit more original and have the sword just block spells.

5) Sentient swords. Ever read Elric of Melnibone? That is some good shit low fantasy and it features a few self-aware weapons.

6) ???

7) Profit

*** I have Harry get into a sword fight in my California Dreamin' story. I originally wrote it as a magic duel and neither me or my husband were satisfied with how it turned out, so I rewrote it as a sword duel and I think it came out much better.

To me, a duel with magic just seems so cut and dried. One Killing Curse and it's done, right? So what do you do? Hide behind a Shield Charm and hope the other guy gets bored and walks away?

A sword fight though--feinting, parrying, slashing, footwork, first blood, fatal stab/slash/chop. The weight of the sword in the hand, the shock along your arm when you block your opponent, the sting and burn of a cut. The satisfaction of landing a hit on your opponent, circling, looking for an opening while keeping up your own guard.

It could be that I'm not very creative when it comes to magical duels, but I felt that fighting with swords lent the scene more immediacy.

*** 100000000000% agree! Magic can do so much. It ignores physics, creates something out of nothing, literally erases matter from the world. There's so much to do with magic, especially harry potter magic since it's so versatile, and we get hung up on swords??
