#+TITLE: One of the best DH fanfics I have read. The trio set out to find Horcruxes. Ginny joins them and it shows Harry and Ginny's relationship more. It was written before DH and it is actually very close to it. There is also a twist with Dudley. Hope you enjoy.

** This story was actually well-known in the fandom and rumored to be a leaked copy of the seventh book in the months preceding the release of Deathly Hallows.

It is pretty good.
