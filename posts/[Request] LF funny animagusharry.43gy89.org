what I mean is he's some sort of stupid animal like a sloth or tortoise not a phoenix or bear. I don't know why but this idea just appeals to me

  The war is over and “eighth year” is about to begin at Hogwarts. But for Harry and Draco, nothing is quite the same. Harry's looking for an escape, Draco's looking for a friend. Does a little black bunny hold the answers for both of our boys?

*** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Manipulator of Destiny)

But I wouldn't recommend this story at all. Contains all the bad tropes of an Indy!Harry story, such as Manipulative!Dumbledore, magical trunk training, super helpful goblins, etc.

  Post OotP. Harry finds that Dumbledore has been less than honest or helpful with him, takes control of his own life and finds the training he needs from others. HHr, NL, no slash. COMPLETE
