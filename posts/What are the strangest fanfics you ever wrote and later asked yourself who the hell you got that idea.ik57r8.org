What are those ideas you later asked yourself how you even got them?

I want your craziest ideas and stories.

Mine is probably when I was talking with some friends and was asked to explain why in the movies Gryffindor has a golden amarillo in their common room and from that conversation a wrote a story how a couple of hundred years ago a house teacher of Gryffindor liked to party with his students and was accidentally turned into a frozen amarillo and people are still unable to turn him back and some wild stuff that happened around that. (like Gryffindors talking the amarillo with them to places they should go and argue that they have a teacher with them and stuff like this)


** I've got one, as yet unpublished, wherein Hagrid had a little more to drink prior setting out to bring Harry to Dumbledore.

Rather than #4 Privett Drive, he ended up at #4 Private Drive, the home of one Snidely Whiplash, Evile Villain extraordinaire.

Whiplash discovers the sleeping child the next morning, but carries on with his day, because it wasn't his problem and Widows and Orphans weren't going to evict themselves.

When he arrived home that night, the kid was still sleeping on his steps, he goes inside, carefully stepping over the boy, prepares his dinner, when he hears on the radio that a mild early fall blizzard is rolling in.

Now, Snidley might be evil, and he would be the first one to tell you that he is but he isn't a jerk. So he goes out to bring the kid in out of the weather. The kid woke up at Snidley's touch and begins learning about this new place: "what dat?"

Since it was only a mild early fall blizzard, Snidely and the kid were only snowed in for three weeks. As soon as the snow thawed to the point that Whiplash could push the door of his cabin open, he delivered the child to the local Mounty post (to Inspector Fenwick, NOT Doright.)

By the time Whiplash is back at his cabin, he finds the kid waiting for him.

This repeats 4 times before the Inspector informs Whiplash that the boy had evidently adopted him and he might as well quit fighting the inevitable, and this is how Harry Whiplash came to be.

​

Harry started accompanying Snidley on his rounds, including the weekly kidnapping of Nell Fenwick...

​

"Dad?" 9-year-old Harry asked.

"Yes, Harry?" Whiplash asked as he looped the rope around Miss Fenwick's narrow waist, starting the elaborate knot that would secure her to the railroad tracks.

"What happens if the train comes?"

"You know," Snidely said, standing up and doffing his stovepipe hat so he could mop his brow, "I'm not really sure. Doright always shows up before that happens."

"Or his horse," Nell Fenwick suggested helpfully.

"Or his horse," Snidely agreed with a nod. "If they didn't show up, it would probably be messy."

The thunderous clatter of steel-shod hooves alerted the villains and Nell of the arrival of the stalwart hero of our tale, the Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman's Horse, known to the world only as Horse arrived on the scene, saving the day.

The mounted policeman himself arrived most of 15 minutes later, inexplicably with a bucket stuck on his head.

​

So, Harry Whiplash goes to Hogwarts... because, of course, he does.

I haven't decided what House he'll be sorted into, but I do know that he's going to take one look at Draco, with his weapons-grade hair care routine, and identifies him as the Hero of the story. (though Harry would have to admit, he expected the hero to have more of a chin, but Draco was still young, maybe he'll grow one as he matures) Draco's status as a hero, of course, means that Pansy is the Damsel who needs to be distressed. She finds herself ending up tied to railroad tracks and the never before mentioned Hogwarts Saw Mill feeder track with alarming regularity.

But Draco never shows up to rescue her. And Draco doesn't have a horse, but Crabbe and Goyle show up accidentally a few times and between them, they are almost as smart as a horse, so Harry decides that's good enough.

This goes on every year with Harry constantly trying and failing to get the Hogwarts student body to boo and hiss when he enters a room, and Pansy is frankly getting sick of it. So 5th or 6th year she takes Harry to bed and suddenly he understands what all the fuss was about.

​

I haven't got an ending yet, but I do know Harry is going to fuck up all of Voldemort's plans in his pursuit of being Evil. He's going to House Break the Basilisk, Steal the Goblet of fire and mail it home to his dad, start a House Elf Mob by exposing Dobby to Gangster movies leading to elves in pinstriped suits and carrying tiny violin cases.

"Nice Manor House youse got here," Dobby said soothingly, "it would bes a shames if something was to happen to it..."

The highlight of Harry's Hogwarts career would be his trial in front of the Wizengamot for roughing up the Dementors, with the demons in the courtroom, pointing at him accusingly while wearing neckbraces and casts on their arms and legs.

Finally, the recognition he'd always wanted.

** Soooooo...... um, yeah. Wow.

I wrote a Draco/Myrtle lemon.

Set during sixth year, when Draco is under pressure and has turned to Myrtle for solace.

He discovers a necromantic ritual that was designed to give a ghost a physical body for a few hours, ostensibly for the purpose of torturing said ghost for information. He correctly reasons that if the ritual could make the ghost feel pain for a few short hours, it could also be used to give the ghost... pleasure.

And... yeah. I honestly have no idea where the inspiration for it came from.

** A number of years ago I was feeling a little under the weather. Bit of a fever for a few days, nothing serious, but in that time I came up with a quick little throwaway idea. And then I wrote it. Looking back, I have no idea why. All I can really say in my defence is... fever dream?

* Dobby the House-Penguin:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: dobby-the-house-penguin
  :END:
Harry had been banished to his room while the Dursleys entertained Mr. and Mrs. Mason. With a bit of luck he could get some more of his homework done. He briefly contemplated writing another letter to his friends but so far the only mail he'd received from them had been covered in bird shit.

He'd asked Hedwig if she was having problems with her bowel movements and she'd just given him an imperious and very hacked off look that had lead to him dropping the matter. He put it down as a mystery.

He sidled into his room and made a puzzled noise as he was met by an unexpected sight.

There was a penguin sitting on his bed. There was a long moment of silence as Harry met the unsettlingly flat black and white eyes. Upon Harry's entrance the eyes had grown slightly and the penguin's flippers had quivered in excitement.

It immediately slipped off the bed and its little pink feet made quiet ‘shlup shlup' noises as it landed on the ground.

The penguin appeared to be wearing a pillowcase. Harry had no idea how it stayed on, penguins weren't known for having especially broad shoulders but the creature before him looked fairly at ease in the frayed and stained fabric.

“Uh,” he said in confusion. He looked at Hedwig in the hope that she might verify his sanity but she was unfortunately still asleep in her cage.

“AHHHAHHHAHHAH!” cried the penguin loudly enough that it would surely be heard downstairs. “AhhHHhahhHHAHHHhahhHHAHHhhAHhhHAah!”

It slapped its wings together enthusiastically and bowed low enough that its beak touched the floor.

“SShhh!” Harry said urgently as he rushed forward to secure the bird's beak. “How did you get in here?”

Though muffled by Harry's hand holding its beak shut the bird seemed to respond. “Mhmmhmhmmmhmhmh,” it said.

It looked up at him with blank penguin eyes, turning its head periodically so that both eyes could get in on the action, and Harry felt completely lost.

“Can you understand me?” he asked tentatively as he released the bird.

“AHHah!” it said with a frantic nod of the head.

“Can you speak?” he tried.

“AHHah!” it said again with another similarly enthusiastic nod.

“English?”

It shook its head and Harry got the impression of a heart-felt sadness. “Oohhah!”

Harry thought for a moment. “Can you write?”

The penguin looked down at its flippers for a moment before looking back up at Harry blankly. “Oohhah!”

“Right,” Harry said drily. “So it's charades then?”

“Aherk?” it said with a quizzical tilt of the head.

“Like, acting the words out,” Harry explained.

“AHHHAHHHAHHHAHHAHHAH!” cried the bird as it bounced from one foot to the other, the ‘shlup' sound returning.

“Shhh,” Harry said again quickly. “The Dursleys have visitors and they don't want to be disturbed.”

“AHHahAHH!” said the penguin with an avian nod.

“Look, why are you here?” Harry asked again.

“AHHhhHAH---” the bird began.

Harry quickly cut the bird off. “Act it, remember.”

“AHHah!” The bird nodded and shlupped its way over to Harry's meagre desk before climbing up onto it slowly and with many false starts.

Then it shat on his homework.

“Bloody hell!” Harry hissed as he ran forward to try and rescue what he discovered was his transfiguration essay. “What are you doing?”

“AHHHAHHAHHAHHHHAHH!” said the penguin before shitting on another piece of his homework. Potions this time.

“Look, stop it!” said Harry as he desperately tried to gather up and save the remaining homework. “I'll get in trouble if I hand in my homework covered in shit.”

“AHHah!” cried the penguin happily and it flapped its stubby wings together with a slap.

Harry was doused in bird shit. A literal heap of shit was dropped on him from above and began to slowly soak through his threadbare clothes. His homework was all ruined. At least it didn't smell too bad.

“Urgh, what was that for?” he said as he tried to find something /not/ covered in shit to clean his face with. “Now I have to do it all over before I go back.”

“Oohah!” said the bird with a frantic shake of the head.

Harry paused and looked at the bird's wide eyes. “I shouldn't do it?”

“Oohah!” said the bird just as energetically.

“You mean I shouldn't go back to Hogwarts?”

“AHHah!” said the bird loudly while happily flapping its wings together.

“But I have to!” Harry cried, the still-wet shit forced to the back of his mind. “All my friends are there.”

“Oohah!” the penguin pointed at one of Harry's shit-encrusted letters. “AHhhAHHOoHHHHAHH!”

Belated realisation suddenly dawned. “Wait, it was /you/ that was shitting on my letters!”

The bird looked down bashfully and made a small ‘AH' noise.

Harry nearly asked why on earth the stupid bird would do something like that but in a flash of foresight knew that any answer would certainly involve a lot of bird shit.

“Look,” he said as reasonably as he could manage given the circumstances. “Whatever the reason is I /have/ to go back.”

The penguin narrowed its eyes. “AHAHHAHHAHAH!” it said loudly before disappearing from sight with a pop.

Suddenly there was a scream from downstairs and in a moment of terrible clarity Harry knew what had happened. Despite that he ran for the dining room as fast as his legs would carry him, near enough tumbling down the stairs in his haste.

The penguin was floating over the dinner table and being watched with now mute amazement by the assembled diners.

“AHHHAHHHHAHHAHHHHAHHAAAHAHHHAHHHAH!” it cried as it pointed at Harry.

It flapped its wings together with a soft slap and as before a huge mass of bird shit materialised over the heads of everyone in the room before descending in a stinking cloud of yellow and brown.

The penguin then flapped its wings together one last time and disappeared.

Harry and the rest of the room stared in mute astonishment and disgust before Mrs. Mason and Aunt Petunia started screaming incoherently. Uncle Vernon began turning an unpleasant shade of puce beneath the near centimetre thick layer of bird-shit.

To complete the scene an owl flew in through the open window and deposited a short letter in Harry's hands.

/Dear Mr. Potter,/

/We have received intelligence that a Penguin Shit Charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine.../

All in all it was a shit night.

** I've almost completed a Harry/Katie oneshot where I used a former classmate as the base for Katie. The age fits perfectly, but she was by far the most perverted person I ever met. Girl had no filter and very little respect for authority, which meant a lot of awkward questions where I am still scratching my head where she came from with that. Great fun to be around, even if I sometimes just wanted to randomly die rather than answer one of her questions.

I've included literal quotes (well, as accurately as I could translate) and tamed some of what she said down, but I bet more than one review will call the dialogue unbelievable. And a few more who slutshame.

As for other crazy ideas, I've made a few attempts at a Teddy&Delphi sibling relationship where either both were raised by Andromeda or Delphi by Andromeda and Teddy by Harry and Tonks. But I really dislike writing based on DH since there are so many issues with that book, mostly centered around Harry being a Horcrux and the final battle and I usually end up with a wall of exposition trying to retcon some sense into book 7 when I try next-gen.

And let's not forget my response to a prompt here where OP asked for Hermione being pregnant but not knowing the father, where I decided that the prompt was silly and instead made all potential "fathers" female and Hermione a lesbian because I found that more plausible than Hermione having unprotected sex with Malfoy, Snape and Nott within a few weeks (OP's suggestion).
