Hi everyone! As the title says, I'm looking for fanfictions that feature good Wizard duels, maybe even a Duelling club if the story takes place at Hogwarts, and bonus points if the the duel scenes are especially creative (not the usual Stupefy/Expelliarmus).

If you have any recommendations, please let me know!


** linkffn(The Accidental Animagus)

Harry grows up adopted by the Grangers. When a Slytherin insults his adoptive sister Hermione, Harry demands satisfaction and requests a formal wizards duel in the middle of the great hall.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** The Alexandra Quick series has a dueling club, as well as an annual halloween competition.

e; the stuff dealing with younger years is fairly straightforward, just stupefy or other simple spells since that's all they know, but the upper year stuff gets more complex.

** Some of my favorite duels:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort][I Am Lord Voldemort?]], linkffn(12980210), has multiple great duels, including a mental contest between SI Voldemort and Dumbledore.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), has another great duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort that involves lots of transfiguration and alchemy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]], linkffn(11463030), has a titanic duel between Hermione and Bellatrix.

I personally dislike teenager Harry defeating Voldemort in a fair duel, as I don't like this kind of power progression.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power. Translated from Russian.)

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

There's also an ongoing third story, linkffn(Annals of Arithmancy by White Squirrel), which is shorter and more episodic.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** DP&SW has some of my favorite duels, but they are pretty far apart and not the main focus of the fic:

Systems have a place in novels. "Oh no, gravity is video game logic, better abandon that too in my novel and have everyone just floating around, propelling themselves by either exhaling or farting, much more mystical and creative that way"

That's true, but it's an AU, so who cares?

I don't really like all of Starfox5's ideas either, but I really feel sorry for the guy when people can't help but exclaim constantly how OOC his characters are or how the rules are different from canon. Must be pretty tiring for AU writers.

***** Part of your response seems to having nothing to do with what I said so I'll skip that.

Games and video games have to adhere to strict rules that are easily judged. Which is why mana/energy points/health is generally available to the players in plain terms. This system is obfuscating the narrative of the story being told in the game. Getting tired/taking a wound or whatever else may occur. In literature this sort of abbreviated storytelling is absolutely a negative. As a fantasy author you can and some would say should have a firm understanding of what can and can not be done. Having this system is not the same thing as following video game logic as I criticized and I think you have to contort my logic pretty far to make it fit your your gravity straw man.

It's not a strawman, I'm just trying to point out how rejecting systems outright is absurd. Clearly you don't believe that we should abandon gravity and I wasn't trying to claim that is your belief.

Sure. I agree that having some kind of Mana counter during a fight is probably a bad idea, similarly as having a blood pressure counter (is blood pressure video game logic? or is it just problematic if it's presented in this manner?) when a fighter is bleeding out might be kinda ridiculous. That doesn't say anything about the usefulness or uselessness of mana or blood pressure as a concept within a novel. In fact, if you are writing a fantasy novel and your super duper figher has lost a liter of blood, you -- as the author -- should probably have some kind of understanding what kind of effect that might have on his fighting prowess, even if you don't include a single reference to his vitals (as numerals). In fact any kind of magical effect that allows him to carry on will be much more impressive if the severity of his condition is well understood, because of systems.
