** While Severus likely blames himself for Lily's death, I highly doubt he would return to Voldemort's side if Harry did, given that he was the direct cause of her death. He might not want to kill Harry Potter himself, but I can see him remaining on the side of the Light.

Pretty much a reversal of how he behaved as a Death Eater in other words -- he would never have killed Lily as a Death Eater, even if he was on the opposite side of her in the war.

There is another thing -- Sev was in the war as a spy, and until he killed Dumbledore, did not participate in Death Eater or Order skirmishes. He would not really be in a better position to protect Harry Potter if he changed allegiances again, unless the Order suggested he kill him directly. For all intents and purposes, Voldemort already thinks he is on their side after all -- nothing would change if his true allegiance changed in that regard.

I believe that after the switch, the only thing that could truly have caused him to switch allegiance back to Voldemort is if /Lily/ switched sides (somehow). Given her death, his side in the war was sealed.

EDIT: Now I want to see a Sevitus plot where Voldemort demands he raise Harry as an instrument of the Dark, with Voldemort's dubious conclusion being "a poetic way to punish Harry for being James' son rather than his own", and Voldemort's plan failing spectactularly...

** "What if it rained pink elefants tomorrow. I know it would never happen, but what if...?"

What's the point of such a question if it's entirely nonsensical? There's no scenario in which Harry would join Voldemort (Voldemort would kill him at the first opportunity) or where Snape would consider this to be safer for Harry (because he knows that Voldemort wants Harry dead above all other people).

If Harry joins Voldemort, remains alive and unharmed and Snape thinks this is perfectly safe for Harry we are in an AU universe that has nothing to do with canon anymore and I couldn't possibly answer any questions about characters and their motivations.

*** What if there was a world were magic was real? Omg what a nonsense question. Magic does not exist.
