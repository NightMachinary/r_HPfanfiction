"Lucius," Lord Voldemort said, holding out his hand with a single, bony finger extended. "Pull my finger."

Lucius stared at Voldemort's offered hand dumbly. "My Lord?"

"Do not make me ask twice, Lucius."

Reluctantly, Lucius reached out and pulled Lord Voldemort's finger.

/BANG!/

Blood, brain, and fragments of bone splattered Lucius in the face and all over his robes, covering him in stinking viscera. Lord Voldemort howled with laughter.

"...my Lord?" Lucius asked, trembling. "Who was that?"

"Your son," Voldemort said. "April Fools!"


** "A banquet simply seemed.. appropriate, don't you think, to celebrate your wise decision, and my victory" Said Voldemort, to the students and teachers assembled in the great hall.

Only Severus refrained from eating, even at the pointed looks from his lord. He knew what day it was, and the meat looked suspicious.

*** Leaning over to Bellatrix, Voldemort said, "Have you ever read the myth of Tantalus?"

She stopped chewing, stared at her plate, and ran for the bathroom, looking a bit green.

***** Most famously, Tantalus offered up his son, Pelops, as a sacrifice. He cut Pelops up, boiled him, and served him up in a banquet for gods in order to the test their omniscience. The gods became aware of the gruesome nature of the menu, so they did not touch the offering; only Demeter, distraught by the loss of her daughter, Persephone, absentmindedly ate part of the boy's shoulder.

I personally question whether Bella would be nauseated in this scenario or not.

***** It's not his punishment that's relevant, it's how he earned it.

He killed his own son, cooked him and tried to feed him to the gods, naturally they were very angry about it.

**** Severus looked back at his plate, only to see the severed, still bleeding head of one Harry James Potter, who winked at him and whispered "Still alive Snivellus"

Voldemort watched as his spy screamed like a little girl, and collapsed face-first into the plate, unconscious. He shouted in Severus' direction "What, didn't like the Boy-Who-Died surprise? That one took a lot of work you know" then turned around and watch in satisfaction as rock-hard snowballs pelted the back of the Weasley twins' corpses' heads.

** "My lord, are you sure we should attack the Ministry on April 1st?", Lucius asked.

"YES, YOU KNOW NOT TO QUESTION ME. CRUCIO!", Voldemort screamed. "

â€‹

*The day of the planned attack.*

"Tom, how nice it is to see you here." Dumbledore stated.

"YOU CANNOT HURT ME OLD MAN, I HAVE PROTECTED MYSELF FROM DYING AGAINST ALL MEANS." Voldemort exclaimed.

"I know I cannot but... Harry can" Dumbledore responded. "You see Tom, the power you know not is the power of Love. JUST KIDDING ITS APRIL FOOLS." "Your time is up Tom."

"Tom Riddle, bastard and Dark Lord, I execute you this day for daring to forget about the momentous day of April Fools.", Harry said.

â€‹

Due to the magical power of April Fools Tom Riddle was banished and the day of April Fools would be renamed the day of Jokes and Magic.

** Not for the first time, there were screams echoing through Malfoy Manor. That, on its own, would not have troubled Lucius. No--the disturbing thing was that they were coming from the upper floors, not the dungeons.

"My Lord?" Lucius asked, coming across Lord Voldemort in the dining room. "Is all well?"

"Ah, Lucius," Voldemort said, a pleased look on his face. "Good news. I have captured Alastor Moody."

Lucius smiled in relief. "Congratulations, my Lord. An auspicious occasion indeed. Long has he been a thorn in our side--no longer."

Voldemort's eyes gleamed with mirth. "You misunderstand, Lucius. I have not imprisoned Moody. I have given him a wand and set him loose in the Manor. April Fools!"
