This might be a little controversial but if for some random reason Regulus Black has to be casted I would imagine it to be Timothee. I'm not entirely sure what the description of Regulus is in the books but Timothee has the frail aristocratic look down.

Do you guys see it? Or who else would be a good fit This is all hypothetical


** That could totally fit. He looks a lot like how Rohan Gotobed (who played a young Sirius in Deathly hallows) looks now, so that would probably work for how Sirius and Regulus would have looked when Regulus died. Probably wouldn't work for Harry's time though, doesn't look much like Gary Oldman, haha.

If they did a marauder era movie these two would probably fit well together.

It's got to be said that there already has been a casting for Regulus Black: Tom Moorcroft.

Granted, his only appearances were photos, so I wouldn't be surprised if they did another casting if he ever had to appear as a speaking character in a movie.

*** Tom Moorcroft looks more Snape-like. Timoth√©e would be better as Regulus, in my opinion.

** I think all that's said is that he's slighter and less handsome than Sirius.
