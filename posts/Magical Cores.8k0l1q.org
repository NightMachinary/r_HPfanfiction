I get people hate the HP Fanon version of Magical Cores, but what about Magic Circuits (Fate/Stay Night) or Linker Cores (Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha) as terms of quantifiable Magiic size. Shirou has basically no reserves but uses it well, and Nanoha is a human ion cannon. Would there be a way to write them in a HP way, well?


** Nearly anything can be written well if it's used as a reasonable plot device in a well thought out story. What people don't like is that authors pay lip service to magical cores in the same way as, for example, Mr. Weasley's Ford Anglia.

Nobody writes a fic about the Ford Anglia, but if the scene you are writing is relevant to it, you throw it in because it's a piece of the universe that you can play with. Fanon tropes shouldn't be used willy-nilly in that way because it comes off in the exact opposite way as actual canon material.

If you spent the time to construct a mechanism by which wizards stored a reservoir of magic that drained and replenished in some predictable manner, and that could increase in depth under certain conditions, that's not an issue. As long as it's well thought out, relevant to the plot, and not just a shortcut to OP!Harry, then you could pull it off. What you call it doesn't particularly matter, although the term "magical core" carries a ton of baggage. You're better off picking a different name.

As to the idea of magic not being quantifiable, it's your story. Don't worry about what anyone else prefers or if you're compliant to canon. My general rule of thumb is that you can violate canon as much as you want as long as it's intentional.

tl;dr - Mentioning Mr. Weasley's Ford Anglia when he's picking Harry up from the Dursley's: Reasonable, authentic, well-researched. Mentioning magical cores because Harry is tired after a duel: Unnecessary, unoriginal, lazy.

*** I find that SyFy's /The Magicians/, as of the latest season, actually does quite a good job of presenting magic, and magic flow, as well as "magical cores"...though they don't actually call it that on the TV show. They just call it "magic", and the system they use to explain both general and individual possession of magic is always well-thought-out. /The Magicians/ series of books that the show is based on was also written by a previous professional reviewer of the /Harry Potter/ books, Lev Grossman.

Personally, I always found the idea of "magical cores" to be somewhat far-fetched in /Harry Potter/ fanfiction, as well as inconsistent with the original book lore. This is because Rowling has specifically stated that magic is tied to a "magic gene", and therefore, magic is literally in a witch or wizard's very DNA makeup. It's a part of their entire physical body, (as opposed to one location), and tied with their soul, as seen with what happens after or during, say, a Dark curse, like the Gaunt ring one, or a Dementor's Kiss.

But physical bodies tire. Everyone runs, it's instinctual, just look at how kids everywhere play tag. But even though that instinct is 'baked in' to our DNA we can't do it forever, and people vary in their swiftness and endurance.

That's why I don't see 'magical cores' as some great sacrilege against canon if handled well.

This is actually false. Monogenetic traits are traits that are controlled by a single gene and are therefore discrete (which is why they are often used for inheritance). Polygenetic traits are that bell curve you're talking about.

I know this is a predictable response, but I can't think of a more appropriate time to use it. Your logic is sound and your evaluation of the science is plausible. The problem is that you're trying to apply reason and naturalism to magic, which doesn't need to adhere to those heuristics.

The nature of magic may be such that it just switches on with a single gene and you get everything that comes with being a witch or wizard. Simple as that, you don't need any further justification.

Once again, let me express that I follow your reasoning and agree with you.

** Magical cores, magical exhaustion, and the like are a REALLY good way to get me to tap out of a story quickly because they're always used poorly. As others have said, it's lazy. Tired after a duel? No shit, you've just spent calories. You've built up lactic acid. You're tired. Eat something and get some sleep.

To use magical cores in a story, it needs a damn good reason. I'm still here has a good reason. Harry's magic from his side is damaged due to his actions from the war and now it's in a younger body and interacting with his counterpart's core. That's interesting. But just talking about cores to show how uber harry is? Fuck off with that shit.

*** Which is why i used the Fate/Stay and Nanoha examples, where the Quantifiable magic is highly relevant. A Semi Crossover, just Harry finding an Armed Device, or Magus Harry who is actually a Squib wizarding wise, but able to cast wizarding spells using his Circuits (which are limited, and thus, exhaustion) would work.

As for pure Generic Harry Potter stuff, at least a finite amount of Mana or whatever makes more sense than "The Merlin Scale" to make someone OP. Basically every other medium that uses Magic has it as a finite resource that recharges.

I don't think that is an airtight case for quantifiable magic. It may as well have been a magical "trigger" checking on the age of the people getting in the boat. Dumbledore even underlines the importance of "youth" as being important, calling Voldemort foolish for underestimating it. Voldemort may as well have charmed the boat to only carry one /adult/ wizard, believing anyone below that of being unable to ever even get close to the island, let alone withstand the potion and the Inferi.

You could also get creative and say that the dying Dumbledore no longer registered as a threat, and it was only Harry with any sort of weight as a threat to Voldemort registered in the boat (but granted, I think we can take Dumbledore's analysis of magic to heart).

And you are straight out wrong about that.

The vast majority of depictions of magic have it be something given out by an outside agency.

Following that comes magic as secret knowledge of how to persuade the universe to bend to your will (with a considerable crossover with the primary depiction above)

Magic as a finite and recharging resource derives from game mechanics and magic depiction that derive directly or indirectly from those.

Is that true or is that only true because of the literature we've read? I know in Western folk literature, it's very common for magic to not tire out individuals, but I'm curious about other literary traditions.

In Indian folktails for example, the conception of magic is completely different from that of Western stories. Magical humans don't really exist. Magic is either derived from prayer or some other divine attribute and often comes in discrete quantities. (Like you mentioned).

Because the two systems are so different I can totally see a conception of magic as something that comes in finite, rechargeable quantities as long pre-dating games.

I wonder how Eastern magic is, especially since many RPGs come from Japan. I know Chinese magic is tied to martial arts so I could totally see tiring out being a fundamental part of it.

The narrator also doesn't say a single thing about "energy levels." It does say that he feels exhausted, but clearly links this back to him maintaining consciousness when facing the dementors.

It's truly absurd to say that the purpose of Harry's exhaustion in this passage was JK Rowling's way of defining an as-of-yet and never again mentioned magical reservoir that limits a wizard's ability to release stored magical energy.

Several sessions on, he was able to producean indistinct, silvery shadow every time the Boggart-Dementor approached him,but his Patronus was too feeble to drive the Dementor away. All it did was hover, like a semitransparent cloud, /draining Harry of energy/ as he fought to keep it there.

True, honest mistake.

That is a very interesting passage, though. As you say, clearly it's his physical energy that is being drained. The question is, why would his maintaining a magic spell drain him of energy. That's awfully strange phrasing to describe what amounts to hard concentration.

This is definitely more convincing than the passage I quoted (though still not conclusive). *It explicitly states that maintaining the spell drains him* and not the dementor induced stress.

***** Speaking of that, why does he get tired if he's only casting a spell? He stands relatively still, so the calories spent and lactic acid produced shouldn't be that much.

Following that, it's somewhat safe to say that some types of magic can be tiresome to use. Draining even.

And since energy comes from somewhere (and assuming that the laws of energy are not Magic's bitch), you /could/ say that the body transforms potential energy stored in the muscles into "magical energy"... or going beyond, you /could/ say that magical people have an organ that turns potential energy (Or whatever the name is for energy stored in muscles, I don't remember that part of physiology classes) into magic.

A... magical core if you will.

Or, if energy is finite, then it must be recovered. Then, magical exhaustion is /possible/.

I do agree that it's usually poorly used though.

Fiendfyre could be cast by a 5 year old if power is truly equal regardless of age. If everyone had the same access to magic then how does Voldemort duel 4 people at once at the Battle of Hogwarts? Skill and knowledge aren't that big of an elevator.

As to writing them well? Don't just have it be a lazy plot device. Why does Harry need to be powerful? Why must his core be large? Is it necessary to establish his goals?

Filch most likely didn't know that, and thought that he'd be able to use magic if he followed the course; ignoring the fact that he had no magic to begin with (Or he had it, but he had no access to it. I'm not sure how squibs are explained in Lore)

This is what I said. I didn't say it implies manapools. I was saying there are various power levels which is supported by canon. Which is me saying canon supports some sort of quantifiable magic. How is it quantified, I have no clue but that isn't me saying manapools.

If you believe there is various power levels, it

1. It cannot be trivial /because/ wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort exists, not that it is trivial /since/ they exists.
2. It has to be quantifiable in some way which canon supports. I'm just not saying canon supports a /specific/ way.

Terrible reserves, but given reserves from somewhere/someone else to be able to use the "Power he knows not" Or if he had a large core, giving Harry something like Raising Heart or Bardiche that necessitates it, and would be utterly useless with a small core. Otherwise it'd be pointless.

We know that it takes understanding the movements and the incantation are the minimum requirements for basic spells, and we also know that other elements are necessary when casting specific spells (intent with the unforgivables, and emotion with patronus). We also know that it takes time and repeated practice for people to actively cast a spell.

Not exclusively. Like learning any ability: skill, knowledge, and *talent* all come into play.

You think Yao Ming (7'6 basketball player) didn't have a natural aptitude for basketball far any away above the average person? You think Stephen Hawking's inborn intelligence doesn't give him a huge advantage over most people?

In this same way, Voldemort's natural talent with magic seems to have given him a huge advantage over, say, the likes of Neville.

The one variable that many people like to use that doesn't seem to carry over well is strength. A good argument can be made that magical strength does not grow in the same way that physical strength does. There is perhaps some evidence that magical strength does increase over time, but it's flimsy at best.

I don't personally believe there is some sort of magical power level represented in canon, but I don't have any problem with authors imagining a sort of strength gain system if it's well thought out.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_Ming:]]

- Yao is the only child of ... both of whom were former professional basketball players.
- When Yao was nine years old, he began playing basketball and attended a junior sports school.
- ... when he was thirteen years old, and practiced ten hours a day for his acceptance.

Natural talent matters, I don't disagree. But without proper training it doesn't give you the "huge advantage".

Yao Ming isn't the only one talented basketball player, Stephen Hawking isn't the sole physicist.

Still in the WW Riddle and Dumbledore are way above everyone else. If everyone had the same prospects as them with just studying and training, there would be a lot more wizards and witches similar to them.

*** I've described the concept a little differently in the past, but the way I've used it in my writing is at least consistent with "magical exhaustion" being interpreted in mundane terms--exhaustion caused by overuse of magic, not exhaustion of magical reserves. Basically, casting more powerful magic burns more calories independent of outward physical actions. Knowledge, practice, and even genetics can improve a person's ability to cast powerful magic both by conditioning and by increased precision, both of which increase the efficiency of one's magic use.

** I'm not familiar with Nonoha, but Fate doesn't lend much fun to this by its usage of magic circuits. Oh sure, there's an attempt in Fate to show magic circuits don't determine strength but that never amounts to much, especially in /stay night, where Shirou doesn't do much until he gets a huge boost from Rin.

As others have mentioned, nearly anything can be done well but the issue with "magical cores" is that people use and want to use them for the same reasons nearly all the time:

-An easy way to create tension because, oops, MC's magic core is running low so now he's exhausted and won't win like he otherwise would.

-Make it easy to say why the MC is strong: his magical core is bigger than Voldemort's!

Magical power can be quantifiable without this core nonsense and without magic needing to be some vague "energy" wizards have in their bodies. Just make it so magic power is (broadly) dependent on intelligence, experience with the magic you're using, intention and emotion at the time of use (Patronus and Occlumency come to mind), and the scale at which you can cast the magic.

** There has yet only been one use of these words that I /kinda/ liked.

In that fic, which I think was a Google Doc linked one, magical cores was just another word for "entities which enrich their environment with magic". That meant that /wizards and witches/ were magical cores from which other magical things could get power. /They/ were the source of magic, just like Veela, Goblins, Centaurs, Dragons,... In that vein it also delivered explanations as to why elves serve - the servitude in itself being a ritual to drain magic from a "magical core", in theory making them immortal beings as long as they, as the fic described it, "served with pleasure". It also gave some creidbility to the "stealing of magic" idea of the pureblood, as the author did mention that high concentrations of magical entities that qualify as cores, correlate with the historical centers of progress and civilization - meaning that muggles were passively benefitting from high concentrations of magic in the vicinity.

I liked it because despite introducing a concept named "magical core", it refrained from introducing RPG mana-bar mechanics like many Anime, or other magical systems in fiction do. Mental fortitude, prodigious mental potential, vast creativity and high concentration are much more interesting traits to define a magic users ability with this power.

In pretty much /every/ other use of magical cores, you may look at my flair to deduce my opinion. It is seldom that I continue reading whenever magical cores start playing a big role in the fic, because it ruins the HP magic system and makes it bland shonen-bullshit that desecrates this truly unique system because the author couldn't wrap their head around the more abstract quantifiers the HP system uses.
