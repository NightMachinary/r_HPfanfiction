:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The fic I'm trying to remember has Harry find out about the wizarding wold early (I think), going to gringotts and doing the inheritance stuff, find out about titles that he has, alliances for the potter family, and stuff I don't remember. One of the main points of the book is Harry getting the dukes, earls, etc. of his family together and planning to basically take over the wizarding world. Minerva also has founded the Amazon's and her company is based off the legend of the Amazon's. Oh and Harry has a harem.

Edit, FOUND IT. It's called The Protection: The Sword and the Shield


** Ooh, I wanna see this
