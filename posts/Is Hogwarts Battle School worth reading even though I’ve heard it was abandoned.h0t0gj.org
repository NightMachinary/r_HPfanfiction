** IMO, it's an enjoyable work, so I'd say yes. I really enjoyed the action scenes, the world building (it's a heavy AU; borrows /a lot/ of elements from Ender's Game) and the fact that there's Harry isn't involved in Horocrux hunting (they get eliminated through other means). The Triwizard Tournament overall is very refreshing compared to what you normally see in fics. I thought the mystery subplots were well done too. I also liked that while Harry becomes powerful, he continually gets beat down to the point where his defeats feel like actual defeats. No bashing, which is also a plus.

The weakest part of the fic, IMO, is how Harry interacts with most of the members of his house, especially during his 4th year Battle classes. Harry is initially seen to be fairly socially adept but somehow loses it once he becomes the team's official Commander during 4th year. However, most of the fic's focus at that time is on the author's amazing take on the TriWizard Tournament, so not that much time is spent on intra-Slytherin relations in comparison.

That said, I'd say read the first 8-10 chapters or so (IIRC the earlier chapters are shorter than the later ones). If it doesn't seem like it's for you, drop it.

*** If I haven't read Enders Game will everything still make sense? Also thank you for all the advice.

** I think it's worth reading! Even though it is abandoned, a lot of the story has been told and the battle scenes are really good
