What resources are there on the wizarding life around the world? I'm specifically looking for France and North America, but I'm interested in all areas of the world so I can get a variety of cultural perspectives. I would prefer to not have to read through multiple stories, since it will be very time-consuming for the amount of information I want to find out, but if there's a really good one, please do tell!

Thanks!


** The [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick]] series by Inverarity does a pretty decent job of creating a logical and convincing North American wizarding world.

** Interesting take on magical version of USA and other places (I link single chapter, this story is in my opinion readable but not recommendable - but this one chapter is far better that all this "entire magical world is perfect, especially USA, only magical UK is bigoted and corrupted") - [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7053661/19/Harry-Potter-The-Forgotten-Brother]]

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=288707][With The Devil]] is wonderful if you like historical fiction, set in Massachusetts during the Salem Witch Trials.
