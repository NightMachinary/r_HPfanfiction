I'm aware that it's almost impossible that it's just me but I've never seen a discussion about this before.

Lucius didn't claim to be under the imperio, he claimed to be under the imperius curse.

Harry didn't use the accio to get his broom, he used the summoning charm.

Ron doesn't crucio Hermione when she doesn't respond to his advances, he tortures her with the cruciatus curse because he's always been a secret spy for Dumbledore and he was promised Hermione when he was 11 despite barely knowing what a girl was.

I honestly don't even think I'm being nitpicky.

EDIT: It's been pointed out a lot that context is important and I agree. When a character is speaking and uses the incantation rather than the name of the spell it's acceptable as long as it makes sense, however during the narrative I would still expect the name of a spell to be used.


** While I see your point, there actually is some canonical basis for this.

While it's arguable that he was too emotionally compromised, Harry does call "Avada Kedavra" by its incantation when describing how Snape killed Dumbledore.

Something along the lines of "And then Snape...Snape did it. The Avada Kedavra."

****** "YEET" Voldemort shouted, while throwing the Avtomat Kalashnikov at Harry.

Harry was too slow to dodge, so it struck him on the forehead.

A little known fact, even amongst wizarding kind, is that the occult arm of the Nazi Reich had repeatedly used dark wizards on loan from Grindelwald to destroy Russian supplies. Cosmoline was the Russian answer- it is toxic to most magic, but dark magic especially. It also happened to be an excellent anti-rusting agent, so that was the muggle cover.

There was enough cosmoline on the rifle that when it struck Harry's forehead some got into his bloodstream. His horcrux burst, and the magical backlash made Voldemort and all his horcruxes explode.

**** I generally agree, but it also makes for an interesting POV indicator. I'd imagine muggleborns (or those raised by muggles) may be more likely to call a spell by the incantation since that's what they've learned it as (like in Philosopher's Stone, Flitwick probably only mentioned 'the Levitation Charm' once or twice at the start of the lesson but had the students repeating 'Wingardium Leviosa' the rest of the time), while those raised in the wizarding world may have heard the spells called by their titles growing up (possibly plus a dash of 'proper pureblooded vocalization' in some cases) and so are more likely to refer to them by those titles.

*** Avada Kedavra is a special case, because its name is just 'the Killing Curse.' If you are describing someone murdering someone else with, for example, a Reductor Curse, you could call that 'the killing curse,' because it's the curse that killed them.

In other words, imagine a courtroom, with one lawyer asking the defendant "Did you mean to hit the victim when you cast the killing curse?" and the defendant responds "I never cast the Killing Curse." It's just confusing.

** On one hand, I feel that it's the same way I, as a mathematician, might refer to some theorem variously by what it does, it's standard name, by some particular bit of it that comes to mind...

On the other hand, there are pretty good reasons for /not/ casually referring to spells by their incantations:

1. For at least some spells, even improper or lacking intent + incantation + magic yields an effect. Calling a spell by its name while holding your wand is begging for an unfortunate accident. Wand safety parallels gun safety, especially for dangerous spells.
2. For spells with extremely dangerous effects, like the Killing Curse, saying its incantation is tantamount to, say, loudly cocking a gun, or even firing a round (or perhaps a blank) into the air - at best, it can easily startle others or call undue attention to oneself, and at worst, it can cause a cascade of unfortunate events.

Like, if you're going to /say/ a particularly dangerous spell incantation (e.g. "I heard someone say "Avada K-" and then they were cut off"), it would make sense to carefully raise your hands in front of yourself and show that you are not casting before saying the words.

** I don't have a problem with this and for a RL reason: we speak interchangably about firearms and the ammo calibers they fire in the same way. 'Habla Smith and Wesson-?' 'I hit him with some double-ought and he dropped on the spot.' 'The opposition engaged us with AK's, but we had Ma Deuce and she wasn't trying to hear that!'

To me, it's very easy to remember that all of the kids at Hogwarts comes there with a multi-purpose tool - and one of those purposes is to act as a self-defense instrument that can also be used for lethal tactical applications. (In other words, to quote the main character of another IP - "It's also a gun!" üôÇ) Remember, that's the reason why the Killing Curse is so feared - 'Harry Potter' is a British work, the main villainous character was first active during the main time of The Troubles, and the AK is essentially the same as a handgun... by those standards, something to be feared above all else because it only has one purpose - premeditated murder. (By that same definition, the other Unforgivables also constitute major crimes if not crimes against the Crown: the Cruciatus is torture, and the Imperius is felony sexual assault PLUS any crime the victim committed while under control.)

Back on track - we also have to remember that there's the proper way of describing something versus the term used by the people who use it in every day, real-world situations. Again, consider the military and their equipment for example, such as aircraft. The A-10 is officially known as the 'Thunderbolt', but people more commonly call it the 'Warthog' or just 'Hog'. Along those lines, F-16s are officially known as 'Fighting Falcons' or 'Falcons', but pilots and so forth call them 'Vipers'. (Check out their story. 'Battlestar Galactica' fans will be happy.)

So anyway, the fact that they use the spell name interchangeably with the incantation in dialogue both as a noun or as verbs doesn't bother me. It's actually a bit more believable and grounds the characters more into a sense of realism, IMHO - just as long as it doesn't call attention to itself by writers trying to make characters sound cool. Then, it's annoying as hell. I've seen a few fanfics that went that way, as well.

** Characters in canon did do it

Hermione did refer to the Summoning Charm as "accio":

*‚ÄúI just did a Summoning Charm. You know --- Accio. And --- they zoomed out of Dumbledore 's study window right into the girls' dormitory.‚Äù*

Barty Crouch Jr did it multiple times:

*‚ÄúAvada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it --- you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn't matter. I'm not here to teach you how to do it."*

and

*‚ÄúNow ... those three curses --- Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus --- are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That's what you're up against. That's what I've got to teach you to fight. You need preparing. You need arming. But most of all, you need to practice constant, never-ceasing vigilance. Get out your quills ... copy this down. ...‚Äù*

Ron also said it multiple times:

*‚ÄúSome lesson, though, eh?‚Äù said Ron to Harry as they set off for the Great Hall. ‚ÄúFred and George were right, weren't they? He really knows his stuff, Moody, doesn't he? When he did Avada Kedavra, the way that spider just died, just snuffed it right --- ‚Äù*

and

*‚ÄúBut there can't be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse, can there?‚Äù said Ron. ‚ÄúWhat's worse than death?‚Äù*

Even Harry did it:

** I get annoyed if it happens /all the time/, but canon's not exactly innocent of referring to spells by their incantation a few times (notably with the Killing Curse - both Sirius and Harry refer to it as "the Avada Kedavra" on separate occasions.

I do think in most narrative cases, using the name of the spell rather than its incantation flows better - ie "Ron caught the troll's club with a well-timed Levitation Charm" rather than "Ron caught the troll's club with a well-timed Wingardium Leviosa".

** I'm not entirely sure if I just imagined this, but the incantation v name differences roughly correspond with the grammatical form of the latin-ish being used as the incantation. The big caveat here is that I don't know Latin beyond Catholicism and famous mottos, and I haven't thought about it much until now so possibly that I've assumed this system in my head and just not noticed things that don't fit it.

Anyway, my answer is that I don't get annoyed, I just assume they aren't good at languages and didn't notice any patterns. It does influence my expectations of writing quality.

** Canon does have characters referring to spells by their incantations, but I feel that for dangerous spells, even though you couldn't cast them just by randomly saying the incantation, people would still shy away from it. Also, in a society that so greatly feared Voldemort and refused to say his name, I feel like they might refuse to say the incantation if not because the spells are dangerous then because of the association with Voldemort.

** There's overlap in a few cases.

Summoning for example.

According to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration, you can't make food. It's not a switching spell either, as she's not replacing it with anything. So it has to come from somewhere. Accio seems like a general summoning spell based on levitation There are most definitely many spells that do the same thing in different ways.

** It occurs to me that the killing curse is one of those spells you can't cast without meaning it. So socially there is a very good reason to publicise the incantation over using the name. If people get used to associating the incantation with the spell, then they have half a chance of dodging instead of using a shield if it's used against them.

****** That's fanon, and mostly comes from authors who use incantations as the spell names themselves, and is not canon. IIRC (it has been years since I read the books), it has never been referred to as the "Avada Kedavra" -- it's always been the Killing Curse.

To me, it's completely fine, BUT if it's like:

It doesn't sound good to me. I find it annoying that people aren't able to describe actions during their narrations. You could very well write something along the lines of:

"Harry called for his broom with the summoning charm" or "Harry summoned his broom", etc.
