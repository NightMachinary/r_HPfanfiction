For my money, it'd be Henry; just going all in on naming Harry for his great grandfather.


** Definitely Henry. Great-grandfather Henry was already his namesake, so makes sense.

** Harry is a nickname for Henry or Harold in Britain so either of those make most sense. Prince Harry's real name is Henry. I think Harrison sounds too American it is becoming a more common name in the UK but remember HP is set in the nineties.

Harry is also often a name by itself, like Jack used to be a nickname for John but nowadays most people called Jack aren't actually called John and Jack is their legal name.

I will state though what is apparently an unpopular opinion, I like the name Hadrian Roman emperor names seem to be a thing in the wizarding world (Severus, Lucius, Draco etc) so if the author is writing a more politically focused fic or a Slytherin!Harry fic it works, as long as it isn't followed by that "Potter-Black-Peverall-Gryffindor-Slytherin" rubbish which is going way over the top.

**** More like BBC Merlin

Edit: Merlin in that series is titled Emrys, so fans extrapolated that to be his second name, which somehow travelled to HP fandom, because the show segues quite neatly into HP canon, a few details here and there aside.

** I think Harold is a reasonable choice. First because it's a nice name and secondly because Petunia says something like 'Named something dreadful, Harold or Harry or something' in the first book.

I've never actually seen it used though. It's weird to just add something minor like this to a story. It's sort of un-premise-y. 'Harry's name is actually Harold' is something with basically no consequences whatsoever.

Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

*** /Granted the premise/ that a fic decide "Harry" is a nickname, OP is asking what the least obnoxious choice for his real name would be. You're perfectly allowed to think this premise is a bad idea, but that's besides the point.

**** I get the premise and wasn't trying to be a jerk. I genuinely think using "Harry" is the least obnoxious choice. Anything else feels like a contrivance for contrivance sake.

** Hartley Potter or Harland Potter or the best Harrington Potter. I don't know you but I think the A family that is essentially the successor of the Peverell must have some Nobility in his titles and names. It is not an answer to your question.

******** Without reference there is no proof that the name submitted has been seen in a fanfic. The Question is not about what name would be good in a hypothetical fanfic but what name in the restricted list of names used by authors in fanfics that have already been seen . How we can be sure that question has been answered without proof that the name submitted has been used in a fanfic ?
