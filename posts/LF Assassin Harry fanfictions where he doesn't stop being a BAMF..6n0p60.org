Preferably includes: gratuitous violence, and a Harry that is all too glad to engage in it

Preferably doesn't include: Relationships or, at the very least, slash relationships. A Harry that immediately rolls over for the first pretty girl.

Example: Blood Stained by Flameraiser

  Harry has been through a lot yet there are some perks to being as gifted as he is. So he's not going to just sit back and let the world shit on him. He's going to best the absolute best. First few chapters are hard to read. Get past those and I promise it gets better. Also, I know the beginning sounds very cliche. It's explained later so try to stick with it. M for bad stuff

**** I just started trying to read it and the first chapter is sooooo painfully terrible. Even the authors introduction has spelling errors.

This is an actual line from the first chapter: "He walked up to both and started to do what any evil villain would does when they meet their enemy. He started to monologue."

***** It's a great line. Everybody knows every evil villain monologues.

PS. it's tagged as humour.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.
