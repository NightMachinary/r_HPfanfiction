I'll start: Slytherin House doesn't have communal dorms for it's students, they all get their own bedroom with an attached bathroom.


** - The Slytherin common room has a communal fruit bowl, because according to what I learned in /Death Note/, you can't finish ominous villain speeches without taking a bite from an apple. [[https://i.imgur.com/0IUbI93.jpg][The movie canonizes it.]]

- The Hufflepuff common room has a communal cookie jar, a privilege of being next to the kitchens. Whenever it's down to the last cookie, no one dares to eat it because they don't want to be rude, so it sits there growing stale until a house elf cleans it out and refills it.

- Students don't have to wear uniforms on the weekends, so the purebloods go around in their "regular" clothes, which look like historical re-enactment costumes: puffy shirts, buckled shoes, floppy lace collars, and everything has tons of buttons and laces instead of zippers and velcro. Then they make fun of muggleborns wearing 1990's nylon windbreakers.

Robes. They wear robes. The Hogwarts uniform is a unisex black robe. Sufficiently out of touch pureblood wizards don't even know what pants are. Sorry, this is one of those things that always bugs me when it pops up in fanfic, and otherwise the mental image you created is hilarious.

This bugs me, because pants have been around in one form or another since circa 600 BC. At best I imagine purebloods looking down on wearing them for much the same reason the Ancient Romans did, where they considered it something the barbarians wore, and not something for civilized peoples.

**** The Statue of Secrecy came into place in 1670. By that time, they didn't have modern fly-zip trousers, but people knew what pantaloons and breeches were. [[https://66.media.tumblr.com/dd1927f970e1eeb1e60c57c0b5a630f9/tumblr_pdezf1cU6a1tl2bf4_540.jpg][This is the kind of cloak and shirt]] I imagined a rich wizard would wear when going around Diagon Alley. Probably without the wig, though.

According to [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/clothing][JKR on Pottermore]], the wizards who go around without pants /know/ what pants are, they just refuse to wear them because reasons.

#+begin_quote
  Some members of the magical community go out of their way to break the clothing clause in the Statute of Secrecy. A fringe movement calling itself Fresh Air Refreshes Totally (F.A.R.T.) insists that Muggle trousers ‘stem the magical flow at source' and insist on wearing robes in public, in spite of repeated warnings and fines.

  Day to day, however, even *those who detest Muggles wear a version of Muggle clothing,* which is undeniably practical compared with robes. Anti-Muggles will often attempt to demonstrate their superiority by adopting a deliberately flamboyant, out-of-date or dandyish style in public.

** I really like the idea in various fics that Hogwarts has a constantly changing floor-plan or even that it lacks a geometry all together. For example, something like, "This hallway will take you to the Transfiguration Classroom, but only on Tuesdays during odd-numbered years." Or than a doorway on the 7th floor might open to a classroom on the 1st floor, without going down any stairs. Etc.

I also like the idea that the castle has no top floor, but that, from the inside, you can just keep going higher and higher, and things there keep getting stranger and stranger...

**** More from /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/. If I recall correctly, /The Arithmancer/ had a castle that was very slowly shifting at all times. I like the idea that Hogwarts is randomly different at random times, but seems to also exhibit some sort of internal consistency.

But lots of stories have this kind of thing. In one of my own fics, the castle was filling up and just when they thought they were out of rooms, a new hallway would be discovered with a few forgotten classrooms. The idea being that Hogwarts itself is semi-aware and changes itself to fit the need, or at least to fit what it thinks is the need in a way that makes sense to the castle.

** The forbidden forest is bigger on the inside. It's nestled in the corrie at the head of the valley and the sheer weight of magic inside it has stretched the terrain so that what looks like a small woodland on the outside is hundreds of square kilometres once you get past the fringes.

One of Hogwarts' towers - at least the base of it - is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broch][Broch]] and is the oldest structure on the site. There have been wizards in Hogsmeade valley since the Iron Age, the Brochs being the archetype for the 'wizard's tower'. One of them may even have been the historical Merlin.

Most of the features of the Chamber of Secrets are 'improvements' added by later parselmouths, who may or may not have been descended from Slytherin (parselmouth is a lot more common than is supposed, but as most native Britons can go their entire lives without seeing a snake in the wild most never realise they have the talent) but assumed they were because they could get in the Chamber. This is why the statue of Slytherin looks like a monkey - it was made by someone who never met him and had the artistic sensibility of, well, a wizard - the entrance is in an odd place and uses a /slide/ and the basilisk is insane even by living-embodiment-of-destruction standards.

The Hogwarts Elves aren't 'bound' in any way. They are more in the nature of an infestation, like having rats in the walls that feel obliged to help with the housework. Helga Hufflepuff brought them along when she retired from the mercenary commander business, because they're a godsend for logistics and feeding the troops. She was the one who insisted the school be fortified: she carved her name across 10th century Germany in fire and blood and was concerned about people from her past coming for vengeance if it got out that she was involved in the school. (This is why she has the name for teaching 'everyone else', she didn't dare advertise her involvement so had to settle for teaching the students who hadn't come specifically for one of the other founders.)

** This isn't my head canon. It was something I read in fan fiction that was inspired by JKR on pottermore. It was all about wizards wearing robes, complete with the theory that trousers would interfere with their magic and focused on the pureblood supremacist fondness for outlandish fashion.

Except the fanfiction author made it more "logical." In that she/he wrote that trousers really did interfere with a wizard or witches abilities. And old world pureblood fashion wasn't just about being better than everyone else. Although there were sumptuary laws, and the higher quality magical haute couture had to be hand woven and naturally died in order for it to serve it's magical purpose. Like the Death Eaters wore black because it served a defensive purpose. And the swirly patterns from the DE robes in the movie, also served as magical charms/runes. The fancier witches clothes would always fit whoever was wearing them, and even change color to match her complexion. Because these clothes were always bespoke, but could fit anyone, they were handed down for generations. Also a dark wizard obtaining your clothing was bad news because they could use the item to curse you. So, clothes were very carefully guarded and only handed down in wills.

Anyway, I have no idea who the author was or what the actual plot was about, because I was too busy loving the magical laws they were creating and the fascinating history of wizarding fashion. I'm really into fashion history and will watch a dodgy film with the mute on if I like the costume designer's work.

So, this totally became my head canon. I don't think it takes away from Death Eaters/Pureblood supremacists being awful if they had a legit reason for dressing oddly and not just some sort of vanity/superiority complex, because of all the MURDERS. Still pretty evil, you know?

It was constructed by Slytherin /well/ before the bathrooms were made, and the "secret" entrance was made before bathrooms were segregated by gender. The basilisk is simply the last surviving snake in the place. The "legend of the Chamber of Secrets" was just some hokey story made up scare muggleborns into submission at the time it was thought up.

So, for a rough estimate, you've got to double all your numbers to get a good estimate as to how much time the teachers need to do their jobs.

Trelawney needs 44 hours per week.

McGonagall needs 60 hours per week. And that's just for Transfiguration. How much more would be necessary for being both Head of Gryffindor and Deputy Headmistress? I'm pretty sure that she'd be pulling a 100 hour work week - which is ridiculous.
