Most of it is on the internet and I don't like to read off my computer. Any advice?


** I use my phone. (Moon Reader Pro with the white-on-black theme)

** I kinda associate reading fanfic with reading off my laptop at 3am in a dark room, a bottle of Mountain Dew glowing from the screen's light. Everything else I read on a Kindle, but reading fanfic on it just seems... wrong.

** I used to read it on my laptop, but now it's all smartphone all the time. I especially like that ff.net has the handy option to increase the text size and/or reverse the colors so that you read white text on a black background. It makes staring at your phone for hours way easier on your eyes. (There's also an app for ff.net so you can download the fic and read it offline. Not super user friendly, but if you know the title then it's easy to search and then you can save data.)

Other than a kindle what options do you really have?

*** This makes me wonder how much paper it would take to print out something really long, like the Sacrifices Arc.

***** Seconded. Calibre says that my copy is 16,807 pages, but I get around 3.5 page numbers per page turn once I make the window a decent size.

**** I could print it off for free at my the common room for my cohort in one of the university buildings but still, don't think I would want to sit there for the massive amount of time it would take to print out like 4 million words of fanfic.

** I read them on my computer, phone or kindle. If I want to archive stories I save them, turn them into e-books and send them to my kindle. I've got a nice sized digital library.

** Convert to epub, Android tablet, FBReader. I use Google Drive to copy the epubs over -- it's just a little more convenient than plugging the tablet in.

** Laptop or kindle.

But when I was younger and didn't have a computer in my room, I would literally print it out. And that was before I had worked out how to download fics on the family computer, so I would just cut and paste them into a massive word doc and print it 16 sheets to a page in size 12 font. Worked better than you would expect. I think there's still a binder of fics somewhere at my parents' house.

** I read on my laptop when at home, or phone when not. But I really want to buy an e-reader of some kind, because I get the feeling it's not the healthiest for my eyes. I like to read a lot, add that to the University stuff I already have to do on my laptop, and the movies and Tv-shows I also watch on my laptop most of the time, then I'm spending way too much time staring at the same display. It's not great for the eyes to be moving in distance so little (e.g. better if you do your homework on your laptop, read a book, watch tv on the telly - your eyes have to focus and get used to different distances).

** I just read from the computer. But I can speed read 1500 words a minute even on a computer screen, so I find that I'm not too bothered by reading from a screen. I would prefer to read everything from my kindle but that's too much of a hassle.
