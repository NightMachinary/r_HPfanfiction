I know this community isn't too fond of slash, but...

Anyway, I'm looking for well-written, novel-length Drarry slash. Characters shouldn't be too OOC, no Weasley bashing. I've read/decided not to read all the recommendations from the “general recs” thread, so please don't suggest any of those or anything by Saras_girl.

Oh, and the writing HAS to be good. Comma splices are not, not will they ever be, remotely okay.

Thanks!


** Yeah, you'd have more luck asking in [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] OP.

** I'm not sure if these are listed in the general recs thread or not, but I really enjoyed the writing in them.

** I would second the recommendation of asking in [[/r/HPSlashFic]], and there's a [[http://fuck-me-drarry.tumblr.com/post/148988150791/rec-all-time-favourite-drarry-fics][rec list here]].

I'm afraid with Drarry you're rather doomed to a lot of OOC - being the most popular pairing in the fandom, it is often reduced to its basest parts and approached by /thousands/ of authors, many of whom are new to writing fanfiction or consider character less important than the "dark-haired one" and the "blond one" fucking as soon as possible.

This is just the cards you're dealt when it comes to pairings as popular as Drarry, I fear, though there are some gems out there.

** I've thoroughly enjoyed this. Writing was not 10/10 but 8/10, but overall great. More novella length, but I recommend it. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/640449]]
