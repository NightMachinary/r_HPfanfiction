Okay, let me start. The author is amazing. Most of his books are Harry Potter crossed over with Marvel/DC Amalgam Universe, and they're all well written. The books are all about 20-30 chapters each, so not that big, but it's surprisingly well written.

Unfortunately, his fics only get 300-500 follows, for some reason. So, I recommend you read this one, and then browse his other books too.

** Two things.

1. I havnt read his fics, so I won't comment on them. But his story descriptions or summaries are pretty bad. That's usually where the game is won or lost for me.

2. You may want to make an alternate account (without the 007) before logging in and pretending to not be the author.

*** Yeah that's not my account. But I understand why you might think so. My fanfic page is by the username HelloDarkness07. You can check it out if you want.
