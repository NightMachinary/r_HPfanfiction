*** It was a throwaway line in a [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/chamber-of-secrets][Pottermore article Rowling wrote about the Chamber of Secrets]], likely meant as a joke.

Its mentioned in the Paragraph explaining that the Chamber has been opened before Tom Riddle.

#+begin_quote
  There is clear evidence that the Chamber was opened more than once between the death of Slytherin and the entrance of Tom Riddle in the twentieth century. When first created, the Chamber was accessed through a concealed trapdoor and a series of magical tunnels. However, *when Hogwarts' plumbing became more elaborate in the eighteenth century (this was a rare instance of wizards copying Muggles, because hitherto they simply relieved themselves wherever they stood, and vanished the evidence), the entrance to the Chamber was threatened, being located on the site of a proposed bathroom.* The presence in school at the time of a student called Corvinus Gaunt -- direct descendant of Slytherin, and antecedent of Tom Riddle -- explains how the simple trapdoor was secretly protected, so that those who knew how could still access the entrance to the Chamber even after newfangled plumbing had been placed on top of it.

** Draco Malfoy shits his pants on his first night at school as an attempted display of "pureblood power." He doesn't know the cleaning or vanishing charm and none of the older students will tell him it because they're all too busy laughing their arses off at how the little rich boy shat in his trousers and thought it was impressive. Snape won't help him, because "Slytherins are resourceful, Mr Malfoy, and do not get themselves into situations they can't control" (secretly he is also laughing his nads off).

This happened and you cannot change my mind.
