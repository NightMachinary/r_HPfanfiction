Her accidental magic pushes it away I think... Other details that might come in handy, It was at a beach or aquarium or something, It was pre-hogwarts, and I am pretty sure that Harry met her for the first time that day. I think it was H/Hr, but I might be wrong.

Edit: *Sigh* I misspelled discover didn't I.


** Sounds like a Peggy Sue fic I read a really long time ago. Did it involve a Harry who got Sirius freed and lived near the Grangers?

Or was this a different type, the background is important.

*** It probably was a Sirius raises Harry fanfic, (And definitely not the Dursleys caring for him). Not sure if it was Peggy Sue or not, but I do read a lot of them so it is definitely possible. However I feel like this was a surprise... I also feel like (but am definitely not certain) that it was a oneshot? However that might just be me mixing part of it in my head with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13308470/1/][Frootlooped Dumbledore]].

***** I would say that FrootLooped Dumbledore is in my top 10. It's just so heartwarming, funny and filled with fluff.

** Brutally Dumbledore bashing (all the way up to “Dark Lord Dumbledore” and he was the Dark Lord from the prophecy), ... mmm, what it was ... linkffn(There Will Be No Foolish Wand Waving by kgfinkel), and yes it is Harmony.

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?

****** Just found out:

#+begin_quote
  Both Lily and Alice grinned and watched the endearing scene. Just as they were turning back to their conversation, there was a disturbance where they last saw the children. One of the support legs for a sign decided then and now to give way and start falling on top of Hermione. She shrieked in fear and to the amazement of those around her, the sign suddenly stopped in mid-fall above the children.

******* Yep, that's the scene I remembered. I wonder why I thought I hadn't gotten this far in the fic? Maybe I read it awhile ago, and didn't remember that when I was reading it earlier?

******** The story is nice, fluffy, and sweet, but in the end it is one of those stories (like e.g., linkffn(6439871)), where the author resolved problems with the Lord Voldemort, err Tom Riddle (see my other thread ;)), and then he run out of the plot. Albus Dumbledore running the concentration camp is just too weird to my taste, although the Dean's adventure is a nice substory.

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?
