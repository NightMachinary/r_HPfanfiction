I've seen the standard “Death's Little Bitch” versions and the “Sad Immortal” versions both eternally youthful and otherwise, the “Replacement Death” stories and “Death's Right Hand” stories as well. Not to mention ones where uniting the stick, stone, and cloak allow Harry to access some part of him that was hidden, either becoming God or awakening an paranormal or supernatural or paranatural bloodline that had been sealed away to protect him.

I'd like more of these. I usually just stumble across one of these while looking for something else. A “Harry is summoned to another world to defeat another Voldemort” story where the summoned Harry also happens to be Death now. Or “Harry tires of living in his world and goes to another” but he's Death's pet not-so-mortal so that adds a splash of distinct flavor to the otherwise typical story (no offense to typical stories in this context, it was exactly what I was looking for; Harry goes to a world where magic is different and less Showy and powerful and blows everyone and their mother's socks off) and made it that much more special.

So let's see the “Immortal Harry goes to Space” stories! The “Death's Right Hand is sent off to merc a wannabe little necromancer” stories, and whatever else you can bring to bear!

*** Okay, I've just read this, and I must say, it is one of the most chilling, realistic, magical, sad, Mod-like and just all around captivating work I've ever read.

I recommend listening to JDMANDSC - VICTORY when reading this.

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.
