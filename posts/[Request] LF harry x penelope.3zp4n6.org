*** People ship everything, also thinking about it, it has potential. She is a Ravenclaw prefect, so you can use her for the 'Girlfriend in a Different House' fics, you could also use her as a replacement for Hermione in the 'Book Smart Responsible Girlfriend' fics. Also she is older then Harry so that hits all sorts of this subreddit's buttons.

**** Yeah, I get that. It just seems like this is more of an "unknown" ship, akin to things like Harry/Su Li, Harry/Susan, Harry/Daphne (admittedly that one is much more popular). I also think that for this to realistically work, they would have to both be out of Hogwarts for a few years, since it's quite an age difference.

***** I agree on them being out of school, but I doubt that will be the case. I have noticed that fanfiction authors tend not to care very much about age difference.

**** Well "ship" implies more "otp" than utility gf for writing purposes, so no I don't think anyone really ships it.

***** I definitely ship Harry with more then one potential girlfriend, I guarantee in the thousands upon millions of fans, at least one person ships those two.
