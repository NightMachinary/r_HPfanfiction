I'd love to see a fanfic where Death Eaters kidnap young Harry and put him in cell in their home but rather than be upset he's amazed at their "kindness" vs his relatives' treatment eg: cell with washbasin and toilet, actual meals... Death Eaters don't know what to think...


** The door was opened and Harry was roughly shoved into the cell.

"Hope you like it here Potter, 'cause you're gonna be here for a looong time. Heh heh heh."

Harry looked around and was amazed. It was so big! There was a bed, not just a mattress on the floor! There was a sink, and a chair, a toilet he could use whenever he wanted, and even a window! He looked up at the strange man and could only breathe out an awed "wow!"

The death eater was confused. This wasn't the worst cell in his dungeon, but still the bed frame was rusted metal, the mattress thin, the sink only offered cold water and the window had bars on it. He shunted aside his confusion and gathered himself again to growl at the boy "That's right Potter, you're never gonna see your relatives again."

His confusion returned greater than before when the boy looked up at him with wide, hope filled eyes and asked "really?"

The boy's next question shut down his brain completely as he couldn't figure out what was going on. "What time do you want me to make your breakfast, Mister?"

** Not Harry, but Hermione and Katie get a pretty decent treatment in linkffn(2407704). Mind you, they have their captors wrapped around their finger but that's a different story.

  Theodore Nott has always been the overlooked Slytherin until he is forced into joining the Death Eaters by his elderly father. Now, with the new rewards Voldemort has given his followers, captured Mudbloods, he is in over his head with Hermione Granger. AU after OoTP.
