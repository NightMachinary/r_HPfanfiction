The title says it all and I can gladly move this to a designated section for fic plugs if such a thing exists. Here is a link to what I have so far: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13594965/1/The-new-life-and-times-of-Lucius-Malfoy]]

The theme is definitely off the beaten path; basically the main character is a small town guy from the states that dies and is sent to the (virtual) Harry Potter Universe while waiting to be processed in the afterlife. Choosing to be reincarnated as Lucius Malfoy gets him a starter pack of extra magic and items that will aid him in his journey to make his mark on the Wizarding world. It is a very mild crossover with The Inheritance Cycle though not in the way you are likely thinking, since the entire story will take place in JK's sandbox.

It is not particularly long thus far and some outside feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!


** I like the idea very much. Lucius Malfoy is an interesting villain, relying mostly on manipulation and his social standing to achieve his ends, and it is an interesting idea to see someone in his position seeking to be a force for the good.

But to be honest the writing style puts me off a little. It isn't very immersive to me. The narration feels kind of detached, like how you'd retell a computer game you're currently playing to a friend.

Your "Lucius" also feels more than just a bit overpowered. He has the knowledge of all that happens in the series, super-intelligence, will become a dragon rider eventually and has the magic of a different universe at his disposal.

My advice would be to aim for a style more similar to the scene in which Lucius got his wand, it felt immersive and I liked how "Lucius" reflected on his emotions when bonding to his wand. In that scene, I really felt drawn into your story.

I'm sorry if my review is a little harsh, and I know that I am a very critical reader. Don't let that discourage you from writing by any means, you certainly have an audience on FFN and tastes are always different.

*** " I'm sorry if my review is a little harsh, and I know that I am a very critical reader. "

I don't mind well thought out critiques at all; I fully admit that this was more a concept in my head than anything, so it didn't translate all that well in some respects.

" Your "Lucius" also feels more than just a bit overpowered. "

I understand your point on the overpowered bit, part of that is because it was mentioned specifically in the fic multiple times that once Lucius assimilated both powers he would essentially be unstoppable, which I should probably just edit out. I plan to have him face some serious opposition later on down the road but I admit to being guilty of falling into the Mary Sue trap at times.

"But to be honest the writing style puts me off a little. It isn't very immersive to me. The narration feels kind of detached, like how you'd retell a computer game you're currently playing to a friend. "

Yeah, I can see how it could read a bit bare bones at times. Honestly that is more my personal preference in general as I can't stand detail oriented stories. When the author takes a full page to describe what the character is wearing, then two more on everybody's respective feelings and biases I am already skipping pages. It is true though, the wand shop ended up flowing very well and the end result was not bad so I might explore a bit of detail on the more poignant scenes particularly.

Part of the reason this fic comes across as rough hewn is because it was made on a whim with some ideas that wouldn't bounce out of my head, and also as stress relief from the main fic. When you are writing a character as established and fandom driven as Sasuke, you end up having to really toe the line on a lot of things and there's always someone vocally unhappy about how things are going. With this fic, it's an OC so there is a lot more room for a fun romp.

All that to say, thank you for taking the time to read and review the fic, I very much appreciate it :)

*** I agree, the writing style is not my favorite. I love the idea, it's very original, but if you could dive more into the characters thoughts but in a more drawn out way it could be amazing

**** Fair enough; could you elaborate more on what you mean by diving into the thoughts of the characters? Are you referring to the thoughts of the main character primarily or the thoughts of the supporting characters?

***** The main character, and I suppose I meant more elaboration on their feelings so that there is more padding between the actions, of that makes sense?
