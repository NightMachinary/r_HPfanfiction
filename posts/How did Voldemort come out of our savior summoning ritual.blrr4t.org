What do you guys think would happen if the Order of the Phoenix (after great failure, suffering and death) decide to summon a hero to defeat Voldemort.

The catch though would be that the hero they end up summoning is a good Tom Riddle Jr/Voldemort.

Im thinking something like a mix of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2595818]]) and linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991]])

Or maybe it could be an Alternate universe where harry is the dark lord and they summon harry or something.

I suppose there are these two linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685]]) and Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1677882]]) but harry is just a death eater and not a dark lord. He also wasnt summoned but accidentally got transported there.

If there already is such a thing please tell me because I need this in my life. If not please feel free to make one if you feel imspired and tell me where i can read it later;)


** Oh yeah I read that one too but I want more of a good charachter who has to fight an evil one. It just so happens that the good charater is voldemort who has to now face himself. Or that the dark lord is harry who has to face himself.

** This reminded me of linkffn(Diablerie by oceanbreeze7), where Harry and Moody accidentally summon a smol Tom Riddle. He's far from being a hero, though (but also far from being Voldemort).

  Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, he doesn't want to die
