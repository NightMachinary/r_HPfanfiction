Hi

I would wish to find a fanfiction which have inside the following : A Darker Universe where basically there isn't mollycoddling in a any way or form of no one. Basically it is normal and expected from everyone to take advantage on whose weaker that them. Basically you are powerful ore dead. Hogwarts can become something like the Hunger Games, only the strong survives. Maybe even some rules against dependency like Harry canon dependency on Hermione.

P.S : Basically where the idea of equality of our modern society is abandoned for the valid idea of applying dominance hierarchy to all animals and Humans are animals.


** My new WIP, linkffn(Requiem by Flye Autumne) fits your Hunger Games-esque vibe. The premise is that Voldemort killed the entire Potter family in Godric's Hollow in 1981, and subsequently took over the rest of Wizarding Britain.

*** Ah I will read it, even if what I wanted to see was How Harry would fare in this situation where his morals would be totally inadequate.

#+begin_quote
  In 1981, Lord Voldemort was victorious in Godric's Hollow. Fourteen years later, he rules Britain with an ironclad fist. Each year, young witches and wizards compete in Requiem for a place in his inner circle. When Hermione is chosen to represent London, she's forced to use every one of her skills to succeed - or die trying. Very AU. Hunger Games inspired.

** Linkffn(The Flamel Experiments by andre.scuteri) and its companion piece linkffn(The Concordat by andre.scuteri) is exactly this, though the story is not well written and abandoned.

Harry, Hermione, Daphne and Ginny use a dark ritual to escape from their terrible universe and arrive at the canon one. We get some flashbacks and hints of the dark AU. The companion piece is set entirely in the dark AU.
