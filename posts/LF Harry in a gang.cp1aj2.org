Muggle AU, late for Hogwarts, whatever

All pairings are fine


** There was one I read this spring where he fell in a bad crowd in Surrey and was involved in a gang sorta and ended up spending a lot of time stealing and in Juvie cause they treated him better than his aunt and uncle. Was pretty interesting and fun even after he had to leave the home town gang and go to Hogwarts when he still ran and kept up with him.

I've also read a few where he is a homeless runaway and lives with mobsters who have him run illegal goods. Gosh so many but I am leaving the house and don't have time to search through my flics to find them sadly atm.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhk√§se.

** Harry is in a sort-of gang for a while in this one: !linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings)

I gotta say, it's definitely not as good as her other fic !linkffn(Blindness), at least at first, but the writing eventually hits its stride.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
