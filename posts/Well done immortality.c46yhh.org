Hello! I am curently in the market for fics that feature immortality and, what is important, handle it well.

Here is what i mean:

- immortal character acting their age. They so often act like emotionaly immature idiots, so I was looking for a more realistic take on it.
- the issue of losing the ones you love to old age is adressed
- the weight of centures on the shoulders

Examples are linkffn(Basilisk-born; a long journey home)

Any pairing or no pairing is fine.

If you could recommend fics from other fandoms that fit the description or original fiction that would be also awseme.


** Hello, I'd recommend linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon). It does not feature immortality per se, but Harry is certainly long lived and IMO it checks everything off your list. Also, it's really great.

**** You can read it without firefly knowledge but, I personally wouldn't recommend it some of it has too little explanation in my opinion.

It is a great story though.

** The_Carnivorous_Muffin does a lot of immortal Harry Potter-is-Death fics. The two you'd probably like are:

linkao3(Bright Eyes by The_Carnivorous_Muffin) which is complete and has an immortal Harry meet his parents

and

linkao3(October by The_Carnivorous_Muffin) which is very long and a wip but has a mature if depressed/philosophical Harry. It's all from Tom Riddle's pov, so it's more of an outsider's point of view on how immortality affects someone than anything else.

** Well, uh, when you say /any/ pairing...

This is a Harry/Voldemort fic (with R-rated content, in case that's not your thing), and probably the only one I've read that does it right in making them equals in terms of experience and power. linkffn(8149841)

I have conflicted feelings, mostly related to the pairing. At the same time, the worldbuilding is quite good, and the politics are interestingly written. I found that interesting enough to keep reading (and I personally found the smut more a bonus, but I know that it's not everyone's cup of tea). It's not finished and is either extremely slow to update or pseudo-hiatus/abandoned, but what is there is long and pretty well written from what I remember.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** There's a LOTR crossover that does this. He seems to be an immature arse, until you look closer and realize he's barely holding himself together. It's also abandoned, because what interesting fic isn't? (Bollocks!)

  He's been stuck like this for a couple of beginnings, and so many ends. Millennium have passed by and his age never changes, his skin cannot stay pierced, his body cannot die; thus locking his soul, binding him forever to this existence. This stranger comes into their lives, and they're unprepared for the events that follow after him. Viper is an interesting enigma. Immortal!Harry
