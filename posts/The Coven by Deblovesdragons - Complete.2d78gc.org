I found The Coven listen in the Randomly Selected Stories section on Ashwinder. It looks like there are only 8 chapters and was never completed, at least on Ashwinder. When I Googled it, I found links on thepotionsmaster.net that listed the story as Completed, but it directs me to the 8 chapters at Ashwinder. Anyone have any ideas if there is a completed fic out there or have a download of the complete story? It sounds like an interesting story, and I'm open to recs of similar stories featuring Severus/Hermione. Thank you!

EDIT: The wordcount on thepotionsmaster.net matches those 8 chapters. The story was also posted on adult-fanfiction before it was on ashwinder: [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=17179]] but all these sources yield only 8 chapters.
