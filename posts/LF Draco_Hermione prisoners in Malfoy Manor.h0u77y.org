:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey, hoping you guys can help me out with finding a fic I've been searching for. I used to be a big Draco/Hermione shipper. I'm not so much anymore, but I suddenly feel like re-reading some of the fics I read(there was A LOT, some of them pretty terrible I'm sure, lol).

I especially remember one where Hermione is taken prisoner and trapped in the dungeon/cellar of Malfoy Manor. Draco is reluctant to do what Lucious and/or Bellatrix demands and eventually gets thrown in the cellar with Hermione. They learn to trust each other and develop a bond, which continues after they are rescued.

Would anyone know which fic I am walking about? TIA!
