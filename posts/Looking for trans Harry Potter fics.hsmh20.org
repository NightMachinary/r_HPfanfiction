** This is one have found and moderately enjoyed. Not sure how realistic it is to the trans experience as I am not trans myself, but it's ok. Only drawback is it is Snarry so if you're not into that, probably not for you.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.
