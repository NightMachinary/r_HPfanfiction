I know even Voldemort always says them aloud, but that could be for effect.

** There are many instances of the curse being cast without the incantation set out as speech in the text. For example, in the Voldemort vs Dumbledore duel in OotP and by Bellatrix at the start of HBP. But that is technically compatible with the view that the incantation is always said verbally. It could simply be that the narrative didn't describe the vocalisation.

However, I think the better way to approach it is this: is there any reason to think the Unforgiveable Curses /cannot/ be cast silently? The possibility of non-verbal casting is the default for all magic, and I don't think there's anything in canon to suggest that the Unforgiveables would form an exception to that.

*** The Killing Curse is the only Unforgivable that cannot be blocked by the Shield Charm in canon, IIRC. So since it's already an exception in that regard I think it would be somewhat fitting that it cannot be cast without the incantation being said.

*** Silent Casting canonically decreases the power of spells(Hermione having only survived the purple curse because it was used silently) , having a certain amount of power behind the spell is the main requirement of the Killing Curse, with how regularly Voldemort vocalises it compared to almost any other spell, I would conclude that you can't practically use the killing curse silently without weakening it to the point of 'not even causing a nosebleed'.

Though I see ehy this position isn't necessarily accepted.

**** Do you though? Crouch manages to kill a spider just fine with the killing curse. The main requirement seems to be power. The unforgivables are /not/ the same. Whereas the killing curse is unblockable, snape manages to block the cruciatus just fine.

I was focusing more on this. I addressed silent casting elsewhere. It was a note that, not only, is the fanon meaning and intent not required for a killing curse, the unforgivables differ in more than one way.

I addressed silent casting with multiple examples of Dumbledore casting it in OoTP and Bellatrix casting the killing curse in a situation where noise was important. Since the incantation was not described in the latter situation, the killing curse can clearly be cast nonverbally.

This was more of a "fruit of the poisonous tree" note, that not all unforgivables are the same and do require specific emotional states like the cruciatus.

** It's never been specified, per se, but we've never seen one cast silently and even the high-level wizards and witches like Voldy and Bella always say them aloud, so people have come to the conclusion that they can only be cast verbally.

We don't know for sure, though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

** Voldemort casts the killing curse many times silently in his duel with Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  “Wait!” The harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth. It leapt from its hiding place and up the bank. There was a flash of green light, a yelp, and the fox fell back to the ground, dead.
#+end_quote

Given how noise was somewhat important in that scene, I don't think the narrative importance justification for a silent killing curse holds up.

Yes, the killing curse is unblockable, which makes it different from other spells, including the other unforgivables.

#+begin_quote
  “Cruc ---” yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Snape blocked the spell again. Harry could see him sneering.

  /Some of the unforgivables are, in fact, blockable./
#+end_quote

But its main requirement is power. Crouch casts the killing curse just fine on a spider, ruling out an intent requirement as well.

** They should.

My head canons or rules for the Unforgivables:

- Must be cast verbally
- Cannot be blocked by Protego and other shield charms
- Can be cast by someone under the Imperius, but chain Imperius will get progressively weaker
- Most wizards can put at most 1 person under the Imperius at any given time, and only those with weaker wills than theirs. Super wizards such as Dumbledore and Voldemort can imperio a few people simultaneously; Harry can imperio a couple people at same time too
- Imperius curse must be cast at close range
- Occlumency helps resisting Imperius curse

Can we argue about this one some? If you have to truly have hate in your heart for someone to use the killing curse, can you really perform it if you're in the vaguely happy, worry-free state that the Imperius Curst leaves you in?

Or is it the case that the victim is so completely under another's control that the command to "use the killing curse" overrides the usual requirements of the spell and it just happens?

**** if while under the imperius, you cast it on someone, it is actually the original caster's will used for the casting, imo. Of course, I think this would mean that a chain casting would be as dependent on the original caster's will as directly imperiusing multiple people. So voldemort could cast 3-5 links deep, most people can't at all, with some exceptions for 2 links deep (a single jump past the original target) Dumbledore and Harry would be on par with voldemort in this
