:END:
I'm looking for a fic where Harry gets sorted into Ravenclaw and then one of the older students is assigned as his mentor. He goes for jogs around the lake everyday with a Japanese student and eventually with Neville, and also practices wandless magic with the same two. Sorry if this is a bit too vague. Thanks!
