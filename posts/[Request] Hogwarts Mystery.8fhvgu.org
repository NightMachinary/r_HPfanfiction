*** It's so badl writen, too. Only started the game yesterday, but almost all dialogues make me either cringe or laugh in disbelief, depending on the mood.

**** Well, I like it, and Tumblr seems to like it. I've seen nothing but haters on reddit, which bums me out because it looks like such a fun take on the world.

***** I'm no hater. If you pay attention, you'll notice from my other comment I still play the game, which is hardly the behaviour of a hater. The game's reasonably untertaining.\\
It has a lot of faults, however. Maybe reddit is better at spotting them than tumblr, but they're still there.\\
It's a bit sad, though not really unexpected these days, that mentionning the writing of a game is subpar is seen as enough reason to be called a hater.\\
People just don't seem to know how to think properly anymore...

Don't take it personally, though, you merely provoked a rant, you're com doesn't fit what I'm talking about all that well.

*** I half want to write Merula "I'm the most powerful witch in Hogwarts +despite only having been here for five minutes+" Snyde getting smacked down by an older student who really doesn't like Death Eaters or their apparently equally bigoted and homicidal offspring.
