** Y'know, one of my favorite chapters of my own work is the one covering the Second Task, called [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/47/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Subsurface Tension]]. It is also one of the most convoluted narratives you could imagine, because it covers the same character going through two versions of the task in two different forms using a Time Turner.

In Holly's case she needed to extract Neville from an enchanted chain holding him hostage, and transfiguring the chain didn't work...

  When she returned to Nev's now-naked body, Holly discovered another wrinkle- his leg wasn't bound by rope like the others were. His ankle was chained to the largest marble block amongst the submerged ruins.

  Holly tried slicing hexes and rusting charms and shrinking his leg, but the manacle and chain looked to be spelled resistant in some way. She was growing quite frustrated when she suddenly felt her arm being gripped from behind. A swift twist around and her wand was pointing into Fleur's face. Both she and 'Eeelya' had returned with their hostages to see what was keeping their fellow champion from returning with them. Holly's smile was reflected genuinely, and they gathered around the chain to pool their knowledge.

  All three tried a variety of charms and hexes without success, trading flame writing suggestions to prevent redundant efforts. Finally, Holly gently pushed the two other swimmers to the side. A jigging motion with her wand caused Neville's leg to desiccate into what was essentially human jerky. A second swipe, and Holly had severed Neville's foot a few inches above the manacle. Fleur vomited into the water, and I'd swear Eeelya released some ink, despite his eel-based transformation. Holly retrieved the errant limb, handing it to (a quite perturbed) Fleur, so that she could carry it in the belt of her seaweed bikini, seeing as Holly hadn't bothered with making one.

*** Cause it floats. If you can't get the hostage off the statue, take the entire statue.
