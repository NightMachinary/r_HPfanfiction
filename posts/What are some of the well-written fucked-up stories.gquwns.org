** Admittedly I would say practically everything written by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1508866/Voice-of-the-Nephilim][Voice of the Nephilim]], with The Unforgiving Minute being an absolute gem for time-travel fics. Warning, these fics are dark and violent in a way most fics can't even pretend at.

Circular Reasoning is also unbelievably vicious as a fic (seriously, the first chapter will make you wonder if you are in the wrong fandom). Its prose reminds me distinctly of Joseph Conrad's works, though the story wander off the rails quite a bit.

*** Well it's a bit too much (Too much Edge) IMO, James Siruis Potter doing his best acting of Tom Marvolo Riddle (while fucking his little sister), Elaine Longbottom going the Bellatrix Lestrange way of torturing into insanety her prisonners, in the same time the Children of Death Eaters are going full victims as if they were not trained or talented enough to defend themselves.

The Defigured girl must be Rose betrayed by Corner who must think he "avenged" his mom past disfiguring. Honestly, it's well written but not really fucked up, just edgy, it's basically mean the whole series was useless. Things stayed in the same state of mind that after the First War, Harry's generation failed to change things, and they didn't even managed to educate their children properly.

Trully the number of Cursed fictions like this made toward the next-Gen is telling us something.

  AU Eleven-year-old Harry's fondest wish is to disappear. With help from friends in a magical storybook he just might succeed.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
