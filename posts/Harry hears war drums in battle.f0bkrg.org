I don't remember a lot from the story apart from the fact that Harry loves fighting in it and hears these "War drums" whenever he does. I think Dumbledore also mentioned a group of famous fighters that would also all hear them. Harry might have even freed Grindelwald at the end at Dumbledores jurisdiction. It was on ffnet and quite famous as well I think.

**** Beginning is okay, but it really picks up towards the middle. The best parts are definitely their travels across the globe.
