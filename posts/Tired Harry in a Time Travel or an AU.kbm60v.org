Where Harry is tired about war/people dying/etc, he might still help people, but he's so withdrawn from what happened to him or other various things.

Anyone can be the main character/any site/any length/old or new

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc doesn't have to focus on pairings

Would rather NOT have Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune/no Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc

Bonus if: No Dumbledore Bashing, but not mandatory


** Into The Arena by LullabyKnell (complete)

Face death in the Hope by LullabyKnell (not complete but 64ish chapters?

Both on Ao3. I don't know how to link things..

  Canon-compliant up to most of DH, more than 10 years later in a hyper-magical, post-apocalyptic Britain, a spectator sneaks into the empty Once-Ministry to watch Harry Potter and Voldemort's final duel. Unfortunately, just as victory finally arrives, an unlikely escape triggers an unexpected beginning.

  Tucked under Regulus's arm was an old, hand bound book in a deep maroon. Embossed on the frayed leather were the words, 'The Purest Art of the Patronus: A guide to defending with Light'. Unlike the books in the Black Library, Sirius couldn't feel the oily oppressiveness of Dark Magic. If the title hadn't given it away, the Magic definitely would have.The book was pure Light Magic. Wherein Sirius questions the facts he thought he knew and Regulus fails to hate.
