I used to follow this fanfic but dropped it after the author didn't update for a while.

I then saw it mentioned in one of the posts on this subreddit, so I visited it again. It's 70+ chapters already. I had only read it up to chapter 40 or so. I tried reading it again to refresh my memory but I found my focus slipping. I feel a bit sad because I remember liking and wanting to know what happens in the story. So what I'm asking now is a summary of what happens after Chapter 40.

Spoiler-y questions ahead

What happened after Lily killed the basilisk and Wizard Lenin was given a body to become Lenin Rabbitson? Did Ginny/Tom Obliviate Lily? Will time travel happen after this? Lily surely must have traveled in the past, which was how she met young Tom, recruited the vampires and set up a shop in the Alley. It was hinted at several times before.

I know it's a rather tall task and I would be very thankful to anyone who can do this.


** Lily was mindwiped temporarily by younger Tom (can't remember the name used). He made her think she was his cousin (a Gaunt) for a while, whilst also creepily trying to woo her. Lenin went and started to restart his movement and restart the war.

Eventually Lily and creepy Tom went to a brothel in order to try and hide out (can't quite remember why, but I think it was because Lenin was looking for them). Lenin basically barged in and helped Lily to break the spell on her mind. Younger Tom fled. Lily realised she needed to go back in time, she did so. Recruited the vampires, lived in the orphanage with young Tom for a while with both of them being a pain to each other. Then when he went to Hogwarts she returned to the present, had a bit of an argument with Lenin. Lenin sent her off to Hogwarts to catch Pettigrew. Rabbitson is now talking and claims the Dementors are some sort of relation to him, holes in the universe left by Lily building it poorly, and keeps urging her to destroy it or let him do so. Lily is struggling with what to do with Pettigrew after catching him, creepy Tom is still occasionally possessing Ginny to chat to Lily. Dumbledore is refusing to believe Lily about Pettigrew as he doesn't trust her after the previous year.

I think that's about it, but I might have forgotten something or got it a bit wrong.

** Oh, I'm so sorry that I can't help - this fic lost me on the way because of life events, but if anyone does provide a summary I will anxiously read. It's just so whack I loved it. So offbeat. I was reading it aloud from the corridor to my housemates getting ready in the bathroom one night and it was a riot, such a fond memory. I pretty much needed their politics-majors to contextualise wtf was going on. It's so postmodern it hurts. Wizard Lenin? We love him.
