All we really know is that Ragnok is a Gringotts employee high up on the corporate ladder. The goblin king is called Ragnuk, with an u, and he's been dead for 9 centuries as he lived in the founder era.


** Probably the same place that "May your gold ever flow, and your enemies tremble at your feet" and "Lord Hadrian Jameson Slytherin by conquest Potter Black Peverell ad infinitum, owner of Hogwarts, the ministry, 47 other castles, and other properties, and by the way, you're also the richest person in the world with 10,000,000,000 Galleons."

It's all just fanon there isn't a lot of info out there on how their current society functions.
