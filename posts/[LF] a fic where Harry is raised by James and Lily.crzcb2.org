Ok so im looking for a fic where Harry is raised by his parents normally

NO WRONG BWL THEY ARE HORIABLE (My opinion)

Ok so IF there is a pairing then i had two options in mind,which were Haphne or Harmony

LONG PLEASE

Can also be Lily only cuz like smart harry is kinda good

(James is smart too btw but i like lily for some reason)

Yeah thats pretty much it

Sorry if im asking for too much in a fic

Thanks!

*** Did i say james was stupid? No, it might have been implied but IF Harry would have been raised only by a marauder i would take a good guess and say that harry would be smart in a different way

Mainly in pranking others

**** You implied that James was stupid and only Lily raising Harry equals smart Harry.

Harry could be smart regardless. I guess you meant that Lily raising Harry doesn't make him so bold.

But do you have any recommendations for my [LF]

** linkffn(Hallowed) is probably the best you'd find in this genre. The downside is that James and Lily aren't featured heavily.

  Once upon a time, three brothers came up with a plan to change the world forever. Centuries later, wizards still fight over the scraps of their power. However, only one person can truly lay claim to their destiny. AU. Harry/Lisa Turpin pairing in later chapters.

**** Because you said that WBWL fics are horrible and implied that Harry/Daphne and Harry/Hermione is the only thing worth reading.

Don't be surprised if you get comments about your opinions when you attack, either explicitly or implicitly, the opinions of other people.

  Mr. and Mrs. Potter were not perfectly ordinary people. They did not live on an ordinary street like you or I. They did not have a small house with a number to differentiate it from the identical houses on either side of it. They had, in fact, quite the opposite of it all.----How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived? Ships not listed because I'm unsure if there will be deviations from canon in that respect. Characters will be added as they appear.
