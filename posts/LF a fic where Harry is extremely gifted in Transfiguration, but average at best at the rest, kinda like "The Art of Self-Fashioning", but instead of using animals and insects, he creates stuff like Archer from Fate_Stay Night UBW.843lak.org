#+TITLE: LF a fic where Harry is extremely gifted in Transfiguration, but average at best at the rest, kinda like "The Art of Self-Fashioning", but instead of using animals and insects, he creates stuff like Archer from Fate/Stay Night UBW.

Or kinda like Gilgamesh, with his weapons. Stuff like that, where the imagination is what limits him. As long it isn't Hermione, Ginny or maleSlash pairings, everything else goes.

** Ooh! Now I need to read this! Or write myself, eventually, once I finish all the Fate related things.

Maybe as [[http://fategrandorder.wikia.com/wiki/Kid_Gil][Kid Gil]] ? And mixed with other tropes? Oh, I feel that I might write something like this someday.

*** Never seen this "Kid Gil" and what other tropes would you think should be included in this? I'm honestly a bit bored of old "manipulativeDumbles" and shit, though.

**** Meh, not sure, maybe with non-BWL, aromantic/asexual HP, non Gryffindor and/or a crossover if I feel it's to weak to stand on its own.
