** I think this is the story you are looking for linkffn(7806627) Sacrificial Second Chance or possibly this one linkffn(11237397) The Next Great Adventure. The second one is pretty much the same story by a different author, its a bit better written if I remember correctly. The first is abandoned, the second might be.
