Hi there~ I'm really looking for fics in which Harry being an heir is either central to the plot or at least a driving factor.

Can include (but not limited to; bolded takes priority): Potter Heir Black Heir Gryffindor Heir Snape/Prince Heir *Voldemort's Heir* Hogwarts/Founders Heir

Other people can heirs too. Any Ship goes. Preferably complete fics but if it's got at least 5 chapters, it's cool.

Please and thank you. I'm not picky.

**** The sequel isn't as good iirc, but the third par remains one of my favorite fics till this day.

Also, don't forget to read the author's mini-fic and collection of oneshots after you finish reading the trilogy. All of them take in the same universe as the main fic, and are quite fun to read.

** Here's one: archiveofourown.org/works/1085412/chapters/2182999 Harry as heir of Potter and Black families. Lots of pure blood politics and family magics.

Summary: What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision... HP/HG. LONG, really, really long but WIP.
