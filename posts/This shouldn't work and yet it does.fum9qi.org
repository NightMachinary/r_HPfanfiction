Rather something seems weird or off or sounds boring until you read it, or some sort of gimmick that happens. But if you've thought "This shouldn't work, and yet it does" it fits.

Anyone can be the main character, it can be from any era. Would rather not have character bashing if possible. Characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but an author going out of their way to bash a character is usually a no go.

Any warnings any pairing are okay. Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash.

It can be on any site.

I'd rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

It can be a oneshot, drabbles, or multichapter.


** I think linkffn(Delenda Est) is the best example of "this shouldn't work, yet it does" that I've read. I just couldn't picture the Harry/Bellatrix pairing under any circumstances before I read it, but the way this fic does it kinda works (even with Bellatrix's crazy canon personality somewhat intact).

Another couple of examples that aren't entirely what you're asking for, but rather "this works far better than it should":

linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero) makes divination into the most interesting class at Hogwarts. It also has the best depiction of Harry in conflict with the order of the phoenix. As in, he has a damn good reason to hate them and the conflict totally makes sense (too often it feels a little forced, out of nowhere or due to someone acting out of character).

linkffn(What s Her Name in Hufflepuff) is a self-insert, but it's so much better than any other self-inserts that I kinda feel bad that it's lumped in with the rest. Not that there aren't any other good SI-fics out there, it's just that even the good ones aren't in the same league as WHNiH (in my opinion).

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** *Fate's Gamble* - linkffn(9586702) Fate Series/HP Crossover.

​

- The magical systems are wildly opposing to each other.

Wizards/Witches have "cores" (only as an explanation for the magic and a way to compare them with each other, nothing else is said about it. Magi have crests AND magic circuits to channel their magic.

​

- The mindset of the practitioners is wildly against each other.

Magi don't give a crap about anything, as long as it moves their research further AND doesn't break the secrecy. Some have /some/ standards. They are sociopaths really.

There's way more, but that happens as it happens. What you don't know about the fate series is explained as needed.

Warning: Creature Harry (plot/political reasons), OP Harry, Sociopathic Harry.

It may look like there is some Dumbledore bashing, but it's pretty canon-like IMO. It's the fact that Harry is against him that it looks that way. They kinda sorta make up later on.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.
