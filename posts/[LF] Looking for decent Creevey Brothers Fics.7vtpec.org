I have recently came across [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12760557/1/Worry-Between-Brothers][Worry Between Brothers]] by Myra109 which broke me down to tears after the first chapter. I then started to look for others and found a couple of gems as well.

linkffn(12760557) Status: Complete

So, I'm asking if anyone knows any other Creevey Brothers fics either talking about Dennis' reaction to Colin sudden silence during the Chamber of Secretes or any brotherly type of fics. I mean after reading Worry Between Brothers, it got me thinking if Dennis ever found out what happen to Colin since there's a likely chance that their parents may or may not have been told about what happen.

I say likely because from what I recall, Hermione did not tell her parents the full truth of the dangers at Hogwarts. So this led me to conclude that muggle are not really well inform of certain dangers in the magical world and do not fully understand what's happening.

Sorry, that got off topic for a bit. Anyways, the story does not have to be like the example I said earlier. I actually would like to find a longer kind of fic that is from either of the Creevey Brothers perspectives. Be it during Hogwarts or post-Hogwarts (the more tears all the better).

  What if it wasn't the Weasley's that rescued Harry just before his second year? What if it was the Creevey brother's? What if Colin isn't the stalker to Harry that he is in the books? What if Colin (and later Dennis) becomes best friends with the trio and joins them on their adventures? Note: Not a Ron bashing fic!
