First I am going to go through four "preliminary matters". Then I will apply these to three scenarios: a hypothetical pitched battle, large scale strategic warfare, and finally a comparison of civilisations.

*First Preliminary: how magic works*

This is a pretty crucial determining factor in how the fight goes. There are two main ways of considering HP magic:

- Magic as energy
- Magic as truly supernatural

The first conception has magic a part of the physical universe that Muggles just haven't discovered yet, and so something that works *with* the "laws of nature" in a consistent way. The second has magic as completely separate from the physical universe, something which /overrides/ the laws of nature (though it has laws of its own).

If you say magic is energy, then wizards clearly have access to stunning amounts of it. /Wizards can create kilograms of matter without a second thought/. This means they have access to quantities of energy which exceed the largest nuclear explosions. Needless to say this feels somewhat absurd, and anyway I think canon indicates that magic is not energy. However, certain people like this kind of "scientific" treatment of magic so I thought I would note it here.

If you say magic is truly supernatural then it just ignores physics entirely. Brooms don't fly via magical thrust, they fly because the flying charm effectively rewrites the rules of the universe to make it so. This seems to be the way magic works in the HP world, and JKR has rather cemented this position with a recent Pottermore entry: "... broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature."

So, wizards are either walking stars or can ignore physics entirely. Either way it's important to remember that they're still bound by the laws of magic.

On the topic of those laws of magic, people should remember that we have seen magic cast not just through the air at physical objects and locations. We've also seen magic cast on such abstract items as job positions (DADA curse), secrets (Fidelius charm), lexical items (the Taboo), and memories (pensieve, obliviate). This indicates that magical law works on a conceptual rather than physical level.

*Second preliminary: wizards and Muggles are both stupid*

People often talk about how stupid wizards are in these discussions, noting things like their inability to pronounce Muggle words correctly. However, what is often glossed over is that the Muggles of the HP universe are also stupid. We're told that the Knight Bus, for example, goes by unseen simply because the Muggles are unable to register something so absurd.

*Third preliminary: wizards have already won*

At the start of HBP we saw the Ministry of Magic rearrange a phone call between the Prime Minister and the President of a foreign country (most likely the United States, given that the PM's first telephone call after election is generally from the US President). In DH, we saw the Ministry insert an Auror into the Prime Minister's office to protect the PM, and none of the Muggles noticed.

In short, the wizards already exhibit control over the highest level of Muggle government and can manipulate it as they please, apparently exhibiting a very high level of international cooperation when doing so.

*Fourth preliminary: different victory conditions*

In the event of a conflict between Muggles and wizards, it's important to remember that the different sides have different victory conditions.

Victory for the wizards would mean the return to the status quo. They're not interested in eradicating Muggles, nor do they have any desire to directly administer rule of Muggles (indeed, suggesting such a thing is probably abhorrent to them, given that it was the philosophy of Grindelwald, who seems to be essentially magical Hitler). So the wizards would be fighting for the goal of eradicating the memory of magic from the Muggle political classes then having the Muggle media present the whole thing as a massive hoax.

Victory for the Muggles means complete independence from wizarding interference. This probably means killing or capturing every wizard in the country, as even a single wizard capable of casting the Imperius curse is a major threat to Muggle independence.

Now that the preliminaries are out of the way, let's consider our scenarios.

*Hypothetical pitched battle*

This is the scenario in which Muggles have the best chance, I think. Firearms and other modern weaponry are very quick and will almost certainly kill wizards instantly if they make it past a wizard's defences, rendering magical healing moot. (Though I have no source for it, I believe JKR has stated that wizards have no special immunity to Muggle weapons: if a wizard is hit by a bullet he is affected much the same as a Muggle would be).

The question then becomes how well wizards can prevent themselves being hit by Muggle weapons. This will determine the outcome of the battle. The go-to defence is likely to be the shield charm, which is a wizard's most general defence from attack.

Not all wizards can cast this charm, so those who cannot will likely be killed quickly unless they have some other defence (e.g. some kind of protective amulet) or another person defending them.

Further, some wizards are likely not to cast the charm in time, and they will probably also die (subject to the same exceptions). However, there will undoubtedly be some wizards who do get the shield charm cast correctly and on time. While bullets move quickly, the people holding the weapons still have to lift the weapon and pull the trigger, which takes some time. Enough time for a wizard to /think/ a three.syllable word.

So, how effective would a shield charm be at stopping Muggle weaponry? It seems to me the answer is "very effective". If we're going with magic is energy, clearly wizards have access to more energy than is released by the Muggle weapons. If we're saying magic is supernatural, then magic's ability to ignore physics means that the kinetic energy of bullets, heat of explosions etc. can all be overridden with magic.

A few other related matters: firstly, we know that shield charms do stop physical as well as magical attacks from DH, secondly we know that shield charms maintain themselves between attacks from GoF and DH, thirdly we know that shield charms can be cast to cover large areas from DH, where Harry instantly cast a shield charm which covered hundreds of people simultaneously.

All these considerations point towards wizards taking losses in the opening moments of the fight but becoming immune to Muggle attack after those initial losses. Once they're immune, the Muggles' inevitable numerical advantage is largely moot. Wizards are free to pick Muggles off at their leisure from behind their shield charms.

*Strategic war*

Strategic warfare is unfortunately even more problematic for the Muggles. They have four main problems:

Firstly, the wizards' ability to infiltrate their command structure via apparition, invisibility and shape-changing, gaining intelligence with legilimency, turning any Muggle into their puppet with the Imperius, or simply erasing memories to forget that they're even at war with the wizards.

Secondly, their inability to find magical locations to attack them. There has been speculation about satellites and automation here, but this brings us back to the issue of conceptual magic. Magic doesn't work through physical means.

The Killing curse, for example, does kill by making the heart fail or killing brain activity or anything like that. (We know this from GoF, no physical signs of death). Rather, it just takes you from the category of "alive" into the category of "dead".

Given this, it seems unlikely that secrecy charms can be bypassed by clever indirect routes. The magic doesn't ensure a means, it ensures a result. We know, for example, that the Muggle repelling charms on Hogwarts castle will sometimes make a Muggle decide to walk away, or other times make the castle look like a dangerous ruin to Muggles. It uses whatever means to achieve the result of the Muggle not realising Hogwarts is there.

The unplottable charm is also a big problem for Muggles, as it means any weaponry which uses any kind of coordination (e.g. GPS) can't locate it. You can't even say "hit the thing next to it" because that is itself a form of mapping. Unplottable means that you can know that Hogwarts is next to a the Great Lake, you can have the Great Lake on the map, but you still can't arrive at the conclusion that Hogwarts is next to the lake on the map. The magic prevents that concept from being arrived at.

Thirdly, that wizards don't rely on infrastructure or supply lines. This gives Muggles very little to attack other than the dispersed dwellings of wizards themselves. Hogwarts and the (deep underground) Ministry of Magic are really the only two pieces of infrastructure in magical Britain.

Fourthly, that wizards are hidden amongst the Muggle population. This makes any large scale weapons like nuclear bombs useless even if you could locate them.

Muggles have an advantage in that they might get some wizards to side with them. However, this will be limited, because consider:

- Hermione Granger, as pro-Muggle as you can get, thinks of herself as a witch enough to erase her parents' memories and send them to Australia. Clearly she fully identifies with the magical world after just 6 years of living there.

- Given the level of infiltration already present in the Muggle government, it's likely that the wizards would be aware of any Muggle plans to use Muggleborns against them.

- Magic can block magical people from a location as well as Muggles, so after the first such attack wizards would protect from other magical people as well as Muggles.

- Some magical locations like Hogwarts are already protected

*Civilisation*

Finally, let's compare the Muggle and magical civilisations on a few different levels.

/Understanding of the universe/

Muggles have a huge disadvantage here from the outset, in that they don't know that magic exists. This means that all of Muggle knowledge of the universe is lacking a pretty major part of the way the world works, including such fundamental knowledge as the existence of souls.

But wizards are not limited to just magical knowledge in their advantage. Wizards also have a good understanding of cosmology. In PoA we saw, for sale in the high street, a real time moving model of the entire Milky Way galaxy. We know that it's an accurate model because the books says that it would mean that Harry could skip astronomy class. This is something any Muggle astronomer would kill for.

Wizards also have a superior understanding of time and of the human mind. Understanding of cosmology and the mind are the two holy grails of human academic endeavour.

Muggles have some achievements that wizards cannot boast, however, most notably the Moon landing. However, one wonders if wizards would consider this an achievement at all -- wizards seem to be an inwards looking lot. Their explorations are focused in that direction, not outwards. For example, no wizard ever seemed to have been curious enough about exploring to discover the New World before the Muggles, even though magic would have helped them do so.

Wizards win.

/Social harmony/

Wizards discriminate against people on the basis of blood. Despite this, the first Muggleborn Minister for Magic was elected in 1962.

Wealth is a factor in the wizarding world, with the rich families having superior political access and able to afford luxuries that others cannot. However, even poor wizarding families are still able to own a five bedroom house with a large plot of land, send their children to the same school as the richest children in the country, and access healthcare.

There is no gender discrimination in the wizarding world, with the first woman Minister for Magic in 1798. Nor does there appear to be any racial discrimination beyond that of blood. The jury is out on if there is discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

The wizarding world also seems to be about as progressive as Muggle Germany with regards to attitudes towards sexual liberation, with mixed gender changing rooms at the Quidditch pitch.

The Muggle world discriminates on the basis of gender, race and sexual orientation, in addition to wealth. Again, despite this the discrimination is being overcome, with the first black President of the US in 2008.

Draw. Unsurprising as blood discrimination in the magical world is intended as a metaphor for discrimination in the real world.

/Healthcare/

Wizards have superior healthcare, with the ability to reattach or regrow limbs and bones, instantly cure Muggle illnesses, seal cuts, and replace blood. Furthermore, this healthcare is universal: even the poorest families can access it.

However, wizards are also subject to more dangers than Muggles, with magical diseases and dark magic. Both can affect Muggles too, but the separation of worlds means than Muggles are generally not exposed to them.

Despite this, wizards win.

/Education/

Muggles have a much greater variety of institutes of learning, and also institutions of higher education (universities). Muggle schools are generally safer (though consider: school shootings) and more standardised than magical schools.

However, relative to society's needs each education system seems to perform equally well. The magical world appears not to need universities, with a Hogwarts education sufficient to allow wizards to contribute to the progression of magical knowledge. The magical world has research institutes (Department of Mysteries) and research journals, as well as "gentleman scholars" like Dumbledore and Luna's mother.

The magical world also has a greater equality of education, with rich and poor attending the same school. Internationally, Britain's magical school seems to be on par with other institutions of learning (Triwizard tournament).

Draw.

/Entertainment/

The Muggle world has a greater variety and higher quality of music, fashion, literature, sports, art, as well as its own unique entertainment like TV and movies.

The wizarding world has Quidditch.

Muggles have the internet.

Winner: Muggles, by far.


** If you're drawing up a war scenario, a few things to consider:

Squibs - particularly any that stuck around until adulthood and have a rough idea of where things are in the magical world and feel bitter about their situation would likely side with the muggles. Take one Squib who signed on with the military and depending on what branch he/she went into the wizarding world could have a whole variety of problems. Malfoy Manor having a squib hold the laser pointer thing on it while the plan unloads a smart bomb comes to mind... I know I've read this more than once.

Also, muggleborns like Granger aren't the threat... the problem would be someone like Tom (moral compass wise not power) siding with the muggles. Suddenly /both/ sides find imperio'd people walking into important places before the bombs strapped to them detonate. Harry's lack of interest in history means that we don't know how familiar or not wizards would be with these tactics... but the floo network being turned into a rapid bomb delivery system would be bad for them.

** If the magical's entered a pitched war, they've already lost. There is little to no reason for magicals to actually /fight/ muggles. The magicals ought to be able to mostly destroy muggles without the muggles even knowing theres a war going on. (Of course, this is assuming a species vs species battle, not, e.g. a civil war within Britain of muggles vs magical.)

What do I mean? Magicals should attack muggle infrastructure: attack water supply (e.g. destroy pipes that supply water, or plant poison in the supply), destroy energy sources (e.g. power-plants, oil/coal supply). Do it right, and muggles wouldn't even know who was attacking them.

I can think of three powers that muggles have over magicals: population size, weapons of mass destruction (i.e. nuclear bombs), and biological/chemical weapons.

Magicals should avoid direct confrontation due to muggle numbers. Muggles should be able to overwhelm a magical by numbers (e.g. think ants, think packs of dogs). Further, muggles have a better supply system. E.g. there already exists a large production capability of weapons/resources. Lastly, muggle weapons can have a high rate of attack (e.g. a gatling machine gun has got to eventually overwhelm most magical shields).

Weapons of Mass Destruction need a target, as well as authorization. As you discussed, the magicals are mostly hidden, although they do need to protect against betrayal (squibs, muggleborns, anyone with a conscience against mass slaughter of muggles) (as mentioned elsewhere in this thread). Further, it shouldn't be that difficult using legilmency, imperio, and memory charms to discover locations of mass weapons.

Biological and chemical weapons. I think this would be harder to protect against. For example magicals don't yet have active protection against the common cold (IIRC, they just take a pepper-up potion to cure it), so I assume that that magicals can't protect against this attack vector. The same defenses against Weapons of Mass Destruction could be used, but I suspect it is more difficult to destroy all caches of biological/chemical weapons that it is destroy all nuclear bombs.

Things I would suggest magicals do: a) create a ward that automatically vanishes specific elements. E.g. automatically vanish any uranium that enters the warded area. b) create a shield (or ward) that automatically vanishes any material traveling faster than a specific velocity. c) develop bubble-body charm. d) develop ways to protect against radiation. e) develop ways to clean-up radio-active areas.

I think that for muggles, the best they can hope for is MAD: mutually assured destruction. If the magical world attacks all-out, then raze the world.

Unless, of course, you suddenly give muggles the ability to detect magic. In that case, well, magicals better hurry up and enact their slaughter before this technology becomes widespread.

EDIT: I realized last night that magicals might have had a more difficult time 200 hundred years ago, when there wasn't a centralized infrastructure to destroy. Of course, back then, muggles don't have the advantages of a good supply chain / high-rates of attack.

** You make some pretty big assumptions, particularly in your dismissal of the 'magic as energy' idea. You say that spells create matter when I don't think that's something we can just assume. Maybe it just moves matter, which raises an interesting question as to where the matter comes from.

Also, if matter is created judging magic to be supernatural doesn't change the fact that it gives wizards access to stunning amounts of energy. It's only the wizarding world's insularity, aversion to change and odd lack of curiosity holding them back. Imagine what scientists could do if they had access to someone with the ability to create arbitrary amounts of matter out of nothing, levitate things without physically interacting with them, etc.

You also treat the narrator/characters as reliable in their explanation of things. The idea that muggles can't see the Knight Bus because it's simply too absurd for us to reconcile is itself absurd. Maybe that explanation simply reflects the casual prejudices of wizarding culture and their apparent apathy towards understanding how magic actually works.

Another possible victory condition for muggles is complete integration of the two worlds. Muggles gain access to magic and could at least get to participate in legislation/enforcement of protections from things like the Imperius.

With regard to pitched battle, Protego is directional. The wizards would be wiped out in moments by missiles/grenades/bombs. As for strategic war, yeah, muggles are completely screwed.

*** My basis for the creation of matter is the use of transfiguration to change an object into another object of a different mass. We know that this is possible and we know that transfiguration is a permanent physical change.

Regarding the directionality of protego: I think it's more correct to say that protego is /usually/ directional. It can be adjusted if the caster wishes. For example, the shield charm on the campsite in DH was around the whole area, and Harry's shield charm in the Great Hall at the climax of DH was like an encircling wall.

A shield against heat won't necessarily stop a bullet. A defense that can save you from a lightning strike won't help against fire. Defenses against blunt impacts often don't help against piercing attacks and vice versa.

Which affect a handful of schools internationally per year. There are hundreds of thousands of schools. In contrast, we have one out of three schools that we know about in Harry Potter that have annual terrorist problems, culminating in terrorist control of the school and frequent torture.

No mandatory arithmetic training. How do you keep accounts? No classes on writing; I expect that wizards have atrociously unstandardized spelling and their essays are rambling. No health class -- either magic prevents people from getting minor infections or everyone's spending more on restorative healthcare than preventative, which generally leads to higher costs and lower life expectancies (but perhaps doesn't require as much skill to identify problems).

Enjoyed your write-up, but my own perspective of a magical/muggle ...conflict as it pertains to likely scenario's is as follows.

Point 1... Every human has a soul.

Point 2... Every soul produces some magic.

Point 3... Those who didn't practice magic grew weaker and their magic withered so far they can't use it, not even subconsciously.

--------------

...This lead to different Muggle (withered magic) and Magical (Practicable magic) societies.

Now... Tom Riddle grew up around World War Two, he knows the devastation muggle's can cause, no doubt he's heard at the orphanage about the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombings, killing the equivalent of the entire magical population apiece.

Thus...

Voldemort performs legilimency on high-up military officials, finds the locations of WMD caches - does a little magical testing and discovers he can simply vanish the nuclear fallout and cleanse the air with a few specialised spells.

#+begin_quote
  Turns muggle weapons on muggle's, hundreds of millions / billions die.

  Claim it was World War Three.

  The fallout endangers mages and Voldemort teaches them how to protect themselves.

  Recruit the magical population that are now disgusted at muggles and need a figure to rally behind.

  Dumbledore mocked derisively and muggle-lovers are deemed delusional.

  Rule over the foolish muggles and enraptured mages.

How you gonna use your fine sciences to counter my AK, my Crucio, even my levitation charm? Standard of education would only matter if that education was purely combative, and I can just Imperio your best folk to go to the fighters and tell them to stand down whilst mages sneak up on them.

"Point Me!: Muggle Leader..."

MFW everyone would be capable of magic if weak mages didn't distance themselves all those years back and forewent their magic.

MFW Muggles are imposing on a truly magical world.

MFW someone finds out how to make the muggle's able to use the magic inside them.

Dun-dun-dunnnnn.
