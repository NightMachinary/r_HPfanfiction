Hi, I have a Harry Potter x OFC fic and I promoted it when I had only posted a single chapter but I have twelve now and have 30k words so of anyone is interested I will link it. I post to both ao3 and wattpad so i'll provide both links. Here is the summary :)

In the dark times of Voldemort's second rise to power Elise finds herself entwined with Harry Potter and joins him on his journey to Voldemort's defeat. The darkest time in their lives was brightened by a ray of hope lighting up their lives.
