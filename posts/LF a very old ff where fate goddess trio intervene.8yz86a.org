Looking for a very old crack fic where gods intervene, strike every death eater, fudge umbridge etc with lightning. I remember Dumbledore tried apparating/portkeying in the last chapter and get struck by lightning in the middle. He got admitted to a muggle hospital.


** Harry Potter and the Ultimate Force by DarkKing666 on ffn.net. It has a in progress sequel also.

*** Thanks, but not this one. The one I am looking for had a more crack story. Like to make Harry's life better gods take out all the deatheaters. Fudge was struck down with lightning along with Malfoys at their home. No God descending on earth.
