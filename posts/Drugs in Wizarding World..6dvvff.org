Do you think they would have them? Canonically I know they don't, but still I think it's a neat idea. Would it be a certain potion? A spell?

Well technically I suppose cheering charm, love potions, Veritaserum would classify as drugs right?

Do you think muggle drugs (LSD, meth etc.) would work on wizards? I belieave that the answer is yes, but it's always fun to hear other opinions.


** I absolutely think wizards would have illicit potions, and be susceptible to Muggle drugs. If you want a story that explores wizard drugs, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2301238/1/][Fizz]] is an excellent fic.

***** Funny thing is, they are completly legal. Only the strongest one might be illegal, or at least frowned upon. I don't think wizards know the definition of rape. That being said, whats the diffrence between a love potion, and Imperius curse? They both seek to control you. The biggest diffrence i could find, is that Imperius is illegal.

****** I don't think we know of any magic in the Wizarding World which is straight up illegal. The Unforgivables are only illegal when cast on another human being, i.e killing, torturing or mentally controlling a human being is illegal - doubly so when using those spells.

I would assume then that rape is still illegal in the Wizarding World. What magic, if any, you use to do so is irrelevant (well, unless it was an Unforgivable). The act itself is illegal, and you will be punished appropriately. And so Wizards see no need to restrict particular spells or potions as illegal - it's how you use them that matters.

******* That makes too much sense for something so stupid.

I mean what possible use could Amortentia have besides having sex with someone/making them fall in love with you. It's a potion made for mind control.

Just to be clear, I agree with your idea, but disagree with the stupidity of the wizards.

#+begin_quote
  Since the singular incident of being a Horcrux for many years has left Harry with a sensitivity to Dark magic, Harry begins training with Jacob, a Wizard who lives in New York, using this sensitivity to his advantage to cleanse magical spaces of Dark magic. After a year of training, Draco Malfoy shows up, wanting to learn from Jacob as well, and unexpectedly the two men grow a bond, both magical and physical. But Jacob's sudden death leaves Harry floundering and growing increasingly dependent on drugs and sex to avoid his problems. After his brief and tumultuous affair with Draco ends, Harry begins a life of travel, avoiding returning home permanently and continuing his drug habit. He flits from job to job, from place to place, never settling down for a moment, until, years later, Harry is called back to England by his friends to help Draco find his way out of a cursed Manor.

  [...] it hadn't taken long to work out that genjutsu stood to be the ultimate drug. You could see anything, feel anything, be anything so long as your chakra held out.

One could imagine that some sort of self-legilimency, or an occlumency-related exercise or a skill, would be able to produce similar results.

** I think that muggle drugs would work on wizards and they could probably abuse them all the time considering that they have magic and can probably just reverse and side effects. Wizarding drugs I think are going to either be super well known, going to be unheard of, or its just going to be people abusing medical potions and the ones that you listed. That does raise a very good question on what happens when you take a love potion yourself instead of giving it to another person.

I believe they could not reverse the drug effects, I mean if they can't do a simple eye fix(muggles can) then they are unlikely to have any better luck on drug-effects.

** I see Muggle Drugs working fine, but I would expect Magicals to be more on Hallucinogenics and Pain Killers, and not potions. I see them taking Raw Potions ingredients and using them in different ways, like Snorting Bicorn Horn, soaking and then drinking/eating Grindylow Livers, Stuffing Leafs of some plant in their cheeks like they would chewing tobacco.

I could also see a additional market for those who take weak poisons and then holding out as long as they can before taking a Bezoar. A mix of Thrillseekers and those who like the particular feeling of what ever side effects their poison (They would probably call them "Kickers") of choice is, and how the Bezoar ("The Grounder") interacts with The Kicker
