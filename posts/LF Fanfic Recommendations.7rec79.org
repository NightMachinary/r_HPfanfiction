I just realized that i mostly read either post war stuff or series starting in Harrys first year. Can anyone recommend good stories which take place or begin in year 2,3,4,5 and dont completely throw prior canon character development out of the window ? worldbuilding would be nice. i dont really care about ships but romance should not be the main focus. thanks in advance


** linkffn(Forging the Sword)

One of the best stories in the fandom.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) starts in first year, and most characters behave relatively similar to canon? There's obviously some differences in Harry due to how the author interpreted his upbringing and the fact that Harry has a twin brother, but it's very well written and has a ton of great worldbuilding.

It's also a lot more Â¿logical? than actual canon because the author explains various little details that wouldn't otherwise make sense. It's ongoing, but years 1 and 2 are done.

*** thanks for the recommendation but ideally im looking for something where the first 1,2, 3 or 4 years happens like in canon and the story diverges afterwards
