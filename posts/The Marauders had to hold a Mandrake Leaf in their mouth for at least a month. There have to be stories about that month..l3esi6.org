See title.

The Animagus potion, as per canon (well, Pottermore canon - but it's not-refuted-elsewhere Pottermore canon) involves having to hold a Mandrake Leaf in your mouth for a month - more if you mess it up or if the weather doesn't cooperate. The Marauders all went through this process - so how exactly is it that four of the greatest pranksters in the school managed this feat?

I'm surprised at myself that I don't know any fics about the Mandrake Month, but it sounds like the sort of thing that would inspire at least a few good ones, so can this subreddit help me out with finding any?


** I think it's hilarious to think about how exactly they had to keep it in their mouths, and through what. Did it need to be in direct contact with their tongue? Could they put it against their cheek? How'd they eat without accidentally swallowing the leaf? Someone had to notice if they weren't talking as much bc of a leaf. Did they cover it up with some kind of prank on each other? (Could only sing lyrics/spout poems/etc so they had reason not to speak) I'd love to see any fics that talk about this too

******* Then you're not using the right type of glue. There are thousands of different glues, and if you want one that can work inside your mouth, then one probably exist, and if not it should be possible to make one. And the sticking charm is making it too easy? What? Are we balancing for a DnD campain? What if you use something to hold the leaf in, and then stick /that/ to the top of your mouth, then you won't be directly applying any wand spells to the leaf.

We are talking about an entire month here, you know. If you can't keep it still I doubt any leaf would survive within your mouth that long. Nevermind the bacteria and microbes the leaf will no doubt be exposed to, it'd have to be able to survive that for the potion to even be viable in the first place, but what about the multiple different types of acid within your saliva? Your mouth's PH level can range between 6.2 and 7.6 without factoring in food. With that, it can jump immensely. Add to that the movement of actively moving about a god damn leaf within your mouth at all times and that leaf is going to dissolve. If you think my solution is too easy, then I think your disimissal of it is making it too hard. I don't think it would be possible otherwise. Not unless you ascribe more than a necessary amount of magical thoughness to a Mandrake leaf, or otherwise prepare it beforehand, either with a spell or a potion. Then we're back where we started of making things 'too easy'. I sincerly doubt anyone in normal reality can actually keep a single leaf safe and undamaged within their mouth for an entire month, not unless you seal it within plastic or something, which would presumably invalidate the entire ritual.

Also, if you are inventive with the magic system in use there will always be more solutions. If you have the details, and the reason /why/ each step of the potion is what it is, then you can change it. Like; does the leaf need to be intact? I imgaine it probably does, but /how/ intact? What's the limit for that? Why the mouth? Is it possible to keep it in a solution of your own blood for a month, which you then refill twice every day or something? What about time magic? Can you put the leaf in stasis? And so only keep it within your mouth in intervals? This is not an easy thing to ask of anyone, and solutions needs to be found, and 'sticking it to the top of your mouth with a sticking charm' is both the simplest, most understandable, and most likely to work, in my opinion.

This is the Wizarding World we're talking about; those people will believe nearly anything they read from "reputable" sources (like, for example, Rita Skeeter hatchet articles).

***** Agreed that it'd be interesting, but I honestly don't see why that'd be so (spell interference). I'll explain why:

*First, the mandrake has to be held inside the wizard's body for a month at the least.* Specifically their mouth. During this time, there are no mentions of dietary restrictions, conflict with other potions, etc. Add in things like Barf Slugs spell that affect the general area... In a magic school where students regularly hex each other in class and in the corridors, the process would be impossible to complete. Even if they managed to get themselves a strategic detention for the duration of "mandrake phase", they'd still need to participate in the practical portions of classes like Charms, and DADA.

*Next, the leaf would be inside a wizard that ate, drank, breathed for the entire duration.* There WOULD be some contamination, from potion fumes for example. Add in that unless we assume that the magic comes from a magic stick (wand), then a wizard is a magical creature and their fluids, such as blood, saliva, etc. hold traces of their magic - and the leaf would be positively marinated in it. So why would a bit more matter? As long as it was the wizard in question that did it, there should be no problem.

*Finally, magical themes.* Sticking charm has the general theme of "joining", which in no way impedes soaking the leaf in their magic. Might actually help. After all, the animagus process is supposed to be very personal and the form different for each individual.

  PoA AU in which -- Harry isn't so clumsy, Dobby's worth is realized, Sirius has priorities other than vengeance, and Luna is Luna. This is the result of my internet being down and not being able to feed my World of Warcraft addiction. Exactly zero plot mapping has gone on with this and it will likely continue until I am bored to tears with it. It will likely be borderline crack and I will likely make Harry ridiculously powerful. There will be attempts made at humor sprinkled in throughout the fic. I've yet to decide on any pairings in the fic but if there are any all types of pairings will be considered, you have been warned. I'll try to post warnings for Graphic Content but I'll likely forget. This isn't smut nor is it going to be too gory, it is after all only 3rd year. I'll make no promises about the rate that this will come out but in three days of writing it has around 16k words to give you an idea of how quickly I write. This at the moment is pure catharsis, if it gets to the point where there are people wanting more I'll certainly do my best to deliver.

If it was anyone but Sirius, maybe. Bellatrix could do very little wrong, nor could Regulus. Sirius, though, was pretty much as bad off as Harry was at the Dursleys - or possibly worse.

While it's true it isn't directly stated anywhere in books (that I know of), the combination of James' behaviour and the fact that they sheltered Sirius when he ran away without much trouble, [[/u/Marawal]]'s version has some merit. James was too confident, too disrespectful of rules and his fellow students and too convinced he'd be able to get what he wanted or avoid trouble to be a result of strict parenting.

********* Quoting myself for the first part:

#+begin_quote
  Their problem with Sirius wasn't that he wasn't enough of a 'bad boy', it was that he openly disrespected their blood-purity views. It could be argued that the Animagus transformation is a deliberate attempt to make his blood 'more impure', thus it's something that they emphatically wouldn't want Sirius to do.
#+end_quote

Either way, they didn't approve of his putting posters up with permanent Sticking Charms either - so that'd be one of the reasons they might take his wand away, or at least pay very close attention so they could intercept any trouble immediately.

99% of the world isn't mentioned in any canon material for Harry Potter. Doesn't mean it doesn't exist.\\
The zero hypothesis is that Peter had two biological parents - this being the norm for most teens 15 and under. Thus, what would require proof is that Peter's father /isn't/ in the picture - and no such proof exists either.

With three Marauders undergoing Animagus preparations, there would have been 426 James's, Sirius's, and Peters around the entire castle for about five hours.

426 bored Marauders.

It wouldn't be so bad at first, for the first week's worth of time. I think they'd still find things to do like reading obscure library books, or setting up pranks, or doing homework.

But once they visit the library in a Time Turner cycle, they can't go back to the same section otherwise they might interact with Past Them. Not even mentioning bathrooms-- even if Hogwarts has seemingly infinite rooms, it's improbable that the Marauders are familiar with the locations of 142 bathrooms.

They wouldn't have that many people to talk to because of the super high chance that their conversation partner would find too many versions of them around the castle. They can't talk well to each other either, because the leaf is uncomfortable.

So the month progresses and our dear Marauders get progressively desperate for entertainment.

If they survive the month, everyone in Hogwarts would face the wrath of an entire month of Extremely Bored Marauders, all in the span of five hours, and cumulating into the extravagant pranking spree that would surely ensue from post-Mandrake-Month celebrations!

Sirius likely said it as dramatically as possible to McGonagall, and her, tired of the Marauders' bullshit, was perfectly fine with not hearing their voices for a month. Then again, Minny probably knew damn well what they were doing and why and she spied on them as a cat to make sure they were safe.

** I only know one fic that addresses this, it's about Hermione finding out she's a pureblood; her father is Regulus Black and the point-of-view alternates between Hermione in the present and reading his diaries. Regulus comments on Sirius and his friends "not fooling anyone" with their month long "vow of silence", especially since the mandrake leaf smells strongly. This prompts Regulus to go through the Animagus process himself.

In the fic I linked, it's funny that Regulus says his brother isn't fooling anyone, but at the same time, it's clear that no one else has noticed the mandrake leaf, or if they have, they didn't mention it in a way that Regulus knows about (much like Harry's obliviousness as a narrator in the books). I would think McGonagall would be the first to notice that 3 students in her House were doing this, a process she obviously went through and students she would see frequently for classes, meals, and discipline.

In Presque Toujours I can see this happening because like, I can see Regulus paying more close attention to them because it's his brother and he seems like the type to pay close attention even if they're estranged. Also, I can absolutely see McGonagall just being too freaking relieved to want to delve too deep into why.

*** I think it is somewhat likely for them to have done it during the school year, because of the next step of the process and because Sirius's family definitely wouldn't let him get away with it.

Their problem with Sirius wasn't that he wasn't enough of a 'bad boy', it was that he openly disrespected their blood-purity views. It could be argued that the Animagus transformation is a deliberate attempt to make his blood 'more impure', thus it's something that they emphatically wouldn't want Sirius to do.

Plus, there's the /next/ step of the process - which requires dew from "a place untouched by humans or sunlight for seven days", which probably has to be added pretty quickly after the Mandrake Leaf (I highly doubt a saliva-soaked leaf will keep for long, and given how hard it's stated to be I doubt preservative magic can be used). Places like that (especially ones that would still produce dew - meaning plantlife has to exist) aren't easy to come by - in fact, the Forbidden Forest might be their only hope for it.

They /might/ have started the process at home to reduce time spent making excuses, but they definitely would have had to do at least part of it at Hogwarts.
