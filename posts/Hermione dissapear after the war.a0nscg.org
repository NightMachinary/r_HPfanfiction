LF fic where Hermione dissapear after war. She cut ties with friends and whole magic community. Usually I don't like this kind of story. Really? Hermione would not abandoned friends without a word. But... maybe is there fic who is good and describe this logically, interesting and I just miss this fic? You know something like that? :)

It doesn't matter if Hermione has memory loss or can't deal with memory of war or, I don't know, escape from husband.

Yeah, right. That's not how Harry, Ron or anyone else in the books would act. It's an overly dramatic "Martyr Hermione gets betrayed by everyone and suffers for her friends who forget her" story that makes no sense.

*** I second this. It's a very well-written fic that manages to be depressing in its tone through necessity, without being over the top grimdark stuff; any tonal shift in /either/ direction would have lessened the fic.

Also, what do you think was frustrating about the ending? I thought it was where it was naturally heading based on the tone of the rest of the fic; they're both still broken (heh) people who will need time to deal with what they've been through, but they can make a good start together. I will concede that the epilogue fic that was written was a massive letdown, however, and choose to disregard it.

**** I never got around to the epilogue fic because I was worried that it would be a letdown.

The ending was just frustrating to me because I felt like there was almost no tangible progression in the buildup that took place throughout the entire fic. Like, I expected a huge ending where things just came unglued, but the last chapter was just like the last 30 seconds of a song where it fades out into silence

***** The song analogy is an interesting one, and it sort of does just fade away at the end without a concrete picture of where they're going to end up. Which could have been useful for letting the reader decide for themselves what the future would hold, since there were definitely multiple ways that Draco and Hermione could have progressed from that point.

For anyone else reading, massive spoilers from this point:

I always thought that Hermione would have ended up spending some more time with Harry so she could tell him more about Matthew, while also re-kindling her friendships with the rest of the Weasleys, sans-Ginny. At the same time she and Draco would continue to be the primary emotional supports for each other while also stumbling through a new relationship that will end up being rather unconventional, but no less successful or loving. I also imagine that she and Harry would have eventually told the rest of the Weasleys about Matthew, despite the obvious awkwardness that that would create. Undoing some of her lies and trying to be truthful with the people she cares about was already something she had started on in the fic, and was likely to continue into the future.

And I don't think you would have liked the epilogue fic, it was rather mundane. Not that I would have imagined the future to be all wacky and action-filled or anything, but the epilogue left me thinking "....That's it?"

****** Yeah, I'm not criticizing the ending or the author because I share the same ideas on it as you, but I do wish there could have been something more concrete. It just felt like there should have been more progression in their relationship than there ever was. I'm not big into the romance genre, so it may be par for the course, but it felt to me like the reason everything wasn't falling together was simply because the author didn't want it to fall together, rather than because there was something between them. I think they could have established something pretty solid by, say, chapter 28 rather than something intangible in chapter 35. I don't remember what was going on in chapter 28 or anything, I'm just using that as an arbitrary timeline.
