I remember once reading a fic where both pairs (Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione) ended up soulbonded, but I don't remember what it was. It was also a time travel fic, but I also don't remember exactly. I remember the characters went back to the Chamber of Secrets accident on 2nd year. Could anyone help me with the name of it?


** Forget it! I just found it!

  When Draco Malfoy misses his weekly probation meeting Auror Harry Potter and his partner Ron Weasley agree to quietly look into it. What they discover at his home will send them and their wives on a mission through time. After all the only reason Draco Malfoy would go back in time would be for evil purposes... Right?
