** i think there is no ship in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3771102/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Irish-Choice]] or most of his stuff or if there is it's always almost just a add on saying "oh he married this witch" and thats it.

#+begin_quote
  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

** Time travel Harry, but still one of the best I have ever read. No romance. No bullshit nonsense. Just an op harry who kills Voldy in the most epic way possible!\\
You won't regret reading this story!
