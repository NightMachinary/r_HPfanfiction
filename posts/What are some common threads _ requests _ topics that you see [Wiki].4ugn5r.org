I've seen lots of the same threads over and over again, and I wanted to know which ones you all see.

List 'em down below (with links to some threads preferably ^{^{it'll}} ^{^{make}} ^{^{make}} ^{^{my}} ^{^{job}} ^{^{a}} ^{^{lot}} ^{^{easier}} ), and I'll compile them for the wiki. Thanks!


** The Trope threads. Bad trope/Good trope/Weird trope/Rare trope/Trope trope/Untrope/Almost Trope...

You get the point. Lotta tropes.

I'll try and look some of the threads up tomorrow because bloody buggering hell I'm tired and need to go to bed.

** I think Slytherin!Harry is a pretty common request. Or requests for fics that want a dark!Harry.

** Oh man the most common and the one i love most. The "LF Well Written fics" or "LF Good fics" threads. I love them. If i don't see "well written" or "good" i just rec the shittiest fic i can find but when you put it i completely change my perspective. /s

Jokes aside, time travel, overpowered harry, not boy who lived harry, james or lily survives. Then there are the ship fics like Snape/Hermione, Harry/Draco, Harry/Ginny. We have time period stories, Marauder's era, next generation, founder's era.

** One type I see a lot is a thread requesting help identifying a story that the OP previously read. The OP will provide as many identifying details as they can remember, and hopefully someone will remember, or know how to make Google remember.

**** As someone who has made this sort of request once or twice, and answered it a few more times, I really agree that it would be nice to have a sticky for this :-) Then you can just scroll through all the LFs.

** Recs: by pairing, by time period (4th year, post-Hogwarts, Marauders' era, etc), by main character, by trope, by length, combos of those.
