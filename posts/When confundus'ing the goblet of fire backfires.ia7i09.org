The spell wears off a bit earlier then Barty Jr expects and the consequences are a bit extreme. The goblet decides to fix the "there is no fourth school" problem by summoning two alternate versions of the chosen one. Each champion will be supported by a version of Harry. The original ending up on hogwarts team with Cedrik, while the others go to durmstarngs and beauxbatons respectively. Chaos ensues and Rita Skeeter has a field day.


** The summoned versions of Harry have bits of magic and personality from the other champions mixed in.

So Fleur's Harry is Harriet with a minor allure.

Krum's Harry has a leaning towards the Dark Arts, and more comfortable with his celebrity status

Cedric's Harry is regular Harry

At the end of the tournament as soon as the Triwizard Cup is touched and he is portkeyed to the graveyard, the other 2 merge back with Harry with their knowledge and abilities.

Oh, I also read a good theory on why Voldy waited for the end of the tournament to take him. He didn't want to take the chance that stealing Harry's blood would somehow transfer part of the binding magical contract from the Goblet of Fire to him. But as soon as he touched the Cup, the tournament ended.

*** I read another interesting one long ago that made the ritual more complex; he waited until the end because the target of the ritual needed to live in fear and overcome great challenges in order for the ritual to work. There might also have been some changing of dates so the ritual took plave on the winter solstice or something similar.. no vlue what it was though.

**** Is that the one where the whole ritual was based on Rebirth and human gestation?

The bone of the father had to marinate for 9 months in a potion based in unicorn blood

The servant had to attend to the homunculus holding the soul of the the one to be reborn for 9 months

The enemy had to live in fear for 9 months

Then combine all 3 for Rebirth.

I cant remember which this is, maybe The Accidental Animagus. Linkffn(9863146)

***** That.. does almost sound familiar, so yes it might be. Or it might be another similar fic that I've read.. they tend to blur together after a certain point, and I've actually only been keeping a list of fics I've dropped, not a list of those I've read. Should probably do that..

****** Uhhhhhhh.... Give me a bit to search through my favorites, I'm like 95% sure I've read this one. The "Must Live in Fear" is giving me strong deja vu.

Edit: Welp, bad news. Going through my favorites didn't help in finding the story, although I am still 95% sure that it's in there somewhere.

Edit #2: Question. Does the idea that this fanfic also revolved around there being two types of Triwizard Tournaments, with one being a super deadly variant that the cup itself controls ring a bell? I ask because I remember that fanfic as well being on my favorites and not being able to find it. I'm wondering if they are the same and was deleted or something.

******** Yup, that'd be the one, even found the chapter and paragraph where it mentioned it. Chapter 43.

#+begin_quote
  Sirius expelled a harsh breath. "We think so." He sighed. "The ritual is very long and involved. But the final part requires something from an enemy who has been in fear of his life and tested for the majority of the nine months prior to the eve of the Summer solstice which is when the end of the ritual has to take place."
#+end_quote

Not gonna lie, I glanced at A Marauder's Plan and just went "That's not the one.", even though in my mind I kept thinking Sirius vehemently tried to oppose the tournament for that very reason.

â€‹

I'm still curious which story is the other one I'm trying to remember. I feel like it's called something like "Harry Potter and the Champion's Triwizard", but nothing I have found points towards it. Knowing my luck, it's not a 4th year fic as well, hence me being unable to locate it.

**** I've read it a couple times at least. An old and new world by lens of sanity (I think, original story has been pulled down now and the author is slowly republishing it).

It was also poked fun at in full circle by tetsurashian , where Voldemort did it for those reasons... but it was made out that he was just being superstitious, with no actual basis for his belief.

It was summer solstice, not winter solstice that was being targeted

** These could make a really interesting story!

The two summoned Harry could be so different yet the same person as the original and that could origin a lot of funny situations.

Like we have Canon Harry and then a Female Harry and then a Slytherin Harry and the three would be really different in their personalities but still at the end of the day get in a duel and use the same spell (Expelliarmus obviously) at the same time.

And the three Harrys could fight all the time but of course they all agree on one thing, the Goblet summoning them is really suspicious and Voldemort must be behind that, so of course they band together to destroy him.

Someone should really write this!

** You can create some interesting interactions depending on what fan versions of Harry you go with. I personally envision this scenario with Taure's Victoria Potter and Hogwarts Battle School Harry. Fleur shocked that her alternative self did the tango with Harry or Krum wondering who exactly is that sassy slytherin girl or even the simple interactions between the 3 chosen ones would be fun to see.

**** Well I mean it just seems weird, the Goblet reverts back to knowing that there are only three schools and that only one champion gets to participate to represent each school, so it's solution is to screw things up even further?

I get that I'm being a buzzkill, but maybe a different type of situation could cause this?

***** OK, how about the goblet throwing the curse off seconds after Dumbledoor reads the paper with Harry's name on it. By that time it would be impossible to get Harry off the tournament as stated in the book and so a more creative solution would be required.

****** It was only impossible because it was binding as the goblet said he had to participate. Harry was chosen to represent a school. If the Goblet found out that Harry's school doesn't exist nor does he even go to the school and that another joining wasn't supposed to be an option, I doubt it would let him participate anymore. The thing is even though Harry's technically representing Hogwarts, to the Goblet he was representing a school that doesn't exist meaning that it wouldn't give the other champions other Harry's to be fair, since Cedric never had a Harry.

I'm just being a buzzkill, maybe it should just be a crack-fick because there's just no way I'm taking a situation where the goblet clones alternate Harry's seriously when it's much more simpler for it to un-choose Harry then choose a bunch of other Harry's to join. But it could just be me.

******* Hmmm how about Harry that has become a master of death deciding to throw a spanner in the works of Canon Harrys story by summoning the other two and modifying the contract made by the goblet as a method to alleviate his boredom. The end result would be the same and since we dont know exactly what becoming the master of death does we might as well assume he is on a god like level. Personally though i dont like that explanation all that much since i dont like master of death Harry trope in general.

******** Well someone else tampering with the goblet to make it do dumb shit I guess is makes more sense than the Goblet resorting to choosing other Harrys over just kicking Harry's school out.

But it should still probably be a crack fic.
