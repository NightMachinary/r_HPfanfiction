For example the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8417562/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Global-Revelation][Albus Potter series]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3435601/NoahPhantom][NoahPhantom]]. Another obvious example would be the actual original Harry Potter series.

I personally think mysterious and extensively planned and complex plots are the most underused thing in HP FanFics. I love reading them so if you guys know of any sharing would be appreciated.


** linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) and its three (so far) sequels. It is astoundingly good, but you probably want a second opinion on that. It can be a bit divisive.

****** The series? 7 books, like HP; that's what Inverarity's said on his blog. The time it takes to write these books (I do believe he's committed enough to do it) will honestly probably take until 2025, at the rate he's writing the fifth book.

** How about this?: linkffn(8940909) One of the longest series on FFN and it updates regularly.

Also this: linkffn(6950954) Updates less regularly but nearly 2 million words so far.

Oh yeah and don't forget the Sacrifices Arc: linkffn(2580283)

******* The trend I'm seeing with harems in HP is that because HP takes place in the "real world" and in modern times it comes off as extra bullshitty and authors generally need to rely on some crutch for it to even make sense.
