In so many time travel fics Harry and whoever goes with him tend to declare Dumbledore to be untrustworthy and do their level best to make sure he suspects nothing. Even in the cases where Dumbledore isn't bashed, I've seen it said that "Dumbledore would agree with us that he shouldn't be involved.". The only fic I can think of in which Dumbledore is both told, and then actively participates in the plot, is Backwards with a Purpose, but I kind of went off that when Ron started grooming Hermione.

So, does anyone know of any others? Preferably with no romance.


** It's Hermione not Harry going back, but check out linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them).

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  What if Voldemort had not called for a cease-fire half-way through the final battle? What if the death toll had continued to mount until in the end, Harry stood victorious but alone? What if Harry decided that such an outcome was unacceptable and set out to change things, to re-write the prophesy that had always defined his life? WARNING: not JUST about time-travel.

  "If you meant the beginning of this current situation, well... my name is Harry Dresden. I'm a wizard of the White Council and a private investigator out of Chicago in my world. Where, I might add, you are a fictional character, and the boy whose body I've gotten stuffed into is the star of a series of popular childrens' books bearing his name."

  Harry Dresden has taken a lot of blows to the head over his career, and woken up in a lot of interesting places, but... aboard the Hogwarts Express in the body of an eleven-year-old boy with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead? Yeah, that's a new one. Most people, they'd just enjoy the ride, but Dresden has read the books, and he REALLY doesn't like dark wizards...
