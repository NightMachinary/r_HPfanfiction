I'm looking for a harry potter fanfiction where harry get wings, it during harry's 5th or 6th year, it starts with harry and a selected other group of people from hogwarts being chosen to go on a trip to another world to go a a kind of field trip, but harry goes out and gets pulled into a portal early when he gets there things start to revile about him his father James comes from this world and harry learns that he inherited wings from him but his wings are black so he is a "cursed one" and they are very powerful fighters with uncontrollable rage harry also has living family in this world and there's also people with white wings that have healing abilities but are very weak. Normal people in this world also have I think have grey wings I think.
