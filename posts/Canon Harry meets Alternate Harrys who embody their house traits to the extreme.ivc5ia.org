Canon Harry somehow comes to meet Alternate Harrys who were sorted into the 4 houses. Except these Harrys take the generally accepted traits of their respective houses to the extreme.

Gryffindor Harry: Overly noble, valiant, brave and chivalrous. He is Prideful and utterly without fear. Backs down from no challenge. Wears a sword on his hip and chainmail under his robes. Is commonly referred to as Sir Harry. (Basically a Medieval Knight). Actively seeks out danger in hopes of combating it; is accused of being an adrenaline junkie.

Slytherin: Is cunning and ambitious to the extreme and is utterly ruthless in his pursuit of power. Is overly charming and thinks he is better than everyone else. Tries to blackmail the other Harrys.

Ravenclaw: A Harry whos pursuit of knowledge knows no bounds. Has foregone any and all human contact and now is only concerned with satisfying his every curiosity, no matter the cost. Is very anti-social.

Hufflepuff: A workaholic with extreme loyalty, not only to his friends but all authority. He is enamored by Justice in its truest form and leads him to work himself to the bone, always serving what he thinks is Just but is coming under doubt that those he is loyal too are not Just.


** i would contest that being brave is utterly lacking fear, because to be brave is to do something despite being afraid of said thing.

That said this would be hillarious to watch

** There is a similar story I think it's called path of mirrors. Harry looks in to this mirror that shows what he would be like if he had been in a different house. It only shows the house that would have been the next most likely house for whoever looks in it. It's pretty good but it's unfinished if I remember correctly.

** Try: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12979337/1/Harry-Potter-et-al-and-the-Keystone-Council]] It's not exactly the same but it does have multiple Harry Potter's from different universes. A Harry Potter raised by Goblins in Ravenclaw A Gryffindor Harry raised by his Father and his Godmother Amelia Bones Canon Harry A female version of Harry in Slytherin A female version of Harry in Gryffindor

Each of the "Harry's" can communicate with each other and advise and learn from the others. Only on chap 38, but it's pretty good read so far

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (Mostly fluff, no character bashing.)
