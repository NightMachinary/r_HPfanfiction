Any fics where Harry, or any character really, is heavily involved in politics?

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.

  Alternate Universe. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

Snape and his very sudden OC time-travelling wife plot to work the future to their mutual advantage, no matter what it takes.

There's no Wizengamot or Ministry drama, it's all chats over cups of tea and home made jam, but there's a lot of scheming to get things to work out the right way.

  Mess with power and you get what you deserve. Bilia Stevens had nothing left to lose when she took the wand, stone and cloak, so if she could meddle with time and space and gain eternal protection from death, why wouldn't she?"Send me where I can do the Wizarding World the most good," she said, as a sop to Fate, but it was Death that laughed in her ears as she tumbled into the nasty little bedroom of a nasty little man.Well, Bilia Stevens wasn't all that nice herself, if it came to it.
