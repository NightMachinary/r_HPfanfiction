By that I mean what factors it takes into account and how it weighs/prioritizes those factors.

We know the Sorting Hat used Harry's preference of Gryffindor over Slytherin. We know that it looked at his personality, talents/strengths, and desires. It also alluded to Slytherin offering what he /needed/ to reach his goals.

So we have 5 factors: preference, personality, desires/goals, talents/strengths, and needs. Do I have this right or am I missing something? I know there is some overlap with these factors and they all influence each other.

Back to the original question, how do you think the Sorting Hat prioritizes these factors to make a sorting decision? How is it weighing the criteria? Is it different per person?

The way I think it works (not necessarily how I think it should work):

1. Personality
2. Talents/Strengths
3. Preferences
4. Desires/Goals
5. Needs/Shore up weaknesses


** In my opinion, the Sorting Hat looks into 3 things:

- In what House the student would would fit the most
- In what House the student would grow the most
- In what House the student wants to go the most

As for ranking, I don't think the Hat has a clear one, but he rather functions on a case by case basis.

Harry was sent in Gryffindor because, as seen in CoS, that's the perfect House for him, and he is pretty much a poster boy for the House. Yet, the Hat still proposed to send him to Slytherin, because "it would help him on the way to greatness", the Hat thought he should go in Slytherin (either to learn something about ambition/cunning or because of the Scarcrux influence), but he in the end he abided by Harry's choice.

In comparaison, Neville (or rather early Neville) is a terrible Gryffindor. He doesn't have any talent, he is shy as well as cowardly, he is pretty much a poster boy for the Hufflepuff (and not the hardworking ones, the "leftovers ones"). But, by the end of PS, Neville show some hint of courage, which grow up to the point of even taking out Gryffindor's sword by DH. Gryffindor may not have been the most confortable House for Neville, but it's the one that brought out the best out of him.

And sometimes, the Hat send people where they want to go, even if it would not really benefit them. Outside of being bully and bigot, I don't see any of Slytherin qualities in Crabbe and Goyle, and yet they still went in that House. Probably because they had been brainwashed into thinking it was the best House ever and they had no other choice but to go there.\\
In a lesser measure, I think the same thing happened to Zacharias Smith. I can't seem him as loyal, or hardworking, but he went to Hufflepuff because "he is related to Hufflepuff herself and it must be the family House" (either that or there is some truth into Hufflepuff taking the leftovers).

â€‹

So, in my opinion, while there is no clear ranking between a student "confort" and "needs", a student desire is the most important factor. I think a student can go anywhere, as long as he wishes it hard enough (some extreme case like Riddle would not to basically hypnotise themselve to not go in their initial House, but it would be technically possible).

** I think it's decisions are entirely, 100% arbitrary. And I will list five reasons why I believe that to be true.

1.) The system doesn't need to exist anymore, it's a legacy for the sake of tradition. The hat knows this, and even loudly advocates for the divisive traditions to be abandoned in favor of "inter-house unity." The hat is actively preaching against the very system it exists to enforce. Why would it do this if the houses actually mattered?

2.) 11 is too young to determine a child's personality, talents, life goals, or ambitions. An 11 year old Harry put into Hufflepuff would have more friends and emotional support, an 11 year old Harry put into Ravenclaw would study more. The houses are a self-fulfilling prophecy of stereotypes, and the hat would know this.

3.) The Founders themselves weren't choosing people that young. They were "sorting" apprentices who were, at the very least, already teenagers or young adults. We have indirect proof that this is true: the Founders were interested in traits that children only start to display after they begin turning into young adults. Dumbledore has said several times throughout the series: they sort students */too early./* The hat would know this as well.

4.) The Founders also were largely arbitrary in their selections, preferring students that would be easy to teach, who were already inclined to think in similar ways to themselves. The only person who truly sorted his group aggressively was Slytherin, and even then, his great point of contention was that he didn't trust muggleborns because he believed they would betray and destroy Hogwarts. His most important criteria was political, not academic.

5.) If people were actually sorted by their innate traits, or where they would do the best and flourish the most, almost everyone we know is in the wrong house. Which means the Sorting Hat can't possibly be sorting people to where they will actually "fit in the best." Consider the following three examples. They're going to be long, but stick with me here, there's a reason I'm going into depth about it. I'm actually going to post it as a reply to myself, because it's too long to fit in one post.

*** */Example one./* Salazar Slytherin hand-picked students who were resourceful, determined, had a certain disregard for the rules, who were cunning, who had true and genuine ambition, and who were pure of blood descent. By those criteria, the most Slytherin students in the castle are... the Weasley Twins. Fred and George are the */consummate/* Slytherins, the true Slytherin */ideal./* The twins absolutely embody every single trait Salazar wanted to see in his students. We see no one in the castle who was more resourceful than they were. They were more determined than almost anyone else. They were aggressive and ambitions in their determination. They knew what they wanted, and didn't let anyone stand in their way, not the faculty or the other students, not even their own mother. The showed true cunning, doing the things they did in ways it couldn't be tied back to them, tweaking the noses of the very teachers and getting away with it. They played their ambitions even father, becoming wealthy and successful businessmen, the most successful members of their family in fact. And finally, the Weasleys are absolutely an old and truly pure-blooded family. Nobody can dispute that. The twins are pure of blood on both sides of the family, back as many generations as you care to go. The twins check every single box Salazar cared about in his students, they only thing they are missing is being Parselmouths, but Salazar can't possibly have had the whole house speak his language, the gift was too rare. So if the Sorting Hat puts people in the house *most suited to their innate talents and proclivities,* the twins are 100% in the wrong house.

*/Example two./* What if the hat isn't putting people where they belong, but where it thinks they would flourish the most? Maybe it put the twins in Gryffindor to encourage their bravery and better moral nature? Well, sorry, but that doesn't work either, because Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ronald Weasley were all put in Gryffindor. If the hat was putting people in the house where they would have the best experience and live the fullest life and time at Hogwarts, Harry would have gone to Hufflepuff, Hermione would have gone to Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw, and Ron would have gone to Ravenclaw or Slytherin. The reasoning for this is simple: Harry has never struggled with bravery or honor, or needed either in his life. He gains nothing from being sorted into Gryffindor. But what /does/ Harry want? What does 11 year old Harry truly need? People he can trust, who support him unconditionally. Harry wants, more than anything else, a family. The mirror showed that. Of all the houses, only Hufflepuff would have given Harry Potter the thing he /needed/ the most as a person.

The same is true of Hermione and Ron. Hermione was picked on and belittled, she had no true friends. Like Harry, she was alone and needed support. Hermione did not need more bravery, or better habits of study. She needed people who would accept her. Hufflepuff would have given her a family; Ravenclaw would have given her peers. Likewise, Ron is defined by his /ambitions/*/./* He dreams of being everything his brothers were, as cool as Bill, as loved as Charlie, as funny as the twins, as successful as Percy. The mirror showed him his hearts desire, and it was being everything his brothers had been and more. Ron was defined by his ambitions from the very beginning. Also, Ron showed a proclivity towards complex intellectual exercises and logic from an early age: he was a skilled chess player, and this was called out repeatedly. So at least in the beginning, Ron was not quite as stupid as he seemed. Slytherin would have served to help him further his own ambitions for success, giving him the tools to rise above his brothers and be noticed for his own merits, and Ravenclaw would have nurtured that burgeoning cleverness before it fell fallow.

So if the Sorting Hat puts people in the house *that is best for their own needs and personal development and maturity*, then Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all in the wrong house.

*/Example three./* Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter. And here is where I make my argument that the Sorting Hat's choices are truly arbitrary and based on nothing more than whimsy. Because canonically, Draco embodies /none/ of the traits sought out by /any/ of the Founders. He is not cunning, and never has been: his attacks and bullying are blatant and in the open. He is not intelligent: to the best of our knowledge, he is an average student in all respects. He is visibly inferior in practical magic. His best subject is potions, but that seems entirely due to favoritism, not intelligence or talent: Hermione was doing more complex potioneering in her second year in an out-of-order toilet than Draco could manage in his 6th year. Draco is not particularly loyal, disdains hard work, and family means little to him. His only redeeming qualities are his willingness to rush face-first into things he sees as a problem, and his own blood purity. But without other qualities that Godric and Salazar both wanted, those aren't virtues.

*So why was Draco Malfoy put in Slytherin, the house that, by all accounts, seems to ask the most of the people who attend it, that has the highest standards of all, at least on paper?*

The answer, to me, seems pretty simple. The hat knew good and well that if Draco Malfoy wasn't sorted into Slytherin, he would throw a massive tantrum about it and demand that his father, who was on the Board of Governors for the school, come down and "fix" his sorting. And then the hat would have to sit on a shelf in Dumbledore's office and listen to Lucius bitch and Draco tantrum about having him re-sorted or re-assigned. And maybe Dumbledore would eventually give them what they want, or maybe Dumbledore wouldn't, but one thing the hat knew for sure is that he didn't want to have to sit there and listen to that two and a half hour long argument.

So without even /looking/ at Draco's mind, without even /considering/ him, the hat /immediately and instantaneously sorted him into Slytherin./ The reason: to shut him and his father the fuck up. It doesn't matter where he goes, just send him where he wants to be. It's less drama.

And funnily enough... that's exactly why Harry got sorted into Gryffindor. An 11 year old, who is most certainly /not/ prepared to make a decision about who his friends and family should be for the next decade of his life, /asked/ the hat to not put him in Slytherin... and the hat gave him what he wanted, too, just like he gave Draco what he wanted. The hat deferred the decision to the child, who couldn't possibly have known where he ought to be any better than a dice roll would have.

*/And this is why I know, with absolute certainty, that the hat's sorting methods are completely arbitrary, and don't hinge on anything at all besides the whims of the hat. The twins, Harry, Ron, and Hermione all prove that people aren't being sorted to the place that suits their talents OR the house that would nurture them the best. But Draco and Harry together prove what the hat is 'really' doing. Namely, whatever the hell it feels like. It's a sentient magical artifact made by four willful and opiniated geniuses smashing their minds together. And it hates the system it exists to perpetuate, and thinks the houses as a whole are a mistake that is dividing the magical community outside the walls of the school. So why the hell would it be making any other kinds of decisions, save arbitrary ones? I'd imagine it wouldn't sort anybody at all, if it had any real choice in the matter./*

** To be honest I don't see the point of sorting 11 year old children. You can't possibly define a child's personality and traits at that age. Who you are is based on your life experience so you can't expect an 11 year old to stay the way they are their whole life. Im sure if they re-sorted the students at the end of their Hogwarts years a lot of them would end up in different house.

So I don't really understand what the sorting hat relies on to sort them, plus it always kind of ends up separating them in even numbers ? It also sometimes takes choices into consideration, and somehow manages to not put muggleborns in Slytherin. And let's not even discuss how people can be brave AND ambitious AND seek knowledge AND be hard working at the same time.

Im trying to keep my comment brief to not seem biased against the whole "let's sort students and separate them but then seem disappointed when they end up making pointless rivalries and being prejudiced against each other" , but to me there just isn't some logic way the sorting hat works, well I guess magic isn't that logical when you come to think of it so let's just say it uses magic and leave it at that ðŸ˜‚.

*** Thanks for the feedback. I agree wholeheartedly that sorting 11 year old children is a futile. I'm working on a fic where the sorting is delayed until 3rd year. I have mostly figured out how I think the now 13 year old students should be sorted, but I needed a sanity check on my logic.
