Greetings everyone! I'm a filmmaker/HP fan in the States and I had this idea come to me about making a web series focusing on the lives of modern day Ilvermorny students. Each episode would focus on a day with a mixed bag of witches and wizards that make an unlikely, yet tight-nit group of friends. Picture something like Dead Poets Society or even Freaks and Geeks, but set in the Wizarding World. A lot of the fan content I see out there is more retelling of stories or just fantasy fights. There is nothing inherently wrong with this stuff, but we would be trying to create more original, story driven content with this idea. Anyhow, I just wanted to put this out there and get some feelers on potential reception, see how other fans felt about having this kind of content out there, and get some general thoughts.


** Why not? It'd all depend on the writing, the acting and the set design, of course. But I see nothing wrong with the idea.

*** Hahaha yeah quality is very important. I just wasn't sure how fans feel about seeing a more American take/story on a predominantly UK ip. Even Fantastic Beasts is moving back to Europe for the rest of the series.

** It sounds like a good idea. The question is, though, whether it would actually be set in Ilvermorny all the time or if there will be sequences played out outside the school's walls.

One thing I find frustrating in the main HP series is just how mundane the summer sequences were outside of that one dementor attack. England has a very rich history and folklore surrounding strange happenings, mythical creatures etc that would have made for interesting encounters over the summer but were never touched upon.

Having magical encounters for the students during their summer break in the form of creatures, curses or ghosts loose in the muggle world would definitely make for some very interesting material. The need to act to keep friends and family safe from harm with the restriction of having to keep magic on the very down-low would make for dynamic, dramatic and creative situations as the kids dive into the books to find out how to curtail threats without needlessly jeopardising the statute of secrecy.

Think Supernatural without the divinity stuff and more 'fun' times for the people involved.

*** I really like those ideas and definitely think it would be something to incorporate. The stakes would be even higher for Ilvermorny students too since they legally can't take wands home with them until their 6th or 7th years. Thanks for the feedback.

**** Yeah, but alchemy, potions, ritual magics, enchanted doo-dads and other disciplines/tools could be available, which would make solving potential situations possible when using them.

I do kind of like the image of having the average muggleborn learning more about Defence Against the Dark Arts and Care of Magical Creatures by constantly being forced to MacGyver him/herself out of trouble than in the classroom-and then being so bored with actual classwork the muggleborn spend their time basically tinkering at new & interesting magical tools while their more magically embedded classmates struggle with figuring out why, exactly, they need to know about how to counter threat x without a wand when they either have one or are surrounded by people who have them...

***** Oh for sure! There is room for a lot of devising to be done. And I really like the idea of having no-maj in the mix of friends since Ilvermorny is way less elitist than most of the other schools. I mean it was even co-founded by one so the idea of one possibly being there is very much possible.

****** I also imagine that the purebloods would have a very different outlook on life compared to their European counterparts.

For one thing, they will have come into contact with magics from the former Incan and Mayan Empires, African shamanism, native American shamanism as well as localised variances of standard magical disciplines from Germany (Hessian War Magic anybody?), Poland, Austria-Hungary, Ireland, England (well yeah), contemporary South America, Italy, Russia, China (gold rush-era migration wave no less!), Vietnam, Korea and Canada (who would have harbored French survival magics from the 17-18th century, Inuit variations of native american magical traditions and, of course, a variety of localised British Magical Disciplines that may have persisted outside of Hogwarts).

And that's if the magical migration patterns broadly reflect no-maj ones. While there is no guarantee for that, American history's basically one giant sand-pit when it comes to migration that you could justify close to any kind of strange magical spell, potion, ritual using it.

Always having a good answer to 'why would someone even try to do that?' is possible when /that/ is quirky magics and /why/ is quirky history.

The same goes for purebloods. They would be far less, um, eccentric than their British counterparts seem to be, given that they occupy a continent that has experienced practically every magic known to man in a span of about 300 years.

They would also have to know how to navigate the thoroughly confusing no-maj world without magic too since their government is a mix of good ole USA politics and the StaatsSicherheitsDienst-and seemingly handles Statute of Secrecy problems by executing those that fall afoul of it (like, seriously, that was where Fantastic Beasts basically went full grimdark without any warning whatsoever-which was great, but holy hell people).

Best way to avoid that mess? No-maj world=no wand. Problem? Considering how hard it is to just live in there, can you imagine how insanely confusing it must be to a newcomer? The average magical would have to seriously work at understanding even the bare basics of it if they want a chance at immersing themselves into that world without, say, ending up in an insane asylum somewhere.

So purebloods have more motivation to actually study and understand the no-maj side than their British cousins since, hey, acting like a British Pureblood would most likely see them killed by their own government and thus avoiding that mess would be a priority for them.

That's another avenue that you can take.

** I think its a really good idea I love all the other magical schools in the HP world. You should check out pottermore.com (if you haven't joined already) jk rowling has writings about the history of north America and it's magical congress plus info about other wizarding schools.

***** Oh no, Pukwudgies are the heart of the wizard! I really think it's hard to compare the different houses because Ilvermorny focuses more on pursuits and what drives students versus Hogwarts which has a focus on more inherent character traits. Each of the houses in America feel like they are on a more even playing field.
