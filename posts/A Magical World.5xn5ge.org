Most stories only stay within Britain, with vague mentions of France (because Beauxbatons/Veela), random comments about Drumstrang(Dark Arts/Grindelwald/Krum fanboying) and random mentions of Egypt(Bill/vague Horcrux stuff...because mummies maybe), Romania(Charlie) and India(Patils/Parseltongue....the one that annoys me the most). Sometimes China(Cho/ Su Li)

Any stories that have more? Many countries and cultures with different magics and practices, differi forms of Government and such?

(Preferably No H/HG, and if possible then Hermione as a minor character)


** linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) has the most extensive worldbuilding I've ever seen in a fanfiction.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** In my story "Patron", the characters spend time in France, Bulgaria, the Balkans, the Magical Ottoman Empire, Jamaica and Scandinavia. I tried to make every culture different as well. For example, werewolves are valued very highly in Magical Scandinavia, but treated as dark creatures everywhere else in Magical Europe.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
