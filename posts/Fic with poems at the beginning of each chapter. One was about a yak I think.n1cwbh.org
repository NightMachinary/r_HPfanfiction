:END:
Basically what the title says. It was a fic where each chapter began with a different poem. One of them was about how the narrators greatest wish in life was to see a yak. Please help!


** Well, if it helps the search any, the yak poem was probably the one by Hilaire Belloc. I didn't find any such on FFN or AO3, but my searches are often unsatisfied so don't let that discourage you from trying again.
