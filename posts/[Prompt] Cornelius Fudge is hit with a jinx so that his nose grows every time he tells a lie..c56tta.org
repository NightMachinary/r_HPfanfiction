** Cornelius swaggered through the lobby, chest puffed up and chin jutted out. He had to take care not to slam his nose into the golden statue or ceiling, which ruined the effect somewhat.

"Cornelius, dear, yoo-hooooooo," came the simpering voice of his /under/-secretary.

He turned on his heel, trying to look imperious, and noticed the lobby had dropped to their knees in fear. /As they should/, he thought silently. With his turn completed, he took a moment to growl.

His nose was a few inches longer.

Thinking nothing of it, he fixed his attention on Dolores.

She looked at him weirdly for a moment, before she flicked her wand, and with a /Finite Incantatem/, fixed his nose.

"Why ever did you not fix that when you first woke up?" She tittered.

He took a moment to wiggle his nose, before he remembered he couldn't actually do that, and said, "Honestly, Delores, it hadn't occurred to me."

And with his yearly truth quota fulfilled once again, he turned back and moved back through the lobby, ignoring the quiet laughter of his pathetic Ministry peasants.
