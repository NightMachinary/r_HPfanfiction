Basically, every single person in Magical Britain is sent back in time to September of 1991, but they think that they are the only one. Presumably, the interactions between characters would be them trying to act as their younger selves, but they are all miserably failing.


** Not every person, but a lot:

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

  A bushy-haired girl had walked into the compartment with a smile, although suddenly she stopped and looked worried.\\
  "Oh dear," she mumbled almost too soft to hear. "Have I gotten the time wrong?"

This fic in a nutshell, the first couple of chapters is all the time travellers trying and failing to act normal.

** There's a (crack) fic where pretty much every student has come back in time---except Harry. Of course, they're all coming back from /different/ futures...

It's not Harry Potter or time travel, but it has a premise along the lines of 'everyone thought they were the only one'. You might like it.

** Twist: Told entirely from the perspective of Riddle and Dumbledore, who dont know what happened but that a seemingly random (ie those who lived) set of people are behaving strangly.

.... and then Dumbledore forms a hidden group to investigate, of those uneffected. Suddenly Tonks, Lupin, and Black are recruited to investigate.
