****** So this all following your own alt universe with "competent" Dumbledore?

Counterpoint 1. "Wait, Dumbledore! The Ministry is trying to discredit you, claiming not only that you tried to cancel the tournament and undo the months of work done by both national and international committees, but also that by doing so, you have created a large set back for international cooperation, simply because you decided that one student /might/ be the target of an assassination attempt. They say this goes against everything you've advocated for in the past, and that this is a sign that you've gotten senile and paranoid. Don't you think that claiming That Voldemort is back is going to be a hard pill to swallow? We've

Also, Harry's visions, Dumbledore, sir? We only found out that Harry was actually looking through the eyes of Voldemort's snake last night. How are we supposed to get Mad-Eye approved to be on school grounds? That Umbridge woman has been restricting just about every move we can make, and bringing in Mad-Eye would not only put him in a difficult position with the Ministry, but after the incident with Crouch Jr last year, Mad-Eye could easily have a Target on his back from the same sources that are trying to discredit you. By doing so, this not only potentially puts a spotlight on Mad-Eye, but also risks Tonks and Kingsley, two of Mad-Eye's best Auror contacts in the Ministry. And you want to do this all because you failed to address the real problem, which is Snape's hatred of James Potter and his grief for Lily. The easier solution would be to hire a fucking therapist for the man, but no, let's risk our entire spy network simply because you don't think Snape will follow through, even though you have stated numerous times that you trust him completely.

Counterpoint 2 "Nice TFS reference, Dumbledore, but what's your proof that Draco did this? Even if we know for certain through Snape, we need evidence to both convincingly detain Draco, while also finding a way to do so without compromising his mission, as well as Snape's role in the mission, all the while finding a discrete method of evacuating Narcissa Malfoy, a woman who is in constant contact while Death Eaters and Death Eater supporters, as well as getting some way to discretely get Lucius Malfoy out of prison, either through the Ministry, which will likely fail, since you've repeatedly denied them access to using Harry as a poster boy to the Ministry and are suddenly asking them to do this blindly for you, not to mention the threat of Death Eater spies in the Ministry, or you could try breaking him out of Azkaban, which would comes with a whole list of risks of its own. Exactly how do you intend to accomplish any of this without alerting Voldemort to Draco's failure, or Snape's Betrayal and still ensuring the safety of the Malfoys?

Counterpoint 3: How are you even alive at this point, Dumbledore? That curse should have killed you last year, according to Snape, who incidentally died because he failed to fulfill his Unbreakable Vow, and the Draco and his family were compromised and killed. We've lost so many people from simply not knowing when they would come, that I'm beginning to think that Snape was far more valuable than the price you put on stopping Draco Malfoy from killing you, a marked man.

And what do you mean about foreign government help? Our relationships with the international community are extremely strained right now, not only because of the instability of the Ministry over the past couple of years, but also because of the Tournament fiasco from years ago. You know, the Triwizard Tournament that you tried to close down because you were trying to protect the life of one boy from a threat that had zero proof to back it up at the time?

Also, in this continuity, it's been established that Voldemort took someone else's blood, so wouldn't this just end up killing Harry, since Lily's protection from Voldemort was not tethered to the mortal world anymore?

And to be honest, after everything that's happened, no, no you should not have told everyone relevant. For one, Voldemort is an expert Legilimens, and we're pretty sure he got the information from us, since he started sending assassin's after Harry instead of kidnappers. Also, Harry knowing about the plan would also weaken Lily's blood protection magic, since Harry would know he wasn't in any real danger of dying. As such, since magic can be incredibly fickle, the paradoxical nature of the situation means that since Harry would know that his mother's protection would save him, means that he wouldn't be in mortal danger, which means the protection might fail to protect him from imminent death. But in any case, that's highly advanced theoretical magic, and the fact remains that you're essentially a blackened husk right now, and a shell of your former self because of that curse. Face it, Dumbledore, you're not as capable as you use to be. You should have retired years ago, and now you've doomed us all.

Did you mean to type more here? The Voldemort thing wouldn't have happened in secret if Dumbledore had stopped the Tournament, which was the point. Obviously the Ministry would still doubt him, because Dumbledore's actions in canon were reasonable but ineffective (assuming the commonsense things he could reasonable be expected to do offscreen were in fact done offscreen).

Uh, he wouldn't be giving Malfoy to a court of law. Malfoy /doesn't/ want to kill anyone, he feels trapped. Dumbledore would offer him and his family asylum. And both breaking Lucius out and getting the Ministry to help would be far from difficult. There weren't any Dementors there at this point.

The instability would be an excellent reason for them to act, considering they're next on the chopping block if Voldemort offs Harry. Also, stopping a Tournament to save a life would just reaffirm that Dumbledore is, indeed, one of the good guys.

Pick one. But when I was typing, I was kind of assuming each year was its own thing, with Dumbledore reacting to the plot of the books, not an overarching competent Dumbledore narrative. His reaction would be to a Harry-blooded Voldemort.

** Let's say in first year Voldemort couldn't get through Mirror of Erised. He was already looking for a way to get past it and this is Voldemort we are talking about, he probably would have find a way. But let's say he didn't. And let's say he didn't go on a rampage or went to the chamber of secrets and told the basilisk to go destroy shit in his rage. Second year, not only is Ginny dead, we have a fully returned 16 year old Voldemort with a fucking basilisk running around.

If using a snake doesn't work (which would, given canon facts) they just need to use force. Blow up the whole thing or transfigure it away. Slytherin wasn't God, and the wizards of old didn't have super magics.

But I do think this is an interesting request. What would happen to their motivations if they got punished for the rules they broke while being praised for their achievements? What punishment would even befit, say, going to the chamber or the forest and such.

I do think the other people on here have a point that their rule breaking saves the world but it's also interesting to think about how exactly it would go if they were having to take responsibility for the rules they broke.

I mean, who knows? Having a Harry who broke rules year after year knowing that there would be consequences to face might even be a great asset to the character.
