I actually was able to find a post archived in the past, but did not really suit my taste I suppose? I'm a pretty big Hermoine and Harry fan and was so sad that Rowling changed her pairing of Harry and Hermione to Hermione and Ron.

Are there any well-written fan fictions out there that involve Hermione and Harry? I actually prefer (according to ffn M+) as well. Not smutty though. Vox Corporis was the perfect blend I hoped for.


** I would ask on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPharmony/]].

I've written a few Harry/Hermione stories myself, but I don't know if they're to your taste.

**** That's not what she said, but it is closer to truth than what OP mentioned.

Rowling felt that Ron/Hermione wasn't a good pairing and that Hermione would work better.

#+begin_quote
  JKR: [...] What I will say is that I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with *me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione with Ron*.

  Watson: Ah.

  JKR: I know, I'm sorry. I can hear the rage and fury it might cause some fans, but if I'm absolutely honest, distance has given me perspective on that. It was a choice I made for very personal reasons, not for reasons of credibility. Am I breaking people's hearts by saying this? I hope not.

  Watson: I don't know. I think there are fans out there who know that too, and who wonder whether Ron would have really been able to make her happy.

  JKR: Yes exactly.

  Watson: And vice versa.

  JKR: It was a young relationship. I think the attraction itself is plausible but the combative side of it... I'm not sure you could have gotten over that in an adult relationship, there was too much fundamental incompatibility. I can't believe we are saying all of this - this is Potter heresy! [...] *In some ways Hermione and Harry are a better fit*, and I'll tell you something very strange. When I wrote Hallows, I felt this quite strongly when I had Hermione and Harry together in the tent! I hadn't told [Steve] Kloves that and when he wrote the script he felt exactly the same thing at exactly the same point.
#+end_quote

But that doesn't mean anything about Harry/Ginny because:

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Ginny were always meant to be together. I thought it was obvious, but apparently there were internet wars about this.
#+end_quote

 

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Ginny are real soul mates. They're both very strong and very passionate. That's their connection, and they're remarkable together.
#+end_quote

 

#+begin_quote
  Ginny and Harry really are soulmates. I think she's like Harry. He's got an intellectual curiosity and she's got something of belief.
#+end_quote

 

#+begin_quote
  The plan was, which I really hope I fulfilled, is that the reader, like Harry, would gradually discover Ginny as pretty much the ideal girl for Harry.

  JKR: I consciously set out to choose a - a fairly unusual name for Hermione, because I didn't want a lot of fairly hard-working little girls to be teased if ever the book was published, because she is a very recognisable type - to which I belonged, when I was young ..

  Lydon: I was about to say 'are you Hermione?'

  JKR: Yeah - w-well - n-n-not ... I mean none of the characters in the books are directly taken from life. Real people did inspire a few of them, but of course once they are on the page they become something completely different. But, yeah, Hermione is a caricature of what I was when I was 11 - a real exaggeration, I wasn't that clever - Hermione is a border-line genius at points - and I hope I wasn't that annoying, because I would have deserved strangling; sometimes she is an incredible know-it-all.

I wouldn't put that much stock into what Rowling says now, after the fact, compared to what she actually meant when writing the books.

Besides, how in the world was it obvious? There was literally nothing to suggest Harry was interested in Ginny romantically until book 6.

*************** Linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise)

The first few chapters might be a bit rough in terms of the balance between humor and the serious stuff, and that's because I originally intended for humor to be one of the two genres. I was going to start another story, one that's more serious, but then I realized I didn't want to have two stories going at once, so I kinda merged them. Whoops. I've gone back and edited the stuff people think is almost borderline crack though.

As to how much of an AU it is... To be honest, I don't know how I'd rate it.

Iris is more best friends with Hermione than Ron, leading to her studying more magic than canon Harry did, which will lead to her become more powerful than Harry. She won't become as strong as Voldemort or anything. In a fair duel, she'll always get her ass whooped by Voldemort.

Ron definitely isn't bashed, but he's not as big of a character as in canon, but he's still Iris's second best friend.

There are five tasks instead of three.

I've created my own spells, but canon spells still exist of course.

I've completely removed magical vows, as I think they're stupid and far too convenient.

How much would of an AU would a fic be with stuff like that? I've seen fics that are canon rehashing and fics that change up so much that it might as well not be the Harry Potter universe anymore, so I'm not sure how to rate mine. The horcruxes, deathly hallows, prophecy, and that kinda stuff is all still there.

There's more warnings and expectations in the introduction on Chapter 1 too.

Iris isn't like canon Harry though. She's much more vocal and not as passive as Harry is. I try to give explanations for why Iris is different. For example, she curses more than Harry, and can be quite vulgar. This is because Vernon was much, much more vulgar than in canon. I'm just giving you a heads up so you know what to expect. She's also a lesbian. I know you don't like slash, but I dunno how you feel about femslash. An actual lesbian relationship really isn't at all an important part of the story though.

******************* I'm leaning heavily towards Fleur right now, but it's not set in stone. The romance is so light that I could honestly change the pairing even after her fourth and fifth year. Fleur and Iris won't even get together until Iris's sixth or seventh year, if my outline goes as planned.

And for the most part, the tasks are different. The first task still features a dragon, but the dragon is more like the climax of the task. The task is more about getting past magical creatures than it is a single dragon.

There's still the lake, but it'll be modified just as much too. They'll be a mist/fog above the lake that'll show what each of the champions are doing, so the audience isn't bored.

I'm throwing the maze out completely and adding three completely original tasks.
