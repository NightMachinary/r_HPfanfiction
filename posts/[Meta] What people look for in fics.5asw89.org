Okay, I admit while I've written a rather sizable amout of words in a series that is accurately called a Harry Potter fanfic I've never spent any time as a consumer of fan fics. I guess for that reason I have been quite surprised that it seems like what people have been looking for, judging by requests on this subreddit which may not be representational of course, is stories starring main characters of the series (and particularly Harry) often in alternate 'history' variations.

I find that curious because my own inclinations as a writer are to look to expand the setting with stories about others, not to try to write Rowling's main characters or to rewrite them in the case of alternate history pieces. It's not wrong to like such things, of course, but I'm not sure I see the attraction, particularly for requesting such a piece. I have to assume when a request is made for an alternative history piece that the requester has a sense of how it should go. It seems unlikely any writer who decides to honor the request will end up writing it as you see it in your mind's eye. It would seem then that writing such a piece yourself would be the best way to scratch such an itch.

Not everybody has the skill to write, sure. They may feel that their own writing won't do the project justice, but isn't it pretty much guaranteed someone else won't do justice to your particular view?

Just some musings.


** It's impossible for somebody else's fic to match up exactly to their readers' headcanon. That's not why people make LF posts. Asking for stories with a particular story element just means that if you enjoy that story element, then those particular stories have a much higher likelihood of being a story you will also enjoy. It's still a crapshoot, but you've stacked the odds.

Also, people like AU versions because, in my opinion, they are familiar ground and are already invested in the character. AU versions allow them to explore different facets of a character that may not have been covered in canon. I also think it helps people spot bad authors easier, as there is a baseline to compare the AU character against. I know that I have found a good author if the character they write is progressively AU rather than abruptly OOC.

Also, writing completely new characters and locations is hard. Sue us.

Edit: I had a total lightbulb moment about the term "crapshoot" coming from the game Craps (who thought of that name?) cuz you're shooting Craps and holy +crap+ shit.

** The reason why I read Harry-centric fics is that the original series has set him up as my avatar within the Harry Potter world. He's the character I identify with because he was the protagonist of the main series. Reading a fic about another character just feels pointless. They aren't /my character/. Offering me a fic about someone other than Harry is like offering to replace my dog with someone else's pet.

Also I think you have misunderstood the "looking for" requests posted on the sub. People aren't asking for others to write fics for them, they are asking for fic recommendations.

*** That's interesting. I look at it as a setting not one person's story, and honestly I never found Harry all that interesting or relatable. The last thing I want to do is be stuck with that one guy longer when there's a whole big world of other people out there. Just my view of course.

Fair enough on the point of the LF posts, but ultimately whether asking someone to write it now or looking for those lready written works out the same (unless the issue is they are trying to find a story they already read and liked).

**** I guess it's because we're already so emotionally invested in Harry. Sure you can write a fic about Draco or Percy, and I would probably still read it if it's done well, but since the events of Voldemort and other main events seem to be so centered around Harry, those are the fics that I would look for first.

**** Exactly. He's not interesting - or rather, he has some interesting parts but the rest is boring. So I want to read stories where Harry is /really/ compelling (and what makes him that way). The relatable part never bothered me - I suspect that's why Rowling wrote the Dursleys that way, to provide some instant sympathy for the character.

I'm not really interested in stories that are exclusively about other characters, except perhaps Lord Voldemort. But, apart from a few scattered oneshots, his characterization is murdered (and then the corpse is mutilated) in nearly every single story.

In a way Harry and Voldemort deserved each other, JK shit on both of them.

***** That's interesting. So you're emotional invested in the character even if you don't find his canon portrayal all that compelling?

I need to think about that a bit.

** Yeah, people aren't looking for stuff based on what exactly they're imagining in their head, as a rule. Otherwise, they'd write fics or make requests rather than actually looking for fanfics and reading them or making vague LF posts.

I think the wonder of fanfiction specifically is that you can read different interpretations and explorations of the same world - you can see precisely how people can make cool new ideas and thoughts based off of the characters, the world, and so on that we've all read.

** I'm interested in HP fics because there is big untapped within the Potterverse.

That's why I want fics that build on interesting canon elements. They may be AU with some serious changes to setting - one doesn't exclude another, because twisting around what we know from canon is a good start.

Instinctively, you would think that keeping with canon elements would make for repetitive works. But it turns out that it's not the case. As it stands now, most of fics wallow in the same bad cliches that go from one fic to another. The repetitiveness lies in fanon part, not the canon one. This creeps even into canon story rehashes (which I generally despise), with the canon plot being surrounded by fanon ideas.

There are so many interesting titbits on the Pottermore, in the HP Wonderbook entries, or even in those game adaptations. But they're mostly left unused.

That's why I like Matou Shinji series more than some other, more polished fics. Because all those pieces of information suddenly become plot points. Book of Spell and Book of Potions are crucial to the story, the illegality of private use of extension charm is used by Lucius against Weslays, history behind seeker position makes Shinji despise Quidditch.

It matters not to me if the cast is original, or is it another story about Harry's school years. Because my attachment to the characters (or some skewed vision of them) isn't what makes me interested in fanfiction.

**** Keeping the basic plot intact, with very small changes.

So for example wit the first year fics it will be: Dumbledore warns against going into third floor corridor -> Harry and friends stumble into it anyway -> troll attacks someone -> Harry finds mirror -> Harry and friends suspect Snape -> They get some info, but have a problem finding more -> They find it -> They suspect that attack is happening, but Dumbledore isn't in the castle and nobody believes them -> Puzzles and Quirrelmort confrontation

Bonus point if you put Harry into a different house, but still have him join Quidditch team.

** Right now. What i'm looking for is a harry potter that builds his own magical society/town/city/village that hold to witch/wizard/wiccan/magi beliefs and religions, but also keeps up with current civilization. Like a Stewing pot of magical and no-maj cultures and races.

** Harry Potter is full of side characters, and most of them are essentially OCs when it comes to fanfiction because canon doesn't really give them more than a couple character traits, if that. I read fanfiction because I enjoy imagining the characters I care about in different scenarios. Megan Jones did not feature enough in the story for me to care one way or another what she got up to before, during, or after her Hogwarts years.

Take Oliver Wood. What, aside from an intense love of quidditch, do we know about him? Who are his friends, what classes did he enjoy? What are his parents like, what are his core values? We don't know. You can pretty much just say any fanfic featuring him is just an OC with the name "Oliver Wood." And I'm not the least bit interested in fanfiction starring an OC.

These characters were just put into the books as filler, so it didn't look like the handful of characters that actually impact the story were in this giant school all on their own. Sally-Anne Perks was apparently so unimportant that even JKR forgot about her, so why would I want to read someone's 200k word epic adventure about her?

Much as I love JKR's world building and writing, most of the characters are two-dimensional and not interesting enough for me to want to read an entire story about them. If an author wants to create an OC, I'd rather they write their own original fiction and do their own world building.

*** I'd take the opposite approach (as you may guess), by only focusing on Harry (or HRH) you essentially are settling for a giant school with nobody in it. Why have a world full of cardboard cut outs and one guy when you can have stories that flesh out all the others and now you have an actual /world/ and not just a stage built for the single heroes' monologue.

I'm not saying your way is badwrongfun. It's what you like and I hope you are able to find it. I just don't really get it, personally.

I keep coming back to lovecaft's work that blossomed into the cthulhu mythos. A large part of it's richness is we see the world through so many views. There's only a couple stories I can think of that have the same main character. And this gives it a much larger sense of place. Harry Potter is much more towards the star wars side where you have this tiny group of people who seem to be responsible for everything which is just so unrealistic. I can accept it in the HP books because they are about an adolescent and told from his view and adolescents are by their nature very self centered so of course he only sees the part of the world that revolves around him, but if that's actually all there is to the world...that diminishes the setting greatly. It's no longer a world of magic. It's a theme party thrown for some kid.

On the other hand when you have a fanfic starring Harry (or Ron or Hermione) you aren't getting the genuine Harry. You aren't getting JK Rowling's Harry. It's someone else's take on the character. So if the character isn't genuine I don't understand how it is more important to get Joe Bob's Harry instead of Joe Bob's Sally-Anne. In neither case are you getting the original but with the former that will be easier to spot. A good writer may disguise the forgery well, but you have to know that's still what it is.

** I know that I started writing the sort of story I couldn't find and still can't. Nobody (not on any forum I have ever found anyway) ever seems to look for (or write) the same things I want to see. I also know that out of my own stories, the one I (as objectively as possible) believe to be the best written and by far the best plotted gets a tiny fraction of the reads of my rather more simplistic work. I don't mind admitting it is very frustrating.
