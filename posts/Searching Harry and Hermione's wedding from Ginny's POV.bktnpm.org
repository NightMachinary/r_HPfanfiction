:END:
I read this fic a long time ago and don't remember all that much. I know that it follows Ginny having trouble letting go of her love for Harry on his wedding day (where he marries Hermione). It was definitely only one chapter and had a single word title. I remember it being pretty gut wrenching and would love to revisit it!
