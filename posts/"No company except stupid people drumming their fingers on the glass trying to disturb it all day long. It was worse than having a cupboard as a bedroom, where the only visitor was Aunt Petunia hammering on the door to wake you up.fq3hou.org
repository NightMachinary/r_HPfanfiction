  Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.

Harry actually compared himself to an animal and thought at least he was better off than the snake. That is messed up in so many ways.

For any one wondering this is taken from PS Chapter 2 The Vanishing Glass.

Are there any fics that actually explore this?


** You mean a fic from the perspective of the snake Harry freed, where it goes around doing little things in the background to help Harry & co. and advances the plot? I'd definitely read that! With Nagini as the BBEG

*** You could even write a "danger? What danger?" Fic where all of the canon events are derailed entirely by the snake in the background, leaving Harry to have a peaceful 7 years of schooling.

**** I'd love this. Asks about the rat that smells like a human, reveals Pettigrew, Sirius is released. Eats Quirrel, cause Harry tells it to find something to eat in the Forest. Tells Harry about the basilisk and where it came from on Halloween, who tells Dumbledore, who deals with it and the diary. No Pettigrew to help Voldemort, no Triwizard shenanigans.

Would be highly entertaining to see how you justify snake-bro getting its scales on a method of destroying Horcruxes, and then using that method.

***** Considering it tapped the label of his enclosure to answer Harry when it couldn't be bothered to answer verbally, it meant the snake can read English. As well as Portuguese, if saying 'amigo' meant anything. Capable of winking or using 'facial expressions' to some extent. It winked at Harry and acted as if what ever Harry is doing as perfectly normal even the 'vanishing of the glass'. Also, in chamber of secrets the basilisk and serpentsortia snake have limited language compared to "Brazil, here I come... Thanks, amigo". The only other snake that spoke at length and is smart is Nagini.

I'd say the snake could be as smart as fanon Hedwig. The snake can literally be that incredibly chill mentor that makes you feels stupid but you don't know is doing stuff at the background.

Or just eats Pettigrew. Downside, Sirius liberation is harder. Upside, Voldemort resurrection is harder.

And in the second book, he compares himself to a slave (Dobby).

This part is important too, I think. It wouldn't look out of place as the thoughts of a teenager, but for a ten year old? It shows a level of contempt for others that is highkey concerning.
