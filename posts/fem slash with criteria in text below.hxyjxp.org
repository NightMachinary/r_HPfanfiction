I enjoy reading f/f pairings / femslash fiction. Ones I read include Crazy Little Things, Yule Ball Panic, Black Madness, Silent Life of Cassandra Evans, Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool, and A Witch and an Amazon Walk Into a Bar.

My criteria are:

- Well written and decent length (no oneshots or fics under 5 chapters)

- no pairings involving Bellatrix or Mcgonagall or a Hermione x Fleur pairing

- femslash/ female pairing should be main pairing

I look forward to your suggestions
