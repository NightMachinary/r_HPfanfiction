#+TITLE: LF: Philosophical Harry Potter; same plot as the books, but with the fantasy elements changed to look at things from a real-life point of view; Hogwarts is non-magical, the various magical creatures are different cultural groups of humans, etc.

In [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6pzcvo/are_houseelves_and_blackus_slaves_comparable/][this thread]], [[/u/turbinicarpus][u/turbinicarpus]] voiced an idea of considering Winky and other house-elves like they were human, and how human servants would reaction to her situation.

And that got me thinking; has anyone written an overview of the books, concisely summarizing or synopsis-izing each chapter, that has no fantastical elements in it?

Like, Hogwarts is a boarding school specialised in engineering and arts, various human subcultures hide under the radar and form their own self-sufficient community (complete with independent government), 'goblins' are a racial/cultural community who value honour and commerce and such, 'centaurs' are just traditionalist forest dwellers, house-elves are replaced with born and bred servant humans, Voldemort was just a highly successful race/culture supremacist...

Has anyone done this? A sort-of synopsis of the Harry Potter books with all the fantasy removed, but keeping an eye on societal/cultural dynamics?


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] has done something similar and has done it extremely well. I honestly enjoy this story more than Canon.

Here, Riddle was a genius scientist bent on totalitarian aristocratic rule. His ideology and cool technologies attracted lots of British aristocrats who were dismayed with liberal democracy and the decline of the British Empire. Their aim was to take over the British internal security sector, before going after the whole government. Opposing them were enlightened aristocrats led by Dumbledore, Potters, and Wellesleys.
