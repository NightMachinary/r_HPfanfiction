When Walburga or any other Black died, where did they bury them seeing as their house is in muggle London? Would they be too humiliated by that as a pure-blood or is it alright to to say in my story that they were buried there? Also, where do witches and wizards get married? (Disregarding example of Bill's wedding in the Burrow as not all wizards have that much open space)


** The real question is this:

Do dark families cremate their dead to prevent future use as inferi or do they keep the bodies around just in case they need their own inferi army?

** It's an interesting question, isn't it? In California Dreamin', I decided that wizards are buried the same as everyone, taking Dumbledore as an example. San Francisco itself has an interesting relationship with the dead. There are only a couple of cemeteries within the city limits and most people are buried in the nearby town of Colma, where the dead outnumber the living. When SF started running out of land, they dug up the graves and relocated them ... or did they? A wizard's grave from the Gold Rush era comes into play.

I don't think there's any particular reason why they wouldn't be buried or cremated like Muggles. Aren't Lily and James buried in Godric's Hollow? Wizards, like Muggles, would have the same impulse to erect a monument to someone they loved.

As for marriage, I don't think they participate in English civil marriage which I've learned has specific rules such as it must be in a public place where literally anyone can come and witness. I also don't know for sure if they publish the banns, but I think there must be some sort of mechanism for announcing that couple so and so intends to marry. The books have shown that wizards love to get boozed up and party as much as anyone else, so I could see large outdoor weddings in an open space charmed to be hidden. They hid the whole Quidditch World Cup stadium, after all. Smaller weddings could happen at the Leaky Cauldron, Three Broomsticks or a private residence. Maybe Malfoy Manor falls on hard times post-war and they have to rent it out for events, much like the British aristocracy do with their country homes!

*** At the very least I'd expect there to be a place in the Ministry that can perform a bare-bones legal wedding (without all the partying).

**** There almost has to be. It seems like the MoM has a lot of analogues to British Civil Law, so there must be a marriage license process and all of that.

*** I thought the wizards wouldn't mind being buried in a normal cemetery too. But, don't they need a minister to officiate the weddings? They sure aren't registering with the Muggle Government so maybe the Ministry has a branch for this?

**** When you say "minister" are you meaning a government official or a religious officiant? I'm trying to remember who does the ceremony at Bill and Fleur's wedding. I don't think he was a specific ministry official. Again, this is one area where I wish JKR had been more detailed.

I assume that the Ministry of Magic has a Vital Statistics office that tracks things like marriages, divorces and deaths along with births that we already know they track. I've been thinking about this off an on since I want to do a wedding story with Harry and Ginny in my Potterverse.

***** I meant a "religious officiant" yes. In Bill and Fleur's wedding, it was the same guy who presided over Dumbledore's funeral.

****** Well, JKR has indicated that wizards don't really participate in a standardized western religion, so I don't think a traditional religious minister would be necessary.

** Wizards have as much space as their talent or funds allow. They can temporarily make muggles leave an area with a muggle repelling jinx and we know they can alter spacial dimensions. As to weddings, we hear Malfoy of all people saying 'god' at times in the books. I don't see why they couldn't use churches, its not like all muggles use them for weddings have to be devout.

*** Thanks, your answer sounds almost like mine. The only problem I'm having to think about is what they do for a minister to officiate the wedding and do they register with the Ministry of Magic?

** Anywhere they want to! :) At least that is my HEADCANON since they do everything else wherever they want without any regard to muggle territory or property rights...

** My head canon says wizards would not leave actual bodies behind, unless they were specifically treated to prevent being used as Inferi or in some other dark rituals.

As for the Blacks, Walburga's instruction to Kreacher would be to completely dispose/vanish her body. It would fit Blacks's paranoia and Blood Purists's ideal of magically getting rid of their bodies as opposed to rotting away by maggots like those filthy Muggles.

*** Vanishing her own body sounds like Walburga alright! But, surely they would want a monument to be erected like any normal person, so where would that be?

**** Could be very well in 12 Grimmauld Place.

Muggle Graveyards only required so much real estate because their needs to deposit actual bodies. Wizards did not have that limitation, and with extension charms, they could literally build their private mausoleums in places they had the greatest connection to.

If we are dealing with the magic world, then at least consider what Wizards would do, and not what Muggles would do!

** Well, first, Godric's Hollow exists, and the graveyard does not explicitly indicate it is only resident families who inhabit it. That being said, Magicals are generally pretty okay with being buried in muggle locations, with the exception of the rarer staunchly pureblood families. Most of these families own their own isolated lands, or seem to, and can thus bury there dead nearby.

I suppose cremation is also plausible, but certain influences of Christianity have made such a thing rather taboo, especially given the interconnected nature before the SoS was established in 1692.
