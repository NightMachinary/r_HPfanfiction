Hi looking for an old fanfic that I read I can't remember the name of but the plot is something like this, it is a Harry Ginny fic where Neville is the Boy who lived and james and lily are alive, at the beginning neville is dating ginny, harry and ginny can't stand each other but over time they eventually harry and ginny start dating and Neville in response to this curses harry with Sectumsempra, ginny searches to try find the counter curse and eventually finds neville who tells her and she discovers neville had planned to dose her with Amortentia

If anyone could help me find this story that would be great

Thanks


** I've read a lot of H&G but I don't really recognise this. Is the relationship between Neville & Ginny ok at the start or is it based on false pretences? I keep thinking of a fic where Ginny thinks Neville saved her from the Chamber but he didn't.
