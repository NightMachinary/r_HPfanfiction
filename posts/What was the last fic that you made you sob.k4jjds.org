There I was, having finished a reread of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]] (a fic, which by the way, I would recommend to everyone), and I figured I'd do a search on this sub to see what people recommended that was similar. This led me to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4308786][no place like home]] by dirgewithoutmusic. The comments all said it made them cry so I went in with hesitation expecting a non-canon type of horrid death but from the get go it was just so wholesome (which actually made me more tense as I kept expecting a super dark twist). No, it just kept getting more and more wholesome, and before I knew it my eyes were tearing up and I was so emotionally invested in the hypothetical. By the time we reach Year 7 tears have started streaming down my face, until finally, the fic was over and I just sobbed over my ipad in bed for a good five minutes until I got a hold of myself again.

I can't remember the last time a fic had such an effect on me. Maybe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11923164/1/I-Know-Not-and-I-Cannot-Know-Yet-I-Live-and-I-Love][I Know Not, and I Cannot Know]]? Which got me wondering, what was the last tearjerker that got you guys full on crying?


** Don't remember the name. But there was this fic about how Harry had unknowingly created Hermionee through magic when he Really wanted a friend, and then she died because Harry fell in love with her(she was no longer a friend see?) I'm fairly certain I was teary for the rest of the day.

As for the good kind of cry, I always go back to Linkao3(11631114) OaLC Part 3. Sana Visio, just, Sana Visio.

Never really sobbed while reading a fic but this definitely got me the closest. It's about Harry who gets cursed as a Maledictus (slowly turning into an animal) during the final battle. Heartbreaking friendship fic that is just beautiful.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** Wanting Narcissa by Amandah Leigh. Not nearly as well-known as it should be, probably because the main characters aren't a popular ship. (Narcissa and Snape). Just about the most well-rounded, well-written most fully realized characters I've ever read in Harry Potter fanfiction. You end up identifying with them so well and rooting for them, all the while knowing they're all inevitably headed over a cliff. It's a tragedy in slow motion and it made me /ache/ for a long while after I read it.
