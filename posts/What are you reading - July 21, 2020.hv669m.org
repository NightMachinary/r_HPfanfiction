** I'm currently reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3721921/chapters/8243602][Weasley Girl]] by Hyaroo, which is rated K+/GA on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] and AO3, respectively. It has a sequel, Weasley Girl: Secrets of The Past and is meant to be a trilogy, with Weasley Girl: War of the Prophecy yet to be posted, with those two having slightly higher ratings at T. There is also a small oneshot which fits into the timeline about Ron; or should I say, Ronnie?

That's right people, as you might have guessed, this is a gender-swap fic featuring Fem!Ron, actually Veronica, as she attends her years at Hogwarts. I saw it on tv tropes while looking up the actual HP series, and decided to give it a go. I've only read the first chapter, but it's more than enough for me to recommend it to you guys. The thing is, things do change because of Ron's gender, and I'm very interested to see how it'll play out.

Anyways, it starts at Platform 9 3/4, with Harry completely clueless as to how to get on the train, and the Weasley's helping him as before. However, things are different from the first time. Because she was worried Ginny would be lonely, Ronnie left Scabber's with her little sister, giving us a shift as to what will happen come Sirius' breakout. Another thing is that seeing how animals usually warmed up to Ron in the books, the author decided to have Ronnie be very gifted with them, taking away her chess skills to compensate. Perhaps the biggest change though, is that Ronnie isn't afraid of spiders, as Fred never had the heart to turn his dear little sister's teddy bear into one, even if she did break his toy broomstick. Therefore, her and Harry decide to check out Lee's tarantula, where after she annoys them, Fred lets it slip that he thinks she might be in Slytherin, as they have no idea how the first Weasley girl in generations will turn out. Upset, Ronnie storms back to the compartment with Harry following, and while she's crying Hermione and Neville come in asking for Trevor. Hermione attempts to comfort Ronnie (but is pretty useless at it) and they end up discussing the sorting "test" before Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle appear. Malfoy extends the same offer to Harry as before, but due to the turn of events, a fight breaks out which has Crabbe and Goyle restraining Ronnie and Hermione while he calls the latter "Mudblood" prematurely. Neville managed to slip away and find Percy, Fred and George, who were about to check on their little sister anyways, and they walk in on the scene. Extremely overprotective, the twins threaten them while Percy promises a talk with their future Head of House and to keep an eye on the three in the future. Ronnie then ends up comforting Hermione, while the three older brothers explain the concept of blood purity to Harry and her. Because of the shifted dynamic, Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville end up forming an early friendship that will most likely carry through the books.

I'm very intrigued, as it seems sort of like the Marauders (which won't do Harry any favors in winning Snape over, I'm sure) and the setups for future events seem to be falling right into place. Overall, ridiculously good, and I hope someone takes the time to read it as I'm doing right now!

*** Thank you for recommending this! I've put it on my reading list. I typically have not been drawn to things that are AU, genderswap, etc (only because I enjoy using canon as a baseline and my interests tend to be along the lines of fleshing out minor characters, exploring what happens post-books, etc) --- but I do absolutely love a good character exploration, as well as the recognition of how a person's gender affects their life experiences, and consequently their personality, dynamics with others... and ultimately, from there, how things play out in the lives of those connected to them. I've just read through the first chapter and the writing itself is excellent, too!

**** I definitely know what you mean, as I usually read fanfiction focused on anyone but the main three (lately it's been the Creevey's after reading "Cauterize") and I was a bit hesitant to try it out. However, from the tropes page alone I could tell it would probably be something I'd enjoy, and I have been trying to expand my material so I could give better recommendations on here, so I decided to give it a shot and have not been disappointed thus far! I hope that when you get a chance you'll read it, because it honestly is good!

Rebirth in a Magical World.

A 15 year old dies of cancer in our world and wake up in the HPU as a newborn baby in a pure blood family. He is born 2 years before Harry Potter. In our world he had read up to Order of the Phoenix

Aside from a very few pieces of Canon knowledge, he doesn't really pull strings to tweak the HPU in his favor which I am very surprised didn't happen. Most of the book revolves around his family, family magics, organized crime in business, and the start of his Hogwarts education. The story is currently in his 3rd year (Harry's first) and is a great Ravenclaw centered fic.

I'm hoping it stays focused on the main character even now that Harry has entered the story. The main character is interesting enough that Harry can be in the background.

** Just finished The Best Revenge. The basic plot is Severus gives Harry his letter instead of leaving it to owls and Hagrid. It was cute and held my interest. It's not an epic adventure or character analysis, but it is a fun read. There is a nice sequel as well. Overall I like the author's other works and they do a nice job of establishing characters.

** Sin & Vice

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11053807/12/]]

It's the first SS/HG (Severmione?) story I've ever tried. I know at one point that ship was the favored one of a family member who is also an avid hpff reader.

I'm on chapter 11 or so out of 60+ in total.

So far it has been a pretty good read. I think the author should have used a beta (or at least UK English spellcheck), but that hasn't been a big enough issue to deter me, even though that's normally my biggest pet peeve.

One of my biggest objections to SSHG has been the age gap. Their canonical ages don't come anywhere close to meeting the half your age + seven rule. In this story, because of repeated and lengthy time turner use by Hermione that rule is more than satisfied.

Plotwise it has been mostly stations of canon but explicitly for the purpose of not fucking up the timeline and the scenes have been background things that may not have been included in canon, so I'm ok with it. Conversely, other authors stick to canon like a kitten following a trail of treats. I think it's White Squirrel that's particularly bad about this?

Anyways, I digress. Based on what I've read so far, I give this story a 7/10 because I like how the author handles the interplay between Hermione and Snape. It's certainly good wnough to read while I'm procrastinating on work from home.

*** I don't recall White Squirrel being particularly obsessed with stations of canon, more than other authors. The Accidental Animagus (and especially the sequel) is certainly well off the rails by now, and The Arithmancer may have hewed fairly close but the sequel Lady Archimedes certainly didn't.

With the age gap resolved, I suppose Severus/Hermione becomes possible, but canonically he found her annoying even though he had no reason for a prior grudge. What happens in this story to change that?

*** Decided to give this one a bash (despite some of the criticism in the comments). Was not disappointed. Characters are quite well written and it's a very interesting start with a number of well placed hooks. Look forward to more updates.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8808381/1/Resistance][Resistance]], by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1371630/KaryInTheSky][KaryInTheSky]]. It's the sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5204912/1/Butterflies-and-Hurricanes][Butterflies and Hurricanes]]

It's a scorose, but it also has a lot of mystery, the story is not just about the romance. I just love how fleshed out characters feel in this story.

** Linkao3(Teleology) It's a pretty good Haphne fic. There's an abrupt personality change in the middle but it'll make sense later on.

  The bloody war has ended at Harry's sixth-year. Though hailed a hero, he's ready for one last year at Hogwarts. One year of a normal life before becoming an Auror. While there, a simple agreement manages to challenge his identity as a hero, while still providing the normalcy he craves. Haphne AU. Post-War 7th year.

** I've been reading Linkao3(A Place Apart) and it's a King Harry fic done well, which is quite the welcome surprise. It's been a lot of fun so far.

  Sick of the Dursleys and resolved to missing his few friends if it means getting away from the people of the Wizarding World and their nosy whispers, Harry gets the idea to leave it all behind for a while, just a bit, just for a rest. Like a camping trip, except he'll take enough provisions for a year or so...maybe some plants, seeds and things for a little garden. Maybe some time away from the things that weigh him down will help the constant highs and lows he's been feeling for a while now. Just a little break. (Or, the one where Harry says TTFN and takes himself off on an indefinite vacation and upsets a few very careful plans.)
