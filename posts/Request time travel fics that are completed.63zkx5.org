I've been reading so many time travel fics recently and I'm loving them, but, there are so many that aren't completed (or are abandoned) and I'm just after some recs for some good time travel fics that have been completed :)

** You might have already read it, since it's a bit of a classic, but if you don't mind Snarry, linkao3(The Boy Who Died A Lot) is one of my absolute favorite time travel fics.

  Harry's always been known as The Boy Who Lived. Only Severus knows that this is a lie. (Or: a portrait of Severus Snape, in seven acts.)

** Oh man if you want time travel, I have GOT time travel. Take a look at these - some are slash, some are het, but all are within the romance genre (although time travel lends itself to good plotting and adventure too imo) and all are ones I would recommend. I've read so many more than this but these are ones I liked. My very favorites are bolded.
