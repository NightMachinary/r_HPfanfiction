And of course, this is a major issue; an image of a Weeping Angel becomes a Weeping Angel.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

*** Holy effing shit this was brilliant. I never read crossover stories but this was terrifying and hillarious all at once. I chuckled and said "Oh no" out loud.

Chilling. Fecking loved it. Are there more good doctor who crossovers worth reading???

  Part 3 of The Arithmancer Series. Hermione won the war, but her career as the world's greatest arithmancer is just beginning. Now, she has places to go, spells to invent, and a family to start. Oh, and a whole lot of dementors to kill.
