It coukd be cool if he trained harry later or somethibg. If there are aby, please do recomend.


** In the grand scheme of things, not much would change, IMO. Harry would probably tell Hermione and Ron, Hermione would read everything there was to read in the Hogwarts Library about prophecies, and she might insist that Harry Train Harder, advice that Harry would promptly ignore.

Dumbledore training Hogwarts-era Harry is a bit like a Professor of Mathematics at Oxford or MIT spending time teaching a teenager of somewhat above-average talent and motivation basic algebra: it's not a great use of their time, and there are other people who can teach that person better.

*Edit:* Replaced "the multiplication table" with "basic algebra", to make it more grade-level-appropriate.

** Not much, until book five, where Voldemort might just take the prophecy from Harry's head and if he couldn't then Harry wouldn't need to be kept in the dark so the whole Voldemort side of things would change a lot.

** Only one somewhat good in which I've seen it happen and consequences is linkffn(for the love of magic) and honestly wasn't that big of a plot-divergence, only made Harry a bit more reckless and speeded up things a bit.
