**** But the 12 available chapters are worth the rec, imo.

It is by far the best Durmstrang!Harry story out there and up there in the ranks of WBWL.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter just another orphan. Without the scar on his forehead Harry is free to choose his own path. His Slytherin sorting is only the first surprise to his parents' old friends. Darkish themes. Dark!Harry. Rating could go up to M later.

** linkffn(Fraterculus by bloodsox88; No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim by Eternal Payne)

I really like No Knowledge, though it hasn't been updated in a few years. It's a different take on a non-BWL Harry. Harry doesn't have a lot of money, is grossly underestimated and largely ignored. But still he has the typical Harry tenacity. I really enjoyed it.

  In a world where Neville Longbottom was marked as Voldemorts equal, Harry Potter is determined not to be his Inferior, and that leaves only one option... Not Slash.
