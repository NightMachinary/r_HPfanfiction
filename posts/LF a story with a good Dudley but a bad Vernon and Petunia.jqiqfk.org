I'd like to read a story where Vernon and Petunia are still assholes, but, for some reason or another (and beginning in their childhood, not after the events of the original book series), Dudley treats his stepbrother like family (which he is, ofc).

  An attempt to go against a popular trope. What if, instead of becoming dark/grey and gaining more power that way, Harry had been a little more considerate? Begins with a small change in first year, and sticks close to the original, but sometimes small changes can add up to change the world.

*** It's a significant subplot to be sure. And I loved Dudley getting to visit Hogwarts.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4172226/1/A-Hero][A Hero]] fits the bill very well, I think. It's a oneshot that won a few awards. At the start, Dudley realizes his parents are abusive to Harry and so he starts treating Harry more like a human. Vernon and Petunia.... don't take this well. It takes place during a summer between years, not sure exactly when.

Edited to add: Dudley and Harry reconciling despite Vernon and Petunia is a subplot in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][A Year Like None Other]]. It starts in Harry's 6th year.

** Darn, I came in here ready to recommend two stories, but as you want a start before the books (both of my recs start in first year), I suddenly have nothing.

**** Seasons of Change was already linked above. It's one of my favourites when it cones to slowly and steadily deviating from canon. The changes start small and it takes time for them to add up. It's pretty long and still ongoing

The other one is linkffn(History Lessons by Bloodpage-Alchemist), a story in which Dudley gets a really good teacher at Smeltings which sets him on a better path. It is a chaptered story, but a short one. It really only covers Dudley's journey towards becoming a nicer guy and him making up with Harry (and finding some other friends on the way). It does not go into if/how this may influence the boys' later years.

  Young Harry is flamboyantly gay and forms a connection with his cousin. The result? Dudley loses a punching bag but gains a sassy gay friend! Based on the Sassy Gay Friend videos made by Second City Network. Now with more drabbles!
