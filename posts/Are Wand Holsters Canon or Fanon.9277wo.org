They tend to show up as flick your wrist wand in hand, in fanfiction at least, and i THINK Scabior had one in the Movie (but they were never mentioned in the books) so was that just a cool addition to the movie, or is there some kind of obtuse Pottermore reference to them, or are they just fanon? Because if they were 100% canon, I can't see why Mad-Eye or any of the other Order members wouldn't use them. Malfoy not using one makes sense because he has his Pimp Cane, but why would only Scabior the Snatcher and meh minor villain use something like that if it exists?


** Yeah it always confused me when they talk about Harry just keeping his in a jeans pocket? Like what crazy long ass pockets do you have that a wand doesn't just fall out?

*** If Harry is wearing Dudley's way way too big jeans like in the beginning, then I could buy it. I've worn men's jeans that could swallow some pretty big things, and if they were even baggier, I'd believe it.

But properly fitted clothing? No.

Personally? I like the idea of long but narrow pockets in robes that hold the wands. I came across that idea in /The Fairy Godmother/ by Merdedes Lacky (it's a good book, see if your library has it), and when a character gets her wand, there's a pocket in her dress for it and I /love love love/ that idea!

**** In book 4, during the Quidditch World Cup, Barty Crouch Jr steals Harry's wand because it was sticking out of his back pocket.

Harry's wand is 11 inches.

Until now I have never really considered the logistics of wand sizes and storage.

Even if the pocket was big enough, with Harry being skinny and the pocket being on the rear, sitting down with even most of it inside would snap it.

So either Harry's an idiot, risking snapping his want and losing a buttock, or he's an idiot who's wand sticks out more than it sticks in.

And in both cases, Rowling probably did not think about wand storage.

***** I usually picture it in the front pocket, which gives you a bit more leeway in terms of sitting down without snapping it.

But yeah, at the World Cup, Harry was probably being an idiot for putting it in his back pocket.

***** /facepalm/ i can't believe I didn't catch that. I'm an idiot.

I meant things like a PSP in it's case with games, or something like a pencil case.

And yes, I've fit both of those (at separate times) in the pockets of men's jeans. Women's jeans suck, always shop in men's if you need storage space.

**** Robes might even have a pocket specifically for this purpose, but it went the weird pocket watch pocket in men's dress slacks, and phased out of use or culturally remembrance, so it's now just this odd fabric doubling in the sleeve that some people find use for but most ignore.

*** I always thought that was pretty dangerous for something you really don't want broken like your leg bumps the edge of a desk and snap there goes the wand or you squat down and snap there goes the wand. Idk always confused me. Edit: it's also like what 11inchs so it's gotta stick out the top of the pocket quite a bit and if anything that increases its chance of shaping doing something as simp as squatting down if you weren't careful.

** The closest is Lucius keeping his wand inside his cane in the movies. Otherwise it's just pockets, like in the PoA film where Harry reaches behind Hermione's back and takes her wand from her pocket.

Still kinda stupid though, people would be snapping their wands all the time. This is an instance where the fanfic solution actually makes sense.

*** I've seen one Fanfiction explain wands as being actually really strong, due to their magical nature, making it actually difficult to accidentally snap them. I think Ron's wand was explained by the whomping willow being actually a fairly powerful magical...thing, and hence was strong enough to break an already damaged wand.

But yeah, on the whole, I prefer holsters and special pockets. Makes more sense.

******* If i did something like that, I'd have everyone design their own style of storing their wand, and have them graded on it, in Fake-Moody's class or something. "That's not very accessible. Malfoy, T" "When my father hears about this!" "Your father at least had the sense to have his wand to hand all the time boy" looking at Granger's design "What is this, Granger?"

** After a brief search, I've found only one mention of the word "holster" on the whole of pottermore, and it's a behind-the-scenes about the last movies:

#+begin_quote
  And even though he still sports the cane, Lucius was given a wand holster that incorporates snake heads in its design for battle scenes. For /Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 1/ and /Part 2/, after Lucius returns from a stint in Azkaban, his costumes were distressed and his hair is dishevelled as he had been beaten down from his experience.

** I don't see how this is such a big deal. Wand holsters make perfect sense, as could any number of alternatives that work exactly in the same manner, the purpose being storing the wand and offering easy access. So it doesn't really matter whether they kept it in their pockets or in holsters or somehow else, so far as it wasn't that big of a problem and there was a solution, which clearly there was, or Rowling would have pointed out these "accidents" a lot more(as opposed to never). So use whatever you want in your fanfic if you're that worried about sticking to canon in cases like this, as long as it makes sense in conjunction with it. And if you're not worried about that, the more reason not to care.
