I wondered if there is any fic where H/Hr is portrayed negatively, as in they actually do get together but things become worse because of it. This might be an unpopular request but MarySue! Hermiones are somewhat tiring, so I kind of want to see some of these fics now.


** What exactly do you mean by "but things become worse"?

Do you mean on an interpersonal level?

Do you want the world to end due to it (Voldemort wins because Harry was distracted by Hermione's fine ass for example)?

Do you want Hermione to betray Harry? (Plenty of edgy Indy!Harry here)

Do you want to see them grow to resent each other?

Do you want to see their friendships with others fall apart?

Do you want to read about Harry sullying the "Noble Bloodline of Gryffindor" and how that was bad (There're plenty of pureblood +bullshit+ culture stories with that premise)?

*** The first, the fourth, and the fifth scenario. The second only reluctantly - it would have to be insanely good for me to entertain it. Definitely not the third or sixth.

**** You don't think the fourth and the second scenarios go hand-in-hand? I imagine that if Harry and Hermione grow to resent each other, their interpersonal dynamic will suffer.

**** For friendships falling apart, just look for any edgy Lord Potter story, usually Hermione has no other friends but Harry there (well, besides Luna). All others are traitors.

Or take any postwar Harry/Hermione. Usually them getting together messes up friendships with Ron and Ginny.

***** I've thought about this, but while edgy Lord Potter stories may indeed portray H/Hr as a negative, the author doesn't realize it. I am not ready to count this as satisfying the criteria.

**** I've thought a little bit more about the second scenario and as it's described, I'm not sure I would accept it. Harry and Hermione going all "the ends justify the means" and accidentally making everything worse by crusading too hard/going extremist, possibly I might accept that. The end of the world would have to be something that H/Hr happening directly contributes to, not passively by being dumb and letting LV win.

Still, whoever did the second scenario would have to be insanely good. That would be a high-risk prompt but with high regard if it actually worked.

I might try my hand at this myself, but (1) I don't think I, right now, have the skill to pull this off, and (2) I'd probably get lots of hate PMs from butthurt H/Hr shippers who believe Hermione has no flaws whatsoever, if I did do it well enough.

** There was a fic where Harry and Hermione got together after the war. They were cheating on their spouses.(Actually Harry was sleeping with quite a few women including Pansy Parkinson who became Percy's wife) But the thing was that Hermione really only cared about the forbidden romance part of their affair. I unfortunately don't remember the name.

*** Do you remember specific lines from this fic? I've sometimes re-found fics that I don't remember the titles of by searching key phrases. But also this sounds like it might have been written by Romantic Silence. I literally just remembered this fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7818290/1/He-s-Mine]], but I'm not sure it qualifies because I'm not sure the author thinks this portrayal is actually a negative one.
