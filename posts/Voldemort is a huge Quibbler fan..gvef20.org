** Xenophilius Lovegood was terrifed, he had known the death eaters had taken over the ministry but now he had been captured by them and was surely going to die.

he culped as he was dragged into a room and saw the figure at the head of the table it was voldemort.

Xeno felt the death eaters push him into a chair roughly before they departed "I hope the Journey here was not too unpleasant'' Voldemort began softly ''Would you like anything to drink, water ? tea perhaps ?'' voldemort asked softly. Xeno was terrifed 'water' he squeaked out.

Voldemort smiled and waves his wand counjuring a nice glass and then filling it with water. "I must admit this is quite nerve racking for me' Voldemort continued 'its not every day you get to meet someone you admire'.

Xeno stared dumbfounded was voldemort toying with him before he would be killed, but why " I am not toying with you xeno, and I would never kill you'' voldemort stated.

Xeno gasped voldemort was reading his mind, he had heard some wizards could do that but he never learned how too he could not even recall what the art of it was called.

''Its called legilimency, though its not quite mind reading anyway your here for a reason, I want you to work with me, as you know I have taken over the ministry with your help we shall find the truth about the rotfang conspiracy'

**** Xeno lovegood realises he is the only person voldemort admires

and suggests, maybe dont kill the muggleborns

and is shocked when voldemort admits he had never thought about that and that xeno is right

** This is especially hilarious in those AUs where The Quibbler is a serious newspaper disguised as a conspiracy rag. Either because it's in code (Rotfang = Death Eaters) or because it looks different if read through special glasses and held upside down.

Voldemort: I'm a huge fan of your work. Xenophilius: /don't think about the code, don't think about the code/
