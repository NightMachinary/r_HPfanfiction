  Charlus and Dorea Potter had two sons. What happened to the second? Is he fit to raise his nephew? Dumbledore sure didn't think so, but that won't stop him from going out and finding his family. James Moriarty/Richard Brook is Richard Potter.

  The story of how Harry Potter left the wizarding world, only to become the muggle version of a Dark Lord. The story of how he became a manipulative bastard. The story of how he became James Moriarty. Machiavellian!Harry DISCONTINUED

*** I've checked it out, and the first chapter was very promising. The rest, however, is a canon rehash down to even Ron and Harry saying the same sentences as they do in book one... That always throws me off. I couldn't keep going after the fifth chapter or so.

*** Oh god, isn't this the fic that gender-bent poor Dr. Watson into a woman?

I think I vaguely remember that, I also remember suppressing the urge to vomit at such a parody of two beloved characters I grew up with :(

***** It wasn't, but it also didn't really change or add anything to the story. Dr. Watson even looked pretty much the same as canon.

***** Oh yes it was. It was fun reading as crack, and the actual book he made was decent, but all of the fanfics after book one were bad

**** Well I love both this story and it's sequel. I don't know why you consider it so horrible, but it's a really well told story, with one of my very favorite alternative methods to destroying Voldemort. And the only story that moves the timeline from the 1990's that I can actually stand.
