Harry was abused at the Dursleys. The abuse stunt his growth and his potential.

James Potter was one of the best looking lad of his era and Harry Potter is a runt when he could be so much more with the eyes of his.

Voldemort got to be beautiful, smart and powerful and chose to throw his looks and part of his sanity away to flee Death. Harry is supposed to be his equal but doesn't look like much, doesn't apply himself in class, suffer from his weak constitution and has no backbone. So I propose we remedy that.

Harry goes down in the Chamber of Secrets and find Salazar's library (which Tom never found because of the incident with Myrtle's death forced him to stay away from the Chamber). Harry uses the books to devise rituals to undo the damages his childhood left --- both physically and magically.

It may not be light magic but Harry decides to be selfish for once.

The defeat of Voldemort cost Harry a lot (his parents, his childhood...) and Harry refuses to pay any longer. He wasn't supposed to go to the Dursleys, he wasn't supposed to be weakened physically, nor magically (sustaining the wards around Privet Drive).

Every year at Hogwarts he put his life on the line to save others, risking and worsening his already fragile health. He decides to stop paying the price for the safety of others and decides that from there on, everyone must fend from themselves.

So here's what I want to read. And before you start going on about Mary Sue Harry, stop. You can be beautiful and intelligent. You can be beautiful and powerful. You can be beautiful, powerful and intelligent. Harry had a hard life, he deserves compensation. Harry would not be perfect in this story, he would be selfish, insensitive, possibly arrogant, and would go to any length to achieve his means and goals.


** A bit of a tangent, but why assume he isn't already handsome? Both James and Lily were, from what I recall. He's just a bit too much on the skinny side, at least in his early years, but just /how/ skinny could he be? Those damned Dursleys couldnt have starved him to the point where his abuse was noticeable. And for his height, the kid just aint that tall, he wasnt some kind of midget.

​

But to answer your question about ritual fics, the only one I recall from the top of my head is For the love of magic. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic]] Be warned though, it starts quite well, but it gets taken over by unnecessary smut later on and the author seems to have a far-right mental breakdown. Still, it starts well, is on subject, and if you push through its alright for what it is.

*** I think canon Harry is tall. James is described as tall, and Harry is the same height as him in DH. He might not be "as tall" as Ron, who is described as lanky, but this doesn't make him short. Dan Radcliffe is short, however. Can't predict how child actors are going to develop.

OP: Not a ritual as such, but an old classic HP&OoTP by Ruskybyte on FF has Harry have a physical overhaul. Most indy Harry fics tend to have the same premise, potion courses etc.

**** I've always thought of Harry as being a late bloomer, at least in terms of his height, with him shooting up like a weed during the summer after his 5th year.

***** And that makes little sense given that he starts out short and malnutritioned and does not get what would be called a regular, healthy diet until after the war. Hogwarts had no salads or comparable food. The summers were defined by bad/unhealthy food or a lack of it. The Hunt had bad food supply as well.

If Harry actually had an undisrupted supply of good food for a year or two it would be believable, but as canon stands any progress he made was undone by either the Dursleys or Voldemort. Not to mention that his sleeping pattern in OotP didn't help, nor did the stress.

**** To answer both of you, I'm talking about fanfiction.

Canon is canon. Apparently J.K. Rowling decided that living in a dark and enclosed space, doing chores all day without fulfilling meals wouldn't affect Harry in the least...

In fanfiction Harry is often on the short side and his treatment at the hands of the Dursley is always exaggerated and goes from neglect to abuse. They use that to show that even if Harry and Tom are similar, Harry could go through hell and remain good. Often we have Remus or Sirius looking critically at Harry's weight and height and comparing it to James'. And Mrs Weasley is always going on about how Harry is too thin. Dumbledore himself told Harry that when he arrived at Hogwarts he wasn't as cared-for as he would have liked. “You arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well nourished as I would have liked”.

In fanfiction, Harry is almost always the shortest/skinniest in his year. He almost never take actions to remedy that. Often he has a magical boost or creature inheritance to fix some of the damages (I'm not fond of that).

In canon his height is never mentioned. His growth is always compared to Ron's. Ron shoots like a weed and Harry gains three inches.

I want him to actually care about his appearance and his health. I want him to find self-worth, to feel entitled to healing and cosmetic rituals.

Harry grew up neglected but was witty and sly (he broke out of his cupboard for food, and always had a retort for Petunia and Dudley). Then he gets himself sorted into Gryffindor and becomes complacent. He never looks into magical means to ensure his health and safety. He is content with being mediocre (I know I'm harsh).

The Dursleys' treatment set him up for mediocrity. It baffles me that he would settle for that and would not look for means of surpassing the effects they had on him. A sort of quiet revenge.

**** It gets props for using Sinistra's character though. I find it so odd that Snape gets to bang every student in Hogwarts in fanfics but Aurora and Vector, both having their age unknown, are literally never used as a serious romantic interest.

I think you mean Septima (who he has a child with), in which case I agree. If you really mean Sinistra, I think I missed something.

I also find it odd that Snape gets to bang everyone, or anyone for that mattter. Alan Rickman may be a sexy, sexy man but I am completely unable so sexualize Snape as a character.

Severus Snape is an overgrown goth with serious skin&hair problems who hates himself, his job, his boss, his former boss and his students. Also he managed to estrange himself from the only positive influence in his life, followed up by pointing a psychotic murderer in her general direction and hoping his goodwill will spare her life.

Nobody should want to fuck Snape. Snape shouldn't want to fuck anybody. He should just stay in his little misery-corner whilst Albus holds his hand.

****** Yeah, may have mixed their names, sorry. And I agree about Snape too. Though, I meant it more that I find it weird that there is such a wide teacher-student romance fics starring Snape while I never, /ever/ saw one involving a female teacher unless it was side-smut.

*** Hm, why not I wouldn't label it. I don't want Harry to conquer the Wizarding world. I don't want him to hurt people just because he wants to. I'm not asking for an evil Harry. I want him to be selfish and reclaim the life he was denied. All the other students are free to lead the life they want. They could fight against the threats befalling Hogwarts but they are content to sit back and let adults do their jobs (which they don't). I just want Harry to stop risking his neck for everyone. Let him sit back, enjoy life, Quidditch, pranks, his studies, boys and girls. Harry won't ever be normal but that doesn't mean he has to be extraordinary all the time. He doesn't have to fight and protect, he doesn't owe anyone anything. He pays tuition like anyone else (yeah Hogwarts is apparently free but I don't believe that) and has the right to get his money's worth. He has the right to demand to be protected like everyone else, he has the right to denounce the staff's passiveness and inefficiency. He has the right to be considered for the Prefect position and not be denied just because « he has too much on his plate already and has other responsibilities to the Wizarding world and would defend Hogwarts regardless of having the badge ». AND HE HAS THE RIGHT TO REFUSE THE HEADMASTER'S AUTHORITY OUT OF HOGWARTS. I'm not asking for Dumbledore bashing! You can't refuse someone's involvement in your life (when they have no business being involved) without hating them. And if Dumbledore refuses Harry his independence, then Harry can sever personal ties with him without the Headmaster being a “bad guy”.

** This reminds me of the procedures that the mages go through in the Witcher, I love the idea.

It should have a cost though, to ‘fix' himself of the lingering damage from his childhood should cost him something, not money. Like Fullmetal Alchemist says ‘equivalent exchange, you can't create something out of nothing'.

Maybe this is the selfish choice but understandable choice that he makes, ‘I trade my ability to create new life for the life I want' . Give me a Harry who looks /hard/ at his life, at his future and thinks ‘no, I'm not willing to bring a child into this world when I have so many enemies, I'm not willing to have a child if I might end up orphaning them and leaving them to live the life I did. This is what I'm sacrificing so I can have the life, health and looks I want.'

A Harry who has medical issues from his childhood and the year on the run, who hates being short, having bad eyesight, teeth, skin, hair etc.

A Harry who wants the best life he can possibly have and knows what he's willing to sacrifice and trade for it

*** I love this idea! Harry losing something would make people less likely to criticize making Harry too handsome or too powerful or some rubbish like that. In canon I thought it was odd that after a war, Harry settled that quickly into married life. Especially with Ginny who I don't approve of, but maybe she was the best he could do. He spent his life jumping when someone yelled jump and once more he conformed to society's expectation. I think Harry would be willing to sacrifice having offspring of his own. He could circumvent that by taking guardianship of Teddy later on but at the time of the ritual it would qualify as sacrifice.

The way I see it, Harry is ill-equiped to build a family as it is. He lost all his family. Never knew his mother and father. Was neglected/abused by his aunt and uncle. Never saw Remus before his third year. Found his godfather in a wanted criminal only to lose him two years later, after only a couple of conversations. Lost Remus two years after that without having been close to him either. Had the overbearing Mrs Weasley try to take the place of his mother and order him around.

Mrs Weasley would have pushed for Harry to be with Ginny as a condition for remaining his maternal figure. He would have had to conform to her wishes and “find a nice and secure job in the Ministry”. His friends would have also pushed him into the youngest Weasley's arm. He wouldn't have had a clue about raising a child the right way, and Mrs Weasley would have intervened at every corner.

Harry doesn't even know who he is, and never got to pause and do some soul-searching --- he wouldn't be fit to take care of a child.

That's why I want him to pause and better himself. If he can't find who he is, then he has to create who he wants to be. Then, only then, would he be able to take on the responsibility of raising a child.

Plus if he took care of Teddy later on, magic wouldn't see it as a betrayal of his sacrifice as he would take care of a child that is not is own (most witches and wizards don't do that), and said child is part-werewolf (a creature of magic that many witches and wizard despise and sneer at).

In terms of perpetuating the Potter line, so what of it? Yes it would be a shame for the line to disappear but Harry could rebuild it by handpicking interesting people and adding them into the family magic, blood adopting them into the family. And if as in canon, he was to reunite the Hallows, he could remain the Head of the Potter family forever and enjoying life with his makeshift family, being an uncle, a blood-brother, a father...

The problem with the idea is that losing the ability to have children is not the same for a man and a woman. The woman is the cradle of life and her relationship with her unborn child is much more intimate and primal. A man just drop his genes and “leave”, he doesn't foster the new life. So it might not be considered sacrifice-worthy.

Sacrificing Voldemort's piece of soul would be so great to read. The magic would require the caster to part with a part of him, of his soul, of his life in order to have the life they want. While preparing for the ritual, Harry would notice a black tendril leeching onto his core --- thus part of Harry, bearing his signature. He would figure out thanks to the books in Salazar's library what it was and then would decide to try and sacrifice it. As it is said in the books that a horcrux could only be destroyed by destroying the container, it would be a real gamble for Harry. He would risk his life. 3 possibilities : -magic accepts the sacrifice and rid him of the Horcrux. -magic refuses the sacrifices as the soul shard (even if it feels like his) is not his. Then he has to sacrifice part of his own soul and is still saddled with the horcrux. -magic latches onto the horcrux but can't dispose of it/ consume it without destroying the container.

That would mean that using the horcrux as sacrifice would entail the risk of sacrificing his life too. Then that could make the horcrux sacrifice-worthy as if it didn't work, he would be prepared to pay the greatest price.
