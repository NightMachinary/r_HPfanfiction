From a comment on DLP:

#+begin_quote
  I remember one fic (can't for the life of me remember which one) where the author actually came up with a semi-sane-sounding explanation for this where the Wizarding World is totally aware of the existence of pens, but chooses to use quills instead.

  Apparently quills are better able to accurately render certain magical symbols/sigils/runes that have variable thicknesses in their lines by using different portions of the quill's edge, where that calligraphic nuance is lost with a ball-point pen. Supposedly the difference in the line-shape is significant to the magical meaning and efficacy of those symbols.
#+end_quote

I vastly prefer this interpretation over assuming literally zero muggle-borns ever thought to bring up pens. In general, I prefer to believe the characters aren't necessarily stupid or malicious even if it may seem so at first glance. Especially after the last few years. How many times have people made judgements with their limited perspective only to end up being wrong?

Another example: Fred and George sell love potions. Now, we can believe Fred and George are rapists and every other character are rape apologists, but why would I ruin these characters for myself? Instead, I take on the headcanon that the potions they sold only ever allowed for people to confess their love for another --- no sex, no kissing, no cuddling, even. And if a person was to try it on a love potioned victim, they'd be violently attacked. Much better than the alternative, which is that everybody is a fucking psycho.

Similarly, I like assuming there are valid in-universe reasons for why characters do things that may seem stupid to us. Like some of Dumbledore's questionable decisions. The alternative is to believe all characters are so stupid that they never think to call Dumbledore out on this stuff, including Hermione. If Dumbledore was actually evil or incompetent, you'd think Hermione would at least say it, especially in the seventh book when she's an adult and the whole world was questioning Dumbledore's integrity. But even when Harry is questioning Dumbledore, Hermione remains steady in her belief that he was good.


** In canon Horace Slughorn has a reputation built up entirely upon his Mastery of Potions and his skill for and enjoyment of networking. And yet we never really see any actual evidence of the latter outside of him hosting a party for select schoolchildren. And while having a fear of Voldemort is healthy, Riddle himself having a vendetta against Horace, who is at worst a vaguely loose end that /may/ suspect he attempted to create multiple Horcruxes, doesn't make much sense. It's counterproductive even, since IIRC it was his unusual pursuit of a former teacher that helped Dumbledore twig on to the fact that Horace knew something.

 

Alternatively, a much better interpretation of events between Slughorn and Riddle:

 

As you recall, once out of school the first employment of note Riddle had was at Borgin's and Burke's. Though he made it work out, there is no way he /chose/ to work at a dingy pawn shop on the bad side of town. Tom Riddle had high marks, was Head Boy, and also won Special Services to the School Award for "solving" the death of a fellow student. This is the sort of person that is on their way to being Minister in a decade. Riddle with the kind of life he should have had coming out of school would have been able to become ruler of Wizarding Britain in full public view almost without lifting a finger. Why didn't he?

 

Enter Horace Slughorn. Instead of seeing the evil within Riddle and just deciding to never do anything about it ever, he took actions. He went down the list of people he knew and called them. Sullying Riddle's name and throwing his metaphorical weight around to make Tom impossible to be hired everywhere he went. And Horace's list of names and places he could call upon was quite long and quite widespread indeed. And given Horace's reputation (and that he was Riddle's Head of House) it's not like people wouldn't believe him when he trashed Riddle.

 

He may have spent galleons on ink and Floo powder, but he waged a one man campaign /and won/. All of Riddle's political and social ambitions cut off at the knees. Tom worked and Borgin's and Burke's because it was the one shitty job he could still get. Had Riddle not turned himself into a homicidal Dark Lord, Horace's plan would have worked and Tom Riddle would be nothing more than a nobody lost to history outside of a trophy that has to be occasionally cleaned.

 

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is a much better reason for Voldemort to have a vendetta against Slughorn. Not to soothe paranoia about a conversation decades ago, but to get revenge against the man who came closer than anyone to killing his efforts before they even got started.

*** This one was brought up in a fic once, i believe it was a time travel one and Harry was masquerading as Lily to coax it out of Slughorn. Slughorn in a fit of tears, alcohol and anger confessed to doing exactly the above after finding out Riddle made Horcruxes which was why he knows Riddle wants him dead.

I can't recall which fic it was though, it's been a while, but I remember it was rather decent.

** There are stories that spend a lot of their time coming up with explanations like that. I've been rereading the Arithmancer series recently, it has lots.

Eg Professor Snape did a deliberately poor job of teaching Harry Occlumency because Voldemort didn't want Harry to learn it and Severus couldn't blow his cover by defying that and teaching Harry to defend his mind properly - so Dumbledore had him teach in his usual style, hoping that Harry would still get /something/ out of it. (His dislike of Harry was all genuine, of course, but he was capable of teaching it better.)

The Half-Blood Prince was able to improve on all the textbook potion recipes because they are optimised for simplicity in teaching, not for effectiveness, so as long as the results are "good enough", they don't need to add in extra alternating stirs or use 13 beans instead of 12.

Goblin-forged coins react violently to being melted down, which is why it's not feasible to make free money through arbitrage.

As an alternative explanation for the Occlumency lessons, Nightmares of Futures Past suggests that there are two styles of Occlumency, one being a simple but obvious barrier, and the other being subtle but difficult misdirection. Only the second kind is useful for a double agent, and that's the style Snape was teaching (maybe even the only one he knows), but Harry was better suited to the first.

Didn't Snape in that fic also deliberately teach poorly because he /didn't want to be a teacher?/ He was in that position because he was paying a debt to Dumbledore. It seems like the most rational explanation for why Hogwarts would have Snape be potions professor, so Dumbledore could keep his spy close, but Snape didn't have to actually put in any effort into /teaching/. It's also why he wanted the Defense post and why Dumbledore refused to let him take it; the curse would mean something catastrophic happening relieving Snape of his duties at Hogwarts. I could be thinking of /Accidental Animagus/ by the same author, though.

I also liked Starfox5's explanation on why the Auror force is so weak during the second war: Snape required only the highest-graded students in Potions to move on to NEWT classes in 6th-7th year, and you need a NEWT in Potions to become an Auror, so Snape was basically gate-keeping future Auror-recruitment by being such an asshole at teaching potions, single-handily crippling the DMLE.

** The fic Harry Potter - Three to Backstep has the explanation concerning quills is that the quill (which is organic) allows the work to be imbued with the writer's magical signature thereby guaranteeing that the work is their own. A muggle pen (which is inorganic) doesn't allow that to happen.

"But, the magical signature can only be... appended... to a normal signature on parchment when you use a quill," added Hermione. "Your magic flows through the organic nature of both the quill and the ink to the organic nature of the parchment. You tend to use an inorganic fountain pen with inorganic ink when you write anything but official documents, class assignments and exams, and that doesn't carry your magical signature over. That's why the wizarding world still uses quills, organic ink and parchment."

** A bit of bizzare headcanon that i've come up with recently: Dementors are sould prisons, and if deprived of positive emotions they die of starvation and release all souls they consumed.

Now, you might say that being held in a soul prison is a terrible fate, but let's broaden our horizons a bit - azkaban houses most violent, unrepentant murderers. Having such people be allowed to simply pass on to the afterlife the same as everyone else doesn't do their victims justice. Thus, Azkaban and dementors.

At the same time, non-permanent crimes get really short sentences. Harshness of the prison makes it so noone complains that some criminal or other were locked up for a week or a few, the punishment is harsh, yet justice is done and one's life isn't turned upside down due to multi-year sentence of isolation from society.

*** I read a fic that talked about the fountain pen, pens and pencils thing. The way the author explained it, they're all made of synthetic, nonmagical materials that can't conduct magic, so while a fountain pen would be great for practicing your handwriting, they'd be useless for the quills' actual purpose.

When it comes to using them for homework, I add on my own personal theory: they trace remnant magic left on the paper by a student's quill to make sure that a student didn't simply copy-paste from someone else's essay. Before you start harping on me about Hermione writing both Harry's and Ron's essays: she didn't. Harry and Ron got copious amounts of help from her, and often times she would go through and check their essays afterwards with corrections. She never actually did it for them. The remnant magic would show this, hence why they never got called out by a teacher for cheating on an assignment. I imagine that grading regulations would be a lot harsher in a magic school than in a mundane /(I refuse to use the word muggle, it sounds like a slur)/ one because it'd be easier to cheat or steal someone else's hard work with magic. This is just what makes sense to me.

As for the use of mundane quills, I tend to headcanon that enchanted quills, being imbued with focused magic beforehand, can't properly channel the student's magic unless the spell was formulated to allow it. Dicta-quills, self-inking, and spell-check quills are acceptable for *most* note-taking and essays, but aren't allowed for projects, specific essays, arithmancy, and ancient runes notes. Along the same train of thought, they give students special quills during tests because they can't check everyone's "mundane" quills to make sure they're actually mundane.

** Prince of Slytherin has a bunch but my favorite was that the werewolf curse slowly turns you into a wolf-human hybrid with a thirst for human flesh but also advantages like easier transformations, claws, etc and that happens to literally every werewolf except Lupin since he's a natural wolf animagus (I think the author has natural mean spontaneous?? So he would've become a wolf without needing to undergo the transformation process, it would've just happened). I also read a fic where it's unhealthy for wizards to spend long periods of time in an expanded-space place, which explains why the Weasleys could have a car and tent that was bigger on the inside but couldn't do the same to their house. Also, the galleon-to-pound exchange rate is moot because muggle money can be duplicated and easily screw up the economy. They put a strict cap on the amount non-muggleborn-students exchange (muggleborn students have a cap too, it's just larger) so wizards can't duplicate a bunch of hundred-pound bills and exchange them for galleons.

** If it's purely about the nib, why quills and not more modern fountain pens with cartridge, which all Muggle kids in Britain know how to use?

In 1991, when Harry went to school, it was pretty much universal in Muggle junior schools in the UK that the children had to use fountain pens with cartridges. You start in infants with a pencil, you progress to a "handwriting pen" which was almost like a thin felt-tip but also not (I have not explained this well sorry!), and by the age of eight or nine you were expected to be able to write with a fountain pen. Many primary schools banned biros up until the early 2000s - the ink gets everywhere if they break and it is nigh on impossible to clean. So the only reason any Muggle raised kid would struggle with a quill is the dipping ink, which hasn't been commonly used in the Muggle world since the early 20th century. So I really don't see why they can't have used fountain pens. It's clearly an aesthetic choice not a logical one!

*** According to Wikipedia (i.e. I had my suspicions and spent a few minutes googling), fountain pens weren't mass-produced until the mid-1800s, and were still fiddly to refill and prone to leaking until the early 20th century.

Basically, with a feather and a knife you can make a quill, and you can't make a better fountain pen without fairly modern manufacturing and/or materials (and I doubt Purebloods like being reliant on muggles for school supplies).

Wizards don't seem to have/need factories, and schoolkids are liable to lose/break things, so there's no ability or incentive to use anything other than cheap quills.

It really couldn't. Paper had supplanted parchment for most purposes by the 17th century: it's cheaper and less labour-intensive to make, more pleasant to handle (parchment short of the most expensive stuff is /greasy/) and more consistent in thickness and surface even at the cheaper end of the scale.

Where parchment scores over paper is that a sheet of parchment is a single, unitary object, a single piece of a single animal's skin. As such it's easier to enchant than a piece of paper, which is made up of hundreds of thousands of fibres, not guaranteed to have all come from the same plant or tree. (Papyrus has the same problem, mitigated somewhat in that you can arrange to have a scroll made from stalks all off the same plant.)

****** Well informed by having to tidy up and sort out the document storage of two separate law firms. The last class of documents that /had/ to be on parchment ceased to be so in the 80s, but that still left a powerful lot of the nasty, greasy things. Especially since I was doing it in the late 80s, the year of and the year before the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 abolished all and any rules of law that 'restricts the substances on which a deed may be written' which rules of law were the only reason anyone was using the wretched stuff.

No standard sizes, greasy, expensive so the clerks and stationers who wrote on them wrote /really/ small, greasy, an absolute /magnet/ for rats (paper is only nest material but parchment is actual food what with it being leather.), heavy, greasy, needed special tools to prepare and write on, disgustingly difficult to uncrease once it'd been folded a few decades (paper deeds, you write them on pages and sew up the pages as a codicil), would only take wax seals rather than the hugely more convenient modern self-adhesive wafer seals, greasy, did I mention greasy?, and just all round bloody inconvenient.

It's handy stuff if you want documents that are shelf-stable for centuries - the precision industrial chemistry needed to make shelf-stable paper in bulk is a comparatively recent thing, so it still don't have the millenium-deep record of success in that department parchment does. (In the right conditions, leather - which is what parchment /is/ - can survive absurd spans of time. There's a 4,000-year-old leather manuscript in one of Cairo's museums, still legible. There are still-recognisable shoes of similar ages, and a quick google tells me that the record-holder is a 5,500yo specimen.)

** I had to do a lot of this for one of my fics, can't remember all of them but here's a couple of the plot-hole closures I came up with, some cribbing directly from what I wrote in the fic:

1. Binns is still teaching history because of politics. Both Dumbledore and Malfoy's ilk recognize that how history is taught can shape the views of children, so both would want a history teacher more in line with their own politics to replace Binns. However, neither is in a position to be 100% confident in pushing through their chosen candidate for the position, so neither side is willing to take the risk of their opposition selecting a new and engaging history professor. Dumbledore doesn't want someone like Umbridge teaching history with a bigoted twist, while Malfoy wouldn't want someone like Remus, so they stick with a sub-optimal status quo over risking a major shift against them.
2. Dumbledore sent the students to their Houses in response to the troll because sequestering them in their Houses was standard procedure for an emergency in the castle. Hindsight afterward caused him to amend that policy to cover cases where they'd be safer elsewhere, thus the sleepover in the Great Hall two years later.
3. The obstacle course protecting the Stone was due to Dumbledore falling prey to the phenomenon of "Have an awesome idea, find a flaw, patch the flaw, find another flaw..." and always trying to stick to that /brilliant/ idea he had without seeing that it was becoming more trouble than it was worth and considering other approaches.
4. The door to the forbidden corridor was only physically locked because Hagrid had to get in to feed/water/clean up after Fluffy. There was no Age Line or other such barrier because it would've required frequent maintenance and/or a localized weakening of the castle's other defenses.
5. The Fidelius isn't used more extensively for three reasons (aside from being an obscure and little-known piece of magic, something many fic-writers forget):

   1. Part of the casting involves giving the secret over, so it has to be a secret that belongs at least in part to the caster. That's why the secret in OotP was about "The Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix" - Dumbledore founded and led the Order, and so its Headquarters' location was a secret belonging to him.
   2. If the Secret Keeper is hidden by the spell, it puts a growing strain on the magic. They can stay for brief periods, but the longer they remain hidden the greater the strain, to the point where it will eventually overcome the caster's skill and power and the concealment will fall completely.
   3. The power required to cast it successfully rises with several factors - how obvious the secret is, the size of the object or area being hidden, the amount of magical power being hidden, the number of people who already know the secret prior to its being hidden, and their familiarity with it. Even Merlin couldn't have hidden a large public location like Hogwarts or the Ministry, and the Philosopher's Stone was too well-known and magically powerful to be hidden.

Why magical buildings aren't all expanded inside like their tents: Expanding a larger space takes more power, as does a greater degree of expansion. The less power required and the more power applied, the longer the expansion lasts - an average wizard could expand a tent for a few days at a time, but it would tire them out. Softer materials like cloth are also easier to expand than more rigid ones like wood or stone - in essence, it's easier for the magic to 'stretch' them. I doubt many would be that keen to build their family homes out of canvas. I also wouldn't want to be inside an expanded room when its expansion charms suddenly failed.

The only area in Britain that's been expanded large-scale and long-term is Diagon Alley and its associated side-streets: Originally, they /were/ actually just a handful of alleys, before a few witches and wizards set up stalls or carts to sell their wares. At some point, they wanted a bit more room and started enlarging the space available, then more people came, and it grew from there. Centuries of repeated castings of various expansion charms have effectively 'pre-stretched' them enough that they mostly hold their size and shape without needing the magics refreshed. On occasion the layout of the Alley shifts suddenly - this is usually because of either an old expansion fading, a new one being cast, or a faded one being re-cast. Also, every few years or so some building or another collapses because the owner hasn't bothered keeping up its expansion spells, though that happens more often in Knockturn Alley and other areas where buildings change hands frequently or landlords tend to be lax about maintenance.

Expanding even a single room in a brick or stone house would take a great deal of effort and likely only last a few hours at first, which would be a /lot/ of work to maintain. Why bother spending literally generations repeatedly expanding the same rooms when you could spend a few days or weeks adding onto the building the conventional way? Beyond that, many of the older families either wouldn't need nor want a huge mansion, and of those that do the ones with money prefer homes that look impressive on the outside as well as the inside.

For anyone curious about the fic, it's "Umino Iruka and the Will of Fire" by Leicontis, on either ffnet or AO3.

**** I expect the Board of Governors, of which Lucius is chair/head/whatever for the first two books, might be able to put their thumb on the scales. Don't forget that Remus was basically forced out when Snape outed him as a werewolf - even if Dumbledore wanted to keep him in the position, it would at the very least have cost him a lot of political capital to try. This implies that even if staff hiring and firing are /technically/ the Headmaster's purview, he can't make such decisions in a vaccum.

And speaking of political capital, another entry for the above list: Part of the reason Fudge was so quick to turn on Dumbledore after book 4, and was so successful in doing so, was because Dumbledore had thrown his weight around a lot and burned a lot of political capital to try and tone down Bagman's ideas for the Tasks to something at least approaching safe. Many at the Ministry of +Morons+Magic wanted the Tasks to be as "spectacular" as possible, which translated to danger levels more appropriate for Aurors than schoolchildren. They tried to include stupid ideas like "All three Champions will face their dragons at the same time in the same arena, and are fully allowed to try to sabotage each other."

Hermione figured it out simply because she knew nothing more of them than that within the book she found and lacked this misconception.

Goblins control the wizarding world's coinage because they are the only ones capable of making coins that can't be magically duplicated or melted down and sold to muggles, it's a similar process to the creation of goblin silver and just about the only way a society capable of conjuring almost anything but gold (which is far too valuable to use for everything) to actually have an economy.

** One reason I always struggled to make sense of the Werewolf Prank(TM) is that Snape isn't a moron, Sirius isn't a murderer and Dumbledore can't be /that/ short-sighted in seeing what impact a demand like he did could have on a traumatized person.

While my personal headcanon is that Sirius was simply just reckless (he's a teenager, and as an Animagus he might have unconsciously devalued the danger a werewolf poses) and engineered things such that Snape would give up all rational thought of venturing to see a werewolf (say, by implying Lily is in danger or something), there was one oneshot with a much more interesting premise that I really liked.

In it, Snape is suspicious, not of Remus specifically but the Marauders in general. So he feeds Sirius Veritaserum, asking Sirius where the Marauders venture every now and then during the night. He mentions the tunnel, and once he realizes what he's about to explain, flees the scene heading straight to James to explain what is going on, while Snape heads to the Willow. After this, cue what we already know from canon.

In such a case, Dumbledore is completely justified in his reaction and punishment, and while he should perhaps have tried to make Snape seek therapy, the Wizarding World in general doesn't really seem big on trauma recovery, so that's not something I'd blame Dumbledure specifically for.

** One of the things that comes to mind is why a Muggle-w*** fic would never be realistic. When Hermione said that magic effects technology, fans took it to mean electronics. What if Hermione (Rowling) meant all technology, including mechanical systems like car engines and guns?

Muggle-w*** fics purpose that superior Muggle firepower and modern tactics would make mincemeat of anything the wix population could ever muster. But, and this is where I differ from most people, if magic interferes with mechanical as well as electrical technology, then Muggles are utterly f***** if they try picking a fight with Death Eaters (or MoM Aurors, in some fics).

A fic that handles this concept well is Partially Kissed Hero, in which Harry, Hermione and Luna get turned into fairies (creatures that constantly emit magical energy). They learn that magic has unpredictable effects on even mechanical technology; a modern firearm, for example, has tolerances in the 1/100 inch range, which magic has a bad habit of messing with. A gun in the hand of a magic user, or in a magic rich area like Hogwarts might function normally, or it may shoot a bunch of flowers, or it might even explode like a hand grenade.

Also, there's the idea that wix have a lot of abilities that Muggles have no capacity to replicate or prevent. Bombarda and Confringo are common spells; basically, every witch or wizard who has a wand is carrying a multi-use, no reload required bazooka that they can hide in even the skimpiest, most revealing outfit that is concealing enough to be worn in public (without being arrested). Apparition and Portkeys mean that you have no way to flank or encircle a wix opponent, and that sandbags, razor wire, and minefields are useless for area denial. Assuming that Disillusionment Spells and invisibility cloaks can hide you from infrared and radar, well, I don't really need to tell you how easy it would be to break into a secure area or set up an ambush.

*** The counter point of wizards being incredibly powerful is that they are also incredibly naive and fail to truly appreciate thinking rationally, especially the mountainous scale of what the non-magical world has created post-industrialization. The world population was about 350 million after the Black Death, less than 1 billion when the Statute was created, and hit 6 billion in 1999.

My head-canon is that one's magical ability relies a lot on creative ability, which makes sense if we see magical ability as a combination of willpower, genetics, intelligence, study, and resourcefulness. The 'whimsy' we see see in the series is partially because it's a children's story, but to pin a reason why whimsy would be preferred over the progressive and utilitarian mind-set over the last few hundred years of education in the non-magical world is that thinking about magic is in itself an irrational exercise. The more you know of physics, the harder it is to accomplish Transfigurations, for example, because your mind just can't simply accept the impossibility of turning something into another thing. Every branch of magic has this dilemma; the more 'intelligent' your are in the non-magical-sense, the harder it is to do magic.

One might argue that Hermione is a counter-point to this, but she's not exceptionally 'good' at magic, she's just very good at problem solving, memorizing facts, studious, and since she was introduced to magic as a child (and probably had many accidental-magic episodes as a kid), can simultaneously accept that magic makes zero sense whilst maintaining a rational approach to problem solving. She's one of the edge cases. Harry is seen as actually 'mastering' many spells before Hermione, especially when Harry has proper motivation, even if Hermione had a better breadth of knowledge in magic.

The wizarding world basically missed the Age of Enlightenment, and while slowly catching up, probably due to constant influx of muggle-born children in their mix, their way of thinking, bar a few unique individuals, just seems dated and rooted in an acceptance of tradition and culture and 'the way things are' rather than affecting change in society.

So, while I think it would be trivial for wizards to topple global muggle governments and markets, it would be rare for a wizard to be able to /think/ of how to do so. Someone like Dumbledore or Riddle would certainly be capable, but the average witch or wizard recruited to defend against the muggles would be out of their element. The Minister of Magic basically just stops by the British muggle government every few years to check on things and then they go back to their separate worlds.

I mean, the world population didn't hit 1 billion until the 1800s, and many modern nations and governments didn't even exist before the Statute. The amount of progress and change in the non-magical world compared to the magical one is staggeringly fast. I find it kind of funny that the books refer to Romania, but Romania didn't even exist as an independent nation until fairly recently in history, so do they consider it part of the Turkish Ottoman territory, the Kingdom of Romania, the People's Republic of Romania, or Romanian Republic? I kind of imagine the wizarding nations' borders to be slightly different than the muggle ones, with large territories under the jurisdiction of small ministries, and they just refer to the area the ministry controls as that area. Great Britain is kind of a rare case of not going through a massive power struggle in its own borders in recent years, except of course where Northern Ireland is concerned.

So, I guess my point is that while wizards are insanely powerful on an individual scale, they aren't exactly equipped to understand a post-industrialization muggle world, even if technology and magic don't mix (which further exacerbates the wizarding world's inability to understand muggle technology).

The wix community made a decision that protected people who were unable to protect themselves.

  But even when Harry is questioning Dumbledore, Hermione remains steady in her belief that he was good.
#+end_quote

This is a fairly weak point, IMHO.

After all, she was a fairly intellectually gifted girl from a family that if not well-off, was at least solidly middle class. That means, she probably was attending a semi-decent to good school before Hogwarts, where teachers would probably try to nurture her talent (it looks good for the school and teacher if their students achieve something). Or at least, act professionally.

That Hermione who, coming from the muggle world, would not have any basis for those rationalizations (she's pretty much ignorant at the start, minus what can be found in Hogwarts: A History) does not so much as question the irresponsible/abusive/etc behaviour, at any point... It makes her judgement not exactly most sound one.

I, unfortunately, see her as a little girl still, even in the Epilogue. A High-INT, Low-WIS character. I find it hard to take her seriously, unless whatever she's saying is backed by hard evidence.

But that is my opinion, and it's perfectly fine if someone disagrees.

The problem with your argument is that the issues people have with Dumbledore aren't hard to find. They seem obvious. Why would Hermione not come to the same conclusions? Why wouldn't anyone else?

Which leads me to: my argument doesn't just apply to Hermione. It applies to everyone. No one in canon thinks Dumbledore was a complete idiot. So if he truly was, then that makes /everyone/ an idiot. Because, again, the criticisms leveled against Dumbledore aren't conclusions that are hard to come to.

If they were true, many would point it out. The fact that they don't points to either them all being idiots past the point of suspension of disbelief, or there's more to it we're missing.
