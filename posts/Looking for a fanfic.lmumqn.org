:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a fanfic that I was reading just recently before losing the link. It is about a Harry Potter who is 22 time traveling through dimensions to Rose Potter's 4th year with the Triwizard tournament. Harry is pretending to be Rose's boyfriend and the story contains some Dumbledore Bashing from what I read. Harry gives Rose some potions or stuff too. Could you tell me what fic it was as I was really enjoying it! PS. Harry's name in the fic was James Evans


** I'm not sure if it's the one you are looking for but the Rose Paradox has a similar plot to it. I think Harry is still in his teens tho and Bella is good while Sirius is bad. It's a decent read.

**** There is one called rose paradox. But it's more porn/smut that a serious fic. It has a harry who travels to a different dimensions and basically fucks every woman including his counter part who a girl.
