Quick explanation of what I'm looking for. I found a story a number of years ago on adultfanfiction.net called Third Wheel. It was about Draco sneaking out to a BDSM bar that's run by a dom couple. He winds up falling in love with them. The story does a really good job of portraying the dom's relationship, and there's a sequel that goes into their relationship with Draco. There was also another story by the same author called Willpower, where after Severus dies, his will is read and one of his last wishes is for Harry to go to Lucius.

What made the stories so good is they didn't really focus on the sex, but more the discipline and letting someone take care of you. Both were by the author someonenotme, but they're gone now. I'm still looking to to find them elsewhere, but in the meantime, I'm looking for similar stories. It's fine if they have sex in them, as long as that's not the focus of the story. I'd prefer slash, but het is okay too if it meets the criteria.


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4177539/chapters/9432279][This]] is the first fic that came to mind, for me. It's drarry and was written pretty recently. I'm not sure it's /quite/ what you're after but I hope it's pretty darn close. Draco is the sub in this, and is new to the scene and Harry shows him the ropes, figuratively and literally ;)

** [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600021832][Mad Snorkacks and Englishmen]] Harry/Luna pairing, DH. With Harry as Dom and Luna as sub. The BDSM part is introduced gradually but is pretty good.

*** God, I /LOVED/ this one when it was getting updated. Salon Kitty really knows how to write BDSM, making it incredibly hot, but also using it to examine the characters' emotional and mental states. Unfortunately, the author seemed attached to the notion of bdsm-as-a-symptom-of-dysfunction, and then the fic went off the rails and she fell off the internet. But for a while, this fic was the gold standard for BDSM in Harry Potter.

** Depending on whether or not you want actual BDSM or BDSM fantasy, then there's [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=1985&warning=4][Maduare]] and [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=1515&warning=Explicit%20Sex/Violence][Invocare]], which is Snape/Harry of the 'we have to have sex to save the world' kind, but is very slow build and gentle. It definitely has the discipline and taking-care-of-you aspects. (Trigger warning: violent rape near the end of the story, but it's not part of the romantic pairing, and is definitely not played for kinks. If you want to try to see whether it's worth it, you can safely read in a bit before encountering it.)

She also wrote [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=15313][Owned]], a Harry/Draco fic, which has both mystical wizards-made-us-do-it slavery and sex, but also some more real world style BDSM, with Draco as a sub, gradually training Harry to be a Dom.

As I say, both of these are fantasy BDSM, which means that the basic scenarios are problematic. Free and informed consent can't necessarily be things in these. Check out the scenarios and see whether they squick you.
