I'm looking for fics similar to this. Grammar is not the best but the plot was unique.I'm looking for selfish SIs who does not care about the rest of the world aside from their few friends. SIs who does not work towards bettering the world.


** It's not in the harry potter fandom but check out blood and chaos. SI wakes up in buffy the vampire slayer world and promptly becomes a vampire. only cares about few people and goes around murder hoboing; gaining power and trying to !science the magic of vamprisim, mainly by experiminting on others.

*** OP wants self-insert stories where the SI concentrates on themselves and their friends rather than saving the world.
