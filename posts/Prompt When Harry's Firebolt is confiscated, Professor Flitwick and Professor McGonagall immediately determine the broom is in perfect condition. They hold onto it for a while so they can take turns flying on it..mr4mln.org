** The two, /VERY/ professional, Professors looked over the broom.

"Now THAT is a work of beauty." Minerva said, gently brushing her fingers down the smooth surface. "The finest Ash and handpicked birch twigs for the tail. Naught to fifty in four seconds and naught to one-hundred-fifty in ten seconds." She looked over to her smaller colleague. "We can just tell Granger it was cursed right?"

Filius gave a belly laugh, pulling his wand free. "I certainly have no issue with that. Ms. Chang will certainly win against Potter if he's flying on hopes and dreams."

The dark haired woman groaned. "Bloody bad luck." she muttered as Filius tapped the broom thrice.

"Would you LOOK at that Arithmancy?!" he exclaimed, the numbers and symbols floating above the body of the broom. "Truly this is a work of art. No way in HADES could Black have managed to curse this thing. The man never took Arithmancy or Runes in his seven years and he would have been a decade out of practice." he announced. "The most he could do is give away a few thousand galleons and turn a 'Mona Lisa' into an 'El tío Paquete'."

McGonagall sighed, "Lucky pup, that Potter." she said sadly, "I shall console myself by taking the Quidditch Cup away from your office Filius."

"Not bloody well yet you shan't!" he squeaked indignantly. "Chang may yet get us a points lead. Your team is good, but MINE is the champion!"

The pair shared a laugh as they sat down, and for a long moment looked down at the finest broom either had seen. Finally the Deputy Headmistress stood and grabbed the broom. "You know Filius, I feel like we /really/ need to test this broom out to make sure there are no... Malfunctions."

The half-goblin nodded sagely. "It may well take /many, many, many/ hours of rigorous testing to make sure Black hasn't somehow figured out how to manipulate runes and arithmancy during his incarceration."

"I dare say the Dementors may have taught the boy a thing or two... No, better safe than sorry... and dibs on the first flight!" she said, running towards the pitch rather sedately, a grin threatening to cleave her head in twine.

"Bugger!" Flitwick cursed, his short legs not carrying him /nearly/ fast enough to keep up, "Wait for me Minerva!" His only answer being her girlish cackles from the stairwell.

** A bit off-topic, but I always felt that the time it takes for the teachers to figure out that the broom is fine was narratively too convenient.

It's just long enough to exacerbate the conflict between Ron and Hermione, and also makes Harry take the side of Ron, but then it is completely resolved without any consequences. I actually found the way Alfonso Cuarón worked the Firebolt into the movie to be so much better, as it gives a movie such a great closure, and works around the fact that getting Sirius out of the castle on a Firebolt would have been way more sensible than an elaborate plan to save/kidnap Buckbeak.

*** Yeah, but it depends on quidditch, which is a massive part of Harry's time in Hogwarts that is skipped over in the movies, not being shown at all. It's something I understand why they did it, but Harry wouldn't be close to competitive on a school broom, and Having Harry buy another Nimbus 2000 like he was thinking only to get the firebolt at the end would be stupid.

**** I understand that it's important for Harry, but it would have had a much bigger impact if the consequences of Harry siding with Ron had some effects on their friendship dynamics.

The books would have a much easier time to do that effectively, since the fact that Harry sided with Ron during the 3rd year /could/ have some impact on how Harry feels about Ron not believing him that he didn't enter himself into the Tri-Wizard Tournament. But it doesn't. Nor does it have an effect on his relationship with Hermione.

I don't actually care about Quidditch not being part of the 3rd movie, since there was so much going on already. In fact, I would say that Cuarón's decision to axe it from the movie almost entirely is the reason why the Prisoner of Azkaban is often regarded as the best movie in the series --- everything that was included had a purpose, rather than being there just because it was in the books. This is where later movies suffer, because they include stuff for the sake of being important in the books, not understanding /why/ they were important in the books.

**** I /kinda/ get it where time travel is involved, lot of authors love a "redeem the evil person" type of love story (hence, also, Draco/Hermione being a thing) - but even then, they usually have to eliminate 99% of his canon character and fill it in with some idealized version, in order for the ship to make sense.

Snape/Hermione without time-travel being involved adds a whole other level of nope.

******* There's one exception for me: Every Other Midnight, a Jilly fic where James (24/25) ends up dating Lily (18) his student at the time. Not only it takes long for them to get together, being way way more than just a school girl crush or perverted teacher, the amount of conflict that's created whithin them is just enough to show exactly how problematic this kinda relationship really is, i.e: James usually ends up with the final word, because he's a teacher at the end of the day and if Lily does something he disagrees with, he might as well punish her. This alone makes her super uncomfortable and unhappy and I personally think is very well made. Also the author explicitly says this should never ever happen in real life, etc etc etc
