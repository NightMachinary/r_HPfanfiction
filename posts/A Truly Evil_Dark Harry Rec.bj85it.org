** A genre savvy SI replaced Voldemort in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/][I am Lord Voldemort?]], linkffn(12980210). He's still a total evil SOB, but more fun.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

** I know one, I'll need to Look for it, but it went like this: Harry Potter was abandoned by the Potters who I think survived. When he was ready to enter school, again the Potters took him away and introduced him to magic. But he wasn't so light anymore, he was mute and scary. So he entered Hogwarts and I think is sorted into Slytherin. Through the years he forms his inner circle. All of them commit murder and torture clashing with Lord V. and his group. There is lots of graphic torture, rape and murder.
