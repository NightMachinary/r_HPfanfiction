For those of you who don't know, a Roast is a celebration of someone, usually but not always a comedian, and they have their friends and fellow comedians on stage and make fun of the Roastee and the other Roasters. The jokes tend to be quite blue but it's all in the spirit of fun. Comedy Central has aired many roasts in the past and most of them are quite funny.

** Let's be honest, all of his awkward romantic attempts would get roasted, as would his angst in OOTP, and why he wandered round the woods for most of DH.

Dumbledore: If I tell you, I'm afraid you won't even try it.
