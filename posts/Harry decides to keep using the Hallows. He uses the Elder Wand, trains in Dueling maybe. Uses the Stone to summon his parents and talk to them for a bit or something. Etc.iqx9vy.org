** It always bothered me how Harry refused to use the Elder Wand (or the Resurrection Stone)... To read these type of fanfics is always a well-received surprise.

** It always annoyed me how much potential Harry just threw away. I mean, The wand seems like it can, other than increase the power of a spell, do things considered otherwise impossible (eg. him fixing his wand), it opens up so many possibilities, could he conjure food maybe?

Besides the emotional help the stone also represents the council of every sage, the tactician knowledge of every general and the expert of every academic to have ever walked on earth. Want to find some long lost artifact? Wait a sec, just gonna call it's last owner and we are ready to go. Wanna cure a disease but know nothing of healing? Ok, who do I know was a good healer... it's on the tip of my tongue... it was a Greek guy- Asclepius! Yeah, I will just call him and get it done on a blink. Oh, wow, age is sure catching up to me, I mean, I already got /a white hair!/ ok, no panic, now let's just ask the recipe of the Philosophers Stone from Flamel and bang! Goodbye uncomfortable aging process! The criminal you are looking for seems crazier than a bag of Knezels and you can't for the life of his victims find a pattern? Ok, lets start asking his parents, then siblings, then friends and mentors... eventually we are bound to find /someone/ who understands that nutjob! I guess it always seemed like such a waste.

And the cloak that permitted the trio to sneak around during all the books and supposedly hides the wearer from death itself (whatever it means) with this no vault, no tomb and no underwear cabinet is safe, he could steal anything that takes his fancy and probably half of what doesn't... or I guess he could go the more boring route of using it to sneak and remain unnoticed by enemies thus getting protection with it, but who cares for this!?

With all three, even without any special powers being gifted to him, he could become a serious powerhouse. Like, making Voldemort and Dumbledore seem like schoolchildren in comparison badass.

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".
