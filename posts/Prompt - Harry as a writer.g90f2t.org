After the war, Harry is kind of sick and bored of the whole death eater, evil vs. light business. His psychologist/mind-healer suggests that he keeps a diary or writes a biography to deal with the ball of trauma that is his life. Harry finds himself writing the Harry Potter books and publishes them in the muggle world causing a sensation. The epilogue is a pipe dream as he is only 18 when he is writing these books.

Anyways, the fans want more books, Harry is stumped as he doesn't have more adventures to share. He goes back to the wizarding world to get inspired etc, and purchases a new notebook and quill at a quaint little shop at Knocturn Alley. Sitting at a bar, he begins to write a short story-made up adventure surrounding Harry. The next day he finds that the adventure he wrote is coming true. He tries a few more short stories and realizes the new notebook he purchased is, you guessed it, quite magical. He can write anything into reality. So he writes himself into a time-travelling adventure and soon finds himself back in the past. Now he could go back to 1980 or maybe 1991 (the stipulation would be if he chooses to go to 1991, he has to be bodily present in the year he chooses to go, as he would merge with that body). If you choose that he goes before 1981 then the stipulation wouldn't apply.

Armed with years of knowledge, could Harry change the storyline that caused a sensation? Could he save people and end the war early?


** This is Inception levels of mindfuck-ery

That being said, I love it. Yes, please!

** Well, if he can write anything and it happens he's practically God. He could write an adventure through the Veil that results in all the good people who died stepping out and being alive again. He could write about Lord Voldemort dancing down Diagon Alley in a ballerinas tutu. He could write about Draco Malfoy's secret adventures as a ferret animagus. He could write about how Harry Potter got elected Supreme World Leader. He could write about the fountains of eternal youth that suddenly started popping up everywhere. He could write about Mars turning habitable.

*** Yes but the thing with Harry is that he is not really that creative. He is a successful writer because he had been writing real events. When it comes to creation, he would be stumped imo. And usually he is very impulsive. He would think of time-travel first, because he had done it before with Hermione. With time travel god-like power would be limited because when he falls to past the notebook would disappear, as he would not have acquired it yet.
