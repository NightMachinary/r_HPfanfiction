With blood magic you get

- ritual blood adoption
- Blood wards
- Blood binding spells on enchanted items (anti-theft on money bags, wand holsters, restricted use on other items, like custom wands or amulets, heir / lordship rings, etc.)
- Religious observances (the old ways)
- Divination rituals (trace spells, scrying, health monitors and diagnostics, heritage tests)
- Blood curses - curses cast via ritual, at a remote location from the target, using the target's blood. May, potentially be heritable, I.e. a line curse.

Anything else notable about blood magic? Limitations? Other uses?

When did it become illegal dark magic?


** Limitations can include willingness of source; 'blood of the enemy, forcibly taken.' Willingly given vs Forcibly taken can have an impact on the intent and result of a spell or potion.

How long can blood held in storage be effective? Does it diminish over time? Does it matter whether the source is currently living? Was living at the time blood was gathered?

*** Excellent points. A fic I'm following featured members of a dying house leaving blood in stasis warded location inside their abandoned manor house in the hopes that some future mage would revive the house via blood adoption. Time traveling Harry uses it to create a new identity and have a completely secure base of operations in the unplottable Kent family home (known to him from discovering it in his original timeline). The Veiled Vestiges by NeatStuff ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20552285/chapters/48785528]])

Suggests that, well protected, blood has a near indefinite shelf life. At least for the purpose of blood adoption.

On the other hand I'd be surprised if blood from a deceased person could be used to curse their line. Certainly it would be too late to curse their person.

I'd like to think blood adoption requires willingly given blood from a living person at time of collection.

Unicorn blood has several aspects, live Unicorn - forcibly taken or willingly given, dead unicorn - natural death or killed. I think blood from a unicorn that died a natural death would be almost as good as willingly given live blood, but post mortem blood from a killed unicorn would be just as cursed as forcibly taken live blood.

There would have to be spells that identified the status of a given sample. They themselves would probably be classified as blood magic, as they required the blood to test.

Excellent points! Thanks again.

**** I think there would a sliding scale of usefulness. Forced/Neutral(Natural)/Willing. Did the resurrection spell Require the blood letting to be forced? Would it have been affected if Harry was willing?

I recall at least one fic where Harry indicates his blood is willingly given, as its added to the spell, despite how it was collected. In turn, weakening the ritual.

He was also already bleeding. Collecting blood from an unrelated wound might have been Neutral in this case.

For blood adopting, how vague can we get? Willingly giving blood for the future of your line, regardless of the recipient? Do personal and/or family ties or feuds factor in? Like say a blood feud between the Malfoys and, say, the Longbottoms. Malfoys die out and the 4th Longbottom in line to inherit decided to revive the Malfoy line. Can it fail? Just a rejection or can it be fatal?

How exact and/or intense do protective spells need to be. Sounds expensive. Or like it's Old Knowledge, closely kept, and obscurely documented.

Using blood of the deceased introduces a new factor to care of the dead. Are bodies drained of blood after death? What would happen to it? Are the dead cremated to prevent misuse of blood? Are there specific crimes against violating a grave or what have you? If magic is classified, would that be Dark or Black magic? Would it be familial magic if done by a family member or relative?

***** I've added the following points to my list, with notes of some related head cannon of mine, inspired by the discussion here.

- Blood protections (I.e.: Lily's ritual blood magic that left the rune scar on Harry's forehead) and 'Potter Luck' a (mostly) beneficial 'line curse' on the family line (expression of which varies according to the individual's magical power level, thus Harry's repeated bouts of incredible luck - a 'power he knows not').\\
- Declare/dissolve blood feuds
- Blood bind magical contracts via signing them with a blood quill. (After Umbridge Harry is reduced to clever use of misdirection and half truths, together with judicious failure to correct misapprehensions, when he needs to deceive (like the Fae), as he no longer has the ability to tell an outright lie.)
- Creation of homunculi and vessels of resurrection ('blood of the enemy, forcibly taken') - combined with the appropriate amount of soul magic, as necessary

I'll have to work up a format to outline the limitations, and related aspects (treatment of the dead, etc. ) and details related to long term storage and finer aspects of blood adoption.

Thank you so much for engaging me with this exercise.

****** No problem. I'm good at locating obscurity, even if I can't directly contribute.

And, you've given me something to think about, as well. Blood bound magical contracts. I like the idea that Harry can't tell lies as a result. But, as he wasn't lying to begin with, it might have te effect of making people take him at his word.

** A source of inspiration I quite enjoy in regard to making limitations is making the definition pointless thematically but still broadly functional. So, the Prissy Bruiser or the Overlord that nobody listens to. Blood Magic could degrade your genetics or morph them somehow, perhaps.

For limitations, you could look into actual blood conditions like Haemochromotosis and attach them as possible side-effects to misused blood magic. Could also have that stored blood you mention in another comment 'go off' as the storage spells degrade and cause those conditions if the decaying blood is used.

Regarding blood magic proper, I'd note that Blood is most often associated with life and death, familial connectiveness, and pain. Some cultures link it to sacrifice (willing and otherwise) while modern Wicca would take a more... vegan-pacifistic path decrying use of anything more than a couple drops of your own vitae.

I'd say illegality most often came from that sacrificial association. Aztecs bled a sizeable number of people over their 90-something years of activity, for instance, which tends to make people rather twitchy on a sheer conceptual level. On a practical base, most Humans have a psychological aversion to seeing blood outside the body. It stinks, it's sticky, and it's generally an unpleasant sensation to be in proximity to it on top of the obvious comments of 'blood keeps us alive, seeing it outside a body is fuckin' weird', thus we dislike it and we stay away from or regulate and ban things we don't like.

*** Thank you so much for engaging with me on this topic. I particularly appreciate your point on dangers of using blood that's 'going off'. That, and the point that I can create any arbitrary limitations I like. I suspect I'll require an, at minimum, grey magical affinity with a specific gift for blood magics to be able to do more than simply use blood based enchanted objects or participate in a blood adoption or religious observance. Without the gift, wielding blood magic would curse the caster, perhaps causing the condition you suggested.

Outlawing blood magic came, in part to protect the lazy public from attempting blood magic without first confirming both affinity and gift. Also, in part, due to envy - 'if I can't play, ain't nobody can play.' And fear, 'I don't want people to be able to use magic against me that I can't use. I won't be able to defend myself.' Add to that the 'squick factor' you mentioned, and outlawing it was probably the easiest of the 'so called' dark magics to be made illegal. As to timing, in the period just after the defeat of Grindelwald, the political ascendency of the light and their attempts to outlaw all things dark.

**** Sure. Always happy to help with worldbuilding. Delightfully fun part of storytelling, despite how little of it goes directly into the actual writing.

That affinity idea is quite interesting. While this isn't specific to your fic, it could be used as an explanation for why things like blood binding or adoptions (ie. the heritage-type magics) are so commonly attributed to the Goblins. Mayhaps they, as the more martial, bellicose race have wider instances of that affinity and the Ministry Magicals saw the opportunity to outlaw themselves practising it (motivated by that fear, envy, and Light-politics you mentioned) in order to push the danger towards the 'lesser races' - if anyone is going to do something that might harm themselves, why not let the Goblins do it so that anything going wrong wouldn't hurt 'respectable wizards'. Hence why the Dark might agree with it. After all, the Goblins didn't sacrifice a large portion of their citizenry to fight Grindelwald, did they? :)

Would make as much sense as any explanation for using that nigh-cliche'd trope. :)

***** If you want a practitioner-limitation other than the Goblins, you could also take a slightly nordic approach to the matter. They had two forms of magic: Seithr, which were high magics practiced by women and 'unmanly men like Odin'; and Galdr, which (while not terribly well understood due to largely-lacking evidence) seemed to refer to magic of incantation and runes (ie. the magic studied in Harry Potter). Could have blood magic being one of the last remnants of the Seithr magics in modern society and thus more powerful and more dangerous all at once. Could even have that affinity be mostly in the hands of women, if you want to throw an interesting socio-cultural influence in there.

****** Oh that's so cool. I love it that blood magic could be primarily in the hands of women. And that obscurity of it as a remnant of Seither magics just lends to the mystery of it all.

And Goblins capitalizing on wizard stupidity by offering magic as a service within their sovereign territory because, unlike wizards, they are neither too lazy nor too squeamish to be competent at it, just makes sense.

Both points very well taken.

******* Glad I could help. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. I'm a culture nerd, so I'm full of random historical-social knowledge like that. :)

I will say that if you want interesting twists, uses, or limitations to magic, look at older cultures and they've generally done all the work for you. Check your local library/pirate books website for anthropology, sociology, psychology, philosophy, or history texts and you'll find a wealth of ideas for inspiration. Centuries-dead people were cruel, and also are no longer around to sue for copyright infringement. So, have fun. :)
