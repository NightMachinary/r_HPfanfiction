The d The dursley's like many of the inhabitants of privet drive Were periodic attendance at the local church usually on major holidays or when petunia felt like Mrs. Snidely was starting to look at her sideways in the grocery aisle after not seeing her at church. They weren't exactly particularly religious but they still went on occasion dragging Harry with them simply because petunia didn't trust him in the house alone for that long of A time at that point and mrs figg always went to Sunday services so she wasn't a Available to watch the young Potter Due to this infrequent trip to church every month or so the dudleys were vaguely familiar to the priest at Saint Michael's and with it had a bit of a familial Father John the vicar had been at Saint Michael's for nearly 17 years that summer between Harry's 5th and 6th yearv whe

n The boy had nightmares so loud it even disturbed Vernon in his normally nearly comatose state of slumber. Petunia as was the tradition at this point firmly established drag the entire family to church when she got the stink eye from the neighbor lady when she was picking out onions for purchase. And without even a thought the neighbors had heard Harry shouting once or twice she dropped or rather dragged him not into the main building for service but into the office of Father John who was at that point slightly older and did more of the afternoon services rather than the early morning ones that was left to the younger priest father Simon father John was also a licensed psychotherapist petunia and many others in the

parish went to him for grief counseling free of charge when it was easier to go to the priest then to contact their local G p's office with the Thatcher cut backs there was a bit of a wait list. TFather John was known for his description and petunia made a show of making a large donation to perish really it was only about 50 pounds before telling the priest quietly with the door shut and Harry shoved into an overly stuffed old chair that her nephew had been having nightmaresWith that petunia doucely turned on her heel and walked back into the main building of the church leaving Harry in the office with a curse sentence that he should walk home after he was finished she went in to service and Harry was left staring at the priest

in the same state he had been in more or less the entire summer morose a bit disassociated and grieving through the closest thing he ever had to a father.
