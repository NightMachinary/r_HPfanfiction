I read a story sometime back where a MoD harry goes to Black island after defeating Voldemort and tries various ways to kill himself, unaware that in Britain and rest of magical world blood purity becomes worse led by Dumbeldore and Percy Weasly, it becomes a rule in Britain if anyone even have a small non magical anestery they are procecuted. The island becomes a sanctuary to all those escaped and after sometime he introduces magical virus to world which renders them incapable of producing magical children, as a result Hogwarts becomes closed and sealed. I stopped at the chapter where he seperates the island to another dimension which runs at 10th of the time. It has about 5 long chapters, with length of about 100,000 words. Does anyone help me find this fic, I searched various combinations but unable to find any.

*** Even though I dislike Wizarding governments and societies a lot, I don't like fics in which protagonists used some kind Deux Ex Machina to diss them. One of my least favorite scheme was having the Queen using some obscure ancient contracts to nerf the Magicals.
