This fic leaves me in awe every single time I re-read it. The amount of work that has gone into this. The way everything is connected over centuries of history is just mind blowing.

Ebenbild... Who ever you are. May merlin bless you. Or as in your fic. Myrddin emrys bless you.


** I agree it's so complex and you don't see the twist until several chapters in. Trying not to spoil it.

*** Exactly. Some of those twists left me like " holy Christ" and I'm still.not able to guess what the end game is going to be. Even after 64 chapters. Amazing

** Indeed. The amount of work and planning that must have gone into setting it up is phenomenal.

That said it still desperately needs to be beta read.

*** Yeah. The spellings. But I can understand. The chapters are huge. So I don't mind them as much as I should.

**** Does it get any better? I just started reading it today when I saw this post and it is tough to read in parts. I appreciate it isn't their first language so I'm not bashing, just not sure if it is worth it.

** I hope so much we'll get more chapters during the isolation, I know they're real monsters lengh-wise but it's just so brilliant. All the small background story details from canon you only just remember that pop up all over the place. I fangirled about this fic to my sister for over an hour when I first read it ^^
