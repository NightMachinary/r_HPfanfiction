I was read White Knight Grey Queen. I was wondering if there are any other fanfics that have this pairing and are completed as to reduce the amount of imagination and brain power I need to use to figure out what MIGHT happen.

Thanks!


** That is the best completed one I know of. Only other really good one I know is linkao3(maybe they did know what they were doing) sadly it's not complete yet

  During the summer before his 6th year, Harry has a meeting with the Gringotts Goblins, they change his life and inform him of something that Harry just can't believe. Never abandoned, will update until complete. Merely sometimes forgotten in the face of ravenous plot bunnies.

** I agree that White Knight, Grey Queen is probably the best Harry/Pansy that I have read. I have not come across a lot of Harry/Pansy fics. We're in this Together by zugrian is a WIP with that pairing.

Linkffa(2039)

Unfortunately Unbreakable by Luan Mao is more of a crack fic where Harry is stuck against his will with Pansy.

Linkffn(9076277)

Duel by fantasy1290 is more of a Harry/Harem where Harry first wins Pansy (via Betrothal contract) as the "prize" when he duels Malfoy.

  Unbreakably bound to someone you can't stand? How unfortunate.
