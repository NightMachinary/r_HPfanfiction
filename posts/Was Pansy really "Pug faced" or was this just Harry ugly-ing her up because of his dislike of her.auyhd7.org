I noticed on the wiki for Pansy it says

"/Looking down, Harry saw the pug-faced Pansy Parkinson right at the front of the stands, her back to the pitch./" ---Harry Potter's opinion of Pansy's appearance "

I find it curious the wiki states "Harry Potters 'Opinion' suggesting that this might not be a wholly fair description of Pansy maybe? Is his view just coloured by her being a Slytherin, a friend of Malfoy and often just nasty? I'm I just reaching with this or could Pansy maybe be nicer looking than Harry would tell us?? haha

Side note I think theres a tendency in fan fics to often make ugly or plain characters highly attarctive as that makes readers often latch onto a character more but is it maybe, pretty fair and okay to write Pansy as, well not beautiful excatly but not as this awful pug face Harry describes? (also what exactly is a 'pug face' does it mean you have the features of the dog breed or?? im just curious haha)

Ps: I enjoy this kind of [[https://ctl.s6img.com/society6/img/UuD-fafwW3PpOb8tMJ2Na3atqeQ/w_700/coffee-mugs/swatch/%7Eartwork,fw_4603,fh_1999,fx_9,fy_-899,iw_4599,ih_8055/s6-original-art-uploads/society6/uploads/misc/dbb1b91f3e44468a876f39fbe130e967/%7E%7E/pansmione-mugs.jpg][Fanart]] of Pansy (how would you describe her here? I'm not sure but i liek it ahha) I also like when she has rather sharp features and is sort of strict and severe but somewhat alluring in fanart...anyone a fan of that style of Pansy too?


** I always imagined Pansy to have the quintessential British girl features, like this [[https://i.imgur.com/rIy0w6C.jpg][*actress here*]] or in [[https://i.imgur.com/JSN3Sen.jpg][*this picture*]].

Imagine that last one as Pansy's face when she tries to turn Harry in to the Carrows in DH, lmao. The "pug" face is a broader shaped nose instead of a pointy one. Not really that unusual of a feature, but distinctive if the rest of her face is normal.

Harry's narration has a tendency to latch onto one or two main details in a person's appearance when he meets them, which repeats when he encounters them after his first impression. An example would be Cho Chang's sleek black hair, or how Tom Riddle is described as handsome 6-7 times over the series, or Voldemort is red eyed, with a high, cold laugh. With attractive characters, he notices their looks even if he doesn't like them, but will often try to counter them with something else, like Bellatrix's hooded eyes or Narcissa's haughty lifted nose, like she just smelled poop. For this reason, I don't think that Pansy was exceptionally beautiful (or physically attractive in a way that appealed to Harry's tastes), like Cho or Ginny, but more average.

** I think Harry's pretty brutal in his descriptions whether he likes someone or not.

We hear about how Molly is overweight and Dumbledore has a crooked nose. We hear about Remus' shabby clothes and the lines on his face. Perhaps most of all, even after Harry gets to the point where he loves Hermione as much as anyone in the world, we hear about her bushy hair and overbite (until she fixes it). He's not very impressed with his own appearance; when we first meet him, he picks himself apart down to the knobbly knees and tells us the only thing he likes about the way he looks is the scar.

Meanwhile, despite Bellatrix being one of the most horrid characters in the books, Harry is clear that she had "great good looks" before her time in Azkaban. Narcissa, who he dislikes, is acknowledged as pretty; it's only the expression on her face that's ugly. The first time he looks at an old picture of Sirius, at which time he still thinks Sirius betrayed his parents, he jumps right to "handsome." Even young Tom Riddle is specifically held up as conventionally attractive through Harry's filter.

He does get a bit more creative with his insults when he dislikes someone-- his most colorful descriptions are saved for the Dursleys-- but I don't think he's dishonest about appearance.

Remember we're looking into the mind of a teenager. My thoughts as a teenage boy were much much worse than Harry's. And much more perverted. All those brutal descriptions (pug-face, overweight, shabby clothes, etc...), he never said those out-loud.

** harry acknowledges when he thinks someone is good looking regardless of how he feels about them- see how he describes bellatrix, narcissa and tom riddle. i doubt she was too unattractive, though, otherwise draco might not have bothered with her. but not too conventionally pretty either

I haven't seen Sex Education, but I don't get the Carmelita parallel. Carlmelita makes everything 100% about her 100% of the time, and never considers anyone else to be of any worth unless it's making her spotlight shine a little brighter.

Pansy acts in a similar fashion when left to her own devices, but she's so simpering and focused on Draco whenever they're in the same room that she's more like Esme Squalor's early characterization.

** It's hard to say when the entire book series is from Harry's POV so his personal opinion may be reflected in some of the descriptions which is what I think the HP Wiki description was trying to address, we don't really have an unbiased view of her other than if you want to pick one of her actresses and describe her yourself (I think there are four credited to her role)

ETA: I think “pug faced” means her face is flat? My best guess lol

She wasn't the first, though I've only seen that from Dahl and her. Maybe a British trope?

#+begin_quote
  “If a person has ugly thoughts, it begins to show on the face. And when that person has ugly thoughts every day, every week, every year, the face gets uglier and uglier until you can hardly bear to look at it.

  A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts it will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.”

***** Id like to see GRR Martins Harry potter lol he does very well in making beautiful people abosulte scum and hideous ugly people have pure hearts. also having characters who are very grey on every level. I think Bellatrix is my fav villian as she is described as good looking but extermely evil while also having quite a childish mind with mocking schoolgirl insults and juvenile attitude, i find this more unerving than Voldemorts more tradtional form of evil. Also she is cable of love i think (on some level and can show affection always calling narcissa cissy and sweet things like that) make this maniac alot more interesting than voldy to me as he has no empathy or ablity to show affection to anyone on any level haha

Dealing with the Death Eaters and pureblood supremacy gets so much easier and enjoyable if you free yourself from the Dumbledore point of view (they are misguided and redeemable) and simply see them as racially motivated terrorists with countless, obvious Nazi parallels.

***** *Claus von Stauffenberg*

Claus Philipp Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg (15 November 1907 -- 21 July 1944) was a German army officer. He was a "Graf" i.e. count and Schenk (i.e., cupbearer) -- an additional hereditary noble title. He took part in the attack on Poland, the German invasion of the Soviet Union and the Tunisian Campaign during the Second World War.

** There are two other instances of Pansy being described as pug-like too:

"“Hey, Potter!” shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin girl with a face like a pug. “Potter! The dementors are coming, Potter! Woooooooo!”" - PoA ch 6

"All of them were looking at something Harry couldn't see and sniggering heartily. Pansy's pug-like face peered excitedly around Goyle's broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached." - GoF ch 27
