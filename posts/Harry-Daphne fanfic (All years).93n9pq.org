** First few points before I get to the details of what your story is. Firstly, its very American. Late night games and /mail/ vans aren't things on this side of the pond. Please stop replying to reviewers, at least at the top of your story. Its a mess and I should never have to put effort into finding the story when I have 750,000+ others to choose from. Your Hagrid is a bit off but better than most. I do hope he's gone soon or else your story will become rather clunky.

Otherwise, you've set yourself a really ambitious first story. 7 years is a lot. JKR needed 1,084,170 words for it and a decade. Now, you're not after professional editing or anything like that but you've got a lot of work ahead of you. Sure plenty of authors have managed that many words, god only knows how MegaMatt keeps pumping them out, best not ask, but still, its an awful lot you've set yourself for a first story. Especially when you have lots of ideas that you would 'like to bounce around'.

Personally I will not be reading more of this. I've read almost every HP/DG story but I won't be reading this because it doesn't match my taste. The style isn't bad but anyone who isn't a fan of Fantastic Beasts, like myself will likely drop at your first chapter. I'd also warn about building too much mystery. It can be good, hook people in and make them ask what comes next but you've dumped a lot of hints and with a potential seven years to bog the pacing down it might become less mystery more frustration.

** Can someone explain the Daphne Greengrass phenomenon to me?

I'm new to the fanfic fandom. All I could discover was a picture of a blonde from the movies. Where did this originate as a point of fascination with authors?

Sorry to the author that this is off-topic. But if someone explains this to me, I may perhaps venture to read one, and why not this one(an DG story, that is) :)

*** Listen, did you ever watch Scooby-Doo as a child? If yes, I don't understand why you're asking.

*** Do you love the Harry Potter world or Harry Potter the character? For me its the world, I want to explore that. If I wanted nice things for Harry he gets Ginny, his happily ever after and its all done before he's 20. DG is a pureblood, through her we can explore the wizarding world of Harry Potter. Some people take this to be some pureblood culture stuff which is often awful but it allows them to leave Hogwarts. We want to see more of the magical world.

An alternative use of her is to explore post war reconciliation. If Harry can move on with a pureblood then shouldn't everyone. Would people see him as a traitor? Potential conflict and therefore stories. What about if she's funny, beautiful, great at handling his fame, shame she's just a bigot. Can Harry reconcile his attraction to that, we have conflict and that's a story.

Another way she crops up is people think Harry is an idiot but don't want to write a Slytherin Harry. Slytherin is about cunning, about winning, about doing whatever it takes to come out on top. Harry does dumb shit because its the 'right' thing to do. People writing fix-it fics sometimes use her to make Harry's plans less bold and more planned.

She's an OC that can be almost anything you want but she's more legitimate than an oc to most people. Most people see OCs as shitty self inserts which really isn't helped by the number of people who make them as Draco/Harry's twin who is everyone's best friend and the cleverest person ever.

*** I think the fundamental reason is pretty simple. Daphne is a mostly-blank slate that can fulfill an otherwise empty role; she's a pretty pure-blood 'princess' who isn't evil. There's no one else like that to ship Harry with.

We know basically nothing about her or her family, other than that they're part of the sacred 28. That, combined with the fact that there was no mention of her or her parents supporting/sympathizing with Voldemort, means that she's the best canon compliant fit for the role.

*** Wow! Lemme help.

So, Daphne Greengrass is the elder sister of Astoria Greengrass(who marries Draco Malfoy). The house of Greengrass is one of the Sacred 28 houses(not emphasized much in books). And that's where canon finishes.

Let's go fanon. The most agreeable and cliched version of Daphne portrayed in fanfics is that of a beautiful blonde Slytherin girl, who is like an Ice Queen. That is, seniors and classmates are reluctant to approach her romantically because of her frosty persona. Now she is shown mostly as the heiress to her house, and usually wields political knowledge. This opens up possibilities of her as Harry's love interest to those of us fanfic lovers, who can't imagine Harry with Ginny, and are tired of him with Hermione.

It's interesting because Harry dates a Slytherin. Which is by far the highlight, as everyone is shocked by the Gryffindor pride to associate with a Slytherin. We as authors can develop her like an OC, which is helpful to our storyline.
