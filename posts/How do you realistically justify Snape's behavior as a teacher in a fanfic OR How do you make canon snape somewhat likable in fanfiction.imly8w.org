So there's a lot of people out there that love Snape and love redeeming him even more. But how exactly do you turn him into a good character without using some ridiculously lazy explanation like 'Snape's actually a very pleasant man, he just acts that way to fool Voldemort and the death eaters'?

Snape is a generally very unpleasant character. He's never clear on where his loyalties lie until the very end, he bullies and mistreats students. He's unfair and borderline malicious (trying to poison Neville's frog, trying to get Sirius kissed by dementors, being the reason for Lupin being fired, ...).

But at the same time we know he's on the good side. Fanfictions might change the narrative for why he's on the 'good side' and whether he's on said side willingly or not, but in canon we know he does work for Dumbledore and the order WILLINGLY. To get revenge for Lily's death, to atone for his part in getting her killed, to protect the last remaining part of Lily (her son), ...

Recently I reread 'a weapon revised' and I have to say it's one of the few fanfics in which I got to enjoy the character of Snape. Throughout the fanfic we see him evolve but still be what he is, at heart. a cynical, sarcastic and sometimes unpleasant individual. But he isn't a cartoon villain or evil teacher, he's got a pleasant side too. He's got a sense of humor, he's intelligent and competent, ... It's also a believable version of Snape. Though it is a bit hard to see canon Snape being like this.

IS it at all possible to redeem canon Snape? Or is fanfiction the only way to make said character a good person? In the same way that fanfiction is, for instance, the only way to make Bellatrix a likeable character.

P.S. Another big question is whether people like Snape because of positive fanfiction representations or they just like him in canon.


** You don't realistically justify all of Snape's behavior as a teacher, because it's not justifiable. Mocking the appearance of young teen girls with bad teeth, threatening to kill students' pets, and glowering at the kid who looks like his dead father are all indefensible.

What you do is acknowledge that human beings are complex and there is more to Snape than his bad behavior. For example, he had rough experiences as a child that explain (but don't justify) some of his bullying tendencies as an adult. And his actions are integral to the war's success. And he's sometimes very funny. And he's academically brilliant. And some students-- the ones who don't crumble under his mockery like Neville-- learn a lot from him because he knows a lot.

He can be "somewhat likable" while also being somewhat awful. In fact, I think that's exactly what he is in canon.

If you redeem him completely, he's no longer his canon self. In the best case scenario, he's an evolved or expanded version of his canon self. And that's fine; most fanfic is AU. But it is possible to give him a realistic journey to being kinder and more humane... just don't pretend that he was always flawless and nothing was ever his fault.

As to your PS, I like him better in canon than in positive fanfiction representations because I get irked by the easy excuses that "he was mean to children to trick Voldemort, he's really sweetness and light" or "he bears no responsibility for his own behavior because James."

*** I agree with you assessment and am of the firm opinion that it's a shame he loses this nuance in fanfic. The Changeling, by annerb, exemplifies an exceptionally well written Snape perfectly - he remained totally horrid and in character, without having any onscreen redemption whatsoever. In fact, that fic even interrogated how much of his redemption served his own ego and sense of superior self, without diminishing his good actions. That was an awesome addition to his character. He was sinister, clever, horrid and all his actions were ambiguous, especially his good ones. Snape in the Changeling was more in character and enjoyable to me, as someone who loved JKR's snape, than any “pro-snape” fic that rehabilitates him, to be honest.

Alsoooooo [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] wrote my favourite small missing scene fic on Snape. It confronts how Snape's request to Voldemort for Lily to be spared would have been framed. Which is to say, sinister. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20868359]]. I grieve that I didn't write it myself, it's genuinely so good. Changed how I saw his character permanently.

*** I think the only thing I would do you redeem him would be to make him stop bullying his students and not take points for the littlest reasons. And maybe more smiling or at least showing he is amused by something. Despite that, he should still be his sarcastic, a bit sadistic, snarky and clinical self.

** There's a few ways to go about it, and it depends on the characterization and goal towards him.

For instance, if it's in the background, I quite like the option of seeding in that he's a harsh teacher, but not completely unfair. Linkffn(Blood Crest) has one of my favorite examples there, where Harry opens up his potions text on the train and does a bit of studying - and where all the tough question Snape asks turn out to sbe (aconite being early alphabetically). A little detail like that can turn Snape's first day outburst into a teacher with a poor temper checking to see if students had even opened up the book to the first page, which is at least a bit more reasonable.

With that sort of characterization, I like the approach of Snape not wanting to be a teacher, but being forced into the role b/c of his dual spy role. So he's a potions prodigy, stuck teaching something he has no desire to do with kids he has no temper for, and who manage to mess everything up. That doesn't make him a 'good person' magically, but it does make him more relatable/understandable.

To flesh out his more pleasant side, I think that should come out more in conversations with other teachers. McGonagall in particular makes for a good foil there, with the two of them being more serious that Dumbledore and having to deal with his... eccentricities. Dumbledore too is good for conversations to showcase Snape when he's not in Teacher Mode. Others that can fit in interestingly are the Malfoys (particularly Draco and Narcissa). Lucius also provides an opportunity to have a nicer Snape still be in an adversarial role early, by having things be requested of him to do.

For having him turn more good, my preferred avenue is having him find out what the Dursleys were doing to Harry early on, when that would force him to change his opinion of him. That is (IMO) the best way of jolting Snape to not hating Harry early on, and from there setting up a more gradual evolution of his character. Laventadorn's "Never-Ending Road" has very nice characterization for that type of Snape, and is highly worth reading (it's my favorite characterization of Snape). linkffn(8615605) . Alternatively, a potions devoted - and competent - MC would seem a fitting way to force him to respect them more. That's the avenue taken in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense), and it's done well there too.

Snape's personality should still be acerbic, still be bitingly mean/sarcastic, cynical, etc. But I think that having him be a on the whole 'good' character - or at the least a complicated, grey one - is far more interesting way to take him, even in the background. And those aspects of his character are easy to make him be more lovable too - after all, a sarcastic cynic can be a lot of fun to read about ;)

Yeah, the eventual pairing in that one is a bit out there - but the entirety of the linked fic has none of that in it, and the sequel (as far as I've read in it) also didn't have the pairing in it at that point. So it's more of a future warning for the direction of the fic, I suppose

And it's just:

1) the massive age difference 2) without having read the fic Harriet will probably be an allost-clone of Lily, making it creepy and seem like he's living his fantasy through his obsession's offspring. Like Littlefinger from GoT. 3) The inappropriateness and immorality of engaging in a romantic relationship with a much younger, emotionally vulnerable, person that sees you as his/her saviour.

Harriet in this fic is a female take on Harry both in personality and looks. The one time romance is mentioned in the fic I believe Harriet has a sort of crush on her teacher. Snape is super pissed when he finds out (at least I think he finds out and stops talking to her, I don't remember the details) and is no way into her like that at the point in the fic where I stopped.

** To steal a line from Sondheim: nice is different than good. He can be a good (not evil) character while still being a cranky bastard. Within canon, I think it's perfectly reasonable to point out that Harry has a limited perspective, especially on the adults in his life. He hates Snape, so he sees everything Snape does through that lens. If you're writing from Snape's perspective, or from someone else's, there's no reason why we couldn't see other aspects of his character. And if you go beyond the books and have Snape survive the war, it's plausible that he could become a /slightly/ less bitter/unhappy person.

There's not much to like about him in canon, though, I agree. People like Alan Rickman or they like the challenge of humanizing villains and unlikable characters.

This isn't true at first. I don't think his "hatred" starts until at least 2nd term 1st year, more likely later. After the first lesson he's not happy with Snape, but that's because of Snape's own actions, which don't improve, leading Harry to hate him. If Snape had not been a bully, had he at least been neutral, i doubt Harry would have hated him at all...

We see Snape's actions clearly at first. While damning Lily made him run to Dumbledore, we don't ever see proof that Snape felt bad/repented for everything else he did as a death eater. He wanted Voldemort dead, so worked with Dumbledore. I still can not see why anyone considers him a "hero". That said, i believe we are all entitled to our own opinions.

** I mean, you seem to be asking four different questions here - How do you redeem Snape, how do you make him likeable, how do you make him good, and how do you justify his canon actions/behaviours.

Likeable is simple. Wit, Snark, Sympathy, and Sass. People like the guy already, so give him some quips, some badass moments, and some sympathetic reasons for what he does. That seems to be the basic recipe for likeability in fanfiction. People in this fandom will cinnamon-roll wizard Hitler and leather-pants Draco Malfoy, we're totes easy. :)

Justification and Redemption are rather more difficult.

Justification tends to revolve around the 'why' of actions. May seem obvious, but it's worth stating. So, you work backwards. Snape does a thing. Why does he do it? What's his reasoning? What's his logic?

Logic is how a character thinks and how they process information and make decisions. Snape tends to be very bitter and obsessive about past events, so everything he experiences tends to be filtered through those events and seen through a lens coloured by those experiences.

Reasoning tends to come in two categories: implicit and explicit. Explicit is the reasons you can tell, implicit is the reasons you can't. You can do things for reasons you don't even realise - that's a big part of certain types of therapy, uncovering unknown reasons for your behaviours and helping you find out those reasons for yourself.

So, you follow that through. Take a situation - Snape telling on Lupin and getting him fired - and work backwards. The situation was provoked by the events of the Shrieking Shack night, so you take that and filter it through Snape's logic (bitter and angry about his youth) and work from there. The implicit reasons that he doesn't really think about too much would likely be around self-hatred and bitterness, while the explicit reasons would likely be around Remus deserving it for nearly killing him or being a werewolf and Sirius being an unrepentant psychopath who also nearly killed him.

Redemption tends to revolve around reflection, growth, and acceptance. Identify where you fucked up, learn from that mistake, then move on and past it to a point that other people agree you're redeemed, basically. That tends to occur via people, via actions, or via experiences, and then either with a single event or over time, depending on the impetus the catalyst thing gives the change.

Generally, everyone has what we can shorthandedly call 'a worldview'. This is, as you could probably guess, the way they see the world. Villainous characters tend to have a worldview that, to them, justifies their actions. The Greater Good, we all want to watch the world burn, all that stuff. This is solidified to them due to their backstory, their experiences through life, and needs something strong to break it.

This could happen due to people. Usually, something happens to a person, or an interaction happens with someone the villainous character cares about. Since this is Snape, that's basically Lily and maybe Dumbledore. Something happens to Lily (she dies, obvs) and then Snape breaks from the Death Eater-y worldview and joins Dumbledore's side. This could also take the intervention-esque form from most American Sitcoms, some characters sit down with the character-in-need-of-redeeming and try convince them to change.

Actions is a mix of decisions and events. Basically, something happens to them or they do something to someone else. Vader is a pretty good example of this. His redemption comes when he sees Luke being tortured, turns on Palpatine, and then dies for his son. Equally, you could have Snape being instructed by Voldemort to torture a captured Harry, then have his breaking-point moment and turn to Harry's side to rescue him and get out of there. It's all about something happening that shows the character the effects of their actions and involves them making a single decision between their redemption and committing to their villainy, and the event gives them some reason to pick the redemption choice. Interestingly, Kylo Ren is also a great example of flipping this around completely. Where Vader was always the Lackey until he got his redemption, Ren took his master's spot and discarded his redemption event to fully commit to being the baddie.

And finally, Experiences. This tends to be the slow path, and often features in 'long term villain helps out the heroes' arcs in TV serials. So, it tends to be a long effort to fully realise the consequences of their actions and to atone for what they've done. For this, I'd say someone Snape betrayed comes along and Snape gets to know them and what happened, then really sees the impact of his spying and double-agentry and such.

Though, I'm sure there's probably way more things. Basically, redemption just needs a catalyst to make the character realise they fucked up, then some development to show them changing and everyone accepting that.

Making a character Good... that I can't really help with. Philosophers have been debating for centuries on what makes a good person, and I honestly find the good-bad evaluation thing to be a little pointless anyway. Most people aren't good or bad, they're just people, and identifying those that are good or bad doesn't really tell you anything useful about them. And I've been playing D&D and reading Sword and Sorcery fantasy novels for too long to see Good as anything but an Alignment value. :D

** This is a titanic task. Reedeeming him while not going OOC. You definitely need him to have a wake up call. There is no way otherwise. He is a grey character but you can't make him jump into the reedeemed bandwagon without he having some sort of epiphany. He needs to understand that he cannot atone for something and mess something else.

I think that if you want inspiration you can look at Jaime Lannister. A hell of a writing job. (Book not tv). He is not quite redeemed yet but he is in the right path at the end on AffC. Jaime did a good deed no one knows about (like Snape). Thinks he is above people and doesn't need to explain himself how good is actions are/were (like Snape). He is a prick and is mean though, pushed a kid out of the window (metaphorical window for Snape). Until Jaime doesn't understand that he has to deal with pushing Bran, he cannot get full atonement. Same for Snape. You need Snape to revaluate who he really is. A heck of a task.

Book Snape? You can't. He's petty and cruel and gives zero fucks about Harry or anyone else besides himself and his own self-pity. He's verbally and emotionally abusive. He picks on a child because his appearance resembles that of his father, constantly insulting that child by comparing him unfavourably to the father he'd never met... meanwhile Snape himself is the reason that father is dead and the child grew up an orphan in an abusive home.

Let me say that one more time: Snape habitually mocks, belittles and torments a preteen orphan while *being the reason the kid is an orphan in the first place.* There is literally no way to justify that.

Fuck Snape redemption arcs. He shouldn't be allowed within ten miles of any child let alone be employed in a school as a teacher.

(And yes, my opinion is harsh. He's still a prick though.)

You would have to toss canon completely out the window, INCLUDING the reason he switched sides, in order to make him not a waste of space imo.

There are several fics that I like which portray Snape as equally prepared to be on the winning side - light or dark. I think that's a cool perspective.

As to why I like Snape: I like YA fiction, I do. But Snape is a fully adult character with a complicated backstory BEFORE he walks into a fanfic. There's a lot to work with. He's complicated and messy and very difficult to Mary Sue.

** The only possible justification is that Snape is acting like a Death Eater teaching so that when Voldemort returns he can point at his fuckery and say, "See! I've always been loyal!" But then, a Death Eater that escaped justice and is now teaching should be not acting like a Death Eater.

** Recently I've watched a video essay that spoke about why the fans are so divided about Snape, to make it short the one from the movies is much less unpleasant than the one from the books and Books!Snape deliberately throws away the minor redemption moment he gets when he outright states that he is only protective of Harry because of Lily in DH.

Mostly it is a matter of presentation and rigging the other characters reactions, depending on how you show/interpret the same action it can have different effects. For example, was Snape cruelly bullying Neville during potions and consequently making him worse in potions or did he let his naturally winning personality get the better of him when he got frustrated by Neville's frequent falls at potions he (a prodigy) sees as extremely easy while keeping a much closer eye on him to prevent any lethal accident?

I think reading fanfictions (or even other fan-made content, like theories or essays) always colors our opinions in some way or another as it exposes us to the interpretations, ideas and alternative scenarios thought up by people who are as deep in the universe as us, plus all the responses that this content inspires others to post in more fanfics, theories, essays... I am not naturally an immersive reader, I read stories because I like them and find their content interesting, but I generally grow attached to the story instead of characters, so when I first read the books I didn't actually feel strongly one way or another about Snape -he was an interesting character who had his plot-twists and helped move the plot along- it was only when I got deep into fanfic that I stopped to consider that some of his actions really /were/ very messed up.

Today I personally am anti-Snape because I grew to see the way he gleefully sets on being a Jerk King to school children as pitiful and cruel to the point that I can't really see any realistic justification that would make it excusable.

** The thing with redeeming Snape, is it has to come from a place of atonement for his wrongs, not lust for his teen obsession. Snape as he is in cannon is too immature to find true redemption. In order to find redemption he has to atone for how he treated his students, both individually, and en-mass. He can continue to despise jame's potter's memory, so long as he dosen't take that contempt out upon harry. He can continue to remember his relationship with lily, as long as he focuses on his friendship, and not his obsession.

Snape can be redeemed. The books entirely missed the mark.

** Realistically? You don't. Snape is a brat who does good things. However if you really want to break character, get him to admit he was a bad person and have him slowly grow.

** He isn't able nor willing to teach 11 year olds how to stir a cauldron. He might be great at inventing new potions and teaching advanced students who know what they're doing, but he shouldn't teach basics.

** Many things were said here and while I agree with some I gotta say.. and this will bring hate... You can't redeem him.

He's a great soldier. He's an amazing fighter in a war but an awful teacher and person overall. While he has some nice traits I don't think you can redeem someone who won't want or do something to get it.

Besides what we get is Harry's interpretation so it's biased. We are biased to think he's a bad person because it's how Harry sees him.

** I feel linkffn(I know not and cannot know yet I live and I love) has a very good characterization of Snape. He's still mean to his students, but somehow Luna grew on him and he tried to be nicer. (he was still not a nice person) Idk I'm not good at summarizing it. It's the best one shot I've ever read. linkao3(problem of potions) has a pretty well written Snape I find? He's still not a nice person, everyone hates him except Harry, but that's just because he liked potions enough to put up with Snape.

** Make all the teachers just as horrible in different ways, or explain that the way Snape behaves is part of wizarding culture, or add context to suggest that what Harry tells us in canon is overexaggerated because he himself dislikes the man.

E: Please enlighten me as to why three suggestions were downvoted?
