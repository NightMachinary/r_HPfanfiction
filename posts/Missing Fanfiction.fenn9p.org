I recently wanted to read The Dark Lady, but it was deleted. Does anyone have a copy of it or knows where i can find one.

**** Hi, I used to be ynmidk. This is my new account, both on FFN and AO3. I am currently re-uploading A Different Perspective and Lavender Brown: Hogwarts Champion Extraordinaire. My other fics, like The Dark Lady, will come eventually, though there'll probably be a bit of a rewrite before I upload the chapters again.

In case you are curious about what happened to my old accounts, there's a short explanation on my new FFN profile page.

****** "Lillian Potter, the Girl-Who-Lived. For years she suffered in her uncle's home. Physically, mentally, sexually. Her pleas for rescue were left unheard and with that, the last flicker of light in her was snuffed out. For her, there was only one thing left to do: await the Dark Lords return."
