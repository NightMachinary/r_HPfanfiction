Not asking about Smut fics where he's got a Harem, or other nonsense that allows him to bang a dozen witches.

But ones where the Trio is Harry and two witches, they grow up together, fight crime together. They reach that hormonal age and maybe for a little while they don't want to share him but eventually they work it out.

And in Adulthood Harry looks alot like Aegon the Conqueror from G.O.T in this pic.

** You should try Remus Lupin, PI. I forgot the pairing, but it's Harry and two cannon girls, plus Luna Lovegood sometimes? There's no smut at all, but it's cute and a fun read.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

** "Rune Stone Path" is the best attempt at a believable polyamorous relationship I've read so far. Would have been better with one girl less in the mix (Daphne) but it has a nice Fleur/Tonks dynamic, the technical aspects of the story are good, the plot is original, Harry is not godlike and the girls/women are more than just arm-candy for Harry to collect.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

** Not MFF like you requested, but linkffn(The Sum Of Their Parts) has the Golden Trio is a polyamorous relationship (my interpretation, but it's never outright). Linkffn(Ruthless by AngelaStarCat) has Harry/Hermione/Theo Nott in a polyamorous relationship.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
