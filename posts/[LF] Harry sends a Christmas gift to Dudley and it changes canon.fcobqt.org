:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a specific fic that I can't seem to find. I only read the first few chapters but it starts with Harry wanting to send Christmas gifts to his friends and ends up sending Dudley a book (or pamphlet?) on the wizarding world. It also includes Harry, Ron, and Hermione planning on giving Hagrid and McGonagall joint Christmas gifts.


** I'm on my phone but I think this is the fic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9969014/1/Seasons-of-change]]

#+begin_quote
  An attempt to go against a popular trope. What if, instead of becoming dark/grey and gaining more power that way, Harry had been a little more considerate? Begins with a small change in first year, and sticks close to the original, but sometimes small changes can add up to change the world.
