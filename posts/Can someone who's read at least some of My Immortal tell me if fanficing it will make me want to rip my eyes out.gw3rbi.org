So I was super into HP fanfic 10ish years ago and somehow managed to completely miss the now infamous "My immortal". I have it in my head that it would be fun to read it chapter by chapter and try to rewrite it into something decent. (I have lost my job due to COVID and subsequently, my mind).

I haven't decided on all of the restrictions I'd place on myself but I do know that I'd write one chapter at a time without looking ahead. I'd also want to keep all of the symbolism and themes or the reverse - I'd keep the same plot, while completely restructuring everything else so the plot makes as much sense as it can??

I see that I'm not the first to do this (Is it too meta to /post/ fanfics about fanfics?) so sorry if this had been asked before, but obviously I can't go read it or look into it too deeply or that defeats the purpose. I'm also a completionist -- If I start this and have to drop it beacuse it's so terrible I will think about it for YEARS

Basically -- I've heard the plot of this fic is a wild ride. What kind of ride is it? I'm imagining it gained its popularity due to its absurdity and it's at least somewhat enjoyable to be around. I'm really looking for a challenge, but if it's just a million chapters of weird cult soulmate angst with nothing to work with, I prob will have to pass.


** Read it as though you're reading a parody. The author, I'm sure, wrote it this way deliberately, and is making fun of people in the fandom who write all the cliches without realising how bad their writing is. For me it was more of a laugh

** It's mostly popular because it's bad. I've read it (at least) six times and probably the hardest thing is even trying to figure out what the plot is. After the first few chapters the plot just kind of goes away. Characters get referred to by several different names that are all spelt differently. The subplots get dropped, characters vanish for no reason, it's just bad. If you are going to read it I recommend you get some friends and read it outloud with all the spelling mistakes. I only read it alone once and it sucks unless you can laugh about it. It's 44 fairly short chapters (~22,700 words).

** You should check out linkffn(12421257). The author of a really good surrealist/crack fic about MoD female Harry with a talking horcrux in her head wrote a crossover of her fic and My Immortal.

** Basically it's a masterpiece of what not to do. The characters are messed up, the setting is twisted so far from canon that it may as well be an original work rather than an HP fanfic. The plot is nonexistent or bad.

In short, there's no way of saving it. It's dead Jim.

** it is so fucking funny I quote it to this day. Read it. It is pink rock in the true sense of the termL bad on purpose but transcendent of its awfulness.

** It's certainly doable, but you'll have to completely rewrite the plot. There's so much character bashing that it goes beyond character bashing... and everyone is severely OOC. I never actually got to the end (had to stop after about chapter 9), but I'm sure the rest of the plot is equally screwed. It's a big commitment, trying to rewrite My Immortal, but if you're up to it, then by all means, I wish you luck!
