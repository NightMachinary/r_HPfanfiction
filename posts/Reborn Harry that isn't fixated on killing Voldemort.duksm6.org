Looking for a reborn harry stories that don't have him going back into his younger self's body just to fix things. Instead i was wondering if anyone knew of any stories where his main goal is pretty selfish. Pretty much a dark harry that is reborn instead of canon harry. Doesn't need to be a dark harry though as long as his goal is self serving.

I mean screwing over Voldemort is totally in Harry's self interest. The sooner he gets rid of Voldemort, the sooner he can do whatever he wants without that sadistic genocidal maniac after him.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545), he fucks over Voldemort real soon and effortlessly after returning to the past. But he doesn't stop here either, as he kills off every Death Eater and their families, while totally enjoying the process. Is he dark enough for your taste?

*** Thanks for the recommendation! Yah I agree killing Voldemort is definitely in Harry's own interest. I love reborn fics, they are one of my favorite tropes, that said you can only watch harry be reborn and go through the motions of killing Voldemort with future knowledge so many times before you start looking for something fresh.

  It all starts with Hogwarts' Class Reunion.

** linkao3(Triple Trouble by E4mj). We don't know what Harry's goal is, but it's definitely not destroying Voldemort. Probably not quite what you're looking for, but worth reading anyway. Dark Harry is sent back to his 11 year old self at the time of his first year at Hogwarts... but so are Voldemort and Grindelwald.

  Dumbledore would regret the decision to hand over the school letters to the house elves, even if it did save him hours in admin. Eleven year old Harry Potter was expected... Tom Riddle and Gellert Grindelwald... yeah, not so much. However that might turn out to be the least of the school's problems.

*** Dude this sounds super cool thanks for the recommendation! I remember reading something that sounds kinda similar except it was harry and Grindelwald reborn when Tom riddle was a kid and they all grew up in the same orphanage. I think it was a fem harry though...
