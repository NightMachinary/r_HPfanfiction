I've read too many stories that have Harry as some debonair gentleman.

Don't get me wrong, I love those stories, but I mean come on /he lived in a fucking cupboard for eleven years./

It doesn't need to be a story that goes through the abuse in gritty detail or anything. Just have some scenes that make it obvious that someone who wasn't stunted wouldn't act that way?

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

** Edit:EWW NO! New link.

This one is okay. Features a severely abused Harry who is rescued and goes to live permanently with the Weasleys. He works through major trust issues and a speech impediment with the help of the Weasleys. In particular, Arthur is top in this fic. Focuses on the recovery much more than the abuse, to its credit. Probably the best abuse/recovery fic I've read, besides maybe Yellow Submarine (which is about Ginny's abuse at the hands of death eaters). 3/5.

*** I agree about Saving Harry. So well written, really captures the cruelty, horror and pain of child abuse. Got me closer to tears than any other fanfic ever did. But it's hopeful, adorable and heartening at the same time, and I still hold hope for a sequal.

About Yellow Submarine: WARNING! DO NOT READ IF YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE ME AND DON'T LIKE BAD THINGS: [[/spoiler][I read the first chapter and it messed me up so badly. Seriously. The idea of it alone makes me nauseous and makes me feel all /wrong/ inside, even now, a month or so later. I can't, won't stand it, and I'll never read it fully, or even click a link to it ever again. It's too fucked up. Way, way, /way/ too fucked up.]]

Sorry, I really needed to get that off my chest.

******** Like it or not, rape happens in the real world. Calling it abhorrent doesn't make it go away. Sometimes literature takes you places where you aren't comfortable, and that's a positive thing, because it gives you a different point of view and really makes you think about something you might have otherwise overlooked or avoided.

Had you continued reading you would have joined Ginny in her struggle with first surviving, then coping, then accepting and finally embracing the love of her family and a kindred spirit who had been hurt too.

You missed out on that beautiful story of Ginny's growth from a victim to a strong young woman because you want to spare your precious feelings. Not me though. I'll take brutal truths over comforting lies any day.

********* You know, I do agree with the point you make. Rape happens and it won't go away. What, with all the news about India and its problems with rape and the public opinion on it for example. I know it exists, and I know it's horrible.

But in the end I'm here for entertainment. I do often read literature to broaden my horizons and get new perspectives, yes, and logically and rationally speaking, I should read this story as well for the sake of my own consistency, and for the sake of not missing out on apparently one of the better fanfics out there.

I guess my "precious feelings" as you so charmingly put it are indeed precious. I don't want to read this right now. Maybe in the future I'll change my mind, maybe I won't. And that's fine. If you think I'm wrong about this, that's fine too.

However, someday, if I'm in the right state of mind, I might want to see what this poor girl went through and how she came out of it stronger than before."

On the other hand, it's irrational and closed mined to say "I'd never even consider reading that because I want to hide from this bad thing that happens because it will never happen to me."

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** I haven't really seen this either, which is unfortunate. There's quite a lot of potential there. I'm writing a fic that does use this, though. Harry is sorted into Slytherin and because of his lack of social skills he doesn't recognize that the other students are just sucking up to him because of who he is. It becomes a catalyst for further changes when he finally realizes he hasn't actually made any real friends.
