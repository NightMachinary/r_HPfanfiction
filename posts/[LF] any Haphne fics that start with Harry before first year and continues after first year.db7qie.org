Title says everything

100k words +

Haphne

No slash with mc

That's all. Thanks!


** linkffn(12740667) : Very well written, expands on some existing tropes and also comes up with original stuff and is also still being updated.

linkffn(12484195) : Just a decently written OP Haphne story. This is the rewrite of the original (which is the one I read) so it could also be more than that.

linkffn(6289435) : Well written and has some original concepts. Although the ending is confusing. It does also start in 2nd year.

EDIT: Just wanted to say that you could also just search for previous Haphne recommendation threads to find a lot more good stories.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!

  Souls don't always live just once. They can return, typically in a time of crisis, if they are deemed worthy. This is about two such souls. Separated by houses. Will they find each other again? Will they even know? One Gryffindor, one Slytherin.
