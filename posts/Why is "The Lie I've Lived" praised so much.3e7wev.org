I've frequently heard it being called one of the best HP fanfics out there, but I seriously can't make it past the first few chapters. I can overlook the grammar, spelling and punctuation mistakes, but some of the characterisation is, in my view, really bad. The Sorting Hat, for example, I've seen called "hilarious", but I just can't take it seriously at all. All of its dialogue feels like it was written by a twelve year old who has just discovered swearing.

Does the fic get better? Am I missing the point? Is it just one of those fics that is a product of its time and doesn't age well? Am I not giving it credit it deserves?


** I guess it's just not your thing, which is fine, but I don't think it's a bad story. It's got lots of action, a badass Harry which is always fun to read, and an awesome reimagining of the Triwizard Tournament. I'd honestly pick entertainment value over accurate characterization every time.

And the hat is funny precisely because you wouldn't expect a revered ancient artifact to swear like a sailor.

** Are there many spelling, grammar, and punctuation mistakes? It's been a while since I read it but I don't recall many and JBern is usually rather accurate.

Granted I've read so much ff that my brain is trained to ignore poor writing to the point where it needs to be exceptionally bad to bother me. With the exception of over use of commas. That drives me up the wall.

** One of the reasons I really love it is the duelling style. We often see Harry who is just a 'battle-tank' and just rushes in blasting spells. It's not that often we see a good representation of Harry who is really good at Transfiguration and properly uses it in a duel.

** I've always thought of this fic as a sort of cracky take on the triwizard tournament, so I can overlook the characterization problems and stuff like that in lieu of the overtop action. Seriously, the duels in this fic are amazing, especially the ones which use transfiguration.

** The Lie I've Lived is a perfect example of how different an author can make a story. There is no POINT in fanfiction friend. Its merely there for entertainment. The sorting hat is funny because he doesnt give a damn if Harry (for not wanting to spoil the plot for anyone who hasnt read it) dies or not. He only cares about what he is getting out of it. It also shows how Harry would react if certain conditions were met. The story, its not perfect. But its so praised because it is one of the few works that can be enjoyed, is complete, has minimal errors /the author improves/ and its a good story. Look past the fact that its fanfiction and just use the images of the characters. Let the author build the world.

** I read it and had a similar experience as you. It really doesn't get better, and I think it just caters to another audience in general. I find that this happens to me a lot in this sub: something is very highly recommended, but when I start reading it, it's just absolutely terrible and the things that were pointed out as good are the very parts I can't stand.

** If I recall correctly, when it was written, God-like Harry wasn't the trope it is today. When I first read it, it felt just really shockingly unexpected, edgy, and original. Now everything in that fic has been done better by other authors, in multiple fics. So it could be partially a victim of its own success. It's still one of the extremely few readable first-person fics, though. So people who prefer first-person will still cling to it. Also, it does still give it that little bit of freshness that a fic needs to be considered a classic.

** This is how I feel about Methods of Rationality or whatever it's called. (It's long winded shite that makes one rout for the main character to die a most horrible, violent death. IMHO).

One is just going to have to sift through the stories to the ones who speak to you. Most praise for stories you find lackluster will always leave you questioning.

When this post is eventually downvoted into negative numbers you guys will have been proving my point.

The grammar, spelling, and punctuation are a lot better than average across all HP fan fiction and roughly average for what's recommended here. Given that the fic is in the first person, punctuation rules become slightly looser -- commas to indicate pauses, omitting punctuation to indicate something's thought very quickly and perhaps slightly jumbled. There are still some mistakes -- more than I typically make -- but not that many.

Anyway, its main advantages are in its Triwizard Tournament tasks and solutions, and in powering up Harry without making it quite as much of a roflstomp as it might have been. It also avoids bashing the most commonly bashed characters. If you're choosing between yet another Robst-style supersmash, for instance, and The Lie I've Lived, there's no comparison.

*** It's been a while since I started to read it, but I seem to remember it being pretty poor on the grammar front. Maybe I'm thinking of another story. I might give it another go, but I remember the being really put off by the Sorting Hat being so obnoxious. Does it get less so later in the story or is that just the way it's characterised?

** This is the one where the Sorting Hat keeps calling Harry, HJ right? Fuck, that was so annoying to read. Such an uncomfortable pronunciation. One of those things that just really bothered me.

I remember reading it, enjoying it, favouriting it, but I don't think it would hold up to a reread at all.
