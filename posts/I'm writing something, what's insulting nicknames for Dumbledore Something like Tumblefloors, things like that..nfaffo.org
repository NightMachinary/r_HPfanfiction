  ‚ÄúMy own brother, Aberforth, was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat. It was all over the papers, but did Aberforth hide? No, he did not! He held his head high and went about his business as usual! Of course, I'm not entirely sure he can read, so that may not have been bravery. ...‚Äù

Given how insulting Dumbledore is to his brother behind his back, this insult would /burn/.

** Deliberately calling him other wizard names (Malicious Misnaming)

Usual dodding Dumbledore - Gandalf Evil Dumbledore - Saruman Been thrown in mud or surrounded by plants/animals - Radagast (All Lotr)

Berating him for thinking hes all knowing/all powerful - you're not bloody Merlin!

Manipulative Dumbledore - Prospero (from Shakespeare)
