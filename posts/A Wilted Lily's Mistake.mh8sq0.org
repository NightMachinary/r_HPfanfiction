In a dimension parallel to one we all know and love, the Dark Lord spared Lily that night. However, James and Harry, her husband and son, were killed.

Despite Severus Snape's joy at Lily being spared, it quickly turned to horror when, after uncovering the truth, an unconsolable Lily tortured the bastard and then killed him.

With nothing else to lose, Lily... well...

Frankly put, Lily went utterly insane, went full on Dark Witch, used her emotional agony and pain as strength (which actually horrified Dumbledore, as she twisted love as its core), and essentially became something /worse/ than Voldemort.

However, due to a certain Prophecy, the "Dark Lord" still lives, albeit in a permanently agonized limbo on the mortal plain, much to her constant amusement and satisfaction.

Lily still wants her son. However, despite what she's done and what she's become, she's not going to do something that'd cause harm to her, him, or James. There's still a spark of the kind, virtuous woman still remaining, deep inside of her.

Or, rather /other/ versions of them.

Possible routes:

- Harry from canon or a near-canon world is summoned --his family is dead, after all-- and he's utterly horrified, not to mention the trauma of being ripped away from his friends
- Unfortunately, the darkness in Lily's soul/mind affected the ritual she was finishing: the Harry from the reality she took him from turns out to be just as cruel, evil, and horrific as her or Voldemort and her combined: /Morgoth/ levels of evil, not Sauron. She's utterly horrified at seeing what a son of hers became...
- Seeing her world in ruins, she travels to a world that fits the criteria --a Harry having no Lily or James-- for a "fresh start": unfortunately, while she has tried to leave evil behind, evil hasn't left her...
- She hops from world to world, helping out various Harrys from the background, either revealing or never revealing her presence, like a dark guardian angel or fairy godmother type shtick. When she accidentally arrives in a world where he has his family, she's very tempted to take that Lily's place by taking either her body, memories, or both...
- She creates a horcrux and flings it across realities: like a magnet, the rest of her is dragged along for the ride. On arriving at a suitable world, the disembodied Lily, neither ghost nor living at this point, seeks to find a suitable woman she can Grand Theft Me, basically...


** Lily could become sort of the joker of her world where even bellatrix would fear her name ...

well untill she learns about parallel worlds .Imagine this lily traveling through different worlds and one of them being manipulative dumbledore or neglect harry trope ..or where she married snape!!

Lily throwing and losing a sanity check, delving into stuff even Tom Riddle avoided in his early years (compared to his later years, when he embraced being Voldemort) straight off the bat? Or disregarding the prices that he was careful in mitigating by doing it slow and steady? I could see it, to be honest.

However, the prices Lily would have to pay... ouch.

***** Therefore, it's quite impossible for Lily to beat Voldemort with raw power, and fics that go this route are not really more credible than those Indy!Harrys with ridiculous power progression.

And it's not raw combat power that's everything either, because even Voldemort's body can not survive a killing curse hitting his back. Others without soul anchors will just die.

To make Lily into a worse threat than Voldemort, it has to be decades long process, then there's time to build up her power and influence. And don't ever assume that a worse threat means more evil! In fact, the worst dark lords in real world all had many virtues, were charismatic and persuasive, and championed a cause that many followed.

This dark Lily might not be able to outduel Voldemort in a straight fight, but she would have other strengths that eventually killed off both Voldemort and Dumbledore. There are many good options how this could be done without powerwanking her.

for our dimension hoping Lily to surpass voldi , here grief , pain , hatred could do the same -activate a base sharingan , no secret lineage of merlin or slytherin is needed

******** In Divided and Entwined Hermione herself states that they need to do something about the laws and that they're eerily similar to the laws Jews were subjected to in WW2 before they straight up got sent to concentration camps. These laws aren't there in Lily's time and there's no indication that they will be published - If anything, there would probably be a more positive attitude towards Muggleborns in the general public during Lily's time because of the opposition against Voldemort. There wouldn't be a successful movement like Hermione's one without the right(or wrong, technically) political atmosphere. And I'm quite certain Walburga died after 1981 - Voldemort could easily pressure her into disinheriting Sirius if she isn't already willing to do so, and that's if he doesn't target Sirius himself.

*** Yeah, I read it: the Snape worship in it was a bit off-putting, to be honest. I mean, I understood why -- he was her friend and his death occurred before the fallout they had in canon could occur -- and I could see the parallel to Snape's canonical obsession with Lily, but... eeeeeh. It was disturbing, but for the wrong reasons the author intended.

...I kinda want to see a riff on this now where James moved on, had "Harry" with someone else, and come his Hogwarts years Lily/"Professor Evans" finds herself looking on Harry with a bittersweet attitude. She'd have the reverse of Snape's situation where she couldn't stand to look into Harry's eyes (given they're his mother's) but not his face (given he looks like a mini-James).

Man, the angst would be delicious -- especially if James and her still see each other on occasion at various events.

  Up at the teacher's table, professor Quirrell was talking to a teacher with dirty red hair hanging around her sickly pale face like a curtain. Looking past Quirrell, two poison-green eyes, devoid of any warmth or empathy, found Harry's own brown ones, and he felt a sharp pain on his scar.“Who's that teacher talking to professor Quirrell?”“Oh, you know professor Quirrell already do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's professor Evans, the potions mistress. Don't get on her bad side, the old hag hates students.“Harry looked again, but the teacher was no longer looking at him. Still, Harry could not escape the nagging feeling, which he had gotten just from a glimpse of her eyes and the cruel twist of her lips, that professor Evans did not like him very much.

** It's a very interesting plot and pretty well shows what would happen if Lily burst. I'm not sure if that is what the canon describes, but many people think that when she was angry she was really scary, now imagine her taking advantage of it and becoming more powerful as a result. Definitely Voldemort, he wouldn't have had a chance to kill Harry, as they say love is warm but just as cruel. If Lily had taken advantage of this and hated Riddle with all her heart for killing her baby, Tom's chances were really bad in his eyes.

I think it would be the most interesting to see a Canon! Harry is dealing with this situation. Would he join Lily and find his way home at the same time, or would he rather join the Order of the Phoenix in a desperate attempt to stop his mother, and then /a Force that the Dark Lord doesn't know/ would have a whole new concept. Harry could convince Lily that what he was doing was wrong and take her with him into his universe, but if he joined the Order at least for me, the unknown /Force/ would be purely symbolic. Harry wants to lay down his life trying to help his "mother" regain sanity. We don't know if he would have succeeded. His best chance was to stay with Lily.

You can weave some interesting things into it, like individual chapters from the perspective of Severus, or maybe a single person of the Order or her own followers.

Honestly, it all depends on you, but this is one of the most interesting story sketches I've read in a long time and I'd love to see it when you publish it, so I'd like to ask if you do, link to it.

** Maybe crossover with star wars and Lily accidentally gaining the dark side of the force, instinctually learning the various methods of using it.

Maybe include a dimensionally travelling Harry instead, with both of them emotionally scarred and broken, supporting each other and recovering. It can be very touching but please no incest. If romance is needed take an alternate universe where Harry and Hermione married but Harry and her child were killed by some ancient dark lord.

And then Hermione, in a John Wick Style kills the dark lord with common spells. The dimensionally travelling Harry can be a pert of the sequel where they recover from trauma from their respective worlds. Just for drama, maybe include Harry coming from a screwed up fanfic world with a bashing trope thrown left and right, but the Harry is his canonical self. No Lord Potter type please.
