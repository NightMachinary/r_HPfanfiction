Not in the sense of "dueling time-travelers" - someone from his age group that wasn't close to him last time around (i.e. not Hermione, Neville, Luna, or any Weasley) goes back as well. It could be someone that was just an acquaintance (a fellow Gryffindor or somebody from the DA) or even somebody he never interacted with at all (like the ever-popular Daphne Greengrass).

Both time-travelers want Voldemort stopped, though not necessarily for the same reasons. Neither one planned this trip, and neither is initially aware of the other being sent back. Once they do notice, they naturally start to drift together; being much older than their classmates, holding dangerous secrets, and having seen the horrors of war sets them apart from everybody else. Eventually they become friends, and perhaps more.


** It would be really interesting if the ones going back are Harry and Colin.

***** I agree. I haven't really been able to find a lot of fanfictions with a decent Colin character. All of the ones I've read either have him as an exaggerated version of his canon "fanboy" persona or don't include him at all other than a passing mention. Which is a shame, especially considering the way he died during the final battle shows he could have had great character development even in canon.

****** The fact that Harry saw Colin's dead body would fill him with guilt and it would be a good subplot where Colin and Harry talk about it.

Yeah it is shame he is often looked over in fiction.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here][I'm Still Here]] - Voldemort wins. Harry goes back. Discovers that Draco Malfoy went back too. They team up. Sort of. Abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13025350/1/][From Ruin]] - Inspired from I'm Still Here. Some things are different, a lot of the plot points are the same. In Progress, Last updated Jan 28th.
