Some Dark Harry fanfiction with these requirements:

-He actually has a teacher or books. No "Voldemort's Memories" bullshit.

-He actually uses the potter money. Just... no Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Merlin-LeFay

-He doesn't become insta op. No "I can kill Dumbles in one shot"

-Over 70k words

**** Yeah 40 odd threads is probably why you got down voted to start with. And that's just me searching for 'dark Harry' and skimming titles and threads. There is no doubt other threads called things like 'evil Harry' or 'dark other character' etc etc.

*** Damn it, I've been spamming *Emperor* recommendations during the last 6 months. I need to cut back.

Ok, I have a new favorite 'dark Harry' fic called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw]], linkffn(11574569). On surface, I should hate it because it contains quite a few tropes:

Wrong Boy-Who-Lived, bad James and Lily

Evil Dumbledore

Lords and Ladies, Most Ancient and Noble Houses

Harem

Betrothal Contracts

Over mature 10 years old

Daphne Greengrass as the Ice Princess of Slytherin

(Almost) pureblood Hermione

Super Luna

Magic Core

Quantifiable Magic

Incredible Magical Trunks

--------------

But that story is such a fun to read!

That Harry is definitely dark and he's dragging his harem along for the ride. The latest two chapters are called 'Necromancy for Fun and Fun, Part 1 and 2'.
