Is there a list of fanfiction like the naruto fanfiction edition by [[/u/ggrey7][u/ggrey7]] ?

it doesn't have to be exactly like that, even a list of high quality fanfiction of all/some genres would be wonderful

link: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cn-yJ4dalKUXpbQ4XMlmIFOOLkKAGaNTWEBy5T5-0QA/edit]]


** There is also a list of [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/edit#gid=0][100 Most Recommended Fics on this Sub]].

I would say it's overall a very good list.

*** This list has the following characteristics:

- Adventure over romance. The highest ranked romance centric fic, "Grow Young With Me", comes in at #36.
- Canon pairings and canon compliant fics are not favored. Disregarding "Seventh Horcrux", the highest ranked fic with canon pairings is "The Dark Lord Never Died" at #18. The highest canon compliant fic is "Cauterize" at #39.
- Ruthless protagonists who compile a large body count is preferred.
- The author of that list also has breakdown for individual years. "A Black Comedy" and "Delenda Est" always made it among top ten.
- I don't think there is a single Dramione or Drarry fic on that list.

**** Yeah, honestly that list is a mixed bag of classics and average to slightly above average fics which happen to be very popular because they focus on popular themes and elements. Like DLP, I tried using it to find enjoyable stories I hadn't read and gave up because it didn't match my tastes well.

My advice would be to seek out multiple sources. There's an entire world of canon-compliant fiction that focuses on events before the books, after the final battle, or during the books from the perspective of other characters. Some of it is truly excellent, masterful storytelling that fills in gaps while keeping true to the spirit of the original series.

Definitely consider fanfiction that is not Harry centric. As a rule these stories reach significantly smaller audiences but I find they also tend to be slightly better in quality on average. And explore FF.net's C2 feature to find curated lists which meet your personal tastes.

******* Same for Draco/Hermione. It is easy to write a plausible story with that ship as long as you make him question his father in CoS. He has the evidence that pureblood supremacy is bullshit right in front of him at Hogwarts (Hermione outscoring all purebloods) and he only needs to start thinking. I can come up with an outline for that plot in a minute:

First CoS message as catalyst; Draco starts thinking and then questioning his father. friends to lovers, still keep the Weasley/Malfoy rivalry and romance start fourth year/at the Yule Ball if you want to go for shocking reveal. Throw in a supportive Narcissa for the fun and some Harry/Draco reconciliation (just a misunderstanding, Bro) and you are set for

****** By proper character growth arc you mean drooling and needing adult diapers after receiving the dementor's kiss right?

Draco in Leather Pants needs to die as a fanfic trope. There is nothing worthwhile about his character as presented in the books. That he survived the war and is able to show himself in polite society rather than having been executed like the quasi-Nazi puke that he was is one of the least noteworthy aspects of the Epilogue.

******* I think you're falling into the pit of '/I don't like this character and no one else should, either/'. Judging by your short paragraph, it's insanely obvious you detest him for the principle of surviving. Comparing him to the Nazi's is just downright wrong.

Kids are cruel and often replicate their peers. Do you really think Draco will go against his father, someone most boys idolise, for someone like Harry Potter or Albus Dumbledore? By the time everything set in, he was already afraid that he and his family would be killed. If some crazed psychopath put a gun to your parent's heads and told you to kill some old man that you really didn't like, would you do it to save your family?

As the years went on, it probably got harder and harder to sympathise with anyone else besides his father because he was an obvious daddy's boy.

Back to my '/kids are cruel/' statement. A lot of children are often aggressive or display open animosity, some are just downright cruel. I used to know a boy that would make people cry in school daily and soon enough he grew up and realised that he was an issue. Sure, he did it in his twenties, but no one, even those he bullied, wished he was dead or claim they wish he was a mental patient.

As for Draco, we see the story from Harry's person. Not his. How do we not know he was constantly crumbling inside? I mean, he was obviously rich and spoilt and used to getting what he wanted. Someone he probably idolised, like everyone else, turned down his friendship over a Weasley, of all people.

I think the issue people have with Draco is that they take what Harry sees as a fact.

We all have characters we dislike, and we're entitled to that, but do calm down.

- He joined a racially motivated terrorist group whose "official" goal was ethnic cleansings, which he supported since he was twelve.

- He committed treason, took part in a civil war and broke the Geneva convention whilst doing so.

- He assisted in several counts of murder and attempted murder.

- He used Unforgivables (on Katie Bell), which as the name says are unforgivable and earn you a lifetime stay in Azkaban.

- At some point, namely as he had to do wet work, he realised that he had chosen the wrong side, just like many in the Waffen-SS and Hitler-Jugend.

- He takes pleasure from the suffering of others (Buckbeak's trial)

As a German that sounds pretty Nazi-like to me

********* So. Did. Snape.

Yet he was given what many consider a redemption arc in canon, even though it felt kinda shoved in there. He's canonically one of the Good Guys™ because of it and some people just can't be swayed otherwise, no matter the kind of shit he pulled. If he can get a /canon/ redemption arc that doesn't even start until he's like 20 and begs for help, then why does Draco have to have his start at the age of not even in puberty?

Snape wasn't even born into blood supremacy ideals, Draco was, and I imagine it's harder to grow away from the ideals you're raised with than to turn away from those you've adopted, just going by what I see with US political views.

Did i say it would be easy? Nah. Many stories that try give it like one chapter of 'oops I was wrong love me now' and that's shit. Make it a process, a journey, a struggle. Make him work for it, make people doubt him. Earn it.

************ I wouldn't call Snapes story a redemption arc. Everything he did was in the name of selfishness. Everything he did for the Order was because of his guilt and role in Lily's demise. Even as an adult he wasn't capable to distinguish between Harry and James, showing favoritism to his house and being an ass in general ("I see no difference." in regards to Hermione's growing teeth). Heck in his last moments he begged to look into Harry's eyes because they reminded him of Lily's and not because he somehow regretted his treatment of him.

Which I don't buy (if you can't tell). But the way it's written in canon definitely /feels/ like it was an attempted redemption of his character, at least to me, regardless of success.

************* Like I said to the other person, I *don't* disagree. But people need to consider what other people look at the canon storyline involving Snape to be, and that is his awful character suddenly being seen as a good guy because of -reasons- for his actions, even though those reasons should not and do not excuse them. People still see his character as being redeemed, as being good, as whatever. But a population of those same people will continue to villainize someone who is still, in the context of the conversation, a teenager with room to grow and change, who had a different upbringing where they legitimately believed what they were taught to be right.

Basically, people interpret the Snape storyline to be redemption, so for the sake of discussion, it's being referred to as that, because it's relevant to the discussion about Draco. If Snape can get one in canon, regardless of right or wrong or interpretation, and have children named after him because -good-, then why can't Draco have a /proper/ redemption? Why is his character just tossed off into a waste pile as not worth the time?

***** Published novels vary widely in quality. Bad writing isn't a bar to getting professionally published. If you want to compare HPMOR to /good/ works of fiction, you're going to need to demonstrate what its merits are, and even then, your criteria will be open to debate.

Plenty of fanfics are just as "technically well written" as HPMOR, but technical expertise alone does not a good story make. I know enough technically adept writers to say I'm not bowled over by Yudkowsky's grammatical competence. He's not a paragon unmatched by other fanfic writers.

Someone defended this fic not too long ago by dragging Tolstoy into it, as if mentioning Yudkowsky in the same breath would somehow establish that HPMOR was comparable to Anna Karenina. It's the same sort of smugness that oozes from every pore of Methods of Rationality and makes it unreadable, at least to me.

I'm not particularly fond of most of the fics recommended by this sub, but long, long before I even knew this place existed, I was pointed to HPMOR by a fellow fan. I went into it without preconceptions, and I barely made it through three chapters, and only got that far because I felt I owed it to my friend to give it a fair shot. It was laughably OOC, the dialogue was poor, the character interactions were stilted and implausible, and the emerging agenda - to deconstruct a magical canon built on whimsy - felt both contemptuous and akin to using a bludgeon to smash a butterfly, i.e, entirely missing the point of butterflies. Worst of all was the creeping arrogance.

Personally, I like JKR's Harry. I found Yudkowsky's Harry insufferable and the author himself far too present in the narrative. I didn't see whatever it is you saw that convinced you of its undeniable quality.

I don't know what the "gold standard" of Potter fic is and I don't care. The fandom's too large and the myriad strains of fic too varied to boil down into a single claim of authority, a single genre, a single taste. But HPMOR would never make my list of fics possessing arguable artistic merit.

*** I do not consider having the main character reciting monologues of the author's beliefs to be good writing, particularly when the other characters do not respond realistically.

I am not a writer, I did try to read it, but I just could not deal with the issues I mentioned above. Additionally, I was that extremely gifted smartass kid who corrected teachers (and certainly not /less/ diplomatically than Harry in HPMOR), and the way Harry's teachers respond to him in HPMOR is just so off that it pulls me right out of the fic.

I actually do know a lot of people irl who've read and loved HPMOR (usually intelligent people who either were never such smartasses to realize that it usually goes over like a lead balloon, or ones who are essentially reading a fantasy of how their intelligence ought to have been received), but they're STEM nerds who appreciate the author's philosophy, not really people who are serious readers.

**** I don't frequent this sub, so maybe my opinion here can help. I found HPMOR via TvTropes and had no warning about its content, only that it was structurally and story-wise going to be worth my while. This warning holds true.

I loved it. I was able to stick around for the first few chapters because I was interested in the premise slightly more than the early execution. It definitely grows into its own piece of work and delivers what I look for in great fics: a new experience. The story left me guessing and I was able to learn something new every now and then. If I recall correctly, the lower emotional awareness of Harry as a protagonist is off-putting and definitely doesn't go away before it's due to. To be fair, the Philosopher's Stone's early chapters are tough to get through as well. I suggest giving it a second try, especially since it's been finished since the last time you read it.

  “You turned into a cat! A SMALL cat! You violated Conservation of Energy! That's not just an arbitrary rule, it's implied by the form of the quantum Hamiltonian! Rejecting it destroys unitarity and then you get FTL signalling!”

This is something Harry said. Harry is 11 years old in this fic. An 11 year old boy said this. An 11 year old boy that is apparently based off of the author's knowledge as an 18 year old. If that isn't proof that the author is trying to make himself feel smart, then I don't know what is.

  Lots of little things, like word choice, sentence arrangement, writing out scenes instead of summarizing them, maintaining consistent characterizations, stuff like that.

He has Black Comedy as #1, which is cool in my book.
