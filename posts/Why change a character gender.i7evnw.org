After seeing a Prompt of this sub ("*Boy-Who-Lived meets Girl-That-Traveled* "), I decided to look for some Harry/ Fem Riddle fics, to see what had been done with this ship, and I noticed something puzzling. Outside of some very well known fics such as "Departure from the Diary" or "Limpieza de Sangre", a majority of the Harry/Female Riddle fics seem to also have a Female Harry.

It makes me wonder for what reason some author change the gender of their characters? Before seing this, I would have thought that it was to avoid writing Slash, but now I guess there must be some other reasons and I'm really curious to hear them.

​

PS: While I am at it, I also want to take advantage of this post to share the most amazing name I ever saw for a Female Riddle : Thomasina.


** Very early on in my fanfiction career I knew I wanted to write something that explored Voldemort in relation to the kid repeatedly sent to London during WW2. I penned the only existing chapter of Tenebrae Vincunt and ran into a wall.

But, I knew it was something I wanted to do. I stepped away from TV and stewed on it. After a few years I did some research into orphans in the 20s-30s in Britain and found some...interesting...information.

So it put me more into the psyche of the character but all of the info I found gave me way more interesting plot options if the character in question wee female.

Which was annoying because I wanted to write something about Voldemort! It took like three months and more trying to plot TV before I finally said “fuck it, just make Voldemort female” and Emily Mary Riddle was born.

My beta at the time told me it was dumb and no one would read it and would Daphne be in it?

It wasn't until like chapter 20 that [[/u/rpeh]] showed up and complained that Emily took a shower in the 50s and apparently all British people are the Wicked Witch if the West when it comes to running water that I made him edit it and actually had someone with a brain to bounce more ideas off of.

I tried to do too much at the beginning and it didn't work like I hoped but no one could articulate my concerns until him. So mostly that's why the second half improves.

But to answer the question of the thread. Why did I do it? Because I felt the plot if the story I wanted to write worked better if Voldemort was female.

And it worked really. There's an old Card quote where Ender Wiggin remarks that it's impossible to understand someone as they understand themselves and not love them and there's some of that in lds. Emily is a bit of a tragic ...anti-hero...and I needed the audience to love her for that to work. And honestly the average fanfic audience is fairly easy to manipulate.

But it boils down to I felt the themes I wanted to explore worked better with a female antagonist.

** A point I see missed here is Harry is a reader lense character, we learn of the world through his eyes. He often stands in for receiving exposition for the reader. He is an Everyman who asks the questions a reader would ask.

I believe this is why we have so many "Harry calls out characters" or "Harry goes his own path" fics. Many readers read the books and say "I wouldn't have followed Dumbledore plan" and then want to see their lense try it that way.

While nothing says females can't identify with a male readers lense, but it can prompt some exploration.

Particularly if the answer to the thought "well I would have done things differently" is "As a girl you would not have been treated the same as Harry, so of course you would approach the problem differently"

(Eg, if part of the fic is exploring how certain concepts are less or more acceptable, either in universe or as readers, if the target is female vs male. Abuse (particularly physical), child soldiers, expected mayterdom, or even something as light as schoolyard romantic conflict)

Because it is an interesting what-if scenario, which sadly is often overloaded with stereotypes (FemHarry is pretty much always very feminine rather than tomboyish).

There are a few variations of this, ranging from "always a different gender" across "involuntary change" to "transsexual", although personally I am most interested in the involuntary category since that is most relatable as a guy since it usually does not go too deep into female cliches. It also avoids the need to read the early Hogwarts years again.

Funnily enough, I am only interested if FemHarry is still into women. After all, your divergence is "Harry is a girl", not "FemHarry is into guys". FemHarry femslash or I'm out.

*** I'm going to take a stab at this, and reply to your post at once Hellstrike... Just sharing opinions.

If the premise for a fic is just exploring how changing a characters gender would effect the story then it would make sense to write a more feminine FemHarry for greater contrast. I can see why this would get tired... Ultimately it's just a vehicle for the story being told. Probably poorly.

Involuntary gender swapping annoys me most of the time. I don't like reading about gender dysphoria as a central conflict. Well, poorly written gender dysphoria.

And it's difficult to express.. correctly, but I am a male and I like exploring my feminine side in fiction when I am unable to do it in real life, so for me the more feminine gender switched protagonists are more.. novel? I like identifying with the feminine even though I am pretty masculine irl...

Don't get me wrong I like Tomboyish protags too, but with those FemHarrys we get the character first and then gender second.. Which is interesting because it then begs the question of why one would write a gender swap fic in the first place. There are a number of reasons and they can even boil down to something more inane like because the author just felt like it.

From what I seen a lot of authors write gender swapped protags because they identify better with the gender and have trouble putting themselves in the shoes of another. What if scenarios are also very popular as well as romance reasons. These two fall more under the umbrella though of societal constructs and expectations on gender. For example, if we have FemHarry with the same general relationships, we should expect more hesitation on the part of Harry leading the DA because of it considering the enviroment of a British boarding school in the nineties.

Another probably obvious reason is FemHarry just fit in with the story the author wanted to tell. Like, why did JK Rowling write a young male and not female originally? I doubt she planned on selling her book from the outset.

**** Who says that there would be significant gender dysphoria? I've played this kind of scenario through in my friend circle a few times, and, other than the one guy who's gay, well none of us would be terribly disappointed. All that really changes is a bit of biology, which amounts to breasts and more intense orgasms in exchange for slightly less physical strength and periods. Childbirth and so forth is irrelevant since you are still into women, clothing does not have to change beyond wearing bras, honestly, it seems pretty manageable.

#+begin_quote
  FemHarry fits the story better
#+end_quote

I can't think of many stories which would require explicitly female characters outside of genderswapping to avoid m/m. You don't need to make Harry a girl to have her have mostly female friends and shoehorning feminism into the main plot seems very vain since the main conflict is about fighting magical Hitler and therefore a few magnitudes more significant. If you want to address such topics, honestly do it after the war when you can resolve any lingering issues with revolutionary justice. Female franchise and such are irrelevant in the HP world, the economy is so vague that it does not seem a suitable issue either.

***** I was more referring to the expected gender roles and other social constructs.

Like, this is how someone who is a female is expected to act and seen by society.

It is true that just changing a characters gender should have no differences all other things being equal. I see your point though that any societal gender disferennces should be less pronounced in the wizarding world during war.

And referring to gender dysphoria was probably in bad taste since that phrase has a lot of other things attached to it nowadays.

****** The good thing about expectations is that you can proceed with no fucks given, especially if you are already close to an outcast for half of the time.

Changing the gender would obviously impact social situations, but most changed would be up to the author rather than logically predestined.

** Authors change a character's gender (or biological sex, or both) for the same reason they make any changes to canon. IMO, all fanfiction is fundamentally based on the question "what if" so any changes an author makes will be for a few reason. To address a what if situation they think could be interesting, because the change is useful for the story they want to tell, or because another change causes a butterfly effect.

  Hermione gives a lecture on "gender-flip fanfiction"; i.e. fanfiction depicting an AU where one or more characters has been born the opposite sex. Of course, when the ones attending the lecture are Harry and Ron... or should that perhaps be "Holly" and "Ronnie"?... it might get a little difficult to stay on track. A very meta story.

** Couple of reasons, the most common is to get a certain ship, sometimes the author just feels better able to write a main character of a specific gender and in (somewhat) rare cases the author is writing a setting in which having a character of the opposite gender will have cultural ramifications later on the story.

** Some if it is also down to author comfort. A few authors aren't comfortable writing same-sex relationships, but they still want to ship two characters, so they flip the gender of one of them.
