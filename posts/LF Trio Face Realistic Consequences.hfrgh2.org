Looking for fics where Harry, Ron, and/or Hermione face consequences for some of their actions at Hogwarts. The consequences should be realistic and fair.


** Man it would be tricky to have a story like this, given the amount of unfair consequences and actions towards the Trio.

The big ones that jump out:

- The attempted murder of Harry by the Ministry (or Umbridge at least) via dementors and the following kangaroo court.
- Ignoring their testimonies about Sirius by Fudge
- Snape's bullshit misbehavior and bullying never getting punished
- Lucius not getting punished for attempting to murder Harry at the end of second year
- Getting punished for almost killing Draco in 6th year despite the fact that Draco tried to Crutacius him.
- McGonagall sending them into the forest in first year to look for something evil and dangerous enough to kill Unicorns, for being out after curfew.

The problem with the idea of the Trio facing "fair" punishment is that unless a bunch of other people also face fair punishment, then punishment that would be fair is actually unfair, since one of the important aspects of law is that it's fairly applied to everyone.

I would like to see a story like this, but so many things would have to be changed and after you've done that, would the Trio still need to do their bad acts?

EDIT: Seeing [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/hfrgh2/lf_trio_face_realistic_consequences/fvzdavp/][this suggestion]], there's definitely a lot of lattitude for minor transgressions being punished appropriately in oneshots.

** Which actions though? The majority of them aren't something that would earn them more then a detention or some lost points. The only exceptions I could think of are the end of OOtP and Harry attacking Draco in HBP.

*** Given that Draco try to Crutacius Harry in the duel in HBP, I would say Harry is allowed lethal force.

**** I'd say that legally, he's in the clear 100%, but the school would still most likely punish him in some severe way if he didn't have plot armor. My guess would be both Harry and Draco getting suspended and having to retake the year, although Harry did have the extra excuse of being unaware that the spell was /that/ lethal.

***** I mean, I think he likely deserves punishment for using unfamiliar magic, but I don't think a suspension is warranted for that. However, for the actual fight I don't think he deserves much if any punishment given that he didn't initiate the duel and by the time he used unfamiliar magic on another person, lethal force was warranted.

Malfoy should have gone to Azkaban for trying to use an unforgivable, since at the very least he attempted commit torture. It's no longer a school matter.

****** Tbf if punishments were fair and unbiased, that whole thing wouldn't have even happened. Dumbledore knew that Draco was trying to murder him, and should have shipped him off to Azkaban way before that, what with Ron and Katie nearly dying, the imperius on Rosmerta etc.

But going off what I've experienced during my school years, teachers really don't care who started the fight.

**** I honestly doubt they'd become social outcasts over /house points/. As far as canon has shown, the points system is completely and utterly meaningless besides giving the head of house some bragging rights. If anything, we might see even more rulebreaking coming from Gryffindors because they would be resigned to never winning anyway. Do remember that the Marauders are said to have held records of house point loss/detentions, and they were still popular.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) where Hermione dosed Draco with self-brewed Veritaserum and since that's illegal as hell she can't defend herself when she's accused of theft without revealing the larger crime and promptly gets expelled. Dumbledore provides her with a homeschooling teacher from the Order.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
