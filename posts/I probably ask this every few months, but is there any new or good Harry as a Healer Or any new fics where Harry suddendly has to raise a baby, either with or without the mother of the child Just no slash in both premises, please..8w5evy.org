*** I have next to no skills in writing, believe me, I've tried. Not to mention that I don't even know how(as in, no imagination as to what would be a good plot, besides the premise) to write down the plot before begining the story, which I'd assume is the best way if you want to actually complete your story, based on a lot of talks I've seen in the reddit.

**** I used to use the exact same excuse. I have no technical skill at writing, I have never written before, I couldn't possibly write something worthwhile. So eventually I tried it, and it was terribly written but it was mine and I was proud of it. The next thing I wrote got marginally better, and before I knew it I was growing. What I was writing was still bad, but I was improving.

In regards to planning, yes an outline is somewhat helpful even required for larger works. But a 1k word oneshot? Start small, and most importantly /write./ Allow yourself to write poorly, as one must crawl before they can walk. Writing is not a talent you are born with, it is acquired.

TLDR: You can write if you apply yourself to the task. Planning helps, but actually writing is how books get done. You can write without a perfect outline, things will fall into place as you go.

**** One of my English teachers told me: 'no one gets to be a good writer without being a bad writer first.' Everyone has to start somewhere :)

Also, I never write with an outline. I just have a vague idea of where I want to go. Writing is a different process for everyone, and there is no rule book on how to be successful. Just start writing. It gets easier the more you do it.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

******* I never actually searched for it, only asked on the reddit, and no, IIRC, no one ever suggested this fic. The only somewhat interesting that was suggest was The serpent Lord, I think thats its name, with Harry/femDraco. Also the one about the zombie apocalypse, which isn't actually about zombies imo, and about politics and suspense, which I dislike a lot. Dementor's Stigma or smth like that.

** There's a couple of Harry raising kid Voldemort through time-travel or deaged Voldemort?

I'm not a fan of the latter but for the former type I quite like linkffn(6715591). Hp/Merope.

If you filter by characters Harry and Teddy Lupins I'm sure you'll get a couple of suddenly raising kid fics too. And Harry timetravelling to his own past and raising himself.
