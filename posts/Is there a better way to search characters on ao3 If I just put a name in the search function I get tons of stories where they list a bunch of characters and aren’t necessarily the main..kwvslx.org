I mean I know I can just go through each page and read them all I just find this process so tedious.

I find it esp difficult when I'm looking for characters that were minor in canon and I don't add a pairing for them.


** I hate when they name every character but I usually search by pairing so I dont know if that helps you any

*** My pet peeve is they name every single pairing they can. Like Ginny has a crush on Harry and kisses him on the cheek it's labelled Harry/Ginny but the main romance with be Harry/Snape which is also labelled along with a bunch of other crushes and people dating.

***** / and & are different though. / is for romantic pairings while & is for platonic ones.

****** I wasn't aware but if it's the same characters in my mine denoting both is unnecessary.

******* Eh, depends on the story I'd say. Like if you have a 700 000 word fic and the characters are only romantically involved with each other the last 50 000 words then I would definetly find it justified to tag both. A 5000 word fic and they are a couple from the start? Yeah, just tag /.

******** It's deeply frustrating if you're looking for entirely gen fics, though. Especially as most fics aren't talking about 650,000 words of building up to a relationship and then the last leg as romantic.

** I usually use the exclusions section to filter out what I don't want. Pairings not involving the character I'm searching for usually get excluded, characters from the wrong era, ect. Anything that's likely to be the main focus of a story that isn't my character search.. idk if that's easier per say but it does winnow the search results to reasonable number.

For a really really specific search I just type it in Google ( with the words "fanfiction" & "recs") and hope that a forum somewhere has already compiled a list for me..

** Excluding relationships helps a ton. Like if I want to read something about regulus I'll exclude Remus/Sirius because he's usually just a cameo in those stories.

** This is the one main problem with AO3's search function. There should be a distinction between the main characters and secondary ones (also between the main ship and secondary ones)

*** I'd say it's also a flaw with AO3 tags function. While it's much more searchable then Fanfiction.net categories, people overdo it and cram on as many tags as they can, not to mention sometimes slapping on same tag that is just spelled differently.

If people were at least responsible with tags...

** AO3's tags are nearly useless for searching.

Your best bet is probably to add "summary: Luna" (the word "summary" is case sensitive, the space is mandatory, and obviously replace Luna with whichever character you're looking for) to the "Search within results" box. That will only give you stories that include the character's name in the summary, which at least makes it more likely that the story is about them.

** This is the main reason I don't primarily use AO3. I don't read fanfiction for pairings, and outside if that, their tagging system is useless.

AO3 really needs to limit the amount of tags someone can use for their story (or at least /searchable/ tags).

** I wish cause I have that same problem. Some things I've tried - If they're tagged in a pairing they might have more chance of being relevant to the story. Also I look at older works that usually tag a lot less so only main characters are tagged. Their also might be a tag for your character like __-centric you can try looking up.
