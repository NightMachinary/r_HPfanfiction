Cetus Orion Black is son of Regulus Black and Serena Grimms, a pureblood witch from griffendor. His father disappeared and his mother died giving birth to him so he was raised by his grandmother, Walburga Black, who tried to make him like his father. while cetus does wish to restore the glory of house black, he doesn't share his grandmother's hate for muggles. He believes his uncle, Sirius, brought shame to their house when he betrayed his friends and not for befriending muggles. In a reverse of harry's sorting, the hat will recommend griffendor, yet this terrifies Cetus believing that any Black sorted into Griffendor is cursed (three guesses who put that in his head) so what do you guys think?
