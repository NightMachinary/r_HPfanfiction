I always like when this happens, but it's been a while since I've read any new one.

he says its a reworking of an earlier fic of his. you may have read it. i never saw the earlier one so i cant comment on how similar it is.

*** I was a bit scared to read, because I'm not usually a fan of H/Hr, even if I do love almost all of James' work.

**** i usually avoid h/hr too. the fic so far is decent, but it hasnt delved into the romance very much yet. the universe harry comes from and goes to are both very AU, and he was in love with Ginny in the old universe. so its at least not like a “hermione is the destined perfect girl forever” kind of story

so far the emotional core of the fic is a lot of “i watched all my friends die” angst from harry. which i like

******* Cool, I'm in the middle of a fic series right now (though its relatively short) so I won't read right away, but this definitely peeked my interest. Thanks.

******* Is H/Hr the main pairing in that fic? Sometimes i get cagey about reading fics with as many relationships tags as that one does lol

******** Yeah, I had the same reaction about the tags.

For now its Daphne and Fleur competing 'behind the scnes' and Harry trying to ignore then.

'I am still here' was going in that direction minus Hermione(I believe).
