I don't care who travels back as long as long as they try to change the timeline out of good intentions. No Slytherin wanking and no purely bratty Marauders. No stupid weak Pettigrew that always wets his pants. (The dude might not be as gifted as the rest but he isn't magically weak. I've always had the Headcanon that he has performance anxiety.)

Kudos if they're friends with the Marauders and/or Lily.

Extra Kudos if Regulus is at least mentioned.

Extra, extra Kudos if it's gen. Het/Slash is fine though


** linkao3(The Incalculable Power by Warriora)

It's a beautiful read. The end ship is Drarry but so far, there's been no hints of it, other than the amicable snarky friendship that Harry and Draco have from being stuck in the past. Also Harry has PTSD from the war.

Edit : the fanfiction bot messed up, I will link the actual fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28632333/chapters/70181604][HERE]]

  Morgana was dead. Her body, once terrible in its beauty and power, lay gutted and lifeless on the bloody battlefield, the prince who had slain her standing triumphantly over her remains. He was speaking, but Emrys barely heard him. Magic still crackled around him, off the tips of his fingers and the ends of his hair. He alone remained standing, untouched by mortal steel or iron, uninjured. He had a clear shot to the prince, but his life would be forfeit if he tried. “Anybody who yields will not be killed,” the prince announced. “Quarter will be offered to anybody who swears fealty to the crown and agrees to abide by its laws.”

** This one has adult Hermione who was thrown back in time during an accident and reborn as the youngest Evans sister with her memories intact. It kind of portrays Lily in an unflattering light in what could be considered bashing, but the fic isn't finished so I'm hoping there will be some reconciliation/character development there. Regulus and Barty Jr are pretty prominent, as are the marauders. I really adore how Barty and Regulus are written actually.

**** "An unflattering light" is a good way to describe Lily in this one.

I wouldn't call it bashing. She's a teenager, even the best of them have their moments. In fact, all of the characters act like teenage idiots from time to time. Mature idiots, but still idiots.

As I think they were implying, your bar for what is or isn't bashing, will be different.

  James Potter went five years at Hogwarts without realizing Lily had a little sister. Hermione would have preferred if he never realized she existed. Now she's stuck, in Potter's circle of awareness, and maintaining the timeline. Not like he makes it easy, or something.

** If you want a fic that takes an unique spin on Peter, there is linkffn(Hero of the Story) with Hermione travelling back and becoming Peter's sister. However, early on, during the first few Hogwarts years, the Marauders are generally not portrayed as good people but rather as a group of bullies, with her instead ending up with a friendship trio with Lily and Severus. So if portraying the latter as a decent (if flawed) person isn't your thing, you might want to skip it. The fic is Hermione/James, once the latter grows up a bit. It does feature a redemption arc of sorts of Regulus later on.

  Regulus Black wakes up in a dark cell during one of the most eventful months of his life, not very sure of how he came to be there, and with only a stranger named Harry for company. An awkward almost friendship is born. Meanwhile, Harry Potter might have made a mistake. Or two. All he knows is that things aren't really going his way right now, and that his cellmate's mostly alright. Mostly.
