In my old FF community, neglected brother fics were almost always at the very bottom of the food-chain - poor writing, bad plots, cringey angst, etc... Does that still hold true in this HP fanfic as well? I've seen a few good ones (Such as /Saving Connor/) but are they exceptions to the rule?


** Like with any other type of fanfiction (except those that you personaly don't like and therefore have a hard time enjoying (for me that would be slash! No matter how well writen and great a slash story might be, I wouldn't read it because it's slash. I have tried to read slash but I simply can't take it!)):

They can be good, but the trope itself is NOT what makes a story good or bad - it's the writer's skill and imagination that makes a story great!

I've read some stories that pull the "WBWL"-Concept off well, but I've also read some that were crappy as fuck!

I wouldn't know if they are the exception because I rarely look for this trope (I sometimes pick up those stories from recommendations or when searching for keywords)...if I look at those I've read versus those I never finished, then I'd say yeah, they aren't the exception - but: As I've said, my sample size isn't large enough to state this with confidence, it's not a trope I enjoy so much that I read it all the time...

Frankly I kind of enjoy somewhat (I love it if he isn't a slacker, like in canon, and studies more and is interested in magic etc.) canon Harry (somewhat independent orphan kid) more than Harry with parents, even if they are almost as bad as the Dursleys!

** Most of those are horrid. They often fail at the premise. Would a mother who loves her children enough to die for them really give away one of them, or outright ignore one of them? Disbelief not suspended.

The only way I can see this work is that Harry would form some sort of complex for being the one without the fame (if he's still the BWL, doesn't really matter). His brother /needs/ more attention from his parents because of that, the public adores him,... in the end Harry ends up being the one in the shadow.

But most fics go to these ridiculous extremes where Harry is /actively/ ignored and scorned on the breakfast table, or just shipped off to the Dursleys for some stupid reason.

I'd like to read only one of these fics where the family dynamic isn't that black and white. Maybe Harry finds that when he shows interest in academics, his mother pays more attention to him and he becomes a bit of a bookworm that way. Maybe he's the one that shows natural talent on a broom and James dedicates time to him to further that talent. But in the end he struggles to keep their eyes on him, because his brother, in addition of being just as much their son as Harry, is in constant need of guidance through the blinding limelight.

the two WBWL fics I really like take different answers to this question.

In Dodging Prison & Stealing Witches, Dumbledore is convinced Harry could become worse than Voldemort (which isn't unjustified as he does do some pretty heinous things). Because of this, he manipulates Lily & James into leaving Harry w/ the Dursleys and later frames Harry for a crime.

in Prince of Slytherin, Lily actually hates the wizarding world and, due to a false negative, her and James though Harry was squib. So she jumped for joy at the chance to have Harry raised as a muggle w/ the Dursleys and have a "normal" life (she had no idea he'd be abused/neglected).

That... is so incredibly out of character it's almost comical. Dumbledore's /defining trait/ is his faith in people's ability to do good, and to define themselves through these decisions.

Dumbledore judging a child and then framing them is like Yoda going on a beserker rampage -- the complete opposite of everything we know about them.

***** It depends on how AU you want to be. Dumbledore in DP&SW is ridiculously out of character. At least for me though, I don't mind that at all.

I know some people dislike when Harry is "only Harry in name" (i.e. so different and OOC that the only thing he shares w/ canon Harry is the name Harry), but I don't have a problem with that. Fanfiction to me is more about exploring the world and the magic/setting, and less about the characters.

**** I'm not sure if Dodging Prison & Stealing Witches is a good example. I mean, its practically famous for indulging in every cliche there is, just in a way that its not awful.

The next thing is... Dumbledore, the guy who has more forgiveness in himself than anyone else in the HP books condemns a child who /maybe, possibly/ could become a Voldemort 2.0? Disbelief once again not suspended.

The thing is, even if Lily ships Harry off to Petunia. He ought to live among muggles to be prepared for their world. Thats all fine. But then: Why wouldn't she check?

This is bullshit. A caring, loving mother would pop in once or twice to talk with her child.

Anyway. I thought Dodging Prison & Stealing Witches to be a fun read. But it has its flaws, and the premise is certainly one of them.

Clichés alone don't make a fic bad. Poorly done clichés do, and I don't think DP&SW does them poorly.

And you're right in that Dumbledore is super OOC, which could be a turn off for some folks.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  A caring, loving mother would pop in once or twice to talk with her child.
#+end_quote

So what PoS does is tries to make a workable story out of as many clichés as possible. Because of this, Harry must grow up abused by Lily's sister's family. There are /tons/ of issues with this, and the PoS solution is to add in external factors/motivations.

For example, regarding why Aurors didn't just storm Hogwarts in the chamber of secrets when kids started getting pretrified. In PoS, the aurors do come, but they're severly limited because the headmaster must swear an unbreakable vow upon taking office to maintain Hogwarts' autonomy from the ministry as much as possible.

So coming back to the Dursleys issue: the following must happen in a WBWL story (massive spoilers ahead):

- Lily, James, Remus and Dumbledore must agree to send Harry away

This is because they think Harry is a squib

- Lily must trust the Dursleys to take good care of her son

In PoS Petunia and Lily didn't really have a falling out. They stayed good friends well after Lily left Hogwarts.

-Petunia and Vernon must abuse their own nephew, and everyone in Little Whitning must ignore obvious signs of Harry's abuse

This part still hasn't been revealed, but we know that Harry has some condition that causes every Muggle he meets to instantly hate him. This also affects Hermione's and Justin's parents too. The author has dropped lots of hints how this works (and there is magic with a very similar effect that has been introduced), but it hasn't been revealed fully. I have my own pet theories why.

- Remus must not seek out Harry

In PoS Remus and James have a huge falling out when Remus requests custody of Harry (to raise him in the Muggle world) and James denies because Remus is a werewolf.

Note that in PoS being a werewolf is very different than in canon (lycanthropy is also a mental disease that slowly corrupts the minds of werewolves and turns them into man-eating monsters like Greyback). Lupin has dedicated his life to curing the mental part of lycanthropy, but James was concerned that, if Lupin's efforts aren't successful Lupin would be a danger to Harry.

- Dumbledore must not check up on Harry

Dumbledore hires Mrs. Fig to keep a watch over Harry. However Squibs and Muggles are very, very similar in the PoS universe (being magical is more of a spectrum between Magical and non-Magical, with muggles being on the low end, wizards on the high end, and squibs in the middle), so Mrs. Fig was also affected by Harry's mysterious ailment.

- Lily and James must not check up on Harry

This has also been hinted at, and a few characters have outright insulted Lily/James for this but nothing about why they didn't has been confirmed. This and why Harry's ailment exists are 2 huge mysteries that (based on how the author has handled everything so far) I'm excited to see be revealed.

- James and Lily must not want Harry to join the family after Harry is found a wizard

There is a prophecy that says if a Potter becomes the "Prince of Slytherin", the world as we know it will end. James is initially ashamed over how he's treated Harry, but once Harry is sorted into Slytherin James tries everything he can to disinherit Harry before he becomes the "Prince of Slytherin".

This prophecy, which has existed in the Potter family for centuries, is why every Potter, including James and Jim (the BWL), were raised to be extremely biased against Slytherin.

Lily doesn't see the point in pretending her and Harry can be a family while James is trying to disinherit Harry, but she being reaching out to Harry against James' wishes while trying to convince James to stop.

--------------

The above is a lot of little explanations, but the idea is that PoS tries to do whatever it can to make the premise and canon work logically, which necessitates, at times, lots of external stuff. And they do this for basically everything.

I'm not really doing it all justice, as this stuff is all revealed slowly over many chapters (allowing the reader to make their own predictions and letting the author drop lots of hints).

I was never entirely happy with that fic, tbh. I was greatly uncomfortable with how Harry - an adult - plans to train, use and eventually marry all those 6 to 8 year old girls. But that is an discussion for another time.

I retract my statements then, about the cliche not being done well. But I guess you see that my opinion of it is blackened and therefore my memory of it was as well.

** The problem I have found with most Neglected/WBWL fics I have read is that the neglect factor is brought in too fast and too hard, usually through cringe-worthy OOC premise and behaviour.

I can only think that in order for this to work in any kind of 'realistic' fashion, the neglect would have to creep up, over enough time for the psychology of the situation to really settle into the Neglected sibling so that in they end they start viewing themselves as more disposable and less-worthy. From there, out of love for their family, they start distancing themselves into the background, etc. Assuming no psychotic break into the typical 'psychopath neglected sibling' I can even conceive of this sort of character eventually coming to the conclusion that they must protect their sibling from the shadows etc. It would certainly tie into that love being the 'power he knows not' idea - for as has been remarked more than once, self-sacrifice for another's gain is one of the greatest acts of love there is.

I can only imagine it would be very hard to balance the storytelling required to sell this situation against keeping it an interesting read.

James and Lily are shown to be loving parents and overall great people. Why would they neglect their son/kids just because? If the curse scar is a result of the Horcrux latching on, why doesn't it appear on Harry? Why would the brother of the supposed BWL not get any attention from people? Yeah he'd be overshadowed, but he'd still get some recognition. Why do they always include a cardboard cutout as the love interest?

We actually see more of James being an asshole in canon than him being a good person. If it weren't for the fact that he died trying to hold off Voldemort long enough for Lily to escape with Harry, no one would think he's a good person.

***** Yep. James is a dick in Canon. As were his friends. There's a popular theory that they are the reason Snape went dark. On that note, they also almost committed murder for shits and giggles. They did not even get punished.

Sadly we know very little about Lily.
