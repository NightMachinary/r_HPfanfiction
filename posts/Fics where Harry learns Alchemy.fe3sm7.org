I would like to request fics where Harry learns Alchemy, I do not care from who, It does not matter if it is not a major component of the story as long as it is there, thank you.


** I just caught up with the linkffn(Pureblood Pretense) series, where alchemy is similar in effect to Transfiguration, but achieved through calculation and runic arrays. It takes a lot more preparation, but is more energy efficient, allowing more impressive effects at the high end. Harry learns it one on one from Professor Dumbledore.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][Enter the Dragon]] takes a different approach, with alchemy being direct mass-energy conversions. Easy to perform, but equally easy to kill yourself via tremendous nuclear explosion (for exothermic transmutation) or total magic drain (for endothermic), so using it successfully requires excellent magical control. Harry is still in the early stages of learning.

And if you're ok with a protagonist other than Harry, then linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) has Severus learning alchemy from Dumbledore because he's not properly challenged by his other classes (since he's repeating his life). This version of alchemy achieves a complete and permanent transformation (unlike Transfiguration which affects only some properties of the material and is temporary), by breaking down the material at the molecular level and rearranging it with the aid of a catalyst.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

** If you don't mind slash this is a great series of stories on AO3 where Harry learns alchemy!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/70241]]

Also, I used the Alchemy tab on AO3, filtered it to have Harry Potter fics and Harry as a character.
