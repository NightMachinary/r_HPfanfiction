** This seems really unrealistic to me. Like why would a society with a proven afterlife mock religion?

*** Proven afterlife? Really?

We know some sort of echo of dead people comes out when using the Resurrection Stone, and when the Priori Incantatem effect happens and one of the wands was used to cast the Killing Curse. This is an interesting case because the echos of Lily Evans and James Potter seemed to recognize Harry. Either they were in an afterlife where they could watch what was happening on Earth and temporarily called back, or they were essentially a combination of temporary ghosts created years after the person's death and partially shaped by the expectations of the people involved.

We know that Harry had some sort of experience between the time he was hit by the Killing Curse (demolishing the Horcrux) and his revival a minute later. This is an unusual circumstance, and Harry didn't get any surprising information that he could later verify from it.

Dumbledore is convinced there is an afterlife.

We know spirits and souls exist -- the ghosts, Voldemort's shade, and Dementors are reasonable evidence of that. Voldemort's shade at least is likely to be in full possession of its mental faculties, or at the very least it was revivable. But that's not the same as dying without preparation, not becoming a ghost, and living in some ethereal realm.

There is a portal in the Department of Mysteries. Anyone who goes through it never returns. The same could be said for a broken Vanishing Cabinet.

That's all the evidence we have for afterlives. Tenuous and inconclusive.

What would we expect to be different if everyone knew there was an afterlife?

Voldemort wouldn't be so eager for immortality unless he was just so attached to Magical Britain that he couldn't bear to leave. His victims would cast the Killing Curse on each other when they saw him approaching -- better to be painlessly sent to another realm of existence than to be Crucio'd to insanity. The Killing Curse wouldn't even be Unforgivable, perhaps. People would be upset by their conversion to ghosthood because it's separating them from loved ones longer, and it would be routine to exorcise those who remained. Committing suicide on your lover's or family member's death would be normal -- perhaps there would even be a tradition of killing infants rather than leaving them orphaned, so their own parents could raise them in the afterlife.

It's certainly not normal to communicate with dead people. Only one artefact has that ability. There are no books being written by dead people, no music by them, no commerce between our realm and the realm of the dead. Nobody has any clue what the afterlife might be like.

The only aspect of society that seems to point to there being an afterlife is the fact that the Philosopher's Stone is not the most sought-after thing in the world.
