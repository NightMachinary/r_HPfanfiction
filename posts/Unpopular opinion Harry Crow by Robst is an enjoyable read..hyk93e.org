** I recently tried to read through the whole thing, so I could properly evaluate it. I reached about chapter four and found myself skimming large parts of it just to get through the chapters. Still planning to go back to it after I finish proofreading The Peace Not Promised, mostly so I can say I did.

Actually, I'd like to do a comparison with Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. They're both in the FFN top ten (by favourites) but both get a lot of hate, both have Harry/Hermione (albeit in quite different ways), both have a Harry who's smarter than canon and has additional skills, both give Harry a stable home life (though very different homes), they're similar lengths and both complete and have decent prose quality (although I felt like Harry Crow needed more pauses in its sentences, maybe more commas and upgrade some to semicolons). Yet they are quite different stories.

As far as I can tell, the premise of Harry Crow is, "What if goblins were much more awesome than wizards?" While the premise of Methods of Rationality is, "Let's introduce the reader to some of the principles of how to reflect on your own thinking patterns and try to fix your mistakes, and we'll use a story to demonstrate them."

** Apart from anything else, I have issues with the steaming chunks of misogyny in some of the ?middle? chapters.

** Never read it, so I don't have an opinion. But an "enjoyable read" doesn't say anything about how well-written or good the story is, it just says that it made you feel good.

*** It is well written and the story is unique. It's quality is not what people dispute. Robst is one of the highest rated and reviewed writers. But people with sticks up their butts bash it a lot

**** That's fair enough, but if you really want to defend it, maybe make a post about how it's actually well-written. The plot, how it moves forward in a logical and consistent manner, the characters, how they grow, etc. rather than making a post just saying you like it and saying people will have a "nuclear meltdown" in the comments due to that.

***** Well to be honest. The post was for people who've already read the story and those aren't the things people complain about

** I like Robst and I cannot lie\\
You other readers can't deny\\
That when a writer walks in with a whole load of tropes\\
And a ship that is your jam\\
You get stoked

** This was one of the firsts Harry Potter fanfiction I read(sorted by favorites), I also quite enjoyed it. I remember liking it so much I read almost all the ones Robst wrote. My favorite one is A different Halloween.

** Wow. You post this and have an overall neutral rating, so your upvotes and downvotes are about equal. I agree with you and I'm at minus 5. Presumably because I said that Harry/Hermione isn't believable without changing their canon relationship.
