**** Do an honest Trailer requires nitpicking, and people won't often do that for their favourite stories. They don't want to have a reason to dislike them.

** SPOILERS SPOILERS TONS OF SPOILERS BELOW

Resonance: linkffn(Resonance)

[[/spoiler][A far out-of-character yet completely in-character Severus Snape adopts a BWL who has just killed Voldemort in an even cheesier way than he did in canon. What will they face when an 18-year-old has to deal with having a parent for the first time (seriously, I think they've got this part backwards) and an overgrown bat reconciles his aversion to showing affection with his protectiveness.]]

[[/spoiler][Harry, now with dimension-travelling powers, has a mountain gryffilis animagus form (basically the most OP animal in existence) to go with the fact that he picks up spells with ease and is very powerful. /But can he pass his Auror exams?/]]

This fic has a notoriously shitty summary anyway. But it's /so/ /so/ /so/ good.

** In a story that was a harder gothbulge than Master of the Universe, Harry (I mean Harlem- er Hadrian, no wait, Harveste ) brutally murders some people offscreen. And then he brutally murders some more people offscreen. Then he eats some weird stuff, turns a lot of people gay, and...does the Mumushka?
