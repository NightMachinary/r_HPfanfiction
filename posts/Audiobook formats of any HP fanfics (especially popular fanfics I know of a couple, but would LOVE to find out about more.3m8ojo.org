The ones I know about are: HP and the methods of rationality. And also the first 16 chapters of Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent. They are both BRILLIANT! The first one definitely isn't super "professional," nor is any attempt to make the voice actors sound brilliant. But it's super fun, sort of like having a friend or sibling read it to you. Don't get me wrong, it IS VERY well done. But it doesn't sound British, which the Psychic Serpent strives to do. Both are wonderful to listen too.

As someone with great difficulty, due to physical limitations cannot spend too much time physically reading, the audiobook formats have been a god-send.

Can anyone else think of any other stories that are in audiobook-format?

Thanks in advanvce!!! :)


** Simple solution, if you have a smart phone: Voice Dream Reader. Started on iPhone, but available for Android now, too.

It's a computerize text-to-speech reader which, /IF/ you get Ivona voices, sounds almost as good as a real person.

You can purchase dozens and dozens of voices in addition to the default voice, but Ivona has them all beat. If you can get them for some other text-to-speech app or computer program, do that instead. I use the British English voices Emma (slightly higher pitched voice) and Amy (deeper voice) for HP fanfiction (the type of headphones you use will change which sounds better). Salli is a good American English voice, Marlene is good for German, and Celine is good for French.

It's not perfect. Unusual names and words won't be pronounced right, but you can create a custom pronunciation dictionary. You can create playlists. You can load in epub files of fanfics. You can read along as the text scrolls with the voice.

By this point, I use VDR more than any other app on my iPhone. I cannot recommend it enough, not in a dozen more posts like this, though once again it's the high quality of the Ivona voices that make it work. You can hear the "computer-y" quality of the voice, but usually I have to pay close attention to notice it. Most of the time, it's more like a real person.

It is also completely indispensible for me as a writer. You would not believe how many errors I catch by listening to my chapters. So many things stand out that way - things that I just pass over when reading. My main beta and I listen to each chapter several times each before anything is published, and it helps a lot.

Listening also forces me to think about what I'm hearing, which helps me notice plot holes, conflicts with things happening in other chapters, foreshadowing I need to do, etc. I could not imagine writing without having this tool to help me.

*** So you pay for the app and then pay for voices on top of that?

**** The voices aren't created by the person who wrote the app. They come from... three or four different companies, I believe. They make voices that are used for lots of different purposes. That's why I singled out Ivona - I've purchased from a couple of the other available companies, but they aren't as good. That "computer-y" quality is much more pronounced with them.

And there are literally /hundreds/ of different voices in all different languages and accents. The app doesn't provide them for free, it simply provides access to them.

You can listen to a samples before buying, too.

The app itself comes with... I think one default voice. It's OK and might be what's native on the iPhone. The app itself is designed for people who have trouble reading and seeing (dyslexia, ADHD, visual impairments). It has a bunch of features that are aimed at that market which I don't pay attention to - automatic scrolling, highlighted lines, variable speaking speed (with certain voices), that sort of thing. You can load web pages, Word documents, epub files, and more.

It's not designed for simple fanfic enjoyment, it just happens to do that very well.

I think it's worth it. Given how much time I've spent using it just on proofing my own work, never mind listing to others' fics, I could have spent four or five times what I already have and it would still be a bargain.

*** Seconding because this app is the best. I prefer Amy myself. I think I've programmed most of the HP words to be pronounced how I imagine them. Priceless for my daily commute.

**** Amy was originally my favorite - Emma sounded /too/ high pitched to me. Like a girl's voice.

But that was when I was using Sennheiser headphones. When I started using headphones with more base, Emma sounded much better.

So, the headphones you use (or speaker settings, though I'm not sure these voices will sound as good that way) will have a strong influence on which voices sound better.

And I've created quite a large custom dictionary, too. Some, like McGonagall, were actually quite challenging to get right! But it's indispensible.

** Look on archiveofourown. You can filter the results by format - just select podcast - and narrow the search by genre or pairing. There are quite a few audio versions though the quality varies greatly.

While not well done or British, I often will turn my iPhone's "voiceover" screen reader on and listen to my phone read me fanfics while I'm working or something. It's definitely not good quality, but I figured I'd mention the option since it enables me to listen to literally any fanfic regardless of whether it's been transcribed into a real audiobook. I'm sure Android/Windows phones have a similar feature!
