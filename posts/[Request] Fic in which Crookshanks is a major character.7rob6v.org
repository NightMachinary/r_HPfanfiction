Crookshanks is a great cat, maybe the greatest cat! Full of piss and vinegar, able to sniff out foes and treachery, he is half housecat, half Kneazle, 100% badass. Surely there must be fics in which he plays a crucial role. And yes, I know he is a game-changer canonically in PoA, but I want /more/.

Please share your favorite Crookshanks fics!


** Isn't there the one that Crookshanks is playing (comedicly painful) matchmaker because he can't have kittens unless his human does too? Or that may have been a Hedwig fic....

  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

** Don't know if I'd call him a MAJOR major character, but he plays a large and important role in the second "Weasley Girl" story, "Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past."

He's not in every chapter and is off-screen for large periods of time, but he's definitely one of the more active characters in the story... he tends to be there for plot-relevant scenes, and is a crucial part in saving the day at the end.

Quite a large part of the story revolves around the characters learning a charm that lets you talk to animals, because they know Crookshanks has important information. When the charm works, we get to hear him talk... and he pretty much talks like the Artful Dodger. It's great. :)

Mind you, this story is part of a series of AU stories, so I'm not sure how much sense it'll make on its own. The premise of the series is that Ron was born a girl, and how things developed slightly differently because of it.

  AU, Sequel to "Weasley Girl." In an alternate universe where Ron Weasley was born a girl, and where Harry's first Hogwarts year turned out a little different as a result, the famous "Potter's Gang" are back for their second year at Hogwarts and hoping perhaps for a calmer year... ...but with a dramatic escape, a mysterious diary, a strange cat, a "loony" girl, a hidden monster and many past secrets coming to light, it looks like this year will be at least as eventful and dangerous as the previous one. Second novel in the "Weasley Girl" Trilogy. Fem!Ron, everyone else is their canon gender.

  I, Crookshanks, am a cat. Proud and fluffy. This is the story of how I got myself a new pet, and how I protected her from an evil imposter. Fluff mainly. Just a bit of a silly little story to occupy me until I get inspiration for my Ancient Relics sequel.
