I wrote a one-shot based on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/eqazyx/a_different_set_of_twins/][a prompt]] posted by [[/u/RowanWinterlace][u/RowanWinterlace]] a couple weeks ago. More specifically, its first part, where Harry and Ron take the Carrow twins to the Yule Ball, and Harry ends up escorting them both. And I stuck them into the same year as the boys because I liked the idea of them taking Potions together.

** This was a really fun read. I'd love to see it continued, but this was excellent as a standalone as well!

** I know this is a massive nit pick and feel free to ignore me but chopping produces a smaller surface area not a larger one.

Dicing would create more surface area while retaining the same mass/volume.

*** Thanks. So diced is finer than chopped, not the other way around? My life has been a lie.

**** Yeah, minced is the finest while chopped is the thickest. Diced comes in between.

** This is fantastic. I love it.

edit: The writing is superb. The story is tight and the characters are spot-on.

edit2: If you don't continue this story, I shall be most vexed. Nothing sexual, mind you, it's just that you've done so well, I'd like to read more of their adventures. It's rare that someone is able to write so well that the humour emerges so naturally.

It definitely needs a follow-up.

Will he choose one over the other? Will they agree to double date him?
