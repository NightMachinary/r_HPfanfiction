Just something I thought of while reading Dumbledores funeral and Bill and Fluers wedding, since they were both officiated by the same chaplain. Or whatever magical equivalent there is in the world.

I'm not saying jk Rowling should have gone that far, nor would I have really wanted her to. Though it can be done convincingly, like in the Song of Ice and Fire series, I think it's for the best it wasn't attempted.


** I much prefer the idea that wizards /are/ as close gods as exist in the /Harry Potter/ universe --- that back in the day, the likes of Lord Voldemort and Dumbledore would have set themselves up as masters of a domain, unquestioned by the cowering Muggles, and taken on names like Jupiter or Horus.

** Why? They already have an explanation for pretty much anything, magic. They are the gods, shaping the world to their will.

*** Just not magic itself.

So there would be one god/goddess of magic or there are lots of small gods for very spell.

Once upon a time, before there was latain, the spells their said, where just the names of those gods... something like this
