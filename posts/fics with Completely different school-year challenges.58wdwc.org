:END:
Are there any good fics out there that are a complete rewrite of the series, e.g. Quirrel is not possessed by Voldemort, Lockhart is not a narcissistic idiot, Moody is not Barty Crouch, Jr., Umbridge isn't Umbridge, etc.

I ask because after reading hundreds of fanfics, the repetition and predictability of everything has become somewhat boring.


** Well, when it comes to for want of a nail fics that lead to fairly drastically different things happening, the big one is linkffn(What You Leave Behind by Newcomb) which partly has to do with aging Harry up a year, and Dumbledore kinda being exiled from Wizarding Britain.

For an AU that so far is holding /generally/ to the canon plotline yet isn't rehash, there is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man), though it is similar enough to canon that you probably wouldn't want to read it.

Sadly, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) does fit this request.

For fullblown AUs we have the sadly abandoned linkffn(Wit of the Raven) and the criminally underrated linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) by [[/u/Ihateseatbelts]].

Out of all of these, the one that fits your request the best would probably be Untitled Tome followed by What You Leave Behind.

  Some call him the next Dumbledore. Others, a thrall of Grindelwald. Not even Harry himself is sure of where he belongs, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a dangerously magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way. Massive!Wizarding World, No!BWL.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again.

These two dont have voldemort in his normal capacity and it makes both very refreshing Aus which dont draw very much from the original canon challenges . Prince of a dark kingdom is abandoned but i would still highly recommend reading it , its just that good . Also both fics treat Ron pretty well , if you share my pet peeve about Ron being garbage in almost every au

**** Unfortunately those are the only two really good AUs with that much alt world building that i can remember. There's this fic , fighting the green, where neville is chosen as the boy who lived and Harry's parents live to raise him and see him sorted into slytherin. It follows cannon kind of closely but skips over alot of stuff that you've read about a million times and just discusses it after the fact. It is probably the best example of children in fanfiction actually behaving like children. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1955451]] . BTW if you ever come across any fics like Reign of the Serpent of Prince of the dark kingdom id love a rec : ) .

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - This fic is still starting up, but has strong (though slow) worldbuilding. It's about non-BWL Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindewald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. There was no Voldemorts' rise so the standard plot is thrown out of the window. Ongoing, regular updates.

Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of neither. Matou Shinji, protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focus on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements or both settings with author original ideas. The first year is similar to canon one, but then it diverges wildly. Ongoing, with currently iregular updates.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725][Forging the Sword]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic that diverges from the end of CoS. Great take on magic system, that's creative and stays close to canon at the same time. Rather slowpaced, with the whole third year being focused mostly on the character- and worldbuilding. Covered the third year that was completely different from canon one. Sadly died just when plot was started getting really interesting. Though considering author's earlier hiatuses I still have hope for more updates.

[[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ww8zey6s8igoghx/AAAW0Cgm8AGQl2amQOwRat_5a?dl=0&preview=Alexandra+Potter+Original+(Revised][Alexandra Potter]].html) - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in heavily magical Hogwarts. It focus on school life and author's variation on magic system. The first year complete, but theoretically there is a new version planned. The covered plot had nothing to do with canon one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358][What You Leave Behind]] - Year older Harry who puts more time in studying magic and looking for secrets of the school. Another canon-ish yet original take on magic. Again, very different from canon in terms of plot. And another dead fic.
