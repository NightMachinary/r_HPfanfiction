I'm writing a fan fiction where the Canon Harry Potter has to work alongside three other Harry Potters. One of them is a "drarry" Harry who was sorted into Slytherin. However, I very much dislike Drarry and was wondering if any slash writers could tell me how a realistic backstory would go between Draco and Harry. Obviously, I won't be writing Drarry fluff, but a big part of the conflict between the characters will be CanonHarry's inability to understand why of all people, SlytherinHarry is with Draco Malfoy and eventually coming to terms with it so I want to do that part of the story justice.


** No advice on Drarry details, but holy crap that story premise sounds like it could be absolutely hilarious.

If you can nail the characterization of canon Harry, and make the other three Harry Potters slightly exaggerated to emphasize the tropes they are parodying, it could be absolutely hysterical.

If you can add just the right amount of self-awareness to the story, it could be really amazing.

*** I'm trying to make it somewhere halfway between crackfic and deadly serious. I know the Ravenclaw Harry will be a girl and most likely the wrong twin who lived, but I am having troubles with where to go on the Hufflepuff Harry. Just for good measure, their main opponent will, of course, be a Dark Lord Harry.

**** I think it would be really funny if there was a prophecy that says how canon Harry will defeat the Dark Lord Harry and it mentions 'the power he knows not'. In the end, the final scene is like the scene in /Good Will Hunting/ where canon Harry explains how he understands how dark Harry feels, and how it isn't his fault. Dark Harry is angry and disbelieving at first, but due to the persistence of canon Harry, comes around and hugs all around. Boom, 'the power he knows not' is love.

As for Hufflepuff Harry, it could be a Harry that was raised in a loving home, specifically if he was raised by Sirius. Due to the loyalty and love that Sirius gave him growing up (and a healthy amount of time spent around the Tonks') he doesn't feel the need to prove himself so that leaves out Slytherin, he doesn't feel the need to be closer to his parents because he knows all about them from Sirius so that leaves out Gryffindor, and he never really fit much in Ravenclaw anyways.

Anyways, just ideas!

The AU!Harry in linkffn(Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen) is a Hufflepuff for pretty much these reasons.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

** Draco recognises Harry at Malkin's. He's restrained around him rather than abrasive, as a properly ambitious politician should be. He gets his father to take over from Hagrid, who has had several drinks at this point and is a wee bit tipsy. They spend the day together, and by the end of it Harry's properly outfitted like a pureblood.

At Hogwarts, Harry's first ambition is to become strong enough that no one can hurt him. As a secondary ambition, he wants to show off his intelligence, since he never had been able to when Dudley was around.

The Dark Arts are a shortcut to strength. They come with high costs, but they work. The Malfoy library has plenty of information on them, and Lucius and Narcissa both have practical experience. And Draco's got years of experience in Magical Britain and can teach him a lot.

On Draco's side, the Boy Who Lived comes with a lot of fame and no ill will. (For most of the people who matter, anyway.) It's just common sense for him to attach himself to Harry. Part of their relationship is an exasperated "you /can't/ be that ignorant of politics / fashion / propriety / what have you in Magical Britain, can you?" -- but that eventually makes him realize that Muggleborns are in the same boat as Harry. Bit of an intellectual meltdown for him. He settles out into accepting Harry and giving Muggleborns half a chance, but they really ought to learn the culture.

Studying together eventually coalesces into something more, especially when Draco dredges up some of the milder Dark artefacts from his family's collection, ones that won't trigger the Trace but will intimidate the Dursleys into treating him humanely.

  "Did it work?"

  Harry grinned. "Like a charm. I could kiss you."

  Draco gave him an appraising look, one eyebrow raised. "Yes, I dare say you could."

And that's how they started dating.

** If Harry is gay and Sorted Slytherin, his awakening to man-lust would involve fantasizing about various men and boys of his acquaintance, the best of which is Draco. Eventually he might discover that his roommate Draco is also of his bent, and that much of Draco's bluster comes from feeling vulnerable to his father's criticism. As this Harry is a survivor of his relatives uncaring attitudes, he might empathise with the blond ponce in a private conversation, and the two would fall into a relationship based on forbidden attraction coupled with shared secrets. Think Jack and Rose in Titanic.

*** [[/u/RealityWanderer]] wants to explore why this Harry chose Draco. "I'm attracted to dudes" is an unsatisfying answer; Draco's grating enough in canon that I'd prefer celibacy and loneliness over dating him.

Funnily enough, changing Harry into a girl does nothing to address this. You still have to specify that she's attracted to guys, and on top of that you have to say why she chose to date Draco of all people.

** hmm... it could be that the reason that Harry and Draco have so much antimosity towards each other is that they each have repressed sexual feelings toward the other. being forced to live with one another (possibly with just the two of them) leads to an eventual casual sexual relationship. That slowly leads into Draco asking Harry to the Yule ball in fourth year. Harry says "I dont know." Harry is afraid of how his family (Sirius and Remus) would feel about him dating Draco Malfoy of all people. They end up going to the ball seperately, Harry gets a date with tracey or something, and at the end of the night, Harry's female date kisses him. He realizes then that he doesnt care what his family thinks. All that matters is draco. as soon as he politely goes to his room, he waits for Draco. Draco comes back a bit drunk. They have an intense verbal spar because Draco was extremely hurt seeing Harry and the girl. And Harry... Harry was insulted by the things Draco said. It wouldnt be until Draco is taken for the second task that they end up together.

That should work. Its semi-realistic. and I dont think it has been over done.

** I can't help with the romance, I'm not even good at writing het. But I don't think that's the major obstacle for you with writing Drarry. The problem is that canon Harry and Draco hate each other. So you need to come up with a believable backstory for SlytherinHarry and Draco to have a different relation to each other.

Now, let's say Harry gets sorted into Slytherin. Even though his first impression of Draco wasn't good, Draco is still the only Slytherin who he knows. And Crabbe and Goyle definitely don't make better friends for Harry than Draco does. Also, Draco could find a friend in Harry, while Crabbe and Goyle could only ever be minions. Of course, this friendship probably would not last if Draco's character evolves the same way as in canon, so for a possible Draco/SlytherinHarry friendship (which later becomes romance) ,Harry would need to influence Draco's development just as much as Draco does with SlytherinHarry's.

I'm not a big fan of the hate turning into love trope, especially not with the kind of hate between canon Harry and canon Draco.

** I agree with [[/u/tkannelid]], but I can't reply to them so I'll just respond to you instead. Whatever you do, make sure the chages happen early and accumulate over a long period of time. There are fics where harry and Draco hate each other, and then, inexplicably, they fall in love and that's that. Don't do that. Instead, change what you need to change (probably lower draco's pompousness and muggle hating a few notches) and move forward from there.

If you wanted a slightly easier task, you could always make him haphne rather than drarry.

Also I love the idea of this fic. Really meta stories are something I love.

*** Yeah, canon Draco is just a little prat with no gravitas. He's a cowardly bully with no depth - he's not a good guy, he's not a good Death Eater, he's just a prat. Taking him seriously in a fic without him being OOC would take some /seriously/ good writing to shift me away from how Rowling wrote Draco.

** Or you could just make it someone like... Pansy Parkinson? Someone who he does actively dislike in canon, but with whom he might strike up a relationship in an alternate universe.

The only motivation I can see for having Malfoy change enough for him not to be an utter scumbag is something really traumatic early in his life... Say, seeing a Death Eater torture and murder someone.

Or maybe having a younger sibling he feels the need to protect and who he suspects may be threatened by Voldemort's rise to power.
