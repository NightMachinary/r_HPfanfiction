As the title says, I want stories where Harry owns a niffler or several nifflers. Bonus points if chaos ensues because of it.

*** When I first read Prisoner of Azkaban and saw the bit about the nifflers being politely puzzled at the attention they were getting in COMC class, I had a mental image of them staring up out of their crates, with big dignified whiskers...or perhaps moustaches.

Can you imagine that? A fancy mole with a moustache?
