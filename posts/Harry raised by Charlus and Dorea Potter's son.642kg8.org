The wiki says that Charlus and Dorea had a son but never given a name or what happened to him. So I am wondering if there are any fanfics out there where Harry is raised by him.


** I don't care what Pottermore says, Charlus and Dorea's son is James Potter. u.u

Not our fault it makes more sense.

EDIT: I mean it purely in a naming scheme sense. I refuse to believe a couple named Euphemia and Fleamont would chose such a plain name for their son.

***** it never made sense because there is no way when showing harry the family tree sirius wouldn't have pointed out harry's grandparents to him.

***** it doesn't make more sense because Dorea wasn't disowned. Sirius uncle Alphard was removed from the family tree just because he left him gold, you'd think if a Black gave him refuge and supported him being a blood traitor they would be removed too. Dorea was also 40 when James was born and rowling stated in early interviews that James parents were elderly.

EDIT: Pottermore says Fleamont was bullied because of his unusual name. Of course he would give his son a normal one

***** Fleamont Potter was the son of Henry Potter (also known as "Harry") who was a pro-Muggle Wizengamot member who caused controversy when he wanted to aid Muggles during the First World War. Henry Potter named his son Fleamont after his mother's maiden name.

There's no reason Fleamont /wouldn't/ give his son the name 'James' given his father's 'normal' name. It also makes sense that James and Lily named Harry after James' grandfather, i.e. Fleamont's father.

** This is actually a good fic idea. After a million stories where Harry is raised by Blacks/Greengrasses/Dumbledores/Weasleys/Hogwarts/random orphanages/Dursleys, one where is raised by a potter who isn't his parent would be quite interesting.

** Fanon has always told Canon to fuck the hell off on this one. Fanon generally accepts that /James/ is the son of Charlus and Dorea Potter, while Fleamont and Euphemia's son died, while canon says it is the other way around.

** I know people get all twisted in knots over how Pottermore 'changed' Harry's grandparents, but doesn't it present an awesome new potential story idea? HARRY HAS FAMILY. Isn't that cool? Cousins and second cousins and new Potters, oh my? No? Nevermind then.
