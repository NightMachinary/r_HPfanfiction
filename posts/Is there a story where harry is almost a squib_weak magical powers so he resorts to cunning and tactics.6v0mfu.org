Harry The Hufflepuff is another story from that author that might be worth reading. It is a comedy piece where Harry has his canon level of power but works hard to be as lazy as possible.

That's BajaB's Harry the Hufflepuff series. Almost a Squib is literally that, Harry is almost a Squib.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** similar theme, this one is sadly incomplete. Its WBWL, but not in a particularly angsty way. Harry is an orphan, and since his relatives are jerks and he isn't the BWL he is largely ignored and has a dead wand, so everyone thinks he is a squib. In the usual cliche fashion this actually makes him eventually uber powerful, but for the first bit he's pretty useless. I kinda wish this premise was borrowed a bit more, as I kinda like it.
