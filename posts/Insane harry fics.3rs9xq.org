  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** The fics linked in this thread are kinda meh in terms of insanity. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6764362/1/][Here's]] a fic where Harry gets sent to Arkham and tortured by the Scarecrow. It's actually pretty quality imo.

Also, clarification: Did you want psychopath type fics (read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/1/The-Snow-Queen][The Snow Queen]] if you want that) or actually insane fics like the one I linked?

**** Great! That means I've got a bunch of other recs for you!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11131988/1/Birth-of-a-Nightmare-Man][Birth of a Nightmare Man]]: This one starts out as a cliched Azkaban fic with some bashing on the side. It changes pace pretty quick around chapter 6. It's the prequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11131988/1/Birth-of-a-Nightmare-Man][The Nightmare Man]] which is also a pretty good Dark Lord Harry fic.

Next up we got [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7244255/1/One-Wizard-Too-Many][One Wizard too Many]] Where Harry finds out that he has effective legal immunity for the duration of the tournament. Oh, and Moony's a shady arms dealer. It's got a great scene where Harry becomes a dentist.

This one's not really Harry, but I still think it deserves a mention: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8706297/1/][Professor Riddle and the Quest of Tenure]], a fic that answers the question, What if Voldemort had been hired as a Defense Teacher. Watch as poor Tom struggles to balance his nightlife with his teaching position and to resist murdering his students.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/][Reunion]]: Luna, Susan, Hermione, and Harry are all time traveling revenge killing psychopaths.

This one is from the Worm fandom, and not the Potter one, but I thin it still fits what you're looking for just because I love this [[https://i.imgur.com/zwh2H.png][motherfucker]] so much. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/to-be-a-queen-worm-fate-stay-night.339838/][To Be a Queen]]: it's a fic where Taylor gets Gilgamesh's powers and his wonderful wonderful personality.

Here's another from the Worm fandom, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/how-i-learned-to-stop-hating-and-love-the-bomb-that-is-nero-worm-au-historical-insert.342737/][How I Learned to Stop Hating and Love the Bomb That is Nero]]. Now I know that this is gonna sound weird, but the main character of this is a reincarnated (historical) Emperor Nero, with all his views on women, marriage, backstabbing and alcohol dumped into a high school girl's body.

This one's got Lord Voldemort as one of the main characters in a buddy cop relationship with Harry as they try to solve a series of disappearances in France. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]]

I'll probably add some more when I think of them.

*** If your going to rec The Nightmare Man, don't forget linkffn(The Birth of The Nightmare Man). It's a prequel, but doesn't require reading TNM first, and honestly I think it's better.

  More than just Sirius died that night at the Ministry. Harry is left strangely empty, driven by one thought, a burning desire for revenge on the witch who killed his Godfather. But the further he goes, the more blurred everything gets. HPBella done right.

**** Unfortunately I don't, that's why BTLCL being unfinished is such a bummer. If you find anything, I'd be interested as well.

If it's any consolation, there's another chapter on DLP WbA...
