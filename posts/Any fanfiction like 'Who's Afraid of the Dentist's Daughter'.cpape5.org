The fanfic is about how Hermione is sorted into Slytherin, she refuses to acknowledge what those like Draco think of her, however her behaviour (Not acting afraid or meek as expected, but rather acting disdainful etc) causes a massive misunderstanding amongst the Slytherins. Older Slytherins believe that she must be from a very imporatant family, whereas those like Draco and Pansy think nothing of it. The next day, Hermione is pranked by Pansy and has an allergic reaction to the herbs used, causing her eyes to go red; This then leads to the entirety of Slytherin believing that she is Voldemort's heir/daughter.

Hermione has no idea that anything is happening, sadly this fanfic has been supposedly abandoned, and I'd like to see something similar if possible :)


** Linkffn(New Blood) is currently being regularly updated and very good!

Hermione tries to convince everyone that she's New Blood, the beginning of a new pureblood line and more pure than anyone else.

When Pansy bullies her she tricks people into thinking Pansy's grandmother is half troll...

She also makes a fortune with MLM makeup.

*** It was too good to be true to have a regularly updated long Slytherin Hermione story. Some of the problems with this one: inconsistencies between the chapters (even consecutive ones), Hermione is too perfect and too good at everything she does, including interpersonal relationships.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))
