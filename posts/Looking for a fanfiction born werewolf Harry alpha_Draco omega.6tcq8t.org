Hello, I need some help to find a fanfiction I fell in love some time ago... It was a Harry Potter (alpha)/Draco Malfoy(omega) fanfic. They were born werewolves. Draco was send by his father to (almost) Harry's pack. there was some Ron/blaise too. There was a competion to choose the new leader of (harry's) pack and draco helped harry win it. there was a run through woods and draco helped him dodging the bear traps. I'm sorry if it's not very clear but it's based on memories only please be indulgent


** Mm...this should probably have the flair 'Fic Search', I think.

For having cliches galore (werewolves distinct from humans, alphas and omegas, Harry/Draco pairing), that actually sounds like a moderately decent fic. I mean, it sounds like it has plot, which is more than you can say for most pairings.

I don't know any fics where Harry and Draco are born werewolves, but funnily enough I do remember one where Harry and Draco were both part of a 'pack', though in that one Draco was estranged from Lucius (to put it lightly); to be precise, it's the Dangerverse, so called because of the existence of the OC 'Danger' Granger, Hermione's older sibling.
