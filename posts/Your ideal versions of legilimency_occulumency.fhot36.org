What do you think a good system of legilimency/occlumency is? I find the "mindscape" system to be the worst and making no sense whatsoever. Of course nothing is going to make perfect sense in a story about magic, but I find that "mindscapes are too much". People create a world in their mind that they have perfect control over and place traps. Legilimency users use legilimency to enter this world and fight these traps while the occlumency user defends. What? Why on earth would you bother creating more traps when you can literally change the world around the legilimency user to force them out? Why on earth would you even place memories out in the open as opposed to a vault? This is only the tip of the iceberg as well.

For me, I think the best system of mind magic is similar to that in canon with a few changes. Legilimency views memories (and only episodic ones to boot) at the same rate as real time, so one can't simply view another's entire life in 2 minutes. It also provides a good explanation as to why people don't learn via legilimency. Why bother learning from someone else's tainted (via their emotions, separate way of thinking, etc) memories when you can learn yourself? Occulumency is about clearing your mind and mastering your emotions. Why? Legilimency works by having the caster (wandless, nonverbal legilimency works by casting the spell) use emotions to bring up memories. If Snape wanted to view memories of Harry's childhood, he'd likely bring up feelings of happiness, security, and of home in Harry only to fail because it would bring up nothing. A trained occlumency user would spend the time clearing their mind or focusing on different emotions/memories and if they get a good enough control over their emotions, they force the legilimency user out.


** I think it's closely tied with emotions as well. And it's one of JKR's accidentally super insightful bits of writing, since memory formation and emotion are closely tied.

There is canon evidence of this is the fact that Vold, who cannot love, cannot access Snape's secrets.

I view occlumency as magical dissociation. And I think legi/occlumency are the best take on mind reading, ever. And Rowling's most fascinating creation. I get so dissapointed when a fic presents it as something that comes naturally or without a price. In mine, I have tried my hardest to portray it very differently.

*** Interesting. Could this mean that a master occlumens could attach weird emotions or detach emotions entirely from memories to ensure they never come up when being attacked?

This also means that a teenager could never learn to protect their mind in this way as it requires mastery of your own emotions, something that comes with age and experience, and not something that can really be taught.

**** Yes, it does mean to detach emotions.

A teenager, however, can learn to master occlumens. A great example would be Draco Malfoy, someone who is known to be a prodigy in occlumens and was even acknowledged by Dumbledore and Snape, both who can't penetrate his shields.

This, on the bad side, has sealed important emotions like empathy and others, allowing him to bully and act like the bastard he is in the series.

**** Well I think it sort of depends on the teenager, in many cases you'd be right on money when you say that teenagers probably couldn't master their emotions.

But what about teenagers with different mental health problems/disorders, for example sociopathic behaviour or even split personality disorders (I realize that there are more these are just examples). What would a legillimency user see in the mind of someone with these symptoms?

My biggest issue in Rowlings' world is that there are supposedly no issues whether physically or psychologically. I mean I get it, magic helps to heal these issues. I still believe that there should be a least cases of people with these kinds of problems in the hp world.

Sorry got off track there. My ideal mind magic would work a little like this. So the eyes are the windows to the soul and to the mind, legillimency users use this connection from the eyes to the brain, which is divided into so many different aspects that reading it like a book seems to be a killjoy. Mindscapes however are possible, if somewhat more limited in real life than in HP. I think it would be cool to use it kind of like two cities connected by a "highway" , and you can either defend it on the "highway" or in your own city.

I don't know if there's a perfect answer to this question simply because everyone views the world in slightly different ways. Some minor, some major differences in view means no two minds would be the same. Idk, just ranted a bit I guess. Sorry.

** As in most fiction, the portrayal many fanfic does is boring beyond belief because it's used in an over the top way.

Like, really, Occlumency is just creating an image in your mind that would, if real, be inescapable? How has no one in your story ever thought of that then? If only the MC (usually Harry, but often whoever he's paired with too) can do it, that's just transparently silly and obvious a way to make them overpowered. It's one thing to have Occlumency help improve the user's memory and concentration (it's makes some sense, but only to an extent), it's another to make them little gods in their minds.

Intentionally or not, JKR created a way more interesting system of telepathy than most any other fictional setting has. It's actually quite sensible, as you say OP. The Occlumens can block out the intruder completely, but then it makes subterfuge hard to justify if the foe is a Legilimens. So, smartly, JKR includes in Occlumency the skill to hide crucial memories and misdirect about one's feelings and motives. Revealing what would throw off the Legilimens, as opposed to just a wall.

And then she goes the extra mile by justifying her choice of how this system works through referencing the nature of the mind itself, explaining why attacking and defending the mind works the way it does. It's very good, and by far my preferred implementation of a system of telepathy.

** Headcanon Occulumency:

- Emotion control
- Improved "control" over the subconscious
- Better memorization/retention/recall (needs upkeep)
- Mental shield (actual shield that you have to upkeep)

The "control" part is moving things to and from the subconscious.

The memory part is longer short term retention of short term memory and easier access of long-term memory. Then, you can take it further by taking specific knowledge/trivia/tidbits and placing them in a third type of memory for that level of recall. This way, you have to meditate to sort the memories, and to maintain your cheatbook.

The shield is just that, a film of magic over everything. Feel an intrusion? Focus more magic to that spot. You just have to maintain that film indefinitely, to the point it becomes subconscious. You can even blanket that shield in emotions.

​

Mindscapes are dumb. The whole fight/trap aspect feels wrong to me. This is a magic book, not a tower defense game... But "Mind Palaces" for meditating/memory sorting/storage is interesting.

​

Edit: I guess I'm saying occulumency is the mastery of your mind. While legilimency is the mastery of entering other people's minds.

** I like to think of it purely as controling your mind, being the master of your thoughts. An occlumens controls his or her stray thoughts and is able to stay focused. A legilimens uses their own menories to try and trigger stray thoughts relating to what they want. That's why some people can read surface thoughts of a person like Dumbledore does (does he?).

** I like the idea that Occlumency defenses are slowly built up by basically using magic to make imagined things "real". The first thing any novice learns is an empty mind, because that's easiest to solidify, but later on, you can place whatever your imagination or memories allow and then "make it real" by mentally infusing it with magic.

Furthermore, I don't like the idea that it can be learned from books, or that there's a better version than what snape taught. What snape was doing was the correct way, as the trick to using magic mentally can't be learned through training, but only through repeated attack. You essentially force your student into a place where they use accidental magic, and then have them channel that magic into their defensive construct. and with time, they learn how to do it without the attack.

Some of the defenses I've read over the years were pretty cool, and the creative ones are very much preferrable to just generic "shields". For example, I read one where the outer layer was basically a metal wall saying "do not enter because you will die", with the second layer being a prepared memory of the unshielded gaze of a basilisk (The memory was possible because Harry entered the limbo state after being killed by its gaze, I think, and then returned while remembering it) So anyone breaking in would see the "made real" memory and die instantly upon encountering it.

Additionally, I like the idea that occlumency is a larger area than just mental defense, with better magical control, eventual perfect memory and such being boons attained through mastership.

** Honestly, I enjoy them all.

Canon is fine for me, but doesn't make for the most engaging reading if the fic is going to be be mind arts centered. Canon Legilimency jumps from memory to memory, though to thought, by tenuous connections or no connections at all. Its clear that the Legilimancer has some method of directing the flow of memory, but it isn't "reading a mind like a book." The Occlumancer tries to clear their mind of emotion and thought to prevent access to memories at all, or at the very least important ones.

I like variations on that where rather than focusing on clearing their mind, the Occlumancer creates inane connections, mazes of useless memories and tenuous connections that they can use to route the attacker into viewing inane and pointless memories as they try to access important information.

I like variations where the mind palace is only an aspect of the process, by which the Occlumancer organizes their mind in such a way that they can clear it more effectively. Thoughts and memories aren't jumbled around unorganized where an attacker can flip through them, they are packed away in appropriate locations. Then, the Occlumancer acts to shield that mind palace from incursion through mental constructs such as walls or traps.

I like variations where the Occlumancer can seal away important memories behind hidden shields and walls while leaving unimportant memories available for the Legilimancer to peruse, thinking that they are seeing everything.

I really like ones where Occlumancy is completely individual. That every witch or wizard has their own personal method for defending their mind, and that their own method will work best for them and others possibly not at all. Maybe clearing the mind works for Snape, but not for Harry, maybe some people focus on a memory that is so strong they can lose themselves in it, preventing any attacker from seeing more than that. Maybe someone else pictures an internal battle between defending mental constructs and attacking mental probes.

​

I do agree with you about learning someones entire life in real time, though I don't think its real time. Remembering things yourself isn't real time, memories are disjointed, and sped up, and removed from such senses as the passing of time. You remember a long car drive taking all day, but it doesn't take all day to remember it. Though maybe that was what you were saying as well.

*** Interesting. I guess I personally just cannot stand mind palaces out of personal preferences. Do you justify the illogical aspects of them like how the traps seem unnecessary if one can merely simply have a mindscape of hell (perfect vacuums, fire, etc)?

To clarify the car drive thing, when you think of it taking a while, the part that knows it took a certain amount of time is semantic (knowing knowledge without sensory information) whereas remembering the experience of the car drive would be episodic. In my ideal version of legilimency, the only way to know the length of the car ride would be to view memories of it near the end where a person would remember how long it took. However, to view everything that happened over the car ride (relevant in learning experiences or interrogations) would require viewing the full eight hours in real time and possibly fighting off attempts at misdirection.

**** I don't think the traps seem unnecessary. In mind palace occlumency as I imagine the benefits are twofold. One, the increased organization helps the user organize their own memories for greater recall. Two it helps them protect them better. Like you are talking about with real time, searching through the mind palace takes time. If Voldemort jumps into an unorganized Harry's mind he can follow links between memories in the blur of thoughts and recollections to jump from memory to memory in order to find what he is looking for. During this time Harry must actively try to clear his mind in order to reject Voldemort while Voldemort is viewing memories. Even if Harry does reject him and the process takes 30 seconds, that's 30 seconds of time for Voldemort to look around and find things.

Now imagine Voldemort enters Harry's mind and finds, not a soup of disorganized memories to peruse through, but a replica of Hogwarts. It will take him time to find where Harry has stored his memories. Does he go to the library first and look for books corresponding to memories? Does he check Gryfffindor tower? Has Harry organized his memories in the Room of Requirement? Say he decides to check Gryffindor tower. First he must gain entry to Hogwarts itself, a fortress of Harry's mind designed to repel intruders. He might not even be able to make it into the mind palace itself, especially if the whomping willow attacks his legilimancy probe, or a mental construct of peeves dive bombs him with distractions.

Voldemort is a good legilimens though, let's say it only takes him 20 seconds to break through the walls. Now he's inside and has to get to Gryffindor tower. Except the suits of armor are attacking him and the staircases are moving randomly and he gets caught in a trick stair. Now he's still in Harry's mind, he gets to Gryffindor tower and opens Harry's trunk and finds memories of Harry doing laundry, packing his trunk, and doing chores. Harry's valuable memories aren't in Gryffindor tower, they are in a hidden chamber in the quidditch broom shed behind dozens of more traps.

This entire time Harry is actively trying to repel Voldemort from his mind. It's been 45 seconds. A rather poor showing on Harry's end but he's managed to evict the intruder from his mind. The intruder who had gained nothing. That's the point of mental traps. It serves as something to occupy abs delay the intruder while trying to eject them from the mind. No one needs to breathe in a mindscape, the vacuum does nothing. What is needed are distractions. Distractions that occupy the attacker while the defender repels them.

With regards to the real time memory I would agree with you that to find out everything about that 8 hour car ride the attacker would need to relive the entirety of it. Except people don't remember things that way. What I think makes more sense is that the attacker would enter the memory, relive 10 seconds associated with getting in the car, flash forward to 5 seconds of passing out treats, 3 seconds of staring blankly at bushes, 5 seconds of feeling interminable boredom, and 10 seconds of getting out of the car along with the emotions associated with those flashes and the general impression of a long car ride. If something important happened on the ride, the person being legilimized would remember that more clearly and it would be one of those flashes that the attacker got when examining the memory of the 8 hour drive.

***** I think it's less the traps are unnecessary as redundant. Firstly, I imagine it would take far more than 45 seconds to do all of the things you mention happening in a hypothetical situation. Walking alone would take more than 45 seconds in a 1:1 time ratio.

Instead of Hogwarts, why not the Atlantic ocean with an oil rig platform? The twist is that the important memories are in a chest buried beneath the ocean floor. Why not a mindscape of pure fire? This would negate the need to even defend as the wizard is either forced out or loses his sanity in these types of systems. Most of the stories with a mindscape have traps that attackers bypass with magical ability translated in from real life. All of the ones I have read have the defending wizard actively defend in a mindscape. The reasons they hold off Voldemort are a combination of traps and their own attacks.

These are traps they will in when constructing a mindscape (which itself is odd, organizing uncorporeal memories into physical objects?). Why not will in a nuke that will destroy everything but the mindscape? A basilisk? A pool of basilisk venom? I think the issues are that reality happening in a mind battle seems ridiculous. Harry and Voldemort dueling in Harry's mind with the only reason Harry ties because he has set up mindscape traps? Why does Harry always use a place with traps like animated statues when he could will in infinitely better traps?

Assuming mindscape systems that can only distract while the wizard repels (how would repelling work is one's mind is a physical location), why not pure fire. That hurts and is a distraction. Banshee screams? Dementor effects?

****** I liked the mindscapes in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense).

In that AU, everyone's magic has an elemental leaning, and their mindscape is and always will be related to that, filled with objects that represent their memories and magical core.

The wizard can reshape the mindscape to some extent, adding defenses and traps out of their own willpower and magic. BUT these are only a visualisation of their defenses, are limited by their magical power (no Death Star for you, Gary Stu), and even a wizard with a mindscape full of flaming spikes can be beaten if the Legilimens can figure out how.

For example, a water elemental might have a river with rocks and fish in it. The source of the river might be their magic, the fish are memories, and the rocks they hide under are the wizard's defenses. The Legilimens wouldn't know that going in. First, they would have to look around with their magic and see what was a memory, what was a fake, what was a trap. Then they would have to get at the fish. If they are more powerful, they can hurl the rocks aside. If they are more skilled, they can sneak in underneath them.

The whole thing becomes more about tricking the other guy so you can use your knowledge advantage to get them out of your mindscape (you know what everything is, the enemy doesn't.)

** I have a very similar head canon on both Legilimency and Occlumency. Legilimency is just a caster trying to subtly (or not so subtly) influence/insert emotions into the targets head, and view the memories attached to those emotions. Occlumency would be less a magical defense, and much more just the mental vigilance to realize first;

a) these aren't my emotions/thoughts, I am being attacked

b) either show them unrelated memories (Focusing on hunger when the legilimens is trying to make you angry and thus showing them memories of food instead) or just focusing on a different memory related to that emotion (the legilimens wants to see a memory of you commiting a crime and makes you feel guilty/ashamed/excited and the occlumens shows them a completely different "secret" where they felt the same emotion)

In my head canon, a "perfect occlumens" is just one who can use occlumency without any interruptions to the conversation/any sign they are focusing on something other than what they appear to be doing, as well as directing their thoughts in a manner that fools a legilimens that they aren't being misdirected. A perfect legilimens, would be somebody who could both use legilimency without being visible about it, and see exactly what memories they are trying to see.

** In my opinion, I think it's really, /really/ important to remember that both Occlumency and Legilimency are inherently magical skills. And, with all magic, there's multiple ways of accomplishing any given task. I mean, with the simple task of getting from point A to point B, there's apparition, portkeys, flying, the knight bus, the floo, phoenix travel, etc. Why should those mental arts be any different?

Do you want to construct a memory palace? Sure. Do you want literal arcane shields blocking entry into your mind? Go for it. Mazes of memories filled with emotional traps? Why not? Hiding memories via disassociation? Yep. Imbuing memories with magic so they can defend themselves? Totally possible.

Legilimency, then, is the art of exploring these defenses and subverting them in equally dynamic ways to try to get at the defended memories.

Also, a side note, I have a theory that magic works best when you give it a single point of failure. The Fidelius charm, passwords on doors, the blood door in the sea cave where the locket was, etc. - basically, you leave only one way in and you can more easily make every other way infeasible. The same would thus apply to occlumency; if you have an emotion-based defence, the attacker would need to find the right combination of emotions to get past, versus a mind-palace defense that requires the attacker to physically navigate a structure to find the memories.

** I think that the best model for Legilimency is basically an interrogation, with an element of torture. However, it's conducted not with words and physical actions but with qualia (thoughts, feelings, mental images, etc.). Occlumency is then training in resisting this type of interrogation and torture.

I like this better than "reading" or "mindscape" analogies, because it makes for a more dynamic interaction that integrates with characters' personalities and the story; and one that advances the theme that powerful magic has a price.

The Legilimens spell, cast with a wand, creates a magical channel between the caster and the target, one that's mostly, though not completely, under the control of the caster. Through this channel, the Legilimens can inject qualia into the target's mind and read the reaction qualia. That's only the beginning, however, because the Legilimens then needs to correctly interpret what they are reading and follow-up with whatever is needed. Most people have enough trouble consciously considering what's going on in their own heads, and interpreting what's going on in other people's heads, and influencing it with any level of accuracy and predictability, requires prodigious levels of general intelligence and working memory, not to mention a lot of practice.

Occlumency is the skill of identifying, dissociating from, and ignoring the injected qualia (i.e., closing one's mind) so that the Legilimens gets nothing. More advanced Occlumency involves forging responses, perhaps through a form of controlled schizophrenia or dissociative identity disorder. (This can be dangerous, to the point of the Occlumens forgetting which of their thoughts are real and which are forgeries. To quote /A Scarlet Letter/, "No man, for any considerable period, can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.")

A hostile Legilimens trying to break through---assuming they don't care about being noticed and the target doesn't have a way of breaking the connection---will be looking to find qualia that the Occlumens can't dissociate from or ignore. Once the Legilimens finds one that elicits an uncontrolled response (as far as the Legilimens can tell), they can push on that, keeping the Occlumens off-balance and sending qualia that get the wanted information and other results. The difficulty of learning Occlumency then stems from the fact that the qualia that can be injected are limited only by the imagination, the experience, and the personal squeamishness of the Legilimens. (It's worth keeping in mind that the Legilimens has to, in some sense, experience everything they are sending, and so, say, sending the notion of extreme pain hurts both sides about equally.)

Now, that means that unlike the Levitation Charm or riding a bike, Occlumency is not discrete skill that one learns and moves on. Rather, it is something that one /becomes/. To successfully resist an all-out attack by a skilled Legilimens, one must /be/ the sort of person who can, say, experience seeing, touching, and smelling a mutilated corpse of one's own best friend, sibling, or child (or worse)---and shrug.

That, in turn, means that Occlumency training is inherently a painful and dangerous process. The instructor must necessarily expose the student to painful, disgusting, and disturbing qualia, because any attack that the student hasn't already experienced and learned to shrug off is one that may surprise them in the future. In other words, if it doesn't hurt, you're doing it wrong, and it may well be the case that the best Occlumency instructor is a sadist or a psychopath who is on your side. Becoming an Occlumens is therefore inherently traumatic and can cause personality changes, often for the worse.

One aspect of Legilimency that favours defence is that Legilimency requires a functioning mind to interrogate, and drugs, sleep deprivation, and other things that might reduce an Occlumens's ability to resist will also tend to reduce the usefulness and the accuracy of the reading. (For a simple example, physically torturing an Occlumens would make it harder for them to maintain the presence of mind needed for Occlumency, but if all the Legilimens can get in response is "Ow, it hurts!", it's not a very useful thing to do.)

Lastly, eye contact creates a weaker, noisier channel, one which only someone who is highly skilled in both Legilimency and Occlumency could read and interpret: Occlumency is necessary to distinguish the weak "signal" of the incoming foreign thoughts from the "noise" of one's own mind, while skill in Legilimency is needed to make sense of the very noisy "signal". That would be the "wandless" version of Legilimency, which isn't a discrete spell at all, as much as it is the ability to receive and interpret stray foreign thoughts. A mind artist of sufficient skill (e.g., Voldemort) might be able to sense and "denoise" thoughts and feelings even without eye contact.

The Memory Charm interacts with Occlumency in an interesting way. I imagine that it has two targeting modes: recent memories (e.g., "last 10 minutes") and specific memories. The first one is pretty easy, and it's what's used most of the time, though perhaps beyond half an hour or so, memories become increasingly integrated, and trying to target anything older than that risks hitting unrelated memories. The second targeting mode requires the target memory to be brought up using Legilimency. This makes it very difficult to Obliviate a skilled Occlumens without them noticing.

These mechanics have broader consequences, which I think are pretty consistent with HP canon. Since Legilimency is *hard*, there are usually much easier ways to extract information. Therefore, even people who could make use of it don't bother to learn it. This rarity of good Legilimences means that even people with secrets to keep are fine without Occlumency; and this, combined with the price of learning it means that few people learn Occlumency as well, even if they have the opportunity to.

** I like the mindscape/ mind palace type thing. But,. I really like Sherlock. So, when they make their mind like a house or library, and tuck memories away or whatever the author will have happen, I don't mind it. I like that. I also like the thought of creating walls and barriers and traps.

*** Well the mindscape thing, rather ironically, in Sherlock is a very common mnemonic technique. What's actually happening isn't that memories are being placed within a mind palace but a image of a physical location is created in one's mind with the things you'd like to remember and stored as a new memory.

However, I totally understand why'd you enjoy it in a story as a result of Sherlock. It's misrepresented in Sherlock and the show is really good.

** mindscapes are real. a memory of a place and traps are memories too. even if they're fictional. i figure snape was trying to teach harry how to think of nothing under pressure. a memory of thinking of nothing is a memory you could sink into and your attacker would have to stay there too. emergency occlumency for dummies.

** For me, occlumens is like creating a safe with many different compartments. Clearing your mind could be that you're sorting through your memories and placing them in different compartments. This would mean that your memories aren't jumbled up in a pile and instead, in smaller compartments, allowing for more empty space to build a ward around those compartments.

These wards, however, tend to lock up more than just memories. Like in the case of Draco Malfoy, these wards can also lock up emotions. This, however, can sometimes be manipulated and used to ones own advantage. For example, sealing in your sadness so to not deal with the grief of losing a beloved. Or sealing your empathy so you can kill someone so on and so forth.

For Legilimens, on the other hand, it would be like picklocking. The locks are different for different people. This is why its so hard to be a good legilimens. Once they're able to unlock the 'safe', they get full access to their memories. But here comes another tricky part. They have to find out where the memory they want is. From what I know and see, it could be that emotions does play a part in what memory you get. So, I do agree with your theory on that.

Well, that's just my thoughts of it. Never really thought much of it but it's an interesting topic to think about.

** If you're interested, I'd recommend you try reading Harry Potter And The Prince Of Slytherin. Besides the fact that it's one of the best fanfics I've read with conspiracies and different views on magic galore, the author created one of the best (in my humble opinion) variations of the mind arts. It is a WBWL type, but the author does really well in explaining why the brothers were treated differently.

**** I suppose I could see that. I tend to binge-read it as much as possible. which makes those little things seem.. well, even less important than otherwise. Regardless, if you've read it then you're already read on how the author portrayed the mind arts.
