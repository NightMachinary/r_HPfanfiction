  Everything was being stacked against Kahina Sulieman; she was unable to marry the man she (almost) tolerated, she was unable to hold her son before handing him over to perfect strangers, and she was unable to show her face.The war was brewing to a violent apex, and the lasting effects would be far-reaching.
