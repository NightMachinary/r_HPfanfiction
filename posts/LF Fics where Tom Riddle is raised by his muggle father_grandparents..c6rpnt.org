**** Have you read linkffn(13103526) ?

One of the best Riddle family portrayals in fanfic, in that they don't act and sound like modern day people people in dress up, which is one of my biggest issues with fics taking place outside the canon era. It genuinely captures the feel of 1940's Britain.

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend". But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle. (1930's Childhood Friends AU)

****** It's more Tom Riddle-centric than a Hermione fic, but what there is of her isn't wanky, especially in the intro when she's presented as the annoying know-it-all like the Hermione of Philosopher's Stone.

I saw it recommended and [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and gave it a read, and it avoids most people's pitfalls with the "brightest witch of her age" characterizations of Arithmancer!Hermione or Starfox!Hermione.

******** The dialogue in that fic is so well written. I like reading intelligent characters being intelligent, and nothing sells it for me quite like a well spoken protagonist who is actually witty. Kind of why many fanfic Harry's seem like edgy edgelords instead of being likeable or sympathetic, because the authors can't write his patented backtalking snark. ("I'm listening to the news. It changes every day, you see.")

My favorite dialogue has to be "Riddle has his killing face on!".

**** I love this aspect of the fic too. It's practically a commedy about a 'New Money' family trying to con their way into high society, but in this case the Riddles apply their well-learned lessons from muggle social climbing to pull one over on all the wizards.

The author's skill with dialogue combined with the well written period setting serve to make this one of my favorite fics.

Ron, Harry, Hermione, Draco, etc were all living in the late '30s-early '40s time period, and Dumbledore was both young and old and neither at the same time. James and Lily and co are still alive as well, it all got confusing really fast.
