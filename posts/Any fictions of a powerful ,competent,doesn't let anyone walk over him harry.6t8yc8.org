Hello, wondering if any one could recommend any harry potter fanfictions where harry is:

~powerful,doesn't need to be instantaneous,he could grow into it as he gets older.

~Doesn't buy into the whole hogwash of dark or light magic but believes in power and intent and what the magic is used for.

~IF he was with dursleys and abused doesn't let them go Scott free. Way too many fanfictions let the dursleys get away with all the things they did to him.(I personally would have beat Vernon and Dudley to an inch of their lives while petunia watched since that's what she always enjoyed doing/but maybe that's just me/).Well that's if he was with them though,doesn't matter if he grows up away from them or his mum and dad survived.

~doesn't have to be at Hogwarts but if he is would rather if he wasn't friends with Ron(with a friend like that who needs enemies?) Doesn't have to be friends with Hermione but if he is it would be okay.

~now, a female love interest like calypso rosier from harry potter and the boy who lived would be awesome or an awesome o.c love interest don't care if she's a witch or muggle.not a priority tho.

~won't mind for any Dumbledore bashing,while I may never call him evil,he's gross negligence,inane notion of love and manipulation really irked me after I read the books and stopped to think about everything. Anyway Dumbledore or no Dumbledore bashing. Doesn't matter.

~Please NO SLASH OR HAREMS.not into those please.

Thanks for all the help. Hit me with everything you got!!


** This is like the majority of HP Fanfiction. Just search "powerful" on ffn or ao3 and you'll get a lot of results. Check out the popular communities on ffn. There are a couple that have lists of stories matching your description.

*** What's ao3,and Maybe my description is a bit too vague,what am really looking for is a well written harry I can relate to or understand his logic behind his actions a good example I know of is the harry from harry potter and the boy who lived. He's sensible,power is growing,he's smart and the book is easy and fun to read,try it if you haven't.

** Search "Independent!Harry" or "Manipulative!Dumbledore" on any fanfiction sites and take your pic. Granted, most of those stories aren't GOOD, but the premise is uber-common.

*** True it's common but am looking for GOOD. The stories are a dime a dozen really tired of searching through them all.

**** Ah. Well, sorry, can't help you there... in my experience, those requirements are pretty much going to guarantee that I hate the story, so I don't know any good ones.

****** Sorry, no... I don't like "Dark!Harry" stories. They tend to be a little too hypocritical for my tastes, with Harry declaring Dumbledore and the Weasleys Scum For Life in the same breath as cursing and torturing and bullying people.

** I prefer this kind of Harry as well. Tbh, you have a lot of specific conditions here and that's fine but I'm not sure I can deliver. I do however have links to fics where Harry is confident and/or competent and they are mostly well written. Mostly AU and some crossovers.
