This is a story I read a few years ago on fanfiction.net. I think it's called the sorcerers apprentice... Or something similar. All I remember was that Harry was inventing products. It may have been considered alchemy, or spell creation. He had opened a store at the end of the story, but no one knew he owned it. He worked in it as a helper in the grand opening.

I'm pretty sure this was a complete story. I don't remember and pairings, and I don't remember anything about voldemort at all.

Thanks in advance! And I'd love to read anything similar, particularly anything where Harry makes stuff.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086/1/Almost-a-Squib][Almost a Squib]] by BajaB has Harry finding all kinds of ways to work around his condition including Mcgyvering some magic related inventions.

It's also well written and very funny.

** I think I may have read this. Did the shop have "enchantment" or something similar in its name? I will look through my bookmarks and things, but I don't know if I'll find it :/

*** Yes! I completely forgot about that. I'll have to include it in my searches.

** This sounds like something I would be interested in reading. I've looked around and haven't found anything though. If I stumble across it I'll make sure to post the title here. I'm actually rather disappointed in myself, I'm generally pretty good at knowing what fics people are looking for. Oh well, guess I'll just have to read some more. Oh shucks.
