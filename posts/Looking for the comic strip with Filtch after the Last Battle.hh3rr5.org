Mr Filtch runs from the castle towards The Trio standing on the bridge (as in the film end of the Deathly Hallows 2) and cries “Mr Potter, Mr Potter, could you please not break the most powerful wand in the world and help us with the fixing of the castle?”. Something of that kind.

Does anybody know what I am talking about? (and yes, this could be the prompt as well)
