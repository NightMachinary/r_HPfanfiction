Was wondering if anyone would enjoy a cute fluffy oneshot(or LF) about (fifth or sixth year) Luna perhaps taking some first year Ravenclaws under her wing? I think though she is an outcast with her peers and those in the years above her perhaps first years might become endeared to her gentle and understanding nature? She might help comfort some nervous students who are scared to be away from home for the first time or feel a bit lonely. Luna might also partake in what older students would see as childs passtimes or games with them like hide and seek or whatever. As younger students they might be more accepting of Luna and find her odd ways and stories enchanting rather than weird? Anyone like to read anything like that? I just find it heart warming to imagine this small group of first years all running around after Luna vying for her attention haha

** Heck, I'll do it. I love Luna.

--------------

"Alright then, first years this way. Come along and keep up." One of the new Ravenclaw prefects, Selene Selwyn barked. The first years, a crowd of six boys and four girls followed Selene and the new fifth year boy prefect, John Evans.

Luna Lovegood rose from the table slowly as the rest of the students of Ravenclaw House filed their way out the Great Hall. She looked wistfully at her seat. It was a nice seat, not far from the doors of the Great Hall but not too close that the drafts from the doors opening would touch her.

Luna frowned for a moment. Her friend, Harry Potter, had come into the Great Hall late. He had had some blood on his shirt--he hadn't been wearing his robes, for some reason. Luna hadn't had a chance to speak to him--Houses weren't allowed to intermingle during the Opening Feast, but she would be allowed to sit with the Gryffindors in the morning. Splendid that--the breakfasts at Gryffindor had more apples and pears.

Luna saw a mane of red hair near the end of the Gryffindor table. Ginny Weasley was holding hands with Dean Thomas. Ah, yes--Ginny had mentioned that they were going out together. Ginny was quite nice but Luna didn't know much about Dean. Luna hoped they would get along. It wouldn't make sense to go out with someone if you didn't get along with them.

Luna began skipping as she ascended the many staircases up to Ravenclaw Tower. It made the trip, otherwise rather long, all the more enjoyable. In short order, she caught up to the rest of the Ravenclaws who were walking in a somewhat more formal fashion.

"Listen up now! We do not have a password! Ravenclaw Tower requires you to be able to think if you want to enter!" Selene snapped. Luna frowned; Selene was not a nice person. Luna suspected Selene was the one who stole and hid many of her possessions. It was all in good fun--Luna had found hidey-holes in many parts of the castle she otherwise wouldn't have visited regularly. Still...Selene often said mean things. Luna wasn't sure she would make a good Prefect.

Selene knocked on the door with the Eagle Knocker twice. The knocker's voice, somewhat mystical, sounded its question:

/Give me food and I live. Give me water and I die. What am I?/

Selene cleared her throat: "You are fire."

"Correct."

While it was certainly an answer to the question, Luna wasn't sure it was the best one. It seemed a little too straight forward. She preferred riddles that had multiple answers and she began to think about them.

"Um...Miss Selwyn? Is it going to be the same question every time?"

The speaker was one of the smallest first years Luna had ever seen. She had slightly dark skin and very dark hair. Her voice seemed almost unnaturally quiet.

"What's your name?"

"Maggie. Maggie Dresden."

"Well, Maggie, let's think for a moment. Do you think that it'd be a good idea to have the same question over and over?"

"Um..."

"It wouldn't be. It'd be a stupid thing to do to have the same question every time. It'd be no better than a password."

"Oh...

"Listen up first years, if you don't get the answer right, then you're going to have to wait for someone better to come along and let you in. This is Ravenclaw and we value intellect. And you Maggie, something tells me you're going to spend a lot of time outside."

It seemed like the entire Common Room laughed that time.

Later that night, Luna got ready for bed. She was mad. She didn't like going to bed mad. It always made for uncomfortable dreams. Not even hugging her stuffed rabbit, Nibbles, made her feel better.

"/Is it going to be the same question every time?/"

Luna frowned as Selene and two of her other dormitory mates broke into a fit of mean-spirited giggling. It wasn't funny to make smaller students feel inferior for not knowing as much. It would be like trying to judge a fish or a dog for not climbing trees as well as a cat. Luna could climb trees--she had spent a weekend at the Burrow and she and Ginny had spent most of their time together in the orchard--but she knew Selene couldn't.

Luna crawled under the covers of her four-poster bed. Her mind was made up. That little first year Maggie needed a helping hand. Luna would provide it for her.

*** Part II

The best way to help someone, Luna thought, was not to draw overt attention to the fact that you were helping someone. It would be best for all parties involved--Maggie would get the helping hand she needed, but Luna would take care to make sure that nobody would think less of Maggie. That way, Maggie could grow without becoming too reliant and if Luna were ever unable to help her...If something happened during the War...then Maggie would still be fine.

It worked in nature too. The Crumple-Horned Snorkack was an excellent devourer of weeds in cornfields, but couldn't be held in captivity, due to its migratory patterns. If a farmer tried to put a saddle or plow on one, the Snorkack would suffer horribly, and the farmer would have two problems.

Luna pulled on her robes and slipped on a thin blue scarf. She would walk Maggie down to breakfast and introduce her to Ginny. And maybe Harry and Neville and Ron and Hermione too. A well-rounded Hogwarts experience should involve all the Houses.

Luna skipped down to the Common Room and waited. She had woken up even earlier than she usually did, as she didn't want to miss Maggie.

Maggie was one of the first students after her, but she still looked as confused and bewildered as she had the previous evening.

"Good morning, Maggie." Luna smiled. "It's nice to meet you."

"Who...who are you?" Maggie blinked big, brown eyes.

"My name is Luna Pandora Lovegood."

"You shouldn't say your full name like that..." Maggie mumbled. "It can be bad if bad people hear it."

"Is it?" Luna asked. She had read that spells similar to the Trace, which tracked underage magic, could be linked to the enunciation of certain words, but she hadn't given much thought to names.

"Well thank you Maggie," Luna smiled in a way she hoped was reassuring. "Let's go down to the Great Hall then and have a bit of breakfast then."

"Um...okay..."

Maggie began walking. Luna, ever tempted to skip, slowed her pace so that Maggie could keep up. The little first year had a very short gait and confused eyes. Poor little thing probably had a Wratspurt. Luna felt a ping of guilt; she had probably passed it on to her from Harry.

"How are you liking Hogwarts, Maggie?"

"It's okay...It's different than what I'm used to. There's a lot of sky and a lot of trees."

The trees were wonderful. So many kinds. Pine trees and fir trees and all the ones in the Greenhouses. Luna was especially fond of a beech tree near the Lake that she and Ginny would study under.

"Your accent...It's not from Britain, is it?"

"I'm from America..." Maggie looked down. "Daddy sent me here because he thought it'd be safer."

Luna thought for a moment. "Hogwarts is very safe. Professor Dumbledore is the only man that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is afraid of."

"You mean Voldemort?"

Luna blinked in surprise. She had become accustomed to people to saying the name, to the point where she even fell into the habit herself. But Maggie, a little first year, spoke his name casually.

"Why, yes. He's a very dangerous and Dark wizard, but he fears Dumbledore."

"He should be afraid of my dad."

"Oh, is your father an Auror?"

"...sort of...he's special...he's going to find and take down Voldemort..."

"And what about your mother? What does she do?"

Maggie had looked proud, brave even when describing her father. But her face fell.

"My mother died...I was eight...I saw it happen."

Luna halted. They had reached the bottom of the staircase and were right outside the Hall. Luna looked over her shoulder. There were several students a flight above them, plus a few more in the foyer. She took Maggie's hand and squeezed it gently.

"When I saw it happen, I was nine...you will see your mother again, Maggie...I promise."

"I know I will...I just wish...I miss her."

Luna bit her lip. A good cry could do anyone a world of good, but Maggie probably needed breakfast now more than anything.

"I miss my mother too...that's never going to go all the way away....but I still have Daddy and my friend Ginny. She makes me feel better when I'm sad."

"I have my dad and my dog Mouse...and Mister and Missus Carpenter...and Harry..."

"You know Harry already?" Luna was mildly surprised. Harry hadn't mentioned wizarding neighbors before.

"Um...I think it's a different Harry."

Luna took Maggie's hand again and led her into the Great Hall.

**** Part 3

--------------

Luna smiled as she sat across from Ginny and Dean. Ginny returned her smile, and Dean nodded politely. Maggie looked at the seats uncertainly.

"It's alright, you can sit."

Luna liked that about Ginny. She was very welcoming...well, mostly welcoming, she didn't seem to like Fleur very much--Luna had gotten a rather grumpy letter about Ginny's brother's girlfriend. Ginny was very welcoming to small first-years.

"So...you're a fifth year like Luna?"

"Yes," Ginny nodded. "This is our O.W.L. year."

"Sixth year," Dean said politely. He smiled at Maggie. That made Luna happy. If more people smiled, the world would be nicer.

"And the teachers..."

"Professors," Ginny corrected. "You'll have Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, Potions, History of Magic, Astronomy and you'll take flying lessons later in the term."

"...I have to take Astronomy...at nighttime?"

"Yes. It's the rule." Dean nodded.

"I know a little bit about potions...my dad's made them...he says they're dangerous."

"And he's right! But you'll have Slughorn, he's new. Or new to us at least." Ginny took a bite of oatmeal. "Maggie, do have a bit of toast and some oatmeal. You look a bit peaky. Take a pear."

Luna helped herself to some cereal as Maggie took a pear nervously. Ginny was very much like her mother.

"And Defense Against the Dark Arts...my dad's told me a bit about that too. And Molly...she's sort of my sister...kind of..."

"A lot of kids here have lost family members in the War," Ginny said softly.

"I'm not exactly from here..." Maggie mumbled. "I miss Mouse..."

Luna patted Maggie gently between the shoulders. It wasn't the most effective treatment for Wratspurts, but it was the most comforting.

--------------

"Luna! He's evil! He's evil!"

Maggie looked to be on the brink of tears.

"Who's evil?"

"Professor Snape...he said...he said...things about my dad..."

"Could you elaborate, please?"

Maggie opened her mouth but dissolved into tears. Luna knew that sometimes the best thing a cry needed was to be allowed to be let out, but it didn't seem feasible to guide Maggie back to their Tower to cry there and then back to class. She heard Maggie's stomach rumble weakly. Lunch it was then.

Luna took Maggie by the hand and guided her over to the Gryffindor table again. Ginny and Dean weren't there but Harry and Neville were. Hermione was sitting further down the table, her face red with temper.

"Harry, Neville--this is my friend Maggie. She's most upset."

"What's wrong?" Neville's brow furrowed.

"Professor Snape said something upsetting about her father."

Maggie had begun to shake. Luna hesitated but began rubbing her shoulder.

Harry looked up, "Professor Snape went to school with my father...and he's said many bad things about him. I reckon this is probably the same thing."

"My dad's from America...he didn't go to Hogwarts...we don't belong here...I want to go home..."

"I know it's scary," Neville placed a hand on Maggie's. Luna looked at Neville's hand, it was larger than hers or Harry's, with calluses from and small scars from digging in his greenhouses. She looked at her own hands--smaller but her fingers were rather long and skinny.

"Don't worry Maggie...I am always going to be here," Luna put an arm around Maggie's shoulder.

"You don't have to tell us what happened."

"Hey Luna, is that your little first year?" Ron Weasley slid in next to Harry and began piling himself a plate of food. Sausages, steak-and-kidney pie, steamed potatoes... "Eat up first year so you can grow big and strong."

Maggie blinked her dark brown eyes once, twice.

"Thank you."

***** Part 4

--------------

Flying was always something to look forward to. Luna wasn't nearly as skilled at Quidditch as Ginny, but she still enjoyed flying very much. Flying was a superb way to get rid of Wratspurts.

It was a pity that the first year Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs weren't having a lesson on a Friday afternoon. That way, Luna could have watched. She hoped Maggie would do alright at it--the school brooms were often rather old and hard to control. Luna suspected in the broom cupboards there may be infestations of Catapulting Silverfish--nasty little vermin that caused vertigo.

As it was, it was time for Transfiguration. Luna enjoyed the classes, she had a bit of a knack of them. And she got to sit next to Ginny, which was very nice.

"Hey Loony! That's my seat!"

"Is it?" Luna frowned. She had sat next to Ginny every class period for almost a year. But if Professor McGonagall wanted her to switch her seat, she would.

"Yeah, Loony--your seat's in the hall, so we can't catch the stupid."

"Don't call her that!" Ginny's eyes flashed dangerously. "Her! Name! Is! Luna! And she's not stupid!

"Thank you Ginny." Luna took her seat. "I apologize for the disturbance, Professor McGonagall."

"You've no part in this, Miss Lovegood. Miss Weasley, I'll remind you to keep your voice to a respectable decibel."

"Thank you."

"Yes, Professor."

Luna listened as Professor McGonagall lectured them about their upcoming O.W.L.s. Ginny seemed very tense. Luna reached out a hand from under their desk and patted Ginny's. Ginny's hands were different from her hands or Neville's. Slightly smaller than hers, with fingers that were a little wider and soft and warm. Ginny's hand felt like a hug. Luna liked hugs.

Luna made a note to check on Maggie at dinnertime. She wondered what Maggie's hands were like.
