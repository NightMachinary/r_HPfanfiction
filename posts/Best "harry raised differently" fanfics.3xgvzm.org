For comparison, A Song Of Ice And Fire is just around 2 million words, and I think I'm over shooting that.

The full Malazan Cycle is around 3.2 million words.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

*** I'm surprised you didn't like the ending to the sacrifices fic; I was pretty happy with it. You've mentioned a few others have disappointing endings - would the endings compare? Do you rate them on a scale? For example, would you consider the ending of sacrifices better or wiser than your other picks. Am curious to know before i start. Thanks!

**** I was disappointed with it because he was constantly whining through half the books about how hard it's gonna be for him to free all these creatures when so many powerful people want to preserve the status quo, and then he basically consumes all of Voldemort's power and throws it all away. With some bullshit handwave like sharing it with sea water and whatnot.

The other disappointing one was Mastermind hunting. Here too Harry grew OPed and then smacked his head on an idiot ball. Only here he screwed up not only himself, but also almost triggered an end-of-the-world scenario to happen.

*********** Yes - the purpose of WbA is for a writer to receive critical feedback on first drafts of work. It's a great way to get helpful feedback that varies anywhere from helping rephrase bad sentences structures and correct spelling mistakes, to discovering that you've made significant mistakes like getting canon details wrong or needing to change entire plot points.

It's not uncommon for a second draft of a story to look completely different. That's why it's important to a lot of authors that the only people who read their first drafts are the people providing that critical feedback - you don't want people to read what might change significantly when you're finished with it, particularly since most people aren't going to read a chapter twice.

Thank you for removing the link. :)

********* Please take this link down. Neither Santi nor DLP has given any permission for his property to be taken outside of the forums. It is incredibly disrespectful to the author that someone would do this. Taking it for personal use it one thing, taking it to share with other people is another. Santi made a conscious decision not to post the extra chapters on ffnet or elsewhere and keep them on DLP. He's not dead, he visited the forums a couple months ago.

If Santi ever wants to post this somewhere else, he will. Until then, you guys can grow up, take a few minutes out of your day and post a small amount of posts in the forums to gain access, and be done with it. It's childish to assume everything on the internet is for your viewing pleasure, and if it isn't, you have the right to take it without the author's permission.

We tried to reason with the creator of this google doc, PmMeFanFic, I assume, but he didn't care. All he did was write a disclaimer at the top and then ignored everything we said afterwards.

There is no problem with taking something that is free and redistributing it for the benefit of everyone. If the author doesn't want me to see his Fic, he can keep it private. He instead choose to make people jump through hoops to gain access. That is ofc his decision, but I don't think you can fault people for creating shortcuts.

*********** Moral high ground fallacy, really? No, man, no. Get the hell off your high horse. I've tried being nice in this sub, I really have. All I've gotten are downvotes and people who refuse to adhere to basic social niceties.

We're on the same side. Neither one of us want authors to feel as if their work is being stolen, plagiarized, or removed from their control. It is THEIR property, not yours to do as you see fit. This isn't a fallacy. If you want to call it a fallacy, then so be it. I *do* see myself as better than you if you can't understand the simple fact that authors own whatever piece of writing they're working on. There *is* a problem with taking something free and redistributing it for the benefit of everyone if the /author doesn't want you to/. These aren't fucking hoops to jump through. It's making a motherfucking account on a motherfucking site and making a few motherfucking posts to access the motherfucking story.

Our WbA isn't for your pleasure or amusement. Everything is not about you and your ability to get things that you want. Our WbA is for authors first and foremost, and people who want to help authors be better second. People like you, who just want to read the fic without giving feedback aren't even on our radar. We don't care if you do it, but we aren't going to fucking *help* you do it. That's why these aren't hoops for you to jump through to get access, we don't fucking CARE if you have access. The first two groups, the people that actually matter, do have access.

If you want to join our site and participate, we welcome you with open arms. If you want to join our site just to read fanfics, that's fine too. But don't fucking complain about having to spend a few minutes to make a few posts in a forum that encompasses everything from politics to My Little Pony to satiate yourself on fics that authors don't want released to the public yet.

But no, go stick your fucking fingers in your ear like a goddamn 10 year old and cry fallacy, because my fucking 2 year old nephew understands why taking stuff without permission of the owner is morally wrong. I'm sorry that I assume would as well. Where the fuck do you get off by saying you have the authority to take someone's work and release it to the public against their wishes?

************ Please consider looking up the meaning of the fallacy. In this case the moral high ground fallacy refers to calling people childish for disagreeing with you. I would argue that the author of original literature has the right to decide what can and cannot be done with his work. Fanfiction of copyrighted material does not fall in that catergory. It is a grey zone that can not be legally enforced, therefore any adherance to the authors wishes are strictly on a voluntary basis. If I wish to consume content provided in the WbA forum with the intent of deriving pleasure or amusement from it, that is entierely up to me. The rest of the third paragraph is just boasted with unfounded assumptions and will therefore be skipped. I will and have joined the DLP community in all its glory and I'm not complaining about putting in the posts. I am merely stating that some people do not want to be bothered with joining a community that is basically the Fanfic equivalent of /v/ when it comes to arogancy. While this is exacly the type of cynical enviroment I prefer, it is certanly not everyones cup of tea. The reason I removed the link hours before you responded with your wall of anger is, that I do agree that beta work should not be read by everyone.

Telling people to behave morally on an anonymous forum seems senseless. If I feel like doing something, I will do it as long as it doesn't violate any laws.

************* Legality has no place in this discussion. The author writes fanfiction for zero monetary gain, so it is entirely up to them to continue. If the author does not wish it to be made public yet, then it should not be made public. Period. If the author feels that only certain individuals should be able to read it, then we must oblige their wishes. It's not a matter of legality, it's matter of decency. Thank you for taking the link down, it means a lot. But fanfiction is entirely based upon a good-natured relationship between the author and his/her readers.

** linkffn(Harry McGonagall) and linkffn(Harry Potter McGonagall) where Harry is raised by Minerva's nephew and his family. They're really sweet but don't have much conflict.

linkffn(Harry Crow) has a Harry raised by the goblins of Gringotts. Haven't read it, but most everyone on this sub seems to hate it. Robst commonly employs Mary-Sues and Gary-Stus, so if you don't like those tropes then don't bother.

*** I liked Harry Crow. Yeah, it was over-the-top in a lot of places, but I liked the interpersonal relationships and the worldbuilding. It kept me entertained for almost two weeks (damn thing's like 700K+ words) and that's all I want from fanfiction.
