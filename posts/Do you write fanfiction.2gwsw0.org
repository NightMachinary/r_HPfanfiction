Do you write fanfiction? Are you thinking of writing fanfiction? Or do you just read fanfiction?

If you do write, link to your profile (if you want) and I'm sure people would love to check it ou!


** I wrote fic back in the early 00s when I was in middle/high school. It was Pokemon, Digimon, and a single chapter of some Harry/Draco fic I was trying out. My Pokemon and Digimon fics were a hit on ffn back in the day, so I thought I was such a good writer. And when I got into Harry Potter I knew I wanted to write something.

Aaaand it sucked. I realized pretty quickly the quality of fics in the HP fandom were so much higher than the anime fandoms I previously was in and my skills just weren't there. That was the end of my short-lived fan fiction writer career. Haha.

Currently I have one somewhat smutty [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10256543/1/Nymphadora-s-Beau][ongoing Harry/Tonks fic]] and once that's done I'll be going back to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9406757/1/One-Misfired-Spell-Later][a Harry/Hermione/Fleur multichapter]] which I'm not particularly proud of (it was too unplanned) but people seem to like it so I'll try to do better in the continuation.

I also write a lot of shorter stories, some no more than a drabble, some completed one-shots.

I'm still amazed by how many people read my fics each time I get a review.

****** That didn't sound quite right but I wasn't sure so I had to [[http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/USCSS_Nostromo][look it up]]. It was a freighter/tug. Much less romantic than a ship mining in the farthest reaches of deep space. There's not really one ship that sticks out to me as fitting the description of deep space miner though, as in most universes they simply exist in the background or are canon fodder representative of how fucked the local area and/or hero is. As for research spacecraft, there are far too many to name individually, but I think Destiny from SGU fits the best: 700 million light years from normal but somehow everything works out for the best, and you learn a whole lot along the way.

That did mining. Which is why it hauled a hugeass refinery behind it, along with the ore.

Ugh. Don't remind me of that abortion of a show. All the worst parts of the SG universe, combined with trying to be Battlestar Galactica (another horrible soap opera) as well. I had managed to forget for several months. SG: Atlantis was better, which is awful to have to acknowledge.

But then again, Harry/Tonks is almost never part of a well-thought-out, /finished/ fanfic, so it sort of fits in that way.

********* And a fishing ship doesn't actually do the fishing within its own hull, it hauls around nets to collect the fish, and afterward holds the fish in its hold.

The people on board were space miners, hauling around automated mining equipment. The ship Nostromo was a tug for hauling that equipment. Your website of choice is simply one that doesn't use the term "mining" for the Nostromo itself. From the first page of Google results.

[[http://alienanthology.wikia.com/wiki/USCSS_Nostromo]]

#+begin_quote
  The USCSS Nostromo (reg. 180924609) was a $42 billion (and adjusted) dollar *mining vessel* owned by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, a Lockmart CM 88B Bison M-Class starfreighter used as a commercial hauler between Thedus and Earth. The Nostromo was 243.8 meters in length, 164.6 meters wide and 72.5 meters in height. It also carried (or rather pulled) a massive refinery behind it for processing ore on the long trip to Earth.
#+end_quote

That isn't even a very interesting argument. I'm shipping space mining and the Nostromo, and the facts and basic ontology of the sci-fi setting back me up.

Just like Harry/Tonks, there might have to be a lot of extra stuff to haul around along with the ship to make it work. But everything still fits together and you should call both what they are.

Fully functional drilling operations.

** Yep, I write. Done over a quarter of a million words worth so far, much of it published. Did one huge chuck of a story for NaNoWriMo one year, then started writing original fiction as well. Three novels currently in progress.

Here I am on [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/TimeLoopedPowerGamer/profile][AO3]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Etimeloopedpowergamer][Fanfiction.net]]. Be warned: one of my AO3 stories is just straight-up porn. Also, it is pretty good if I do say so. Not an HP fic, however, though I am working on one of those.

The other two, also on FFN, are a Naruto and a Harry Potter story. Neither are finished but they aren't abandoned either. I did just update /Witch Queen/, so there is that. Haven't updated the Naruto story on AO3 with all completed chapters yet, for some reason. Hmm...

As for how good they are, I couldn't really say, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][Harry Potter and the Witch Queen]] has over 100,000 views in its lifetime and is in 31 communities. The Naruto story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8782164/1/Secret-Treasures-of-the-Uchiha][Secret Treasures of the Uchiha]], isn't quite as popular, but was also well received. Both would be more popular if I'd just finish them already.

I also read fanfic like a hungry badger. Can't say I really care for short one-shots, as my favorite stories are always at least novel sized (80k+ words).

**** What was yours about?

Mine was focused on the time when Remus/James/Peter weren't talking to Sirius because of the Snape/Wumping Willow incident.

It was the angstiest piece of writing I've ever seen in my entire life.

It had everything, characters telling others they hate each other, the threat of Remus being executed for being a werewolf, self harm/suicide attempt.

Good lord it was so angst ridden.

I thought mine was great too when I wrote it. Now though...

However, every now and then I get an alert telling me someone favourited or followed me because of that story.

***** Mine was before the Whomping Willow thing, so everybody was pretty tight still. It's basically like a soap opera, where James and Sirius overhear Remus having sexy dreams about Sirius, and the events that follow from that. Sirius is hypocritically homophobic at first, while James is totally supportive and stuff, and Remus angsts for a bit before he and Sirius end up kissing in the last chapter. It's a sweet story, but the characters are pretty shallow, looking back on it. If I were to rewrite it, I'd make the homophobia into a bigger conflict, and I'd make James a more complex character as well.

I am in the process of changing things around atm but right now I write mostly gen, and occasional slash. My favorite character focus is Harry but I like playing with certain lesser developed characters like Merope Gaunt or Eileen Prince. Tom/Lucius/Severus friendship is a thing of win. :)
