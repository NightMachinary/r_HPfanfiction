** The long road. Remus is not Sirius' though. it only happened after the war, so until the war it wasn't like that. It's mostly canon, but Snape lives and Hermione married I think Charlie??? but Sirius still died when he did. it is very dark and disturbing though, and I feel so bad for the children. it's slash Snupin fic.

I love it even with all the sad stuff, but kinda wish the author won't give them any more grief, always something bad happens to them. ah well.
