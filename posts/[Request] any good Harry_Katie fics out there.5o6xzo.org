Preferably something long but if it's good I'll read it! Thanks!


** The only somewhat decent one I can recall off the top of my head is kmfrank's /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4003405/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Unlocked-Knowledge][Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge]]/| linkffn(4003405) .

It's one of the earlier stories where Harry receives Voldemort's memories from the Horcrux in his head, in this post 5th year. Katie Bell ends up becoming Harry's girlfriend during Year 6 and the events of the book. Abandoned, but you may find it to be a decent, sizeable read.

*** I've been tempted to read this before but it just seems like an edgy godlike Harry that uses pistols cause the author thought they were cooler than wands. Any reason why I should reconsider?

**** No. Virtually every single decision made is a bad one.

Though him using pistols is actually smart because Wild West Sheriff. Would have been better if he went back without a wand, though.

**** I only read it because it was hilarious.

Also, Harry is a /cowboy/, that alone makes it awesome. (Well okay, he's a Marshall, but he /looks/ like a cowboy, and it's the thought that counts, right?)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.
