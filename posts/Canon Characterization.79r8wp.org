** There's not really a summary I know of for this (if you find one I'd be interested in it). However, the most common ways the fandom gets it wrong is:

1) Ron being a horrible friend. He isn't. He's jealous sometimes, yes, and can say the wrong thing at the wrong time that causes a fight, but people dial it up to 11 in fics. At the end of the day, Ron deals with a lot of shit for his friends and he only really blows up 1) under supermagical influence ala Horcrux re walking out on 7 (which he immediately regretted), or 2) Appears he's been lied to (book 4, GoF fight).

2) Hermione's love for authority - stemming from everyone remembering "or worse expelled" from book 1 and nothing else. By 3, we see her using her time-turner in a way that breaks the rules McGonagall set for her (academic only) to do the right thing. By 5, she suggests they start an underground student club that looks suspiciously like rebellion, and enforces it with as close to a blood pact as you can get away with in a school under martial law.

3) Manipulative Dumbledore. In a way, I suppose I can see this, but it tends to employ the most cynical view of Dumbledore's actions - a standard we don't use on most other characters. He's wise, well-meaning, but ultimately a falliable human still carrying scars and weights from the last 2 wars he fought. Did he mess up sometimes? Yes, no one denies that. But at the same time, you can't say he messed up (which implies an accident) and say he did it for some nefarious purpose that requires he messed up. It's an inherent contradiction.

4) Harry - He's really a snarky kid at heart. If you re read the books, he's quippy and mouthy and has something clever to say more oft than not. The humor is really lost on fanfiction as it gets sidelined to focus on other aspects of him.

5) Daphne Greengrass - literally a blank slate we know nothing about. Anything you think you know about her is a lie.

*** Hermione's love for authority in fanfiction stemming from the broom incident from 3rd year too. The fact that she overlooked Harry and went straight to McGonagall made her teacher's pet in many eyes.

These things authors uses in Dumbledore-bashing stories where he can exploit her love for books and authority to spy on Harry.

*** The problem with Dumbledore is that he's sort of presented as this ultimate, hyper competent wizard. Or at least I feel like that's how readers want to view him.

It is very hard to think of him this way when the mistakes he makes seem to be so.. horribly stupid.

Some off the top of my head

- How can you possibly justify not checking directly in on Harry throughout his childhood? Some random lady living across the street is not enough.

- Hagrid can hardly function on his own, what on earth are you doing sending him to introduce Harry Potter to the wizarding world?

- Again, how can you possibly justify keeping the Philosopher's Stone in Hogwarts?

- Detention in the forbidden forest? What the fuck? Hagrid can't even reliably use magic, not to mention that /he split their group up/, leaving two children alone in the forest at night.

- The man literally sent two 13 year old children on a time travelling mission to rescue Sirius Black, fully knowing that a horde of Dementors and a werewolf were involved. What. The. Fuck.

There are many, many more.

Now, assuming that Dumbledore isn't legitimately senile, how could he possibly make "mistakes" like those above?

It's much easier to say that Dumbledore knows what he's doing and that he has some sort of sneaky plan he's working on.

I could be being overly cynical here, but what has Dumbledore really done /right/? At least, since the fall of Voldemort.

Lucius Malfoy has a powerful influence on Fudge.

He hasn't destroyed a single Horcrux.

Voldemort successfully revives himself.

He's had a Death Eater and /Voldemort himself/ sneak into the school for the full year disguised as teachers, without knowing about it.

Etc, etc.

**** 1) Not all of Voldemort's Death Eaters were captured. Some were even set free by the Ministry because Imperius Defense. It's not a stretch to assume some of them were watching Dumbledore, searching for their master or simply to get revenge on "the brat who did him in." Now, the blood protection of Lily might work within the Dursley household, but its unclear whether it would have held while he was in muggle school.

2) I'm not sure I understand. Are you saying Hagrid is autistic/retarded/socially inept? He's a bit slow and has an extremely skewed sense of what is and isn't dangerous when it comes to magical creatures, but I don't recall seeing anything that might make him dangerous to Harry or incapable of guiding him into the wizarding world. If we accept the premise from (1) that Dumbledore knows some Death Eaters are still out there and still on the lookout, who are they likely to pay attention to? A distinguished professor such as McGonagall or some half giant dropout?

3) Because the alternative is to hand it to Voldemort on a silver platter and start yet another war while Harry was still woefully underclassed and far too young to handle it. If Voldemort had succeeded in being resurrected during PS, he would have won the war. Hogwarts was the safest place in the world, and the seat of Dumbledore's power. Gringotts was broken into if you recall. Where else could he have stored it? The Ministry which as you yourself noted has Death Eater influence? Who could Dumbledore trust not to succumb to the temptation of using the Stone? I'm not saying it wasn't dangerous to the children or that it was an overstep in his role as an educator, but seeing it in the context of his role as the First Line of Defense against Voldemort, it makes sense.

4) Let's be fair here, that was on McGonagall, not Dumbledore. While it reflects poorly on Dumbledore's choices when his subordinates screw up, it's not his direct action that causes that. One could argue, I suppose, that if this was long-standing policy, he is to blame. However, never again do we hear of a student going into the Forbidden Forest for detention, which hints that this was corrected.

5) The thing is, it was out of his hand. If you recall in the first timeline, Harry and Hermione already went back (i.e. it's a self contained time-loop) to save past Harry from the Dementors. Now, we might assign some blame to Dumbledore for this, sure, but had he forbidden them to go Harry would have died anyway. What was the right call?

I never said Dumbledore didn't have a plan, or a sneaky one. My contention is that Dumbledore's plans (of which he does not tell Harry all of them), is that they are done in good faith and not some super secret plan to off Harry or what have you.

What has he done right: Gee, I don't know. Stopped Voldemort from returning for the 10 years Harry was a child? Figuring out his secret to immortality? Combating Death Eater influence in the Ministry when he doesn't have the gold Malfoy does and only has his reputation? Not as easy as you think and it amazes me more the Ministry wasn't an openly Death Eater stronghold by book 1.

Also, Malfoy's influence on Fudge only eclipses Dumbledore's by book 5, if you recall, when the Minister refuses to acknowledge Voldemort's revival and by then Fudge was on his way out.

He didn't destroy a single Horcrux, but he was instrumental in discovering their existence and theorizing what items might be Horcruxes and where they might be hidden. He was the research behind Harry's success, doing the grunt work necessary so Harry might have a chance. He had to delve deep into Voldemort's mind, study his personality and figure him out to do this.

Death Eater and Voldemort sneaking in - that's more Voldemort's success than Dumbledore's failure. The curse on the DADA makes it impossible for Dumbledore to have a person he can trust in the position for long, but at the same time he can't /not/ fill the position. It was a glaring gap in his defense that Voldemort exploited time and again, but with no real way to fix it. Do you suppose he had a plethora of skilled candidates lining up every year when he's had to replace each one at the end of a year for decades on end? Word gets around, and no one wants to suffer.

Voldemort revives himself yes. Are you saying Dumbledore should have developed spontaneous omniscience to stop him? Put forth a plan or safeguard you think Voldemort couldn't have beaten, and I'll concede this point.

Etc, etc.

Like I said, Dumbledore is well-meaning but things out of his control more often than not force his hand. He has too many hats to wear, so to speak, which is his biggest failing.

  watching Dumbledore
#+end_quote

He's Dumbledore. He should certainly be able to evade Death Eaters to visit Harry if he chose to. He doesn't even need to go personally, send someone he trusts. Polyjuice exists. Also, Dumbledore has The Invisibility Cloak at this time.

If he wanted to check in on Harry, he could.

#+begin_quote
  its unclear whether it would have held while he was in muggle school.
#+end_quote

If we're serious about Harry's safety, then this alone should disqualify the Dursley house hold. That's ~8 hours a day where he's entirely unprotected, vulnerable to being located magically as well.

2)

Hagrid just has no sense. He's also not qualified to answer any questions Harry might have. Dumbledore/McGonagall at least know that the Dursleys were not informative.

Hagrid is a terrible source of information for Harry when he needs to learn so much about the magical world. /Hagrid forgot to tell Harry about platform 9 3/4/. How many other small but important things would he have forgotten? Or not known about at all?

What about someone who can more delicately explain why Harry is so absurdly famous?

#+begin_quote
  who are they likely to pay attention to? A distinguished professor such as McGonagall or some half giant dropout?
#+end_quote

Hagrid is ten feet tall. Him walking down the street is going to be a spectacle no matter what.

The very first thing that happens when Harry gets to the magical world is that Leaky Cauldron mob scene. They were not keeping Harry's arrival a secret.

If you want to keep it a secret, send someone else. It doesn't have to be a professor. Put a hat on Harry's head and send some random but trustworthy wizard, there you go.

3)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Huh? Does the Fidelius charm not exist anymore? Put some place under that charm, put the stone in that place, put Dumbledore himself as the secret keeper. Sorry Voldemort, better luck never.

Where have the Flamels had it for the past several centuries? I seriously doubt this is the first time it has occurred to Voldemort that having the Stone would be great. Yet, he didn't steal it before.

4)

#+begin_quote
  Let's be fair here, that was on McGonagall, not Dumbledore.

True.

Seriously though, that sounds like grounds for dismissal to me. Not too sure how Lucius didn't have McGonagall ruined after that stunt.

5)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Dumbledore takes Hermione's Time-Turner and does it himself.

#+begin_quote
  The thing is, it was out of his hand. If you recall in the first timeline, Harry and Hermione already went back (i.e. it's a self contained time-loop) to save past Harry from the Dementors.
#+end_quote

If Dumbledore decided to go himself, the things that helped Harry and Hermione the first time (rock hitting the window, Hermione howling, Harry's patronus) would simply have been different things.

#+begin_quote
  I never said Dumbledore didn't have a plan, or a sneaky one. My contention is that Dumbledore's plans (of which he does not tell Harry all of them), is that they are done in good faith and not some super secret plan to off Harry or what have you.
#+end_quote

So Dumbledore has a plan that he's working towards and takes direct action to ensure certain events happen. He doesn't tell anybody about it even if the plan directly involves them, regardless of what they want. That's called manipulation. Good intentions or not, Dumbledore is manipulative.

Given that Dumbledore knows - or at least heavily suspects- that Harry is a horcrux, we can assume that part of his plan involved Harry dying at least temporarily.

#+begin_quote
  Stopped Voldemort from returning for the 10 years Harry was a child
#+end_quote

I don't recall anything suggesting that Dumbledore has done anything at all to delay Voldemort's return. Voldemort has simply been incapable of it.

#+begin_quote
  Figuring out his secret to immortality?
#+end_quote

Sure, that is admittedly incredibly valuable information. But he kept it entirely to himself.

#+begin_quote
  He didn't destroy a single Horcrux, but he was instrumental in discovering their existence and theorizing what items might be Horcruxes and where they might be hidden. He was the research behind Harry's success, doing the grunt work necessary so Harry might have a chance.

Fair enough, but again, he decides to keep this information to himself.

  Combating Death Eater influence in the Ministry when he doesn't have the gold Malfoy does and only has his reputation? Not as easy as you think and it amazes me more the Ministry wasn't an openly Death Eater stronghold by book 1.
#+end_quote

Frankly, it amazes me that the exact opposite isn't true. These people are marked by some powerful magic that nobody understand, placed by Voldemort himself. Even if they truly believed that Lucius & others were forced into serving Voldemort, what the hell does that Dark Mark do? How can you have people in positions of power when they have something like the Dark Mark on them, possibly ready to influence them at any time?

Voldemort is a wizard so feared that people refuse to speak his name a decade after his death. Associating with him is like associating with Satan himself, to the general public. Death Eaters literally carry his mark. Even if everybody truly believed that they were imperius'd, the people would likely still be outcasts.

Not to mention I find that it is impossible to believe that this "Oh, I was imperius'd!" defense hasn't been used before. I suspect it has been used ever since that curse was invented. There must be some ways of verifying, like Veritaserum.

But this is a digression I suppose, this is more about Rowling's writing now than about Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  Death Eater and Voldemort sneaking in - that's more Voldemort's success than Dumbledore's failure.
#+end_quote

I disagree. Pay attention to who you're hiring. When polyjuice exists, certain standards of identification must be met.

I have a hard time believing there's no way of identifying people who are literally possessed by an evil wraith. /Especially/ when this is the same year that Dumbledore is holding the Philosopher's Stone. He should be completely on guard, and a new Professor is a glaringly obvious place to look. Not to mention those so called "defenses" protecting the Stone.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort revives himself yes. Are you saying Dumbledore should have developed spontaneous omniscience to stop him? Put forth a plan or safeguard you think Voldemort couldn't have beaten, and I'll concede this point.
#+end_quote

How about any safeguards at all?

At the end of the first book, Dumbledore admits to Harry that there are other ways that Voldemort could revive himself. Implying that Dumbledore knows about these ways. Now I'm no wizard, but it seems to me that the remains of close kin is likely to be a pretty important ingredient for rituals/potions. It would be easy for Dumbledore to sabotage them.

I just don't see where Dumbledore has done anything great, as would be expected of a Great Wizard.

#+begin_quote
  Like I said, Dumbledore is well-meaning but things out of his control more often than not force his hand. He has too many hats to wear, so to speak, which is his biggest failing.
#+end_quote

This is a massive failing. He needed to give up some of his positions and focus more on stopping the evil wizard, imo.

I'll agree that he's important in the Wizengamot for fighting the Death Eaters' influence. Why does he need to be Headmaster of Hogwarts?

He does like rules, I'll give you that, but his falling out with the rest of the family was their fault as much as it was his, he never saw any of the proof that Harry had for any of his claims, and the reason why he went for a job in the ministry was that he hoped it would allow him to help people at some point. In a way that many people do not grasp, he is a quintessential gryffindor.

Also, Ron has quite a dark sense of humour. If anyone of the trio would throw gallows jokes, it's most likely to be him (though Harry could do it too, if pushed a bit).

** Hermione isn't this amazing character that is perfect and the only one at fault is Ron; that's not true at all.

I've read quite a few stories where Hermione seems to be perfect in every way while Ron is the failure, which while Ron was jealous, and he did often want Hermione to help him with homework and stuff like that, he wasn't as bad as fanfiction often portrays him to be. And Hermione isn't as amazing as she's often portrayed to be in fanfiction either. I see that a lot in fanfiction.

Evil/Manipulative Dumbledore! While Dumbledore did hide things, he clearly cared for Harry and co; he isn't evil, while he might be a bit manipulative he's nowhere like he is often seen as in fanfiction.

Draco isn't a good guy; he looks up to his father and thinks that Muggles/Muggleborns ect extra are beneath him. It isn't until later that he's uncertain of everything. But even then he's not a good guy that loves Muggles/Muggleborns. I like redemption Draco stories as much as the next person but he was a right jerk to people because of his name, his believes and his money.

As others have said we only heard about Daphne once; I hate the Ice princess/Ice Queen persona fanfiction has given her, that's not how I view her at all. The fact that so many fanfiction writers write her that way is disheartening.

Harry isn't an all powerful being; his best class was Defence Against the Dark Arts, but he wasn't all powerful like so many fanfictions tend to write him. And he wasn't that interested in girls either, he was interested in Cho but that was it until Ginny. He wasn't interested in multiple girls or whatever as I sometime see him written as.

Molly and Ginny aren't manipulative, they aren't trying to force Harry to marry Ginny or anything like that like some early fanfictions wrote them as doing.

Severus is sarcastic, rude and can be rather cruel/harsh at times. He's had a rough time but we don't see him act in a friendly manner. He's always cunning or thinking ahead or trying to keep himself and others alive. Some people write him nicer then he was, and while I can understand since he's difficult to write that's not how he was.

Luna: While she did have weird moments she did have good moments as well. She was the one to talk to Harry after Sirius died, she was the one to realize it was him under a polyjuice potion. She had a few creatures that she believed in, not a bunch of crazy sounding creatures; I've read a couple of stories where she had a bunch Or where they made her too crazy.
