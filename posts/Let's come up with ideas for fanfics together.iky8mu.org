***** "Taco Tuesday. It was simple, elegant, and beautiful. But most importantly, it was feasible (as well as sounding better than Sandwich Saturday and Sunday). It was with half staffed weekends or giving ALL of the elves their holy night, Tuesday, off. And thus, Taco Tuesday was born and Teddy Lupin-Tonks is front and center.

"It started out simply enough, really. It was just a very Hufflepuff idea that Teddy put forward during the prefects' meeting. They didn't have to make him the figure head. But here he was. Previously of middling popularity -- due to his war legacy and boyish good looks countered with being a shy Hufflepuff -- Teddy was now the center of attention and met with equal parts zealous scorn and derision from the 'upper-crust' students as well as adoration and admiration from the Hufflepuffs and all other taco lovers."

On Tuesday, classes end early (3pm) and the houses rotate duties (House A preps and cooks, House B serves and cleans up. Next week Houses C and D do this, etc) with the help of their heads of houses and other faculty. Being the kind and generous soul he is, Flitwick volunteers to magically chop the onions every week (he can do it in only a few minutes, whereas it would take a full team of students 20 minutes and lots of onion tears). Despite being a terrible baker, Hagrid actually makes a mean salsa.

While there is an initial backlash (especially from old-blood families and other snooty students as well as students with zero confidence in the cooking abilities of themselves and their classmates), soon everyone looks forward to Taco Tuesdays because of the delicious tacos, comraderie, and their newfound confidence in the kitchen.

All is well and good until she discovers her predecessor was secretly directing ministry resources to help get a certain redhead's now burgeoning competitive Wizard's Chess League off the ground.

**** It was an accident! Draco Malfoy didn't mean to set the WHOLE school on fire - and he certainly didn't mean to laugh as it burnt to the ground. Draco only wanted to sneak into the Gryffindor Dormitory and burn Harry Potter alive while he slept. (And maybe Weasley too if he was lucky.) Unfortunately, when he tried to explain this to Dumbledore, the Aurors, and the entire Ministry of Magic, they didn't want to hear it.

The only thing Voldemort couldn't possibly foresee was that the boy was more of a monster than Voldemort himself... All Voldemort wanted was to kill Harry Potter. He hadn't counted on those evil green eyes haunting not only his dreams, but his waking hours as well. "Do it..." the boy would whisper in Voldemort's mind. "Kill yourself...no one would care if you did it...do it...you're nothing but a dork lord..." Voldemort wanted to scream, to cry, to do anything to shut the monster up once and for all! - but he couldn't. He could do nothing but allow the monster to prey on his darkest vulnerabilities, tearing him apart from the inside out.

Basically, there's a scene where Draco is tattered and terrified with his fancy clothes ripped and his blonde hair messy, and he is on Harry's doorstep in the midst of a fierce thunderstorm begging Harry to help him. Harry of course, can't get over the fact that "Bloody Hell! Malfoy poisoned all the pure-bloods over a translation error! And - Ron! - take a look at Malfoy!" And so Ron and Harry stand laughing hysterically at Malfoy for around 20 minutes, until they see the pure-blood zombies catch up to them and they remember this is a crisis.
