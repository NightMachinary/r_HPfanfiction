Yes please see the title and be very helpful! :) What is the basic premise of this type of story please?


** Common tropes in these stories:

- Potter/Dumbledore/Weasley bashing
- Snape/Slytherin glorification
- The "Wrong" BWL - whoever it may be (Harry's new twin, Neville, John Smith) - is an idiot and a bully

If you want the story to be /good/, don't adhere to any of this.

*** Oh okay! I hate bashing! :) Also I will never glorify Snape because I do not like him either. And I do not want to make the wrong BWL a mean person. I am thinking I would want it to be like super close siblings, who are nice and helpful and stuff, and they fight the war together and it doesn't really matter who is the BWL or not. :) And when it does get revealed they will still support each other. Or maybe it can be super sad and dramatic where the wrong BWL dies thinking they are the BWL in a heroic sacrifice, so then the real BWL carries on for them. :)

**** That's an endeavor I've seen attempted but never achieved. I wish you luck!

Also, an interesting twist you might want to consider: Voldemort only considers two boys. Since you mentioned WGWL, it could be made into an argument based on pedantry. It used to be that 'he' was a general term, representing either male or female, rather than referring to someone who identifies as male.

***** Note that Voldemort never heard the "he" part of the prophecy. If Harry had been a girl, he would have still considered her and Neville equally and gone after "Harriet." And if Harriet had a twin brother, that would give Dumbledore a plausible, non-bashing reason to think she's not the Chosen One. Or it could be interesting if Dumbledore himself was confused about the prophecy because of it.

***** :o That would be a really cool twist! :) I was thinking just making it two sisters, but that's cool too! Or I could even make the real BWL or GWL transgender, and it could be even MORE of a twist. :)

Well I mean nothing would be a twist because I'm talking about it here... :( Hmmm...everybody just forget you read anything here okay?! :) :)

** Googled WBWL trops and copied this from spacebattles wish some additions.

- Harry gets send to the Dursleys and will have a horrible childhood despite having a twin who isn't sent there and/or having parents alive.
- Harry's thoughts are filled with revenge and taking back what's rightfully his
- Harry gets mentored by a powerful wizard/group/being some time before the first year starts.
- Everyone loves the wrong Twin. (Exceptions are on occasion Sirius and Lupin, and Snape always loaths as usual.)
- The Twin gets everything he wants, just by asking or demanding.
- The Twin gets sorted in Gryffindor, Harry usually into Slytherin or Ravenclaw.
- Harry is the Parselmouth.
- Harry gets all the girls?
- Ron is the Twin's best friend. And a moron. The twin acts like Ron v. 2.0 for the most part
- The Plot follows the story of the books, almost forced even.

Fics that try to subvert this genre are Prince of Slytherin and a Sarcasm and Slytherin (inspired by PoS).

**** One more that really pisses me off. Where Lily and sometimes James/others come off as bipolar.

​

They all ignore Harry/WBWL just fine till major events start to happen and suddenly realize that they have ignored him or something. And then the whole thing with them wanting forgiveness in one breath while putting WBWL down for not being as important as the BWL with the other breath.

​

It's massively annoying. Either they ignored/abandoned him for a good practical reason, or they are just horrible people. No one pulls a character 180 like that.

*** One fic I read that played with and averted most of these tropes was an Elder Scrolls crossover where Harry was raised by his grandfather Fleamont to stay out of his brother's shadow. They discover a portal to Tamriel, which one of Harry's ancestors had created to escape Tamriel, and Harry ends up activating it.

From what I've read, those two fics actually play the tropes strait, though they include better in-universe justifications so that the tropes make sense rather than just being an example of bad writing. Also, Sarcasm wasn't inspired by PoS per se. The author has a note about that on the story:

#+begin_quote
  A/N: It has been brought to my attention by a commenter that there are a number of parallels between this work and a fic I read on fanfiction.net about a year ago, and then more or less forgot about because I don't have a fanfiction.net account and never got notified when the author started posting year 2 of PoS. I've apparently been mirroring PoS in a couple elements--PoS also has Harry sorted into Slytherin while his twin goes to Gryffindor; Harry befriending Theo and Blaise and Hermione and Neville while making enemies of his brother and Ron; Harry trying to rehabilitate Malfoy. There are some pretty key differences but the resemblance is there. Credit, then, goes to The Sinister Man on fanfiction.net for any subconscious influences I've drawn from his work, and I'm sorry to anyone else who noticed this. Endless gratitude to user Odysseus and other nonentites for pointing this out.

  The Prince of Slytherin book 2 rewrite is in progress. I'm really excited for it but I won't be reading it until after my own adaptation of Chamber of Secrets is finished (it's in production now).

** I think it isn't enough to know what tropes to avoid. Just the basic premise of a WBWL story is a good starting point, but to keep things interesting, try having multiple unexpected things going on in the plot, as even subversion of the trope is common enough that I'd personally enjoy more going on, and I know you'd be great at thinking up some creative plots (I love The Fight for Rights, though full disclosure, I'm just a few chapters in right now, it's very very different and creative).

I'd like some problems that stem solely from having people think of your sibling as the boy who lived, but not the most common ignored in favour of or abandoned one. Maybe they'd be really close to each other, but for safety or something, someone's trying to keep them apart? Or maybe there's a lot of danger for the twin at Hogwarts and Harry (or both together) needs to deal with older students or find ways to keep them safe. If you go the route of them both being close to each other, I think they'd want to be in the same house. Maybe the hat wants to send whomever is second to a different house, but is convinced otherwise.

However, try not to copy canon at all, it's the worst thing I think stories do. So yeah, there's a major character introduced, all characters have different upbringings and thoughts, and yet the philosopher's stone rescue still goes down the same. Well, okay, that could happen, but things stay the same as canon all the way through, and who wants to read that? It gets boring. Such a major difference would totally derail all plots in so many unexpected ways, and it's fun to explore that.

Dumbledore as a major character is always a huge plus point for a story for me, when he's written well. Not all knowing or manipulative, but wise and truly caring and just trying his best.

Let me know when you upload! I'd like to read this story. :)

*** Thank you a2i9! These are all very good ideas and tips! :) Yes I have only read like 12 fanfics ever, so I guess that's why I don't write stories with the same stuff everyone else does. I do not really know all those "common fanon head-canon world-building character type" stuff people talk about in pet peeve threads. So I don't do them.

** If you're going for a close knit relationship between brother, how about this?

Have you read the manga "Sanctuary"? Two friends (basically brother in all but blood) devise a plan for revenge, where one works in the light, which is the government office, climbing the ladder, while the other in the dark - the mafia. They supported each other behind the scene, and ultimately achieved their goal, but not without a price.

That's it, a story where the WBWL took on the mantle of the hero, while the other one (assuming it's Harry here), after years and years of "bickering", left and joined Voldemort. The two were working together all the while.

** I really never got the appeal of the whole twin thing.

At least "Voldemorte got it wrong it was really Neville" does fit the mythos.

But really, why is this interesting? Harry gets to live without fame, like he wants? Or Harry hates the fame but instead of being a child of phophecy, it was really a case of mistaken identity, sorry your life sucks?

If you want to write a story where Harry is not the child of phophecy, why not just change the phophecy or make it unknown?

Sometimes I understand the draw even if a theme doesn't appeal to me specifically (op fics, redeeming malfloy). But these? I do not understand what is interesting enough for people to want to write them...

Edit: my original thought was it was just a SI starting point, but that does not seem the case.
