Except for Lily and Hermione I've read all of those and they're so repetitive and boring, especially for Lily. I wanna see other women get the spotlight. I wanna see fics about McGonagall, Amelia Bones and Dorcas Meadows, the other Order ladies, Alice Longbottom, Bellatrix, Narcissa, Tonks and Andromeda, Emmeline Vance and Hestia Jones, Molly, Ginny, Marlene Mckinnon. Genderbent, whoever.

Hell even OC's would work, I'm not unopen to it.

** Linkffn(13098062)

This is my OC wip. The main character is a powerful adult witch living three decades after Voldemort, and I've taken pains to make her capable without being a Mary Sue (I think of her as a step and a half below the likes of Dumbledore, if people like Bellatrix and Minerva are three steps down). She's part of a small group comprised of people with a similar level of skill, but they're secondary to the story, yet still with important roles. Most of them are women.

I don't like my first few chapters anymore, honestly, but I'd rather make progress than agonize over them. I'm 80% finished with chapter 9 at the moment, and I have a clear idea of what's going to happen at every stage.

I feel bad promoting myself without recommending something else, but I can't really think of anything for this.

  Nearly thirty years on from Voldemort's war, the world is no less unforgiving.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.
