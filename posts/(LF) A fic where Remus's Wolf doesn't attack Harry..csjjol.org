I've read a story called /Pack Mentality/ and I really liked it. I also read on called /Werewolves are Gentle creatures/ which was very good too. I like the whole wolf recognizes Harry as his pack vibe. I am hoping you guys could point me (or create) a fic that is in a similar style?


** A good werewolf fic is linkffn(The Wolf Lord) Although I am unsure how similar it is as I have never read pack mentality, please link it.

  Summer of 1993, Professor McGonagall visits a small American town hunting the one man who might be able to help capture the escaped convict Sirius Black, and more importantly fill in as the DADA professor. There she meets a boy that disappeared eight years ago sparking a massive if fruitless manhunt for the missing Boy-Who-Lived. Werewolf!Harry with DAD!Remus

** Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) has Harry as Wolf Animagus and a lot of focus on Remus and his wolf, although they haven't interacted very much yet.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.
