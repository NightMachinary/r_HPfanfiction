:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for one of those fics where Harry travels back to when Tom is at Hogwarts. Unfortunately i've read a couple so i'm not sure I have the right details. I believe Harry tries to ignore/avoid Tom, but Tom doesn't like it. The one i'm looking for they have a fight in the common room and Tom uses Parseltongue and the snakes (from the banners i think) in the room wrap around and pin Harry down. And I remember Harry telling himself not to use his own parseltongue to get them off. I think it was a Tom/Harry but it might have just been subtext not an actual relationship.


** Oh god I am sure I've read something like this but I've also read so many Tom/Harry time travel fics I am not sure I'll ever find the one you think about since I am absolutely mixing them up in my brain

** I think it's called the intruder by Arliene but I'm not sure I might be wrong.
