** It wasn't exactly in a review, but in PMs discussing my story:

A reviewer asked me which would be the main pairing of my current WiP. I replied them that for most part, it is a genfic, and if romance happened, it would be a Harry/OFC.

Then the reviewer replied that I should seriously consider changing it to Harry/Ginny, because they are not interested in any other fic. Like, sure, I'll change my story because one person doesn't like part of it.

** I have a series of weird reviews from a neckbeard pretending to be a feminist:

#+begin_quote
  I have finished reading your story. Not because I like it much, mind, but it does hold some professional interest as it illustrates some of the common patterns in the mindsets of those prone to toxic masculinity and glorification of oppression. Or would you seek to deny it? Just in this latest chapter you show a true lack of female empowerment when Victoria is too "girly" for dueling. The only way that scene with Susan would have been acceptable was if Victoria then went on to defy the stereotype by actually being real good at dueling, and then took note to try more activities that the patriarchy deems to be for the big strong menfolk. You didn't do that though. Instead you fed the gender stereotypes by having her lose, and not to Susan or Hermione, but to a boy! The wrongheadedness of this chapter was simply beyond belief! There are several problems with the glorification of upper class snobbery etc as well, but maybe if we take it one step at a time you can actually come to see the errors of your way. If you want to make it up to your readers, make Victoria and the muggleborn Hermione fall in love. That would both make up for your classism and show that you are not against the LGBTQ community. Also write more about Marlene McKinnen and Poliakoff. Thanks in advance.

  Calling Susan a banshee is really sexist even if it also references the play. She isn't a member of the seminal punk band of that name, is she? I didn't think so. Aside from this story continuing its sexist naughtiness, Victoria didn't meet Griphook in the bank. I like Griphook because he is cool and really wished he had been included! This Snaggletooth is an OC and including OCs demeans Rowling's work by saying her characters Hannah aren't good enough to use. This just goes back to my first point. Sexism! It's in this story! Only a man would think of Victoria using her powers so indecently! Granted I'm a man myself but I know that no woman willingly would increase the size of her teets. Please give a more significant role to Marlene McKinnen. She's my favourite character. Oh, and please update. Despite the problems this story is a bit not so bad.
#+end_quote

  How come Victoria is so much better off than Harry? While Harry only receives filthy socks and hard work Petunia takes Victoria out for strolls and lunch and shopping on High Street. Not at all realistic unless you think girls don't get abused the same as boys. I am shocked and appalled that anybody could think so. You have male prosecution complex, which means you think boys are more victimized than girls. Such self pity makes me sick, and I suggest you go elsewhere if you want to pettle this nonsense. How about the straight white boy pity party that is the Dark (Edge)Lord Potter forums? Sure you could use the defence of that guy what wrote about superheroes in his story Worm and said he wasn't nazi even though he wrote about nazis, but that would be a little ridiculous. Oh, and cannon never suggested wizards had "Sky doors". Sounds more like stupid sci-fi cliche, and that isn't the first time I notice such sloppy research in this story. You like to portray yourself as a canon expert, so either show some dedication or stop saying you're something you Hannah Aren't. And Mr. Bones seriously needs to cool it with his Peter Pan syndrome. He's so wacky and no responsible woman would let him take care of her child many meters in the air. Granted Pet isn't responsible, but surely Susan's mum is.

  I am a bit torn on this Muggle Protection Act of yours, dear fellow. On the one hand, it is important to me that businesses don't fold just because new and more efficient business models become available. This is because the old models in general can be used to employ more people. But on the other hand, it is the old businesses what are owned by the oppressors and the new businesses what are owned by the oppressed, and magic really limits the need for Labour anyway, sad as it is to admit for an old Haileybury House volunteer such as myself. So in this particular instance, I suppose I am for the modernization of industry. No working class people will be affected, other than in as far as they can finally afford to buy proper clothes, which is more than what you can say for some brave labourers in Post-War Britain. Oh yes, the Americans would surely like to say that their Marshall Plan made Europe into a Utopia overnight, but take it from one that was there, old bean: It took a hell of a long time for things to be set to rights in England's green and pleasant land.

  Taure shows his true colours with this fic. One wanders if he is called Taure because he is a Tory. This is sexist because Victoria can't handle stuff that Harry handled in his sleep and there are not any characters that stray from his comfort zone. No ethnic or sexual variety can be expected here, folks. Taure's writing gleams with wish fullfilment of the baddest sort. Also I think it's wrong that Victoria don't dislike the prejudiced fools Pany and Dapper Daphne more. This obviosly goes against the cherecter that you made for her. Taure neads to take a long look in the mirror and realise that what he's riding ain't all gold.

** I'm pretty new at this, so I don't have many reviews to choose from. But I got one today that, after I managed to parse through it (I'm still not 100% what it meant to say), seemed to dislike that my Harry is like canon Harry. I thought that's what people liked to see, rather than self-insert Harry, perfect Harry, or not Harry.

I've been trying to keep my Harry mostly in character with a few changes, so I just took it as a compliment even though it was meant as criticism.

To each his own, I guess.

** I remember there used to be a dude who would review every story with how to "improve" it. Usually ended up with calling dobby and getting his money from gringotts etc. Like 90% of stories I would look through reviews and there he was.

Found one of his reviews:

#+begin_quote
  The fallowing ideas and questions I have, are not ment to tell anyone how to write their stories. I like characters that think, thats why I have the ideas that fallow:

  Sirius need to get Regulus emancipated ASAP so noone can control Regulus.

  Harry/Regulus needs to goto Gringotts and have a skills and heritage test run on him, as well check for any magical Blocks and tracking devices on him or his thangs.

  • Harry/Regulus needs to see what skills he has that he does not know about.

  • Harry/Regulus needs to see what other families he is relatd to, IE:

  Arthur Pendragon, Godric Griffindor, Merlin, Etc.

  • Harry/Regulus needs to see what blocks (on his magic or himself, any tracking devices or spells on him.)

  • If Harry/Regulus finds out he only related to the Potters, at least he checked.

  Same goes for the Blocks and spells, if he finds none, at least he checked.

  Harry/Regulus needs to get all magical brethren to help him, as well as Harry helping them bring Peace to the World, and Equality between sentients.

  Harry/Regulus should also be Lord Slytherin by conquest, as Harry/Regulus defeated Thomas "Tom" Marvolo Riddle, Jr. a/k/a "Lord Voldemort", by destoring Thomas "Tom" Marvolo Riddle's, Jr. a/k/a "Lord Voldemort's" physical being as a child. Harry/Regulus needs to cast "Thomas Marvolo Riddle, Jr." out of the Slytherin family foever.

  Albus Dumbledore as well as Minerva McGonagall and Hagrid (Minerva McGonagall did not stop Dumbledore from Harry/Regulus going to the Dudleys, as well as kidnapping Harry/Regulus, and Hagrid brought Harry/Regulus to the Dudleys) needs to made to do HARD labor, without using his Magic in the Goblin mines till they DIE, for putting Harry/Regulus with the Dudleys, as well as, if ilegial blocks and or spells were put on Harry/Regulus by Dumbledore, as well as the Dudleys to goto prison for what they did to Harry.

  EVERYTHANG that Albus Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall, the Dudleys have need to be given to Harry/Regulus, for what thay have allowed to happen to Harry/Regulus.

  • Hagrid just needs a good warning about what he did to Harry/Regulus on Dumbledore's orders as Hagrid is a smiple trusting person.

  • Albus Dumbledore put Harry/Regulus with the Dudleys, so Albus Dumbledore is just as responble as the Dudleys for how Harry/Regulus was treated by the Dudleys, as Albus Dumbledore was an accessory to how Harry was treated by the Dudleys.

  Fawkes needs to unbond with DumbleDORK and bond to Harry/Regulus, for what DumbleDORK has done to Harry/Regulus and others.

  In the Harry Potter and mostly in the Fan Fics Dumbledore never gets in trubble for what he allowed Harry to go through at the Dudleys or at Hogwarts.

  Snape needs to goto Azkaban for all the thangs he has done to Harry/Regulus and his family.

  • Snape over haeard the prophecy and repoted it to Voldemort,

  thus puttig Harry/Regulus and his fmily in danger

I was seriously surprised how popular that kind of idea was given that it has not been written to my knowledge (and there are only a few stories around where a couple polyjuices into each other).

Also a rant about the attitude on sex of most Americans. The reviewer seemed to come from the Bible Belt and was a pretty promiscuous women who seemed very pissed at the average "wait till we marry" spiel and chose one of my fics to rant about that. I mean, I generally write sex-positive, but am far from the most outspoken in that regard.
