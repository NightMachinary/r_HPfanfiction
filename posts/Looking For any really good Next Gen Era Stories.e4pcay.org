As it says, I'm looking for any kind of Next Gen Era stories, I'd like for it be as canon compliant as possible, a few changes are okay if they're believable changes.

Though I don't really count Cursed Child as canon, it depends on what is in the story. For instance the houses or what have you.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash.

Would rather it be completed, but constantly updated is fine. But if it's not completed and you think it's that good, feel free to recommend it.


** I really like linkao3(373224).

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...
