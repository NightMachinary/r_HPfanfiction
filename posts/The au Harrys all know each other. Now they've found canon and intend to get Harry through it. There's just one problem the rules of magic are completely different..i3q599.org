*** The intent thing is like one of the biggest trope ever. Harry is sitting in transfiguration unable to turn his match into a needle

He thinks and contemplates...

“Aah, I need to mean it. It needs intent!”

Nothing bad about this, but I've seen this exact scene so many times!!

  The FF world is stuffed full of fantasy Harrys. What will fourteen of them do now though when they've been sent to the 'cannon world' to learn from the REAL Harry? Will Gay!Harry go straight? Will Dark!Harry go good? Will Super!Harry ever lose a duel?
