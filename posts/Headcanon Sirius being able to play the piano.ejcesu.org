I looked up some pictures of the "Grimmauld place" Set of the HP movies and there was a piano in one of the pictures. I can really see Walburga standing there, maybe organzing a tutor who teaches little Sirius and Regulus to play the piano. I think Sirius would've hated it, though I guess he would've been tought to perfection. "Because no Black will be a disgrace to us during the next social gathering" In the end it would've probably been Regulus who had to show his skill by playing some kind of classical piece, because Sirius refused and you could hardly make a scene in front of some influental people. But now I see Sirius when he is stuck in Grimmauld place during Harry's fifth year and he discovers the piano. At first he keeps his distance to the doomed thing but in the end boredom overrules and he starts to play again.

(Ps. If someone wants to write a ficlet about this I would love to read it)


** I can see Walburga making him play music composed before the Statute of Secrecy, and he hates it, but then another Marauder or someone introduces him to modern music and suddenly he's annoying his mother by playing [[https://youtu.be/fJ9rUzIMcZQ][Bohemian Rhapsody]] . She forbids him from touching the piano after that.

Edited to include a link to the song on YouTube, not that I think anyone hasn't heard this song already and needs help finding it, but just to save y'all the few clicks it takes to get to it. Just picture the classically-trained Freddie Mercury as Sirius Black. Even the outfit works.

**** Thanks. I just totally picture Sirius going from rebelling against the lessons and only begrudgingly taking them to avoid punishment to realising that 'chicks dig musicians, man' and utterly embracing them.

***** I read this really long wolfstar fic that had muggle orphanage-raised Remus introducing Sirius to rock music as a major part of their relationship, particularly Bowie, Zeppelin etc. The fic itself was named after the song All The Young Dudes most notably played by Mott the Hoopie, which Bowie wrote & also performed in live shows.

I could see that as a part of canon without the slash for sure.

****** I have not read that - thanks for the rec! That one was a great song.

Now I kind of want to read a 60s/70s musical Hippy-esque revolution of Hogwarts fic where some enterprising Muggleborn in the Marauder's era somehow works out how to play Muggle music in Hogwarts and the culture changes accordingly. Purebloods everywhere embracing Peace, Love, and Good Vibrations. :)

** Ooh! A piano requires a piano tuner. Do you think the wizarding population owns enough pianos to support a professional piano tuner? Probably not, so they have to hire muggles. There's a story right there.

**** Quoth Dumbledore: “Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here!”

I don't think even magic can make up for wizarding society's lack of training.

** Talking about headcanons: ever after reading “Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Seventh Safeguard” (on [[https://charlotteannrose.wordpress.com/2017/04/07/sherlock-holmes-chpt1-the-strange-case-of-amelia-bones/][the author's Wordpress]] with pictures, not on FFnet) I have imagined inside of the Grimmauld Place as [[https://www.bcd-urbex.com/crookham-court-school-aka-harlequin-manor-berkshire/][Crookham Court in Berkshire]]. It is just too good to let it go.

** I feel like I've seen this in several fics before, but the only one I can find now is in the last chapter of "Still Life With Skull".

"The first warning is, of course, an impossible thing. He turns his ear to the wall so he can hear the music from inside the Shack - Johann Sebastian Bach, fugue in G minor, the way Sirius had played it for him back in Fifth Year on the yet-unbroken piano, the exact same way, including the fiddly bit he messed up."

  September 1974 and Remus goes a bit loopy, what with the moon, and the teenage wolf, and his friends who are not Animagi yet, and the creepy dead thing that is following him around.Sirius had a horrible summer, too.
