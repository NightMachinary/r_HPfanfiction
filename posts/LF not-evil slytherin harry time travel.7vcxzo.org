i'm looking for time travel fics where harry truly embraces his slytherin qualities once he goes back in time, but doesn't just become the next dark lord like i've seen so many times before. nothing against those fics, just looking for something different to read. i don't mind bashing, slash, or overpowered harry fics, i'll read most everything except angst/tragedy (that don't get fixed by the time travel) and crack fics. thanks!

*** never read travels secret before, i'll take a look at that soon! i vaguely remember reading the first few chapters of dodging prison and stealing witches and not liking it, but i don't remember why, so i'll try reading it again. thanks for the suggestions!

** If you don't mind founders era time travel, check out Flamethrower's great story "Of A Linear Circle" on ao3. It is a long and very well-written fic that involves Harry embracing the good Slytherin qualities. Part IV is being regularly updated.
