Nothing is more frustrating that falling in love with a story before realizing it's been abandoned for 5 years. d:

As such, I've previously had a strict "I only read completed fics" policy. But, I want to see what new stories are being written. I'm done hiding in dusty corners of fanfiction.net with stories that were completed years ago.

What promising new talent have you read lately?

What is your favorite (currently) WIP?

Any ship or genre is good for me. Although really really for real abandoned fics will probably make me sad.


** These aren't new stories, but they are all works in progress that haven't been abandoned.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past]]. As far as I'm aware, this really kicked off the whole 'character X travels back in time and becomes his/her younger self' genre. I'm not sure if it was the first, but it seems to have been the first big one. It hasn't been updated for about two and a half years, but the author's website shows that he's working on the next chapter. It's not abandoned, but +I wouldn't expect any updates before 2013+. Edit: It hadn't been updated for two and a half years, but it updates two days after I say this. Go figure.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]. Harry Potter as a hardcore rationalist. This got me into fanfiction, and probably a lot of others as well. The subreddit is [[/r/HPMOR]], and it has more than twice as many subscribers as [[/r/HPfanfiction]]. Hasn't been updated for a while, but the author likes to finish up entire story arcs consisting of several chapters before posting them. You should read this.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3998455/1/][Every Other Midnight]]. This is a Marauders-era fic, with the major departure from canon that Lily is a few years younger than the others. It's a romance between James and Lily, but there's a lot of adventure to it. I'm no good at writing these blurbs; let me just say that this story is good, and you should read it. As far as I know, the update rate is slow, but it hasn't been abandoned.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]]. Voldemort won the war, and rules Britain with an iron fist. The story is set on Harry Potter, as he's making his way into the magical world. Starts with year one, and it's currently up to year six. Features a world set on a grand scale. Not just Hogwarts, but much of magical Europe is in this story.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6611208/1/][Trust is a Relative Thing]]. Slytherin Harry, but not a dark Harry. Petunia Dursley is quite different from canon--she blames Dumbledore for the problems in her life, and raises Harry to believe the same.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7539627/1/][The Warlock of Slytherin]]. Another Slytherin Harry, and this one's also a twinfic, with the caveat that Harry knows he has a twin, but the Boy-Who-Lived twin is unaware that Harry is related to him. Has a Harry/Hermione pairing, and is written by an author who is crazy dedicated to the Harry/Ginny pairing. Hasn't been updated in a bit, and I'm slightly worried that (s)he has lost interest, and is just going to keep putting out oneshots involving Harry and Hermione discovering their love for each other.

*** I got about 15 chapters into MoR and couldn't keep going... It's wonderful, but too Harry-is-way-awesome crackficish for me I think. I know of its cult following, so I guess I could give it another shot.

I'm terrible at writing blurbs too. (: I'm definitely interested in Every Other Midnight. I love reading the fics that kick off a certain 'commonly' done plotline, so Nightmares sounds good too. The last three sound great as well!

Thanks so much for taking time to type up some good recs.

**** The Other World Universe by NettieT is decent. If you're looking for something to soak up your time, this is it. This dude(chick?) has been working on this series since 2008. The series is on its third and final book. It is very hard to describe this series as it involves alternate dimensions. The series starts off a little slow but picks up. Each book could be read alone. Although it will make more sense if you read each book. I thought the second was the best overall in the series so far. The series can get rather dark in its themes at times.

The Other World Universe series is at 1,855,225 words. The Harry Potter series itself is only 1,084,170 words long.

Total of 242 chapters in the Other World Series versus the 199 chapters in the Harry Potter Series.

** I avoid WIPs like the plague too :P Been woefully left hanging by one too many old fics. Of the ones I do read, most of them are by authors I actually know, so I get to nag them personally.

I'm still crossing my fingers for a third installment of gyzym's Harry Potter AU (I've suggested this here before), a 'what if Dumbledore decided to join Grindlewald?' AU. Part [[http://gyzym.livejournal.com/109306.html][1]] & [[http://gyzym.livejournal.com/109753.html][2]]. The way she makes canon work with this history is too amazing, and I've got a little separate headcanon just for this fic. I'm always in awe of what authors can do with the HP history.

One I really need to catch up on, I've also suggested here before. It's recently completed and just won a few awards: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=313068][Run]], an adventure fic set in the afterlife, and it satisfies all my dead-character feels (which sounds terribly morbid, oh dear). Every year, the dead can compete for a chance to go back to earth for 24 hours, but losing means permanently losing their soul, and the wrong person winning can mean other terrible things...

I don't have time to inhale novels like I used to, alongside my own writing and school, so I've been behind and long fics just intimate me now. A lot of the WIPs I used to read have since been abandoned, too :(

** Well, I've been quite enjoying [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3446796/1/Magical-Relations][Magical Relations]]. To quote the summary: /Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year./

*** Harry is so powerful that it should qualify as crackfic (usually he is more competent/powerful/intelligent than professors - see first transfiguration lesson for extreme example)

#+begin_quote
  Minerva had been a transfiguration prodigy and now held a mastery in the subject, an eleven year old goblin-trained wizard had just totally destroyed everything she held to be true. She was a powerful witch but couldn't even contemplate repeating the feat this boy just achieved when she was the same age. It wasn't just that though, Harry Crow just threw the transfiguration rulebook out the window. Where the hell did they go from here?

*** I can read some stories with powerful!Harry in them - I really enjoyed powerful!Harry in the Sacrifices arc, for instance - but not all. I saw where it was rec'd earlier in this subreddit, and I really wanted to like Harry Crow. I love the idea of the story, and H/Hr is one of my favorites ships... but the writing wasn't "pithy" enough for me.

Thanks for the suggestion, though. (: Maybe one day when I'm in the mood for verbose writing I will start it up again.

**** I think that [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6769957/1/][Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone]] is a better version of a Harry raised by goblins. It's not nearly as over-the-top as Harry Crow.
