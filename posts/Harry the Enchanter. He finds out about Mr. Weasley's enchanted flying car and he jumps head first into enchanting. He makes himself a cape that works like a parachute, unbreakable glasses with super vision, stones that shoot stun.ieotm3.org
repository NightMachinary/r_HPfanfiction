*** I came here to say this. The romance in that fic is kinda meh, but Shiva is the best mentor in HP fanfics, second to none. I have searched far and wide but could find no story which came even close.

And while an OP Harry fic, there is actual conflict resulting from that and his consequent decisions (trying to use runes as shortcuts for actual magic, disregard for safety standards and so on).

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

*** So I was going to read this cause the premise sounds really good to me. But when I started it told me the pairings, plural. There is nothing I hate more than harem Harry, I also don't read anything where the pairing is the main premise. Is the harem a large part of the story or is it more of a sub plot. I could read it if the pairings are a sub plot. What would you recommend

**** More of a sub plot. A little more near the end and it's less harem more of just a polyamorous relationship.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
