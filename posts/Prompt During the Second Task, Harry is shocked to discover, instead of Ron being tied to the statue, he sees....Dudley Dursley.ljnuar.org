*** Or potentially the young and clearly French little girl he never encountered in his whole life. As a hero he can't be expected to leave the innocent unaided and he figures the judges know it will be the thing which would hurt him the most, so they naturally took a random kid to be his hostage. Meanwhile Fleur obviously is secretly dating Dudley because he is her complete and total opposite, the fact that they never even meet each other before is really quite irrelevant, the bottom line is that Dudley is her responsibility and he refuses to steal her chance at eternal glory, see how kind he is.

** The clue promises that if you don't rescue your hostage in time, they're "gone" and "won't come back." I can see why Harry might want Dudley gone and not returning.
