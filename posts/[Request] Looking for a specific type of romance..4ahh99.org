Hey, I'm looking for a romance fic, preferably not slash, where its a fairly reluctant and drawn out lead up to the romance. It feels like most romance docs wait a chapter or two, and then they're happy through out the rest of the fic. Any pairing is cool, I just want to find an interesting read. Thanks.


** Well, if it's slow drawn out romance you want, then you definitely need to check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2717445/1/Tears-on-the-Balcony][Tears on the Balcony]] and it's two sequels [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3927882/1/Kisses-on-the-Balcony][Kisses on the Balcony]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127738/1/Goodbyes-On-The-Balcony][Goodbyes on the Balcony]].

It's a marauder era series, and one of my all time favorites for the era. Altogether they are just shy of 2,000,000 words, and as far as I remember cannon compliant. The last one isn't finished yet, but it's still updated regularly (just last week in fact).

  Hermione overhears something she shouldn't concerning Professor Snape and decides that maybe the House-elves aren't the only ones in need of protection.

** [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net][Harry Potter and the Years of Rebellion]] has an extremely reluctant H/Hr romance---complicated by a really well-drawn OC and then an incident with some Death Eaters that leaves one character completely terrified of the other.

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.

** YES, my favourite kind of romance fic!!

linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty) is definitely this. It's a gorgeously written Hermione/Bellatrix (through time travel) fic. Even though the first kiss happens [[/spoiler][at the end of chapter 10]], your worry about "then they're happy through out the rest of the fic" does *NOT* apply. Basically, [[/spoiler][in chapter 34, they are wrenched horribly apart, and nothing is sunshine and rainbows ever again, even until the end]]. Unless you read the two little sequels.

Also, linkffn(War Paint) does /not/ start out as a romance, and it's a rather unlikely pairing, but it somehow works in the end. There's very little fluff at all.

  Are Murderers born? Or are they made? When Hermione is sent to the past she is forced to become acquainted with someone she knew she'd hate for the rest of her life. Rated M for later chapters.

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.
