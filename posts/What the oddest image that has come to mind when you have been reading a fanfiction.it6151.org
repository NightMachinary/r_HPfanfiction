I was reading a sixth year story and Dumbledore says that the "Protections" around Hogwarts have strengthened in new and mysterious ways. For some reason what came to mind was Hagrid putting the latch on the front gate and hanging a sign saying not Hogwarts.


** One of the first FanFictions that I read used words such as threesome and foursome to describe families such as Harry, Ginny, and teddy or ron, Hermione, rose, and Hugo. I had a different image in my head than what the author meant...

** I once read a story written by someone who did not get along with autocorrect. So things like "he walked in and shat the door gently" were common and for some reason the story gave Dobby a significant other, tagged as "other mail character" when I first read that I assumed it was a crack-fic and literal, which lead to... Interesting mental images.

** I was writing a part where Harry waits for his date to the Yule Ball outside the Great Hall.

I wrote: "(name) headed downstairs along with his other year mates to the ground floor, where most of the students conjugated and met up."

I must've not seen the mistake there because I meant congregated. One of my readers via private message pointed out that it wasn't likely that students were having intercourse in front of everyone. That image that popped into my head was hilarious. Good thing I changed it to congregate or else my readers would've thought my fanfic took a sudden dive into M rated scenes.

  Last time Harry was lead around by his nose. Only seeing what others wanted him to, only doing what others wanted to. Everyone had their own agenda, and it eventually got them all killed. Except Harry, who couldn't die thanks to accidentally becoming the master of death in his teens. Now he's back. A new timeline, a whole new world of opportunity. He'll save the world, but not by following anyone's script for him.
