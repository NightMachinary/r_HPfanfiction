Basically, Dumbledore should be the superbossvillain he is capable of being. There was an unfinished series called Harry Potter and the Ring of the Ancients (book 6) and Order of the Phoenix(book 5) that appeared between the actual releases of GoF and OotP that did this pretty decently. That's where I got the idea. There's also something new going on, Hallowed Lady or something that does this.

I want Dumbledore to be as evil as possible, but in a proper way. Like, the only reason he doesn't crush Harry is because Harry is too minuscule a problem for him atm. None of that twinkly-eyed, grandfather-clocky, Harry m-boy-y bullcrap.

He's fucking Dumbledore. Not a moron.

Anything?

*** Not if Evil Dumbledore still works toward his own ends without being allied to Voldemort. In that case, you'd have two dark giants of magical wickedness exhausting themselves against each other, with Harry and Co. in the middle, trying to pit one against the other so as to finally be able to defeat them both.

***** Depends on whether you're using a power system or not. In the more canon-compliant systems where skill and knowledge are everything and there isn't such a thing as a wizard's "power-level", it seems more manageable.

*** And all his magical skill won't save him from an assassin's blade in the night. Because eventually, he will spend a night outside of Hogwarts wards.

Now, don't get me wrong, Dumbledore won't be a pushover but impossible is the wrong term. There are always ways.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

** Hmm...well, linkffn(5142024) by AntaresTheEighthPleiade is the start of a series where Harry and his friends are some big prophesied heroes, and Dumbledore is the Spider destined to bring the world to ruin. Tragically never finished.

I haven't read it for ages, but from what I remember, Dumbledore poses an extremely serious threat behind the facade of 'grandfatherly hero of the Wizarding World' he puts on, and one point of the series has him almost successfully assassinate Hermione; the heroes have to use fake identities (and in the above instance, a fey-supplied body double) for their work so he can't track them down and kill all of them.

  Take a WBWL-verse, add in some Slytherin Harry with Voldemort's memories, and add just a dash of Parselmagic, and what do you get? Harry Potter and the Sorting Hat's Gift, Book 1 of the Saga of the Lightning Speaker.

** Hmm yeah, the Manipulative old Bastard Dumbledore is more often than not played for laughs.

In most stories that I can think of he's either not as evil as you'd like him to be or not a genuine threat.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw]]) :

"Dodging Prison ..." has a pretty competent Dumbledore, but it's not clear how evil he really is.

[[http://www.roughtrade.org/darkly-loyal-chapters-1-5-by-keira-marcos/]] :

"Darkly Loyal" (warning: slash) has a super evil Dumbledore, but he's not that dangerous because time-travel shenanigans.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3807777/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Acts-of-Betrayal]]) :

One of my favorite guilty-pleasure stories in that category, but it's all very over the top (on purpose).

  The Semiclassic 'everyone has been lying to Harry about everything' plot. Very AU. Bashing of pretty much everyone. Mind Control Sex. Language. Dumbledore decides the Old Families won't tolerate the Chosen One being with a mudblood. Sucks to be Ron Ginny
