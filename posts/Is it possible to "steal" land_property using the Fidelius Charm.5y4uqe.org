For instance, if someone "really* wanted someone else's house, could they break in while the owners are gone and cast the charm? It's supposed to be hard or whatever, but it's a really nice house. If it /is/ possible, is it illegal? How would they persecute? The owners wouldn't know about it, and they probably wouldn't be the secret keepers, and wouldn't be able to report it.

** It's been my belief for a while that there are limitations on the Fidelius charm implied by how it was used within the story.

- It can only be used on a building, as that's the only way it was ever used
- The owner must be a participant in the casting, as it's his or her property that is being secured
- The Fidelius will break down if the building can no longer fulfill its function; if the roof is gone it's no longer a shelter
- Corollary to the above, you can't cast the Fidelius on a monument, business or public building, as hiding it directly contradicts the purpose of that sort of building
- The spell requires that trust be given; you can't make the secret keeper the one who is being hidden there and you can't make the secret keeper someone for whom you're holding a similar secret

Unfortunately for that last point, book seven shot holes into any sense of consistency about how the spell functions, mostly with this one passage:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Right. Dobby, I want you to grab Luna, Dean and Mr Ollivander, and take them -- take them to --'

  ‘Bill and Fleur's,' said Ron. ‘Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth!'
#+end_quote

Bill later informs Harry that their safehouses are protected by Fidelius charm, and that Bill is secret-keeper for Shell Cottage (his own house, though if Arthur Weasley bought it for them, maybe there's a loophole). That doesn't explain how Ron can tell Dobby where to evacuate them.

It's confusing as you say that Bill is the Secret Keeper. I think your suggestion that Arthur might own the property is plausible, it's worth noting that the Weasleys move from the Burrow to Murial's House.

#+end_quote

It would still undermine the whole Trust/Fidelius intent part of the spell, which IMHO is most important to preserve. Who cares who owns the house? If you can live in the house AND be the secret keeper there's no reason to ever have someone outside of the house be the secret keeper. Why didn't James and Lily just gift their house in Godrics Hollow to Dumbledore and be their own secret keepers?

Same with the whole "underage Magic trace" stuff I think we have to accept that in some regards the writing is just too inconsistent to make sense of it. Fanfic authors should just stick with one or the other interpretation, explain how it works in their story and stay internally consistent that way.

*** Another reason for having an outsider knowing the secret would be the ability to spread it to the right people without the ones in hiding leaving the property. Bill, who's not as much as a target as Lily and James were, didn't have to remain at the property all the time.

Also, I've added another limitation in my head-canon: the more people who know the would-be secret, the more it will take to perform the fidelius. Hiding Hogwarts, for instance, wouldn't work and possibly land the wizards and witches casting it in a coma.

** I have a theory that the Fidelius Charm can only be used on buildings. It uses a four walls and a roof mentality and cannot be used to hide farmland or any open spaces. I believe that you cast it inside and then it expand outwards like a dome and stops at solid foundations. If a wall or roof breaks then the spell breaks -- also explains how the Fidelius over the Potter house vanished.

I also believe that it must be /your/ property. If you have stolen it or taken it by force, the spell will not stick. This makes sense for why the Death Eaters didn't abuse this with Hogwarts or why family manors weren't stolen or seized when the line died out.

The owner of said property must be present or cast the spell. Again, this explains the rarity behind the spells. Same with hiding the secret keeper. As wordhammer said. Voldemort cannot be his own secret keeper, same with Lily and James.

This one is for my current story...

The binder is ‘Obliviated' of the location and the fact they cast it. They may have been the binding force, but they were not the secret keeper or the owner.

Does that include Ministry laws? I don't remember if it's canon, but lots of fanfics have the Potter house in Godric's Hollow made into some kind of historical landmark or something, often compensated with a single Gallon.

I'd love to see a fanfic where Harry casts the Fidelius over the entire property to take back what the Ministry in effect stole from him through "legal" means.

Grimmauld Place itself wasn't protected under the Fidelius -- the location of the Order was. If Bellatrix had separate reason to go there (and could get past the considerable protections on the townhouse), she could presumably do so, just never making the connection to the Order's location.

Flitwick seemed to think it would prevent Voldemort from seeing Harry's family, but would not prevent him from seeing their home.

Harry, in narration, saw:

#+begin_quote
  “Think about what you've just memorized,” said Lupin quietly.

  Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about number twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had inflated, pushing those on either side out of its way. Harry gaped at it. The stereo in number eleven thudded on. Apparently the Muggles inside hadn't even felt anything.
#+end_quote

Which is inconsistent. The most obvious explanation is that JK Rowling hadn't fully envisioned how the charm worked at that point. The next most obvious is that Flitwick doesn't precisely know how the charm works, not having seen it in action.

A third alternative is that Lily and James had their family's existence hidden, not their place of residence -- which turns the charm from protecting a location, to protecting any secret, which is much more powerful.

Or possibly the charm wouldn't keep you out and doesn't mess with space, but it does mess with your perceptions. Voldemort would think his nose were pressed to the bricks of the neighbor's house instead.

#+begin_quote
  The point is that they no matter how they search for Dumbledore's resistance movement, they won't be able to find the address.
#+end_quote

They won't be able to establish that it's the headquarters. They might think that it's a secondary base, or that it's a major safehouse, or simply that several members live there.

If the secret had been "Members of the Order of the Phoenix can be found at number twelve Grimmauld Place", then that would actually do something useful. The kids would be vulnerable at that point, but someone trying to find Remus Lupin would either be unable to track him down at Grimmauld Place or unable to suspect that he's a member of the Order.

It has to be more general than precisely what's written on the paper for it to have the desired effect.

That's simply not true. We saw a lot of evidence for their talents and skills in the books. True, none of them are "gods" at magic, but we only know of 3 people alive during the books that would, /maybe/ be worthy of that title - Grindelwald, Dumbledore and Voldemort.

We don't know of Arthurs abilities as they're never shown. However he /did/ enchant a car to almost sentience, so take that as you will.

Molly Weasley beat up Bellatrix Lestrange. You know, the psychopathic mass-murderess who is known for her prowess on the battlefield.

Charlie Weasley is a non-entity mostly. But he is a dragon handler, so...

Percy Weasley also isn't known for his magic. No verdict there.

The twins are shown to be able of quite spectacular magic. Not just in a sense of making great fireworks, but as in using highly complex magic for highly complex effects.

Ron is lazy. Thats probably why he isn't spectacular at magic. He is the only one of the Weasleys we know better who isn't particularly gifted at magic. Not saying he is bad, he's probably just average given his grades.

Ginny is invited to the Slug Club for being great at hexing people. I mean, get that: Ginny hexed someone in such an expert fashion in front of a Professor that instead of detention she gets an invitation. An Invitation that is repeated, meaning that Slughorn sees something in her. I would say that Slughorn is a somewhat competent judge of talent.

All in all, the Weasleys tend to be above average in their use of and skill in magic. Not gods, sure, but definitely somewhere in the upper echelons.

oh, and edit: Bill and Fleur not particularly gifted at magic? Yeah... One's a cursebreaker the other was a Triwizard Champion. If you describe those as "not particularly gifted at magic" what kind of description would you give the other 90% of Britains wizarding population?

Pretty sure the requirement to be a police officer is at least a bachelors. But I could be wrong, that, however, is not the point. Being expelled considerably lowers career choices, if it's a job that someone who didn't finish their fourth year, could do, then it's likely in the domain of being easy.

Yep, minimum requirement for federal police is bachelors.

No, Mage is a male term, synonymous with wizard. Once again, you prove to show your ignorance through opinionated reasoning. You can't even form proper rebuttals, so you stick to commenting on my wording and my annoyance at the use of the 'Mage' pro-noun. Maybe I dislike you using it, because it is never stated in the books as being a valid descriptor? likely because it actually means something in the potterverse.

Do a Google image search for mage. According to you, we shouldn't see any female characters showing up. In fact, we do see female characters.

In the webcomic 8-Bit Theatre, the character White Mage is a woman.

You've provided no sources, only bloviation. Repeating your point doesn't strengthen it.

Nice Strawman, but I didn't they they were crud. Said they were average, if not slightly below due to lack of finishing education. They invent, doesn't mean that they did anything advanced.

Police as such do not exist at the federal level in the US. Are you referring to the FBI? The US Marshals? The DEA? The ATF? The Bureau of Prisons? Border Patrol? The Coast Guard? These are all independent agencies with their own requirements.

**************** Are you purposefully being ignorant? Plenty of law enforcement positions exist in a federal level. But, as I said, that is neither here no there. The point is, to become a police officer, you need to finish your education (Hogwarts education ends at about the time high school ends). So if you take someone who only has a fourteen year old's knowledge of magic, and say that they can do the tough jobs that fully equipped wizards can, then you're only kidding yourself.

Who is talking about the twins? Stop switching the goal posts. If most jobs require that you finish your education, one that doesn't is either less 'mentally intensive' or more labor intensive. One can assume that Charlie's job isn't much of a big deal. Whilst you said that him working with dragons was a 'nuff said' on how powerful he is. Fred and George are obviously not the best Wizards, as if they were, Molly would have furthered her attempts at getting them to finish their education. Four O.W.L.s after months of studying only proves my point further.

The Mage point is one you conceded fairly quickly, after I said that calling anyone a mage is against canon in this context, as no one uses it in canon. Seriously, we had Warlock, Witch, Wizard, Wizardess, Sorceress, Sorcerer, and you choose mage, the only term never used in canon. I don't know why you attempt to push it?

***************** As I understand this subthread, you're debating whether the Weasley twins could be excellent wizards given that they left school with an incomplete education.

The point I vaguely made towards the top of this was that 'ability to make money with magic without resorting to theft' was not a function of magical ability so much as business acumen. There are plenty of low-income geniuses and average-IQ millionaires out there in both the real and literary worlds to prove my point: there is no direct relationship between magical ability and economic success, a direct reply to what [[/u/SuperAlexIY][u/SuperAlexIY]] was suggesting:

  Petty crime isn't really common in the Magical World, we didn't really see many criminal acts that didn't involve Voldemort and his Death Eaters if any at all.
#+end_quote

Petty crime /is/ common in the magical world. We saw many criminal acts perpetrated that didn't involve Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Fletcher was guilty of theft, burglary, fraud, and dealing in stolen goods. Arthur Weasley threatened to chase after a huckster selling fake metamorph medals, but he was off-duty and busy leading the family on a shopping trip. I can't even say whether gambling was illegal, but Ludo Bagman defrauded the goblins by making a wager and running away when it didn't play out for him.
