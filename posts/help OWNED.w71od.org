sooo.... im trying to find this fanfic called Owned ..... dont know who the author is, i bookmarked it but now the link is a dead end, wondering if anyone knows anything about it.its a HG/SS fic, shes captured and given to him, he keeps her safe, and healthy, then the revels start, and she asks him to take her v card, so that she would have some control over it. then she becoms his sub. then harry and ron find out. its a great fic, and i just want to read it again, but its gone :( the link used to be fanfic.net/s/5443075/1/owned\\
if anyone knows anything or a way for me to find it, i would be greatly appreciative of assistance i cant imagine its GONE gone, maybe changed names or something ?


** I just googled, and it looks like a fair number of people are looking for this fic not being able to find it. From some forums I found, it looks like the author went by TwilightDarkness82, if that helps you find it. It also claims that the author currently writes Twilight fics under the name Deavlynn.

At this point, it looks like your best bet is trying to contact the author directly. Lost fics is becoming a serious problem, you might want to consider going through and saving copies of your favorite fics if you have time, because a lot of the classics from the golden age of HP fanfic are starting to disappear.
