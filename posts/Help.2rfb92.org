Are there any good Dm/hp fics out there? I think I went through most of them by now. So any suggestions?


** I would just recommend going back through LJ Fests. A lot of the new ones are also hosted on AO3 and then you can track through the authors and find their other works. I'd also check on AO3 to see if any of your favorite authors have saved works as favorites. Here's a [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Fionaxyz/bookmarks][link to my AO3 bookmarks]]. They aren't /all/ DM/HP but the majority are, hopefully there are at least one or two new ones and if not it might be a starting point to start digging.

** When I'm not sure what Drarry fic to read, I often check this [[https://www.diigo.com/list/applelingrecs?&page_num=0&count=20&tab=1][Massive Drarry Fanfiction Theme List]] to help me find a fic based on what theme or trope I'm in the mood to read. Maybe you'll find something interesting there.

I've just finished [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3727][Draco's Boy]], which is a Non-Magic AU and I thought it was excellent! I highly recommend it!

** Not sure if it's the kind of thing you're looking for, but there's an amazing fic, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/384548/chapters/629550][The Rise of the Drackens]] It's Harry/Draco/Blaise/OC/OC, and a creature fic, well worth checking out.
