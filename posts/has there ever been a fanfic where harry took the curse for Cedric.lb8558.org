basically looking for a story where after arriving in the graveyard, what if harry (accidentally or intentionally) got inbetween Cedric and the curse.

of course there are many ways to write it, but i could see him getting hit with the AK then going to kings cross, and meeting his parents there.

perhaps due to the mistake they simply take Cedric's blood and send 2 percieved bodies back (although i would like to see Cedric escape somehow) and then Harry awakes after his "body" arrives back at hogwarts. figure voldy sent the body as a message that he was back, or something, as he was less needing to hide with harry "dead"


** Unfortunately no, but I see huge potentials here:

1. Wormtail's AK killed the Horcrux in Harry, and he wakes up after a few hours.
2. Wormtail's AK killed Harry, and the Horcrux wakes up after a few hours. He pretends to be Harry, but secretly wants to be the dark lord.

The second option sounds far more intriguing to me, as this can make for a much more credible "Harry as the 3rd faction" story. Him corrupting the good kids will also be interesting to watch.

*** Not sure about intriguing since I've seen the dark lord done wrong plenty of times already... but, it seems like the most likely case, doesn't it? The scarcrux needed to be killed by Voldemort, not wormtail

*** I thought the only reason Harry survived the Killing Curse in Book 7 was because Voldemort had his blood, Voldemort did the deed using the wand that recognised Harry as it's master and Harry didn't put in a fight.

If Wormtail kills Harry, he dies with the horcrux.

**** Not Harmony, I didn't go into the sequel as that's actually the WIP, but it seemed like it was going for a Harry/Luna.

As the summary says - Accidental Animagus is up to year 4 - then Animagus At War (which is the actual WIP at this point) will cover the rest.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.
