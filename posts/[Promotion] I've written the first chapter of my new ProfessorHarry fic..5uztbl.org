Hello all. I said I'd do it, and I've done it. I've already written the second but will withhold publishing it to see if it's worth the time.

It's not too long, but I think I've done a decent job.

Tell me what you guys think about it!


** Sorry, but down voted for extortion. I won't read stories where the author demands a certain amount of reviews, likes, etc before posting more. Either write and post it because you like it or don't waste our time and yours.

I guarantee there will be people who like what you wrote, but when you stop writing the story because you don't get the amount of recognition you think you're due, it will be beyond frustrating to them and you will lose fans.

*** I think what you said is right, but it works both ways. I write for my own enjoyment, but I put my fics online because I like to know what others think of them.

When I said "if it's worth the time" I was referring to a previous one I made, that I took down, that was shitstormed. Seriously, I had 78 negative reviews simply writing "bad", "you suck" on a fic where Dumbledore thinks back on his mistakes and his victories.

I simply don't want to deal with that kind of thing.

**** If you like the story then screw them. I know, "easier said than done," as no one likes hearing (useless) negative criticism. But you can't be an artist, and a writer is an artist, if you can't accept there will be idiots out there, who have never written anything more than a grocery list, telling you that, "you suck".

There will be others, even those you might respect as authors, who will also tell you, "you suck". And those will hurt infinitely more, but you're job as an author, as an artist in any medium, is to shake off the useless criticism, decide if the other criticism is worth listening to, and continue with your art.

After 5 years of continual rejection, Agatha Christie finally got a deal. Only William Shakespeare has sold more.

JKR was rejected 12 times from publishers and advised not to quit her day job before Philosopher's Stone was published.

Louis L'Amour received 200 rejections before Bantam took a chance on him.

Dr. Seuss was told he was, “Too different from other juveniles on the market to warrant its selling.” He's the 9th best-selling fiction author of all time.

The authors of "Chicken Soup for the Soul" received 140 rejections stating “Anthologies don't sell”.

Judy Blume had two years of rejections stating that her fiction would have no readership before she was picked up.

You're writing might not compare to the above. It might never compare, but they didn't give up from people telling them, "you're too different" or "no one reads this style" or "don't quit you're day job". They took the criticism and decided whether it was worth listening to and most importantly didn't give up.

You might not ever be JKR, but you could be the next Jeconais, or Rorschach, or Clell, or whoever that will cause the next great Harry Potter cliché. You could find your stories being down voted on reddit in 5 years because they are so, "contrived" and "cliché" while the ones who recommended them argue they are only cliché because they were the first!

TL;DR ignore the haters, keep writing, never give up, never surrender. And get a beta. It's a good idea to at least have one person you trust go over the grammer and make sure you are connecting the dots in your plot.

** As long as it doesn't focus on silly romances/emo, I'll give it a try. As for first chapter, no judgment so far.

*** Meh, I don't know yet if I'll write more than master of defense, and even that will be pretty different. I'm going to write about the whole seven years, or six in this case
