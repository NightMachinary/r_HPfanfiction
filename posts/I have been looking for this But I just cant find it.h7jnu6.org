Dragons, Snakes, and Secrets Demondog136, EllianaNarna Summary: Harry Potter thought his fourth year was going to be peaceful, where he wouldn't have to worry about anything (except the Dark Lord out for his blood, as per bloody usual). The Tri-Wizard tournament was here at Hogwarts and he was not old enough to take place. How wrong could he turn out to be? When his name is called from the goblet, a plethora of changes and secrets are on their way. How can Harry defeat dragons and handle deceiving headmasters, while also learning things about the past that will change not just his life, but the fate of the Wizarding World?

** Do you remember if it was ffn, ao3 or something else? ao3's tagging system is ridiculously comprehensive, so it would be easy to find it. If it was on ffn, you will need several virgin sacrifices.

  During the second term of Harry's sixth year, he ends up saving Daphne Greengrass from a fate worse than death. To repay him, she teaches him Occlumency and they get to know each other well enough to learn that labels are not always useful... HP/DG

  After Harry's name is released from the Goblet of Fire, only Hermione seems to believe he didn't enter himself, that is until a chance meeting one day by the great lake. What will become of a Gryffindor and Slytherin trying to be friends with each other? Harry/Daphne. Completed.
