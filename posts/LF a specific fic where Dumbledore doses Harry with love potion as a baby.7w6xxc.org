I think it was too increase his love --- "the power the Dark Lord knows not" --- and resulted in Harry being madly in love with Hermione, even before he had met her.

** Why Hermione? She is just a muggleborn and no one knew her before 1991... I always hated lazy, incompetent author who would find any excuses to just force any connection between Harry and Hermione.

  In order to increase 'the power the Dark Lord knows not,' Dumbledore gives baby Harry a powerful love potion. This bold move results in...unusual consequences. Witness Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, Boy-Who-Caught-the-Snitch-Two-Times, and Boy-Who-Conquered-Voldemort-But-Did-Not-Kill-Him at his very best...which is considerably less impressive than everyone expects. AU.
