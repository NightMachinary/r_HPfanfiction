Hi, I'm currently looking for fics where Harry is in an abusive relationship. Preferably m/m relationships. If you have any fan-fictions or fan-fiction communities etc. that you could suggest it would be greatly appreciated. I've been looking but most abuse fics center around the Dursleys and while i do enjoy reading those sometimes that's just not what I'm looking for at the moment.


** You doing okay?

*** I'm doing fine, I just enjoy the more tragic part of literature. Thank you for asking though.

** For m/m relationships, you're better going to [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]. There's a link to it in the sidebar.
