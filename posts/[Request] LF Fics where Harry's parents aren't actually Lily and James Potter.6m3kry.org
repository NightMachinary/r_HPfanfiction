I found a WIP recently where Harry is the son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy and they take him from the Dursleys to live with them, and that made me want more similar fics, but I'm not sure if I'm having problems finding similar fics because I'm bad at searching, not patient enough to scroll through hundreds of unrelated fics, or because they don't exist.

Preference against Harry being Severus Snape's son. Otherwise any and all recs welcome and appreciated! I also vaguely remember reading a fic or two some time ago where only one of the Potters was actually Harry's parent; recs for fics with that premise are also welcome and appreciated!


** I once read a fic where Harry's parents were Voldemort and his wife, Caroline something I think. Will try to find it. Also read a few stories where Voldemort or Sirius were Harry's father.

Found it - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6963092/1/Keeping-Appearances]]

Do be aware Dumbledore is super fucked up in this story.

** "Incendio" by Savya398. Harry is the son of Smaug. LOTR crossover. Less cracky than it sounds. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2761430/chapters/6191972]]

There are also a bunch of Avengers crossovers where Harry is the son of Tony Stark, Loki, Thor, etc. I'd imagine you'll find more in other crossovers too.

So all of those stories where Harry is the ass-baby of Snape & Luscious Malfoy are probably out, huh?

(Good call...)
