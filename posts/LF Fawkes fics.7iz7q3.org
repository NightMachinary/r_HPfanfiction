Looking for fics where Fawkes has a major role or the main POV. Or perhaps a fic where Fawkes is Harry's or someone else (not Dumbledore) patronus or animagus form.

It's probably my favourite characterization of Fawkes I've ever read. However it's in a slashfic (Albus/OMC) so it might not be your thing.

  Formerly The Weekend and Madame Esme. Albus Dumbledore thought that defeating Gellert was the hardest thing he had ever done. That was until a rather shy Dumbledore attempted to acquire a date for Elphias Doge's party. Postdefeat of Grindelwald Era. Slash
