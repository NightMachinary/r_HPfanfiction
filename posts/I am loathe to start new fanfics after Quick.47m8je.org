After Alexandra Quick ( and hpmor and Prince of the dark kingdom) I am loathe to start a new fic. Anybody else feel the same way? I just can't find any fics that even scratch the immense world building those authors have done. Especially Alexandra Quick. And I yearn for more!


** Read something what is supposed to be "light". A comedy or something like that (like linkffn(A Black Comedy)). After that it should be easy.

If that is nothing to you either read nothing a week. Helps too. Than you should easily bea able to immerse into a new fic. I unforunaly cant recommend something like those both as I never finished either.

*** Seconded. Best thing to do after a big epic is a series of shorter stories. Take in some comedy, lighthearted romance, and avoid the world building. I prefer the longer stories for most of my reading, but the short stuff is great to cleanse your fanfiction pallet

** If you want more fic with rich world building, I suggest [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] by Diane Castle, where "Harworts" is an exclusive boarding school for training commandos, spies, handlers, interrogators, hackers, and other staff for Britain's tumultuous Intelligence Community, where skill, technology, and occasional James-Bond-style superscience takes the place of magic. Most children who go there come from families in the Community, such as the "Wellesleys" and the "Malenfants", but some common children, like Hermione and Colin can get an invitation if they do something particularly cunning or vicious. The overall plot follows canon loosely (in that the big challenge of each year parallels that of that year of canon), but it's a plus in this case, because it's interesting to see how the magical events of HP canon are reflected in this spy-verse.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

**** The only one who ever says "My love" out loud in the fic is an adult. And that happens once.

I always write from the POV of a character, not an omniscient author. So, fifteen year olds will think of their boy/girlfriends as "their love". That's what tends to happen when you're young, full of hormones, and just got together.

Not that it happens that often anyway ("his/her love" is mentioned 9 times total, in over 50 chapters), and never out loud.

** well linkffn(4098039) has in depth worldbuilding and the author is very fond of using elements or details foreshadowed 300000 words ago to come in effect later on in the story. The pacing is unequal but the writing competent, which is also how I'd describe Prince of the Forbidden Kingdom so there's that.

Stands complete at 1.3 million words, which should qualify it for the "epic" descriptive.
