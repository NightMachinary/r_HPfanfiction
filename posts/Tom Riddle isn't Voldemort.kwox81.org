When Tom Riddle was in school, he was a part of a group that experimented in some of the blackest magic to achieve immortality. As part of that group, he took the name Voldemort. When he went to ask for the DADA post, he was just a mild serial killer, yet to become a dark lord. When he left Hogwarts though, he left Wizarding Britain entirely.

A member of that group, one who idolized Tom, saw this as a betrayal of the name. He took Voldemort as his own name and became a Dark Lord.

After Voldemort's return, Tom's had enough...


** There's a comparable plotline in the Pureblood Pretense series.

Tom Riddle created the Diary containing a sentient magical construct, "Voldemort", copying his sixteen-year-old self's mind, and he was going to add a piece of his soul - but then he realised that losing bits of his soul would diminish him, and regretted Myrtle's death. Instead of war, he turned to politics, where he succeeded in restricting Hogwarts to purebloods only, and barring anyone educated abroad from working in high government positions or publicly listed companies, thus putting non-purebloods firmly in an underclass, and allowing new magic to enter the wizarding world properly only after several generations.

However, as part of his plan to next restrict intermarriage between muggle-borns and half-bloods, he sent the Diary to Hogwarts, intending to undermine Dumbledore's credibility and political influence. By this time the Diary was half-mad from isolation and gradually dwindling magic, but retained his sixteen-year-old drive to 'purge' the world, and it decided that Riddle had become complacent and weak. It opened the Chamber of Secrets, intending to overthrow Dumbledore violently, and when that failed, it struck out on its own to gather followers and 'cleanse' society of Muggle taint through terrorism.

*** Honestly I feel like that this way of keeping the non-purebloods in a lower class, is the only one that would work

**** He actually has some good reasons mixed in with his bad ones. His marriage law is meant to encourage intermarriage between half-bloods and pure-bloods, thus reducing the inbreeding that is causing the Fade.

***** So he managed to keep the racism in a way that actually is self-sustaining to the Wizarding World?

**** I'm waiting eagerly for the update to book four, whenever it comes. The last chapter is such a cliffhanger. The kind of cliffhanger that is usually found in the last chapters of abandoned stories.

***** The author last updated in mid-December, and then before that, in May or June. So however slow it might be going, it isn't abandoned!

There's a snippet in this chapter; in it, Magical Britain and the rest of the magical world is utterly morally bankrupt, and Tom Riddle washes his hands of it after diddling Abraxas Malfoy out of his fortune, but Abraxas strikes back by stealing Tom's pseudonym of Voldemort for himself and starting the First Wizarding War.

** I read that somewhere, only in that fic, they made this story to convince everyone that Tom was the original and the darkness in him was somehow gotten out of himself due to a curse and turned into Voldemort. Tom returned after long time and worked to defeat Voldemort.

** I remember one fanfic(which was rather bash heavy) that had a somewhat similar premise, but the Dark Lord was birthed from the creation of horcruxes, and when he initially created it, he wasn't evil, just desperate and feeling cornered.
