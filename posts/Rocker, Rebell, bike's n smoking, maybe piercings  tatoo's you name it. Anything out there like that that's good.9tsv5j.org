:END:
Preferably with romance! I do like myself relationships in fanfictions... :P

maybe a bit like linkffn(Runaways) .... just more substantial/better?

e:/ i know that fic doesnt really incoorporate what i search that much or at all, but it gave me the idea for this search! And the bot got the wrong fic...


** I wrote a little Sirius one shot that has some of those things. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11860627/1/Make-Much-of-Time]]

  Charlotte and Eladriel, although cousins, are brother and sister; best friends until the end of the line. They'll always have each other's back, even when they both ran away from their abusive household to live on the streets together.
