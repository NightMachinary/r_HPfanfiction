  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  The war didn't end when Harry and Voldemort fell. Hermione refuses to feel helpless any longer, and goes back in time to remove the scar that an unloved Tom Riddle left on the wizarding world. Tangled in the pureblood sphere, will Hermione just become another cog in Tom Riddle's plans? Final pairing is a secret! But not a Tomione. Lestrange OC. Parent!Hermione Child!Tom. COMPLETE!

** Last time it was Molly! Now you've gone and raised the age gap by 40 years from the previous 30! You know Tom Riddle could basically be Hermione's grandpa or something

I hope this doesn't go to Rose Weasley's kids next or something

Yes i know it's time travel, but still it feels wrong

***** The nice thing about /fan/fiction is that fans can write whatever they want, and if it's well written then it's guaranteed to be an enjoyable read for at least a few people, often more. Your /opinion/ about what's "supposed to be done" isn't going to stop other fans from enjoying it.

****** Ah yes, I agree with you

I would also like to point out that I never told anyone that they're not /allowed to/ write it, I just expressed my opinion about such fanfictions.

******* You phrased it as if you thought you were stating a fact, which comes across as insulting to people whose tastes are different from yours. If you meant it as a subjective statement of opinion, then it would be polite to phrase it as such; i.e. "this idea doesn't appeal to me" or "I'd prefer not to read that sort of thing."

******** Of course, but that wouldn't discourage anyone of writing such fictions and would end up in me finding more of such fictions
