I love Harry Potter fanfics but I feel like Quidditch, and it's complexities have been looked over somewhat in both the main series and fan fics. I was thinking of doing a fan fic, filled with completely original characters, with the main character starting in second year and finishing at a professional level. Does this sound interesting to anyone, or do I just have a weird taste in stories?


** As a gamedesigner I detest the victory condition rules of Quidditch. The core-game itself is pretty solid. Three chasers, two beater, one keeper. Its the seeker that gives me headaches, or rather, the disgusting amount of points he can win. 120 points (12 goals) renders most games played before the catching of the snitch insignificant. I think the only game we see in canon that is won by the Chasers is the worldcup and there we hear that the Bulgarian Chasers are at least two leagues under the Irish.

Therefore, the only Quidditch fics I would read are ones where the six most active players in a team are the ones deciding most games. The seeker is nice and all, but his core mechanic is to end the game (or prevent it from ending if his team is too far behind). If catching the snitch would give, maybe, 50 points the whole game would be /a lot/ better.

Also, Quidditch fics live and die with the action scenes. Get them right and the fic will be at least an entertaining read.

Complete OC is something I wouldn't read.

*** This is also partly due to how incredibly detached from the rest of the game the seekers are and how short the sample games given in the books are. Remember, the game /only/ ends when the snitch is caught, with no breaks and no replacement players.

The longer the game lasts the easier it becomes for one side to dominate on the field and for the points from the snitch to lose relevance.

That's not quite true. A match can also end if the captains agree, but that's one of those things which rarely happens. As for breaks, a captain can call time out, though probably for no longer than a minute. And there are replacement players, but not for injury. I'm 90% certain it was mentioned that there was a match that went on for like 3 days/weeks or so, and they had to keep bringing in subs so that the players could get some rest.

Thats exactly what would make a Seeker interesting. Do we need to win before they get a significant lead? Do I need to keep the snitch away from the other seeker, but don't catch it so we can catch up?

If a game is won by the Chasers it feels earned. If its won by the Seeker alone, then it feels like cheating.

*** Indeed, the seeker could be made into a balanced player by integrating him/her to the game more tightly (as distraction or the occasional chaser) and reducing the snitch points to the equivalent of five or less goals.

*** On the other hand, we need to remember to put the snitch into context. It's a small golden ball, with fine silvery wings, and it's about the size of a walnut. The Quidditch pitch is larger than an american football field, and as far as we know, there's not height restriction for the snitch to fly (we do know it can't leave the confines of the pitch, contrary to the second movie.)\\
I don't think it's really the points that are unbalanced, but the matches we see played (other than the world cup) make it seem very easy to catch the snitch.

I think it can be put down to the difference between Hogwarts Quidditch and Professional Quidditch. International Snitches would probably be faster and harder to catch than school ones.

Another thing to note is that at Hogwarts, the number of games you win is irrelevant, it is the total number of points you win that wins you the cup. Seems fairly balanced imo.

Personally I think that is one of the most absurd parts of the books. It's possible, although unlikely, to lose all three matches and win the quiddich cup.

** I like sport, so I enjoy fics that have Quidditch related plotlines - whether it's an OC, Wood at Puddlemere, or Harry playing for England.

Generally, the most successful Quidditch-centric fics balance the game with some other sort of plotline that runs independently. Other things to look for that I think benefit the fic including a nuanced, structural development of how Quidditch functions and plays out on a day to day basis - discuss the domestic & international game, different coaching styles and philosophies, media commitments and contracts, things like a draft or designated player system. You could also have the player in your story transfer from a club in England to another country, and then part of the fic is about life adjustment.

To generate plots and drama that can occur to break away from the game day experience, reading autobiographies from sports players/managers could help as a way of generating material.

This is probably the most Quidditch centric fic I can think of off the top of my head. If you end up publishing and are looking for a beta reader/want to discuss ideas, shoot us a PM.

We've had:

- Jinxed Broom
- Rogue bludger
- Dementors
- death eaters
- a big fight culminating in Harry, Fred and George being banned.
- ...

We've never once seen a nomal match of quidditch being played because that'd be boring as hell.

** In my mind, quidditch should be changed in order to make it more interesting. As many people stated, making the snitch worth 50 points would make more sense. But also increasing the amount of games at hogwarts would also make a lot of sense, in my mind. Playing only 3 games is boring. But playing each team 5 times would make for a 15 game season for each team as well as develop more intrigue throughout the season as standings change.

Another aspect that might make it a bit more interesting is doing less of in-game action. And by that, I mean practices would be discussed a bit more, managing teams would be discussed more (if it's professional, then trades between teams), and bickering back and forth between teammates. In my opinion, it would be better to discuss the actual games by articles or commentary after the fact. "Potter is going to be something special, eh? Give Johnson, the general manager of Puddlemere, credit. He saw the talent in this kid and signed him early and now he's setting records. Nineteen goals in this last game with eleven assists, I have never seen a kid like this completely dominate a game. All he needs is seven goals in his next match-up against Hufflepuff to tie Philip Gerard for most goals scored in a single season at Hogwarts"

Stuff like that allows you to let the reader know what actually happened in the game while not being repetitive. Rather than individually describing each goal, you just point out that he scored nineteen. That way you can concentrate more on the off-the-pitch stuff while keeping quidditch a focal point of the story.

*** Yeah I definitely agree with what everyone is saying. The snitch thing has always really annoyed me, so I'm definitely gonna change its value, and 50 does seem to be a reasonable amount, but I might up it to 70, to play with that whole 7 is a magical number thing. I agree with playing more games, but 5 seems a little extreme in my opinion for a school setting, I was thinking twice, perhaps three times. I mean the kids still need to go to school :P. And yeah the side of Quidditich I really wanted to explore was the management and practise side, obviously I'll include games, but they will most likely only be pivotal, or story necessary ones, I want to more focus on what life as a upcoming, and then professional Quidditch player would be like, with the girls, fame, etc that our professional sports people deal with. In my opinion this should create some nice drama and obstacles for my protagonist.

The only reason people go to hogwarts if for the quidditch, obviously. The people in class are there as punishment for not making the house team) Pivotal games and scenes are important, as long as it's not every game told in its entirety. That can get a bit repetitive.
