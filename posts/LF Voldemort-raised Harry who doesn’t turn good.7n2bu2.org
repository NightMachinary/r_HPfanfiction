I can't recall seeing a fic where Harry is raised by Voldemort that doesn't end with him turning against his father and either going to the light or just betraying him for his own gain. I want one of those. Preferably one with major canon divergence, and not just plot regurgitation with a dark harry. Lily and James being alive is okay too.

Bashing and slash are fine. Please no harems, mpreg, pottercest, romance/smut-driven plot or genderbending. Thank you!


** Linkffn(Enochian prophecies by kalfu)

This story is odd in a good way. It diverges from canon pretty heavily and it ends well.

  History is the sum of infinite minor events, each one contributing to the next. Some say this is written, this is destiny. Yet when those who walk outside Fate arrive, how can an unmarked invitation change the destiny of the world's two greatest enemies?

** Linkffn(A Different Life by Tiro)

His name changes here, then slash pairing, but it's on the later parts of the book, then new school around his third year, somewhat OP Harry if it's fine with you, lots of Ron and Dumbledore bashing.

Edit: Also remembered another one.

Linkffn(Dark as Night by LavenderStorm)

Still ongoing, but it's recently updated so I think it's not abandoned.

He turns his back to Voldemort due to rage, but he regrets it. A three part series.

  They all thought Lily was Light. She wasn't. She was in love with the Dark Lord, and gave birth to his son. Now Erus Riddle is growing up, showing just how evil the son of Lord Voldemort can be. Of course, the Light doesn't know that fact. Slash later.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12597395/1/His-Twenty-Eighth-Life][His Twenty-Eighth Life]] is /kind of/ what you're asking. He's captured by Voldemort for a few months (maybe a couple years?), but he's never really turned and you couldn't particularly say that Voldemort raised him.

I know it's not exactly what you're looking for, but I can't think of a better matched alternative off the top of my head.

  HPLV. Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is to support Jonathan. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort kidnaps him that Halloween night.
