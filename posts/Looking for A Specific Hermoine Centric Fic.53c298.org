I read a few years ago a Hermione centric fic I don't remember the details all that well but I do remember it was quite heavy and well written the points I do remember are: *Perhaps set in the fifth year? She begins a relationship with one of the Weasley twins and is given a massage by him in the library - this is relationship from what I remember was not a focal point of the story *She either becomes quite sick or feels the effect of some powerful magic and is bedridden for a while at somewhere that is not Hogwarts, Molly is mentioned and Remus visits her, commenting "that she is the brightest witch of her age" and also encouraging her to eat? leave the room? or just in general being supportive? *She looks in the mirror at one point during this time of her being bedridden and does not like/recognise what she sees. *There was a quite heavy and dark undertone to the story which suggests to me that Hermione may have been dabbling or under the effects of dark but from memory, I don't think this was a Dark!Hermoine fic.

I know I haven't been able to provide much detail in terms of the story but that is the very little I can remember and any help would be much appreciated.
