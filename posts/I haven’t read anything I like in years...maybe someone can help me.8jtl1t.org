#+begin_quote
  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

** If you haven't found anything you like in /years,/ maybe you should consider that you've simply outgrown fanfiction. It happens. Or you do what I had to do and write what you want to read. Sometimes that's really the only option.

*** Or he/she is getting burnt out on HP fics. I think the burn out is starting to creep up on me. I read published books too, but HP fics are free when I'm broke. I wish more fandoms had great recommendation reddits like this one. Its such a pain to slog through the fanfiction sites without recommendations. Its like going through the sewer barefoot with the hope of sometimes finding someone's accidently flushed wedding ring.

** It really depends on how much action you want. If you want something that is canon compliant and still retains a lot of the original books' feel, I recommend this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6342013/1/Hunters-and-Prey]] . It has a story that could easily fit into the canon after the penultimate chapter in Deathly Hallows and has action and excitement but also focuses on other aspects of Harry's life.

#+begin_quote
  To avoid the unjust prosecution of his friends in the days following the end of the war, Harry Potter signed a magical contract in blood. Years later, Harry struggles with the balance of his latest Auror case involving a wizard ritualistically murdering Muggles, periodic contract renewals, and both the developing and deteriorating relationships with those closest to him. HP/NT.

** Have you just read nothing HP that you liked in years, or have you actually not read /anything/ enjoyable in years? If the latter, then are you looking for more general recommendations?

Really? I find that curious. I would have thought that whatever about it catches your interest, there's almost certain to be some other story that also has it in some way.

If you're looking for learning skills, then one of my favorites - incomplete, but updating very steadily, and hopefully will finish later this year - is Mother of Learning. Original fiction with a groundhog day (actually month) loop, set in a fantasy world with very rich worldbuilding.
