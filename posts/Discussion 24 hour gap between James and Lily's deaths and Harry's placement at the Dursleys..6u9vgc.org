Hello, I've just read an article about a plothole in the Philosopher's stone. We know that McGonagall had been spying on Dursleys for a whole day before Hagrid arrived there. So a question is, what were they up to for 24 hours since they left godric's hollow? Would love to hear what your thoughts on that are and if you have some fic recs that have an explanation to that:) Here is a link to the article, if anyone's interested. [[https://www.unilad.co.uk/life/harry-potter-fans-have-just-discovered-a-massive-plothole-in-the-story/amp/]]


** It's a hole but it's easily filled.

In my head-canon, Dumbledore detected the situation at the Potter's house in Godric's Hollow mere minutes after Voldemort killed Lily. Albus sent Hagrid to the Dumbledore family house in the village via the Floo with orders to sneak over and see what's what.

Hagrid did so, found Harry and then encountered Sirius, who had come when his own tricks revealed that his friends were exposed and/or dead. Sirius gave over his bike to Hagrid and then changed into Padfoot so that he could track down Wormtail.

Hagrid returned to Dumbledore's house and floo-called to tell him who survived, and he was directed to fly Harry to Madame Pomfrey's house in Swansea. Dumbledore then sent Pomfrey home from Hogwarts to check Harry over (as they couldn't trust St. Mungos to be safe and bringing Harry to Hogwarts would take hours since sending him through the Floo or Apparating might harm him) while Dumbledore headed to the scene to investigate. Barely an hour had passed since the Potters died.

Hagrid, bored at Pomfreys but ordered to stay at hand with the cycle, starts chatting with other Order members via the Floo. Pomfrey is called by Dumbledore from his house, because he has detected an unusual protection from around the remains of Harry's crib. Pomfrey is ordered to keep him safe for the day while Dumbledore figures out how to leverage this.

Hagrid, still bored and listening in, called back his gossip friends to update them about Dumbledore's findings- 'Harry killed Voldemort, uh huh!'

Albus came up with a possible solution, but found that there weren't many Evans' left alive for some reason. He ordered McGonagall to Surrey to check out his best prospect.

About here is when Albus started getting inundated with Floo calls from various and sundry, asking for info on Harry vs. Voldemort. He spent what time he wasn't researching blood-based protections doing spin control over everything that Hagrid was heard to say (and given Hagrid's accent, much misinterpretation was at play).

That evening Albus arranged for Hagrid to deliver Harry to the Dursleys, meeting McGonagall there to confirm that they are Lily's family and not cannibal serial-killers. The letter was the keystone of sustaining Harry's protection, and it relied on Petunia accepting the role of substitute parent and host. She did, and the rest is history.

**** So are Dumbledore, Hagrid and McGonagall. This all happened on Halloween, which is a big party night at the school when there isn't a war on. Albus sends Pomfrey to her home with instructions to receive Hagrid and treat whomever is with him, leaving any others outside and telling no one of their location. He does this because keeping a secret at Hogwarts is an exercise in futility, so bringing Harry there wouldn't be safe.

*** Why wouldn'y Poppy just go to the Dumbledore house where Harry is? Moving Harry seems unnecessary.

**** To my mind, because they needed to get Harry away from Godric's Hollow. There's also an assumption that Pomfrey, as a healer, has more supplies at her own home. Plus, everyone knows Dumbeldore is in the thick of things, so they may be congesting his Floo with questions.

** I've thought about this recently, as I actually just reread book 1 this week. This is pretty much the oldest and most well-known plothole. There's no way it should take ~24 hours for Hagrid to fly 300 miles with a flying motorbike. Similar, it's implied that Dumbledore /walked/ to Privet drive, as he mentions that he passed by "dozens of feasts and parties on his way there", which doesn't make sense.

I mean, I can imagine it taking some time for Dumbledore to get whatever paperwork is necessary to place Harry at the Dursley's, as much as is necessary for the Ministry, because the Ministry does know that Harry is living there, judging by Fudge's reaction in book 3.

Explaining the travel times is a lot harder. Perhaps Hagrid flying in the air for a whole day was done on purpose - Hagrid being mobile while Dumbledore sets up the magical protection at the Dursleys so it would be harder for Death Eaters to get revenge on Harrys. It's better to keep moving.

As for Dumbledore, that one's a bit harder to explain. You'd have to interpret his words in some oblique manner. We know that when someone floos, you pass by other stop-off points. So, Dumbledore has never been to Surrey before, and you can't really apparate to somewhere you've never been. So perhaps Dumbledore does whatever business he does during the day, and when he floo's over to the nearest floo near Surrey, he passes by a bunch of grates that all have wizards and witch's celebrating on the other side. That would assume that you actually have enough time to see what is on the other side of the floo as you're passing by, which is a possibility I guess.

The other option is that Dumbledore rode a broom over. Perhaps there were no floos nearby, which is a possibility. But if there were no floos, would there really be the opportunity for Dumbledore to pass by dozens of feasts and parties? We have to assume that those are witches and wizards holding parties, because muggles were clueless about anything going down.

We also have to factor in the possibility that Dumbledore followed a similar path to Hagrid. If we assume Hagrid was simply buying time, waiting for Dumbledore, then perhaps when Dumbledore said that he "passed dozens of feasts and parties on his way here", that he didn't go there in a straight line. Being the immediate aftermath of Voldemort's disappearance, Dumbledore would no doubt be extremely busy. Perhaps that meant he was going all over the countryside, so perhaps you can't actually interpret "on the way here" as a straight line, and that he just saw feasts and parties on every stop he made, wherever it was he was going. Perhaps he would be personally dealing with a lot of immediate fallout, and getting Harry settled wouldn't necessarily be priority number one.

Anyways, I like I said, I have reread book 1 within the last three days, and it's made clear more than ever that numbers is not JKR's strong point. The point that stuck out most to me is when Percy is offended that Dumbledore didn't tell "us prefects" about the forbidden third floor corridor, when Percy is a new prefect and there was really no actual opportunity for Dumbledore to have told them that doesn't involve Dumbledore writing about it in a letter to 24 different people, or making an appearance on the Hogwarts Express before the sorting feast. Both of which seem highly unlikely.

** I would assume dumbledore was quite busy during that time. I mean a war just ended over night and he had to deal wit the aftermath. Hagrid probably took care of him until dumbledore had time for harry
