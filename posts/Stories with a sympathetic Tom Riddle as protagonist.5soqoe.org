Be it that he had a different upbringing, that he decides to accept his own blood-status as part of himself, that he sees a grey alignement as more beneficial than a dark one, or anything else I didn't think of:

Can you suggest stories where Tom Riddle is the protagonist and a sympathetic person, as opposed to a torturing maniac with immortality-fetish?

Also I'd appreciate it if they had actual stories, instead of turning him nice just so the author can ship him with Harry (which is just weird).

*** Does the writing quality in "A Riddled Universe" improve after the first chapter? The plot seems like it could be interesting, but it's pretty tough to read so far.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

** The Broken Victory, linkffn(505654), accounts for him growing up and going through Hogwarts. Its ending isn't canon compliant with the horcruxes, IIRC, because it was written before the last two books. Also maybe check out Addendum: He Is Also A Liar, linkffn(11562871), but he's not a particularly good kid in there either.

The Right Hand Path, linkffn(3221511), has Merope surviving to take care of him. In Doubting Thomas, a oneshot, Luna goes back in time to raise him instead -- linkffn(5492188) . In If Them's The Rules, Harry does that. linkao3(284278) Same goes for Rewritten, linkao3(5924098).

A Safe Place to Hide is timetravel with Hermione, TMR/HG. linkffn(6451934). Also by Flaignhan is Tempora Abducto, linkffn(5500156). Both generally have a redeemable Tom Riddle that doesn't turn out as a crazed mass-murderer.

Maybe Lithium for diary!Riddle, though it is slash. He's not quite the protag, but he's a key character. linkao3(2296544) He's more sensible and reasonable in Twist of Fate, linkffn(5925524), but still a bit off.

Also, basically all Voldemort redemption fics have him become more grey, or at least not crazed mass-murdering dark, but...well, sympathetic depends on your point of view. Examples of this include most of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2328854/Athey][Athey's works.]]

  Harry gets bored of immortality and feels like he's losing his sanity. Death points him in the direction where he'll find the person who can keep him together. But when he finally finds his anchor, he didn't expect to feel incredibly possessive and protective where he all but constantly glomps poor little Tom (who fails to avoid growing fond of Harry).Updates every week.

  The smallest change in details can lead to vastly different outcomes. When Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary in his second year, he befriends the entity that resides within. This simple act results in a ripple effect that tears the story as we know it apart, causing a descent into the madness that is the human psyche.

  Tom Marvolo Riddle never loved...or so they say. What if he did love, but he couldn't understand it and so destroyed it? A choice between his ultimate desire of world domination and the one thing he's always been denied: love. The story spans between his school years until his rise in power. You already know the end, but do you know the beginning?

** I give you ‚ÄúLast Chance‚Äù (linkffn(4457149)).

It is an in-progress story that asks the question ‚Äúwhat would happen if Albus Dumbledore acted differently when he first met Tom Riddle‚Äù and tries to answer it in some way. I feel it to be quite an enjoyable story.

*** I just got done reading most of this fic. It's hilarious at points, but also very OOC / practically unrecognizeable from the actual Harry Potter books at others. There's also heavy Dumbledore and Weasley bashing involved, as well as Chessmaster!Harry and Harem!Harry. Also, there's not so much Riddle involved, as there is a weird amalgam of Riddle-Quirrell-Voldemort.
