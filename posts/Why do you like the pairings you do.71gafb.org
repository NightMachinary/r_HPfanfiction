Personally, I love the whole sexual tension trope. James and Lily/Draco and Hermione are my favorites. But what I don't understand is Harry and Lord Voldemort, etc. Why do you like who you like?


** My favorite non-canon pairing is Harry/Hermione/Ron. The Trio friendship and relationship is a fundamental theme in the Series, and I love seeing them getting together. Also, I'm not bothered by the unconventional M/F/M relationship. Given how many writers push M/Multis, why can't I support my favorite female character have both her beloved boys?

** Harry/Tonks because I think Harry needs a fun older girl like her. He's been through a lot of shit, which matured him in a lot of ways, and she can act immature at times. They kinda balance out. Plus, I always like "unethical" relationships and the reactions of people when they find out about it.

Harry and one of the Black sisters is fun to read too. The whole older woman thing is interesting to me. Though, I've never found a Bellatrix one that I've fully read.

I like Harry/Tracey Davis too, as long as they give her the bubbly personality she tends to have in fanfiction. Same thing as Tonks, Harry needs a fun bubbly person, and then there's the whole Slytherin thing. Idgaf about Daphne much (if she has the Ice Queen persona, that is) so Tracey works for me when I've got a Harry/Slytherin itch.

Harry/Astoria is almost the same as above, really. Close to Daphne, a Slytherin, and a fun personality.

*** Agreed with all points, but I fux with the daphne pairing too, simply because I like the syltherin dynamic. What I /dont/ like is when they portray harry as borderline illiterate simply due to him not being brought up with a pureblood family, and Daphne has to educate him. Tonks stories still #1 and no one writes that pairing anymore....

Yeah, I usually just quickly skim those parts in Harry/Daphne stories. I just don't care for those lessons where Daphne explains how important Harry is and all that. For once, I'd like to see her go, "You? Please, Potter, you're not shit in the Wizengamot."

In my story, my Daphne ends up not giving a shit about any politics at all, simply because I've gotten sick of seeing what I described above play out over and over.

Nah. I was thinking on having Iris date her for a bit, but decided against it. She'll still play a bigger role in the story later on, but I don't think I'll have her date Iris.

Edit: Okay, apparently I don't know how to spoiler tag something, so beware? [[/s][My outline has the possibility of her being in love with Tracey instead, but Tracey doesn't know and ends up dating Iris for a little bit in fifth year, then Iris figures out why Daphne isn't exactly friendly towards her and gets the two together.]] But all that isn't really set in stone. It'll be a subplot, so keeping it or completely tossing it out won't affect the main story, really.

** I have a few pairings that I'm willing to read. (This reasoning is all post Hogwarts) I have nothing against Ginny and I'm sure she went through a horrid year while Harry was on the run but it all felt to clean, especially the epilogue. By that I mean, in my opinion Harry should be a rather screwed up person after everything that happened. He dates Ginny for a couple of weeks and decides she's his happily ever after.

If we take the idea that Harry is a slightly broken individual who may struggle to move on from the war, we need people who will Help him recover or break out of his funk. Possible candidates include: a generic Hufflepuff, a kind caring selfless individual dedicated to getting Harry through his troubles. Personally I'm not a fan, why, because in real life I'm not a big fan of happy people, I tend to date clever women with sharp wit. With that in mind I've always found myself drawn to the idea of a Harry/Slytherin girl pairing. Now like or loathe her the little we actually know about Daphne Greengrass opens up potential plot. We know nothing about her and as such I can't go 'omg she's totes perfect for him' or any other cringe like comments. What I can say is it would allow you to explore the treatment of purebloods after the war, was there a backlash? How does Harry deal with Malfoy as a brother in law. Does Draco, known Death Eater meet Dudley, Harry's childhood bully at family gatherings? Ravenclaw might value wit nut we never see any. Cunning wordplay and wit are rather similar. A Slytherin girl might cut down Harry and any attacks on him as a person might help separate harry from the titles he's been given.

Moving on from more generic groups. Gabrielle Delacour. (remember post Hogwarts) in my opinion Harry would struggle to find a place for himself after the war. He'd struggle with the attention and the price paid. How better to get him to move on than a breath of fresh air. You don't need magical veela stuff, she wants to help Harry like he helped her in the lake. Every face in GBR reminds him of those that died. He can't look at people without knowing what Voldemort took from them, almost every family lost someone and Harry can't help but wonder if he could have finished Voldemort a bit quicker. Gabi is close enough to Harry's surviving friends that she has a way to meet him that isn't too contrived. She can fit the Hufflepuff mild or be something completely different, either way she's something not tainted by the war. Perhaps moving to France might even be what lets Harry escape the public.

Tonks. She lives Remus dies. He's the godfather of her kid. She's energy and happiness in a funk. Could they be the answer to each other's problems. Two people struggling to recover brought together by Teddy, the child's happiness a beckon of hope they share. A sign of better things to come.

Harry/Fleur, if this is post Hogwarts then she never met Bill since they seem happy together. Fleur is the pretty face, a talented witch who struggles to be recognised for her own talents. Harry is a boy famous for something he can't remember without the help of dementors. Have they finally found someone who understands that?

They should have the right everything but the way they were written just felt so forced. I didn't like that they had a fortnight together and then Harry was done. Heck I think he was dating Cho for longer, then we barely see her in the seventh book other than Harry watching her in the map. I'm not going to straight out say she wasn't developed as a character because that's simply not true but as a relationship they didn't get development.

**** Quite a lot of people got "violated" by Voldemort and/or his followers. And just because two people went through possessions does not mean that they are perfectly suited for a romantic relationship. Besides, they had quite different experiences regarding Voldemort's violations.

If you are simply going for "healing together" Luna makes the better candidate because she lacks Ginny's obsession for everything Harry and she seems to be a far more understanding character (and has also experienced the loss of a parent).

****** As new readers come into their own lots of 'new perspectives' out and we're not to the point where it's so old that all themes and anti themes come out and been analyzed.

It's very easy, depending on how you view the story, to not like Remus (even before he abandons Tonks).

Like. Yeah. It's fiction. And you're supposed to suspend your disbelief so when fantastical stuff happens you don't question it.

Thus a problem. JKR set this story in basically the real world. Harry Potter was born in Britain in 1980. A real country and a real year.

WWII happened at the same time Grendelwald began his campaign.

So we as the reader have an immediate frame of reference to draw from (regardless of how old you are), which means some of us can inject our human emotion and interaction into our frame.

Now. We have a frame and read on. There was a terrible guerrilla war and the protagonist has just won this war through some unexplained magic reaction.

That protagonist's parents have a group of friends that were close and tight knit. Ones a traitor. Ones in prison and possibly insane. The last is a werewolf who ran away. Abandoned his best friends kid.

Then shows up out of the blue in the third year. Right. And Harry just basically accepts it.

Harry's shown to have a temper, it manifests 'better' in later years but it's still there.

So why doesn't he hash it out with Remus then accept it? Why is Remus just allowed to waltz in and then out? This some can not like him.

People tend to value strength, doing what is right instead of what is easy, especially in role models and heroes and Remus has the potential to be both of those things, but he is defined by his disease instead of his actions and choices. He takes the easy way out, using his lycanthropy as a crutch his entire adult life. In a lot of ways I pity Remus, he had amazing friends in school (I acknowledge that they were not necessarily great people so spare me the lecture about bullying Snape. I maintain that a pre-teen werewolf would never find better friends in the magical world), but when their son/godson needed him, he failed spectacularly.

Harry/Young!Bellatrix -> This is my favorite guilty pleasure. It only works with time travel anyway, but I've got this image, of Bella witnessing a duel between Harry and Voldemort, and Voldemort fleeing the fight. Which shakes her whole world and so on. And you get a pairing with a passionate dark witch that slowly becomes devoted to Harry... it's a fun concept. The older version of Bella, not even once.

Harry/Tonks -> I like this, even though I've only enjoyed a couple of fics with the pairing, the rest are crap - mostly because I disliked how Tonks developed after OttP in canon. Still hold some hope I'll find a few more fics I'll like though.

Harry/Pansy -> Again a fun concept. And you can build a good story on how it happens, since it seems so unlikely on first glance.

** I used to be repulsed by the idea of HP/LV, but then got into it for the horror elements. It's not something I read for the romance. Sure, there are stories out there with Voldemort being the best guy who was ever misunderstood while Dumbledore is evil, but those fics are just bad bash-fests. And while I like lots of fluff and romance, sometimes I want something the opposite of that, and a HP/LV fic will show me some of the most messed up parts of the human psyche.

One of the tropes I like in the pairing is the soulmate trope because it shows just how badly a relationship can go even when the people involved are "meant for each other" and how we can throw away something good for us. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7911124/chapters/18074659][in death we seek devotion]] by flat_teeth, Harry and Tom are soulmates, but Tom keeps killing him and Harry keeps reincarnating, until Harry's final incarnation as a Potter, by which time Tom has become Voldemort. There's no romance, no graphic sex, just a lot of angst.

** I love Harry and Tom, but not Harry and Lord Voldemort. I still read HP/LV fics, but I don't like the pairing with the same intensity I ship Harry and Tom with. To clarify, most of the Tomarry fics that I love best are the AU fics. The ones where there's no magic, or there is magic but it's set in a completely different world from canon. Whether it's worlds where Lord Voldemort never existed, worlds where Tom became Minister of Magic instead of the leader of a terrorist organisation, or even worlds where Tom and Harry live in an adventure fantasy type environment. One of my favourite authors that does this type of Tomarry fics is Rendered Reversed. They're the perfect mix of fluffy romance and realism, with characters that still keep in line with believable interpretations of canon!Harry and Tom. If you want to read actually decent Tomarry fics, I definitely recommend Rendered Reversed. My favourite is probably The Game, which while sadly unfinished, stops at a conclusive enough point that I can delude myself into thinking that it's satisfying enough for me (Yes, I am trying to convert whoever is reading this).

Anyway, in most of my favourite Tomarry fics, Tom never kills Harry's parents. He's a sociopath, an ass, usually still a murderer, but he's nice to Harry and loving, even. Their relationship is definitely not the most healthy, but I think that's why I like the pairing so much. Because it's both fucked up and cute, if that even makes sense.

Now, excuse me while I go off and scour the internet for the few Tomarry fics that I have yet to read.

I don't like her being paired up with Draco or other Death Eaters since those stories often seem to ignore core parts of her character and/or whitewash bigots.

**** I don't think of her as a "prize", of course she's her own person capable of deciding who she wants to be with. But I think she would have been at least a little bit likely to choose Snape and love him over James if he hadn't been a death eater wannabe.

I agree that the mudblood comment was most likely the straw that broke the camel's back on their friendship. He was probably sliding toward death eater-ville long before that.

***** It's entirely possible that Lily saw Snape move towards the dark side but held hope she could temper her friend without realizing how deep he was going because of how bombastic James and Sirius were. So once the mudblood comment happens AND James matures she fully realized what Snape was becoming and where he was heading. Which means redemption for Snape was a giant chasm.

Sure it could be crossed but realistically?

** I like Harry/Tonks and Harry/Fleur. It feels like he should have a crush on both of them, Tonks especially. Two flirty, attractive, older women, it basically writes itself. I also like Harry/Katie as a relationship. She seems to have a fair bit in common with Ginny without the "fangirl" phase (at least we don't see it). We know they are friends from the quidditch team, it seems like the right way to go for a first relationship as opposed to Cho, where they share little but bad memories or Ginny, as I'm opposed to rewarding fangirling or attempts to manipulate somebody by making them jealous.

**** She dated other guys so she could move on from her crush on Harry and enjoy some normal teenage relationships. Those relationships affirm that she's desirable and allow her to regain her confidence and show her true personality around Harry, instead of the debilitating crush. This is what he finds attractive, so when they do get together, it's Harry who becomes interested and initiates things. And you're calling her a slut for having what, two likely non-sexual relationships in two years from ages 14-15?

** I like Harry and Hermione or Tonks, because Ginny is such a non-entity. Harry and another male character is OK, as long as there is no enmity between them in canon, so no Voldemort, no Draco, no Snape. Leather pants doesn't fix any problems except in the mind of the author.

The worst pairing of all is Hermione/Ron. They /do not/ fit well together. They quarrel all the time, and Ron constantly belittles her by calling her "mental" whenever she shows a work ethic or functioning brain. The "quarrel like an old married couple" is not a healthy basis for a relationship, because then /siblings/ would be perfect matches.

*** Ron and Hermione's arguments were way overblown. After the Yule Ball or Year 4, when they moved beyond their children phase, please name instances in which Ron belittled Hermione's intellect and work ethic. They often seemed to enjoy their verbal jujitsus in Year 5, and it was Harry who couldn't stand that and often blew up at them COLLECTIVELY.

Book Hermione was hardly perfect and she knew that. She didn't have Emma Watson's look, her argumentativeness and bossiness didn't sit well with Harry, and her great intellect might turn off many guys. Ron was one of the very few who actually put up with her shortcomings and even enjoyed them.

I suspect that people most against canon pairings generally focused on scenes in the first 4 Books where Ron often had juvenile fights with Hermione and Ginny was an non-entity fan girl. OoTP and HBP are IMO the Books that really defined their future relationships.

** HP/TMR, HG/TMR, and HP/LV. It's probably because Tom's my favourite character, and I like seeing their interactions. I mostly prefer ships with Tom over ships with LV.

I tend to like things that are darker/horror/have a more serious setting, so that helps. And there's quite a few funny crack/humour fics, which is nice.

I've also noticed a nice lack of stories with particularly boring romance and overdone harems.

**** I think he's an interesting character, and that doesn't necessarily mean that he's a morally good character -- which is good, because he isn't, not really.

I should probably note that I think that explaining Riddle as lacking any and all feelings due to his mother's use of Amortentia is a cop-out -- I mean, painting a character as point-blank evil is fine for children's novels, but becomes quite the bore in fanfic. Besides, you see plenty of awful fic with Molly going around potioning Arthur all the time, but the Weasleys are never emotionless killing-machines because of it.

So if Riddle's not just a pure-evil-born-murdering spawn of the devil that kills illogically and for no reason (e.g. canon Voldemort), and actually has the power to think, it's interesting to read about motives (if he wants power, to what end?), thought processes, feelings, etc. If he's inclined towards evil -- maybe he follows it, maybe he's redeemed, maybe he takes another route, but the process is interesting either way.

Hopefully that explanation's good enough?

** I like the pairings that I do because they were written by a competent writer and are written at the very least decently with any romance being believable and appearing organic (i.e. not forced).

To elaborate, I'm not really a fan of any single pairing, though I do refuse to read certain pairings at all because I simply lack the ability to believe that they could be anything but railroaded crap and railroaded pairings with forced and unrealistic development are not something I care about at all, which means that when I read something that features a pairing that it focuses on it's either despite the pairing, regardless of it, or because someone recommended it as a realistic and believable romance story and I believed them.

Of course, some leeway is to be expected if the story is primarily a comedy, but then again in those cases the romance is more of a background thing for the laugh so ... yeah.

** I'm a big SSHG fan but I have some pretty strict criteria.

I like seeing an older Hermione - one who's experienced quite a bit of the wizarding world and is more realistic or even cynical (or widowed even). And the romance can't be easy because that just doesn't seem very realistic to me. I like seeing them working through their preconceptions and biases.

And no underage. I have a big, big problem with that and absolutely no interest in them. It also completely kills any willing suspension of disbelief for me.

Yes, these usually end up pretty angsty and , done poorly, are examples of the worst fan fiction out there. But done well, they can be the best.
