It bugs me really badly, that no one even attempted this.It's like right there staring you in the face and no one can see it. So how or why didn't someone at least attempt a half-assed story on this?


** You mean Naraku as in the antagonist in Inuyasha?

The guy who's name literally means "Hell"?

I'm not in any way knowledgable about the story and characters of Inuyasha, but why would the connection Harry - Naraku be so "in the face" as you describe it?

*** It's not the current connection between the two, but the chance to connect the two.

As far as I could tell in the countless of fanfics Harry is severely by his family,and in some of them leads him to becoming a dark lord. In Inuyasha, Onigumo is beaten and/or burned leading him to eventually selling his body to demons and then becoming Naraku the Spider demon lord.

I've read fics where a dark harry done the same rituals voldemort had done and scientific Harry had done a modified horcux ritual.

So why can't a truly dark harry or Darkish grey Harry do the same but with a spider-ish angle in mind leading him to eventually becoming Naraku.

I mean I read one where the the only connection between harry and another character from another series were eye color or hair style, so why not this?

**** Because to most people it probably sounds like “eh, well, stuff happens so stuff, and well, there's a connection because stuff and some fanon rubbish which is also stuff, how can you not see it that stuff and thus a connection because stuff?”.

In other words: when you say that it's “right there staring you in the face”, most people see you speaking gibberish in an attempt to present a probably inane idea. Whether or not they are right there is irrelevant, what matters is that this is how they see.
