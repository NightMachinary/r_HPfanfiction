I am looking for a fanfic where Harry "runs away" in the summer to travel camping in a tent. He ends up going to Norway or Scandinavia and getting a teenage nature guide pregnant. Harry doesn't find out until after he returns to Hogwarts but he offers to take care of her and the baby and to teach her magic.

Would like to read some other stories about Harry traveling as well. No slash for the main characters please.


** Well, the best known Traveling Harry story is probably Rorshach's Blot's "Make A Wish."

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
