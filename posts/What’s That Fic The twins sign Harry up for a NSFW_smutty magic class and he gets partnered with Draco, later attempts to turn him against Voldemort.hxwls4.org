** Sex Magic by VelvetBlood. Linking not allowed because of the underage, but it's on Skyehawke.

ETA: also on aff, where the author stated outright she was abandoning it, but that it was being continued by leo_draconis on livejournal. leo_draconis posted two chapters before abandoning it again (officially on hiatus but it's been 9 years so I think we can call it dead).
