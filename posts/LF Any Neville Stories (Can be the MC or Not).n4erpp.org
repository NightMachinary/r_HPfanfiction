He can be the MC or not, but I want him used more in the story. I'd rather him not be suddenly OP just because he has a new magic wand, that's cliche and over the top. I want him to get more confident because of his accomplishments and the like.

Different dynamics between characters, maybe interactions between unexpected characters, or whatever

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes/etc


** Look up author name Bobika on ffnet. There's a great fic there with Neville as POV but the story is very much about Harry. It's a dystopian adventure fic, frequently appears on reco lists and is the highest rated story on DLP.

Name is something like beyond the curtain I think.

Great fic

  AU. OC: Graces Malfoy, Draco's twin sister. Neville, with his usual bad luck, ends up partners with Graces Malfoy for Herbology, just after landing her father in Azkaban, after the Ministry ordeal. Will this partnership prove to be as awful as it sounds? 6th year. Rated M for sexual content. Now on Ao3 As well.

** Try Harry Black by AuthorK on ffnet. AU rehash if Harry was raised by Sirius and didn't go to Hogwarts until later. Neville makes friends with Harry and becomes more confident organically. Overall it is full of great character interactions and Nice because it avoids the early childhood years that most authors muck up by turning 11 year olds into adults.
