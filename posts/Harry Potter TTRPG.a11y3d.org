Howdy everyone! Seeing as how everyone here likes to make their own stories I wanted to see if there's any interest in something like a DnD game using the world. It'd be set in the Wizarding War, the PCs would be recently graduated students of Hogwarts from the same class as James and his gang. If you're interested in an adventure during what Hagrid calls “Dark Times” then contact me. The game would be once a month, set up in Discord on a day that everyone can game for 6-7 hours. Thanks for any responses!


** I'd probably be down. If nothing else, I make a lot of homebrew content for d&d 5e, so I could help fine-tune and playtest if you need it.

** I don't think I'd have time for it on top of other campaigns, but the idea of an HP ttrpg is actually pretty interesting to consider. Are you adapting an existing RPG or are you homebrewing the system entirely?

*** I'm using a hack of RISUS, this simple d6 system that lets the players be in control of their character progression. It's usually pretty loose but I have a set of rules for it to be more concrete. For instance you will have a stat for your Hogwarts House and you'll get to choose a Hogwarts class for another stat.

*** It's alright, the system I'm going to use is very simple.
