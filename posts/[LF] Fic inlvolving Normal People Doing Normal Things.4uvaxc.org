** Still Life by The Treacle Tart

Snape/Lupin Snape confiscates Collin's camera and finds that he enjoys photography.

[[http://www.ssf-moonshadow.com/archive/archive/1/stilllife.html]]

" One picture gave the Weasley girl red eyes, brighter than her ridiculous hair. Could the camera detect the remnants of demonic possession? he thought, aghast. Another photograph showed the Granger girl, her head cut off at the mouth. Could it read his mind and inner most fantasies? he considered, intrigued. Yet a third showed that brat Malfoy with his face twisted into the most unappealing grimace Snape had ever seen. Could this camera show a person's true nature? What sort of Dark Magic was this? he marveled, excited."

** These are more commonly known as "Slice of Life" fics.

A great collection of fics that revolve around such things (among some extraordinary situations as well) are linkffn(Northumbrian)'s universe.

Specifically, you should (if you haven't already) read the novel length linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh).

  Because one never knows when someone might poison the prince's meals... or maybe Arthur has an ulterior motive for having Merlin eat half his breakfast.
