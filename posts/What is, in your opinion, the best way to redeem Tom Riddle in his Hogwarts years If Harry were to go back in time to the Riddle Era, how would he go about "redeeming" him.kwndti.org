** Research done on children who survived Romanian orphanages (which were probably about as bad as British orphanages at the time) shows that the damage done from birth to age two is pretty much irreversible. If a kid isn't loved in that window, they'll never be able to have normal relationships afterwards. They don't all turn into mass murderers of course, but they're not mentally healthy. If you really want to redeem him, you'll have to start much earlier than Hogwarts.

Wow. So, a previous employer of mine went to uni in Bucharest during this time period. His parents were both doctors, and he had bribed his way into a private room in student housing by giving the house mothers birth control pills from his home country for them to distribute. Kind if puts a spin on why the pill was so damn valuable - I had thought it was just lack off access since the country was communist. Nope, apparently they were actually illegal <.<

[He had a crapload of stories to tell between living in St Petersburg until his parents lied through their teeth and got them out, the uni thing, travelling to switzerland to buy his first car (because it was cheaper), and so many more. Absolute treasure trove - I may have hated the career, but the people were amazing.]

***** Nope, the Irish one was horrible, but it was just an abuse. In Romania under Ceaușescu there was systematic effort to get as many children as possible (to have them as Kanonenfutter) without regards how well they were raised up (because it didn't matter that much). Thus illegal abortion AND contraception with rather harsh penalties for both. I don't know if the abuse in orphanages was intentional (possibly not) or the regime was just not capable of doing anything well (which it wasn't), but the situation there was by far worse and systematically worse than anything you encounter in the normal countries (not excusing horrible crimes in Ireland etc.).

** As far as we know, Tom Riddle was a psychopath. Psychopathy is not a disease or a condition but a personality disorder so it cannot be cured. Riddle cannot be redeemed without making him non-psychopathic, at least if redeeming means making him a good guy. However, most psychopaths are not serial killers. I think the best way to change the course of young Riddle would be to give him some other challenging ambition than the path of a Dark Lord. Working in the Department of Mysteries is one career that I'm sure Riddle would have found appealing.

** My initial thought like the others is just to kill him. However, you specifically asked to redeem him in his Hogwarts years. Though going back further would be better.

First, would be to get him away from the orphanage as there were very few in that time frame that were any good. Again, earlier would be better. The implication in canon was he was emotionally and/or physically abused and that led to his hatred of muggles and his desire to have power over others (you can't be harmed if you hold the power).

Put him with a loving family (as a halfblood that would take many of the dark aligned families out of the running). As he never experienced that type of family dynamic.

Make sure that he understands that his mother didn't want to leave him but she was too sick. That may give him the drive to becoming a healer as he wouldn't want another kid to suffer what he did.

At Hogwarts the staff would have to crack down on all the bigotry and bullying. Any offenders have to be immediately and severely punished when caught. If that doesn't happen then Tom might once again decide that the only way to make sure he isn't harmed is if he is the "top of the food chain".

Put his desire to learn/be the best to constructive directions eg towards healing to helping people versus dark magic to harm people who may hurt him. Again getting rid of the canon Hogwarts environment where bullying seems to be tolerated could only help to keep Tom from wanting to find ways to keep people from harming him.

Now all of the above presupposes that the emotional and/or physical abuse Tom suffered at the orphanage hadn't yet risen to the level where his personality demanded revenge. If that high level of abuse had already occurred then you either have to go further back in time or just get back to the idea of killing him.

Edit: it also presupposes that Harry can get Dumbledore on his side in order to do most of the above. If not the only possible chance to redeem him instead of killing him is to befriend him, protect him, and find other outlets for his magic.

** Depends a lot from when you are starting his redemption. Assuming it is from the very beginning than /if/ he can be redeemed than I guess the first step should be giving him a warmer reception to the magical world (while I don't think it is fair to put all the blame on him Dumbledore really screwed up that first meeting and from the way he told about his later interactions with Riddle he proceeded to turn his screw up into FUBAR nightmare) talking about inherited magical trails like parseltogue and metamorphy as somewhat uncommon but overall not /that/ rare would be a good start, as would /not/ letting a /freaking eleven years old/ run around /alone/ in a magical district he had never known existed previously and which so happened to cross with a side-street infamous for dealing with illegal goodies.

Furthermore, giving him some place to stay during the summers which isn't /bombed every single fucking day/ would probably also do wonders for his fear of death and resentment of muggles. Other than that /not/ try curbing his interests, but instead direct them towards less destructive means, like highlighting all the cons of making Horcruxes while trying to make a philosopher stone and using his pride to get him to help, saying how difficult it is and that only the most powerful wizard on living memory (which may or may not be an exaggeration) ever managed it; or even directing him to lobbying to get political reforms passed through by pointing out how the loss of life would have negative repercussions on the population later on, how unsatisfying would it be to have to depend on a government to do things properly while being blamed for everything that goes wrong and appealing to flattery by remarking how good he would be at it with his natural charisma, intelligence and fast-thinking.

The most important to this approach would probably maintaining a constant support network for Tom without infringing on his privacy or being overbearing, Tom is exactly the kind of person who would resent heavily over being smothered or pushed around.

I'd go back in time and delete any and all records of his parentage, so he loses that drive. It won't redeem him but it might make him a little bit more killable once he does commit crimes and need to be stopped.

I'd claim that I was the heir of Slytherin and make a big show about finding the chamber of secrets and slaying the basilisk and remove that weapon from him before he discovers it.

I'd out the room of requirement to the entire school, I'd make sure I beat him on every single test, I would single handedly destroy any reinforcement he ever got that he was superior to anyone.

Hell I would even get the job at Borgin and Burke's first , then take the DADA job the year he wants it.

*** While an interesting method I would think that it would drive Tom to go looking for magic you don't know so he can beat you. Which will drive him to study dark magic and look for dark rituals to increase his strength. Which are all things that time travel Harry doesn'tknow about. I think his burning desire to beat/kill you would morph to the desire to show everyone that he is much better than you.

And at this timeframe Tom is a much better student than Harry is and while Harry will initially know more magic than Tom due to the time travel it won't be that much more because Harry was an average student.

So I'm not that sure your method would work.

It does sound like it would be a fun read.

** Firstly, I assume by "redeem" you mean "fix" rather than "make unleashing the Basilisk and killing his paternal relatives okay".

Frankly, it's probably too late by the time he's got to Hogwarts since he's already done all the stuff at the orphanage. I feel like most fics tend to gloss over this.

For example, was reading a fic recently called Bad Education (which I actually really like) where in one scene (mid-twenties) Tom is trying to figure out why he's given a gift (actually two). As far as I'm concerned, a canon personality wouldn't care... the motives for giving the gift, who it came from and so forth? None of that would matter. The scene would be like you or I becoming obsessed about why a fly chose to land on our left instead of our right legs. However, it doesn't feel wholly out of character to characterise Tom like this (see, also, Seventh Horcrux, where I think Harrymort isn't wholly dissimilar to this).

So... that's one approach. Engender circumstances where Tom has to deal with ordinary social situations that are wholly new for him. The question, then, is how? Well, if we're using that kind of characterisation of Tom, it's probably as simple as Harry's running some kind of Slug Club. However, unlike Slughorn's Slug Club, this one isn't about networking but is, instead, about authentic socialisation. To this end, of course, Harry must become a member of staff. I suggest that the only possibilities are the flight instructor and DADA.

(There's an additional complication insofar as Tom must be compelled to participate, mustn't feel like he's being singled out for being weird and probably shouldn't be reminded that he's muggleborn. Being too precious about that last point would be a definite problem but it can't be put front and centre: Tom wants to be special.)

If we use the other characterisation (i.e. the one where Tom sees people as no more worthy of thought than flies... perhaps even less worthy of consideration)? That's harder. But, again, I think the strategy needs to be to infiltrate Tom's preconceptions about the world: get inside his narrative. So... how to do that?

My immediate thought is for Harry (if it's not clear, I continue to assume it's an adult Harry who travels through time) to pretend to be Tom's father, who's spent years looking for his son. The complication here, of course, is that Harry's not good at occlumency and Voldemort naturally knows when people are lying. The advantage is that Tom is obsessed with his father as an eleven year old. This is another problem since Harry wouldn't be on record at Hogwarts and Tom would definitely still try to find him.

It may, therefore, be easier to pretend to be Tom's uncle, Morfin. The chances of the actual Morfin ever actually becoming involved are slim but if that's a problem, pretending to be a fake uncle? Ah, that might have its merits. Especially if, as I personally prefer, Harry still speaks parseltongue... Morfin himself would vouch for it, I think. If not, it may be necessary to break a few laws at this point.

You see, the plan needs to be more subtle than simply pretending to be Tom's uncle: Harry needs to ingratiate himself with the Riddles. To this end, Harry should usurp Morfin's inheritance by being the older brother and, thus, the rightful heir to the property. The Gaunt's house must be immediately replaced with something that implies a social equality between Harry and the country squires in the big house. This still leaves the complication of all the rumours swirling about Merope but that why Harry ingratiates himself. It's a deep cover operation that's set up years in advance. He learns the rumours and "dares hope", but he's got no way of finding Tom unless he attends Hogwarts...

In principle, therefore, Harry should be ready to introduce his "nephew" to the Riddles for the summer of Tom's second year.

Of course, the whole thing would be much easier if Tom's father is also dead and never returns to his parent's home, since that allows Harry to have a much easier to control narrative. He can present himself as the successful but estranged older brother that introduced Tom's father to Merope and try to legitimise the whole sorry affair. I guess much of the same effect is possible with memory modification, but that would require bringing Hermione along or, perhaps, getting Dumbledore on side since I rather think this is out of Harry's capabilities.

Similarly, Morfin needs to go once he's fulfilled his purpose of authenticating Harry's fake identity. The Slytherin connection must be avoided at all costs. The whole speaking to snakes thing must be presented as an independently acquired gift.

In any case, armed with a successful relative in his fake uncle, I do think the eleven/twelve year old Tom can be reconciled to the idea that pure blood supremacism is the wrong idea. The advantage, of course, is that I don't think Tom would've become a Believer in a single year. However, we must still contend with Tom's deeply rooted psychological problems which I fear are intractable. To this end, Harry must try to channel Tom into frivolous obsessions and establish an alternative value system. Luckily, Harry knows Uncle Vernon very well.

Look, turning Voldemort into a kind of Vernon... whose values are definitely driven first by wealth and secondly by presentation... isn't exactly a good thing. But Vernonmort is definitely preferable to Voldemort.

** I don't think it's really possible to make Tom Riddle a good person - once he's at Hogwarts, he'll already have had 11 years of what amounts to a positive feedback loop of psychopathy/sociopathy.

The best hope Harry would have is to point Tom at something enticing that doesn't involve mass murder and/or taking over Britain, and hoping he doesn't get bored.

As an example, one could in theory give him a less-lethal method for his immortality than Horcruxes by claiming that he could /totally/ make a Philosopher's Stone - that might just keep him busy enough to not look into Horcruxes or the Chamber of Secrets.

Also get him out of that orphanage ASAP, and into a home that at least /tries/ to fix what's been done. He probably still won't care whether other people die, but he also won't care enough to go murder people who wronged him.

To be honest, if we're time travelling anyway, Harry's best bet is to add a few years. The moment Tom Marvolo Riddle is born would be ideal - the first two years are the most formative, so by taking care of Tom from-birth the issues might never develop.

**** *WARNING*: This turned into a wall of text. Please bear with me, but I'll put a TL;DR at the end. :)

To begin with, Tom's sociopathic tendencies were way more severe than you describe --- by the time he was 10, he's been described to brutally and gruesomely murder an animal (a rabbit, I think) as well as routinely abuse and torture other children (in the cave where he'd hide the locket later on). He also enjoys stealing or racketeering things from others, to the point where he has an entire box of such possessions, and keeps both children and adults of his orphanage in fear.

So not only is he an active sociopath, but he also has established an active positive feedback loop with his sociopathic tendencies. That's bad, since therapy has a much higher chance of success if the patient is willing --- and now Tom won't be.

Then there is a matter of a therapist. And you actually are in luck --- despite there being only a handful of people at this time who will have at least some idea of what they are doing, one of them is right there. David Henderson would either be reading his /Psychopathic states/ lectures in New York, or doing research in Glasgow Royal Hospital --- where he might be drafted. He might even bring Donald Cameron with him, which is nice, since Tom Riddle could definitely use some electroshock to his system... maybe no, then. Scratch Cameron out.

#+begin_quote
  /offtopic

  To actually increase the chance of success I'd consider adding Herbert Sullivan to the team --- his work with autistic kids has been pioneering for the time, while David is mostly familiar with adults. Maybe George Partridge can be convinced to come out of retirement too, but by this time he'd be out of the game for decades.

  Also, I'd totally read this book. Three brightest psychiatrists of the age versus the hardest case of a century. Also, Sullivan's out-there Neo-Freudian views clashing with Henderson's more conventional analysis would be hilarious. I wish I actually knew enough to write a story like this.

  offtopic/
#+end_quote

You might have noticed something, though. Yes, indeed --- David is a muggle. Which means that Tom would be given a position of power over him just by being in the same room. And we have established what happens when Tom is given power --- he'd be more likely to turn this therapy session into a terror\torture session or mind control tryouts. You'd need an experienced wizard guard present at all times to prevent it, which adds a wild variable into the process of therapy and makes establishing trust very difficult.

And then there is a matter of motivation. Or, as we have established, the lack of one. Tom has precisely zero reasons to keep his sociopathic tendencies in check --- they have been his only road to success thus far. Even if you make therapy mandatory or a pre-requisite to something he wants, he would still rather fake results than actually work through his issues. And, as we all know, Tom Riddle is very good at reading people and faking results.

*TL;DR/Conclusion:* To sum it all up, the chance of success with therapy in this case is extremely slim. It is simply too late for it, and Tom's unique nature brings too many complications. You'd be gambling the fate of several generations on a minuscule chance.

It would make for one hell of a story, and I'd be all over it. But if such an event happened in real life --- /Bombarda/ is a better choice.

***** This is a time travel prompt, you are being too much of a genius here. IF Harry was trying to go back in time with the specific intent of helping Tom, he would do the research necessary. It's time travel so he has plenty of time to prepare. So he goes back to the best time possible before Tom started the cycle, maybe even as early as showing up and adopting him as a newborn. Now Harry has full control and works /specifically/ towards avoiding him turning into a mass murderer or Dark Lord. At the very least Harry would have removed what originally provided the positive feedback loop. The power over the other orphans who didn't get along with him. We have to assume he lashed out for a reason before discovering he could /hurt/ them. Probably something minor like Tom wanted a kid's dessert and caused him to (insert painful accidental magic here).

  I think we all know that JKR read a psychology textbook to make him a psychopath because Tom's childhood memories are like reading a textbook. If there was a thing a psychopathic child would do, Tom did it. I think if I remember my serial killers correctly, particular indicative behaviors would form. Ones that would eventually reflect in the killings Tom would commit, or at least that's what profiling says.

****** Well, if we are going back to the newborn Tom Riddle --- absolutely. I'd say that anything before three years old is a breeze. In fact, that early on you might even prevent the entire sociopathic disorder from coming online at all --- most of the research concludes that it is a developmental disorder, not physical.

However, the prompt specifically calls for the Hogwarts-aged Tom Riddle. Which, as I explained, is significantly trickier --- because his sociopathy already had time to set in. It is definitely possible with time travel, and success is eventually guaranteed if you are allowed to use it multiple times. But if you only have one run, it would be pretty hard to prepare enough --- especially if Harry is the one taking the role of a therapist.

Hogwarts - I would say your probably better off just trying to convince him not to be a Dark Lord, try and motivate him to pursue something less /destructive/. Hell, even if he became a regular serial killer I'd say you probably saved a ridiculous number of lives.

Honestly, though Hogwarts' time frame basically necessitates murder I would recommend at least some amount of therapy sessions if only to further the psychological study of the mind of genocidal maniacs.
