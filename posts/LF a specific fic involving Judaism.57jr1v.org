I read this fic a while ago, I think it was on ao3. There was a fat Jewish kid who was in the DA and he along with I think Cho and the Patils provided the impetus for the DA to learn non-Western magic. Harry went home with him for the holidays I think to celebrate Passover, and hermione dates him briefly but he ends up I think dying either in the battle or because of a terminal disease. I think his name might've been david?

It was actually v. good, I'm just crap at summarizing. So if you see a fic like this, could you please let me know? I always like seeing 'non-Western' magic as it were.

E: if you wanna post any other fics involving non-Western magic or more specifically Jewish magic here, that'd be cool too.


** Neither of these are your fic, but linkao3(he will have power the dark lord knows not by dirgewithoutmusic) and linkffn(Goldstein by laazov) are Jewish non-magical fics.

  What's a nice Jewish boy like Anthony doing at Hogwarts? Well, for starters, his name isn't really Anthony. Winner of the Fanfiction Booker's Prize 2014.

  It was Mrs. Figg who suspected first. She noticed many things, sitting on her side of her fence with her cats chasing butterflies and nuzzling her ankles, Mundungus and the other watchers dropping by for tea now and then. Mrs. Figg noticed that Petunia was a nosy bit of work with insecurities hanging from her every harsh angle. She noticed when Dudley learned the word MINE-- the whole neighborhood noticed that one. She noticed that Vernon glared at owls.She noticed that when Petunia gave Harry a truly horrendous haircut one year, it grew back in at a normal rate. Harry was uneven and weird-looking for ages, hiding under beanies when he could. When Mrs. Figg had Harry over for carefully miserable afternoons of babysitting, she noticed nothing moved that shouldn't. He didn't accidentally make flowers out of fallen leaves, or levitate anything during tantrums, or turn toys funny colors. Mrs. Figg called up her mother, interrupting the wizarding bridge game she was winning against the nursing home staff, and asked her how she had known, decades back, that her youngest daughter was a squib.

*** That is a rather interesting question though, isn't it? And I suppose I'm just always interested in what other people and other cultures would do with magic. It's always nice to have more than one perspective, even in passing, Ã  la linkffn(4594634) or linkffn(11439594).

  "Tragedy was too fresh for Anthony Goldstein to find any solace in God, who had refused to hear his prayers. Instead, he found comfort in stones on a grave, a freshly-written epitaph, and Morag MacDougal's hand on his shoulder." In which Anthony and Morag deal with their respective losses. Anthony&Morag FRIENDSHIP. Oneshot for Deb.
