Looking into stuff now. Trying to find something full completion. Most interested in time travel or interesting AUs.


** A lot of [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]] 's stories fit the bill.

**** Oh yeah, I recommend Fate here a lot. It's not even close to completion so I did not rec it in this post.

If you enjoy Fate's characterization where pretty much everyone has problems and everyone can be shit then I will warn you that Starfox5's stories are very pro-Hermione. Though the stories themselves often are so unique that it isn't something that can't be looked past. Ron is also generally Good!Ron which is a plus though the pairings are generally Harry/Hermione.

My favorite Starfox5 fic is linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died)

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/][*/Harry Potter and the Lady Thief/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][/Starfox5/]]

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

***** I like the word length going on a million words. Anything else that long? I particularly like drawn out stories because of the really interesting takes on character development.
