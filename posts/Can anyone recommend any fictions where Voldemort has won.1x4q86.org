Preferably centered on HP/SS (can be slash or non-slash). HP/LV okay aswell.

Thank you!


** One I'm currently reading and really enjoying is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]]. In progress, no pairing (at least as far as I've made it), but HP and LV have a very intense, if not romantic or sexual, relationship, and Snape and Harry see quite a lot of each other. Voldemort has won in the UK in this fic, but as Harry is growing up LV is setting his sights on the rest of Europe, so there's more conflict to come. Not sure if this is what you're after or not, but I hope you enjoy it.

*** Really enjoyable and very unique fic. It's very action and adventure based, little to no romance.

*** Okay I just finished reading it and wow, amazing. I LOVE the characters although i think voldemort turned "nice" abit to fast. Severus is portrayed in a interesting way in this fanfic and you cant stop yourself from becoming attached to him. Great fic, if anyone has knows of any fics that are like this one please let me know!

** Thanks for the reply's and recommendations everyone. I will have a look at Prince of the Dark Kingdom and And the wolves all cry, I really dislike Ginny as a character so I'll pass on the ginny/draco fan fic, thanks for taking the time to recommend it though :)

** If Draco/Ginny shipping is your thing, the Fire and Ice Archive has the classic Hesperide's Apple. I highly recommend it not just because I love the pairing but also because it is soooooo well written.

** Cruel and Beautiful World was a pretty decent read. It is based off of Volemort winning the final battle of Hogwarts...though Harry survives and is in hiding. It is a Dramione so its more heavily focused on that and sex. Lots of sex.
