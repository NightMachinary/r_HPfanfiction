** I really am losing my ability to cope with authors who refuse to use the character's names. Example being instead of saying:

"Hello, how was your morning?" Harry asked.

They will say:

"Hello, how was your morning?" the messy haired, green orbed, Gryffindor Quidditch seeker-boy asked.

Some authors are so damned bad about this that I lose track of who's talking. Like, what do I do if two green-eyed people are in the same conversation? Or if Harry is talking to Neville, who is "The Gryffindor boy" supposed to be? Just freaking say "Harry said." at the end of the sentence!

Red Riding Hood has Grandma and the Huntsman (and I think we all realize Red Riding Hood isn't actually her name). Rapunzel has the Witch. Snow White has the Queen - I'm pretty sure she didn't have a name in the original tale. The Little Match Girl. The Tin Soldier. Princess and the Pea - I don't think even the princess had a name in that one. The Little Mermaid didn't have a name until the Disney movie. I don't think Beauty from Beauty and the Beast did either.

***** Never say never, but:

There are /very/ few times when not using the name helps the story - and the main exception is whent the trait you're using to describe the speaker is directly relevant to the story at that moment. For example, if Harry is talking to Snape, you might want to say 'said the green-eyed boy' when Harry drops a bombshell that would immediately remind Snape that Harry is Lily's son too. (And then you can let the reader imagine the effect this reminder has on Snape, if you're any good.)

But more normally, if you just want to make sure not every line ends with said Harry / said Snape / said Harry ad nauseum, you're much better off just moving the said tag around - sometimes in the beginning, sometimes the end, sometimes the middle.

Pro level: if you're characters have distinct voices, you might not even need said tags at all.

*** I tentatively agree with you here. I saw the author's notes, but aside from an internal "hmmmm..." to myself didn't think much of them. I've seen authors who are overly sensitive to any sort of criticism, but I've also seen reviewers who basically want to be backseat drivers for the story and tell the author what to write and how to write it and complain bitterly if the plot doesn't go the way they want. I didn't read the reviews in question, but I guess it depends on exactly what kind of feedback the author was getting.

/Edit/ Went and read through a few pages of reviews on a lark. Aside from one or two reviewers who were genuinely being dicks and probably should have been responded to via private message or not at all, the author's reaction does seem to be an overreaction.

** Authors who abandon their story, but they don't put it up on the summary and then mark it up as completed. I hate reading non-completed fics where the author doesn't give a regular updating schedule because the sheer wasted potential if it does not update is heartbreaking. I would rather read a shorty story with a real ending then be left dangling, especially if it is left at a major cliffhanger. So if a story's last chapter is basically an "I'm sorry" notes..., well now I basically have to spoil myself everytime I stumble upon a completed story, just to be extra clear.

Long author notes at the start is another irritating quirk. I don't mind author responding to reviews asking as its at the bottom. But in general, I don't really mind what the author says, as along as there's a story, cause I can scroll through the boring parts. Yet, I do expect some story when there's an update. It burns when in the middle of the story an author note only is thrown in and the flow is interrupted, not to mention I do believe it's against the rules. And they don't clear it up when it's purpose is gone.

I've only run across that a few times, but it is so infuriating. It's fine that it won't be completed because things happen and times change. But if you're going into it expecting it to be completed, it's a nasty surprise.

I'd love it if authors would write a little blurb about how the story would have ended. It'd be a good bit of closure, even if it was just a few sentences.

** They're, their, there. Affect, Effect. And other various homophones getting mixed up. Once or twice you won't usually notice, but when it's done once every chapter you start noticing it.

Also, about author notes, they can be annoying. However, there's one fanfiction I read, where I really loved the author notes. The author notes were mostly commentaries on the characters, or the plot, and I found them very interesting to read.linkffn(9845650) (an avatar the last airbender fanfiction)

**** Absolutely, cause if that were the case then James and Lily would have died at 23 instead of 21, not be in the same class as Sirius, Remus, Peter and Severus. Severus would probably not know Lily as well, so he has doesn't become friends with her, which means he would not be drawn to the death eaters, resulting in the prophesy not being known by Voldemort, so he doesn't attack the Potters and continues to live until Harry goes to school.

***** But you wouldn't have to change Lily and James' ages, you can just say they had him younger, although that would have it's own fallout beacuse Harry would be born before the prophecy is even made, thus eliminating him from even being a potential target, so L/J would probably live unless still otherwise killed in the war, which is possible. Harry would be orphaned but not as anyone special, and Voldemort would go after the Longbottoms as part of the prophecy and Neville would be the BWL.

Also I object to the Snape thing. Snape didn't become a Death Eater because he was friends with Lily. If anything, not having Lily as a friend would make him /more/ of a Death Eater because he wouldn't have any of that "my friend is Muggleborn" guilt and he could get behind the pureblood doctrine 100% (except for the whole being a half-blood issue). Fallout from that would be extra dark--he learns the prophecy but makes no plea to save Lily, so Voldemort never gives her the chance to step aside, and as I understand that fact was crucial to how Harry survived so he dies and Voldemort rules the world.

****** Hang on- if Harry is born sooner, the prophecy about him would have been made sooner or changed reference to 'a child just beginning to walk' or some such. If the author chooses to bump up Harry's age but give him a younger sibling who ends up the child who lived, he could still have survived by being elsewhere when it went down. Then, Harry isn't the child of destiny but still important to the story line.

(I agree with everything else you said.)

******* Does anyone even consider the fact that making Harry older usually means "everything happened 2 years earlier than in canon"? Prophecy, class of the Marauders, Lily and Snape, Halloween, probably Neville too, everything is the same, but 2 years earlier. The difference starts then in 1989, when Harry starts school with the twins.

Chapter 1 starts after the events of 4th year, then reverts back to even before the Halloween night of 1981 only to drag us 87 chapters through plot until we, maybe, eventually, come back to a scene we already know. It's ridiculous. The fic hasn't even finished year 3. After half a million words.

** - Review begging.

That one is just sad. I get that people want to know that others like what they wrote, and writing a short reminder of "review please" never hurt anybody. But anything more and we go into cringey begging-for-internet-fame areas.

- Answering reviews in the story.

I hate it 'cause its just false advertising. When I see I haven't even scrolled 2/3 of the page, but then the chapter suddenly ends and dozens of review answers begin, I feel kind of cheated. Its the same, just a wee bit less disappointing when those answers are at the start.

- Thinking you're hot shit when all you do is canon rehashes and Lord Potter template-fics.

We all know that quality is in no way a factor when it comes to the popularity of a fic. There are fics out there with thousands of reviews, triple that in favorites and follows and views rivaling a well viewed Youtube video. Yet their standards are barely above High School notebook-drivel. I totally respect those fics as something completely legit. What grinds my gears, however, is when the authors of those fics begin to discuss their artistic choices and ideas. I mean, fuck off, you just copy pasted every single manipulative!Dumbledore Lord Potter fic into your Document Manager and uploaded that fic. Quit your goddamn bullshit.

I use the Lord Potter fics because those seem especially liked amongst those kind of authors, but its a phenomenon throughout the fanfiction community.
