  James Potter would never forget the first time he met Hermione Granger. Nor would he forget just how much he owed her for all she had done for him, his family, his world, and his future. HHr, through the evolving eyes of James Potter. HHr/JPLE

It's a fic about Hermione going back in time. It's been a while since I've read it. She has some PTSD symptoms. Keep in mind that it's been a while since I read it, but I loved how she dealt with it in her time. I just hope I'm not confusing it >.< Also, the pairings are a bit bizzare, but if you don't mind those, I heavily recommend it.

Edit: Failed the link. Also noticed it's NSFW so I tagged it. I think

*** No no, she definitely did have PTSD symptoms in this one, I was waffling on mentioning it myself until I saw your comment.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
