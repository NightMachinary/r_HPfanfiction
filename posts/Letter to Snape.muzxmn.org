I am looking for an odd fanfic and can remember only part... not sure where it was located. Thesummer after Occulamy lessons, Harry writes a letter to Professor Snape offering to replace the Pensive. In the letter, he states how sorry he is for someone as lowly/freakish as him for even daring to contaminate it with his presence and thus why he feels the need to replace it. Snape comes to see what is going on and thats all I remember. If anyone has any clues, please let me know. I realize it's a long shot but had to try! Thanks.
