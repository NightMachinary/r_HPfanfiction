*** Way too much cunnilingus in those, I mean damn... As someone who thinks cunnilingus is objectively more disgusting and unsafe than, say, blowjobs, it's a huge turn-off...

**** /Shrugs/

Each kink to their own.

I don't necessarily like every snippet or every kink or whatever, but I like the large assortment, and I like how there's usually a drop of context and not fading in right on the action. (Yes, what context, but what there is works for me since it still helps me get into the mindset.)

** I remember reading a short one-shot once where the anthropomorphic personification of death was kinky in that way and was playfully annoying Harry with it...

I can't remember where, though, sorry. I'm guessing it'd be too tame for you, anyway.

** Who needs the Quick-E-Mart? ;) - I DOOOOOO! :D (so yeah, I'd read that - I love kinky immortals that take an interest in Harry or at best follow his commands (while having some independence left of course))

ps: Damned, now I am stuck with that damned song from the Simpsons again :(
