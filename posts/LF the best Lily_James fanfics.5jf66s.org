Besides The Life and Times, I mean.

If you can link me some nice ones that are less tropey or just have a refreshing plot I'll also be grateful. Thanks!


** I HIGHLY recommend linkffn(11747402). It's still a WIP, but it already has almost 400k words. Like someone else already commented, the Tears on the Balcony trilogy by ByeByeBirdie is incredible too.

  There's just something about James Potter that always causes Lily to make the worst decisions. That's probably how she ends up throwing away a month of her seventh year on a bet with a boy she can hardly stand. A story of growing up, identity, and falling in love.

  Lily Evans is planning on seeing the New Year in alone, then just getting through the rest of the year with as few problems as possible. Unfortunately for Lily Evans, very little in her life is that simple. Still, what difference can a year make? 1977 through the eyes of L & J. Cover art by Viria. All Harry Potter characters, places etc are the property of JK Rowling.

***** Hey [[/u/HelloBeautifulChild]], here's an update: so far I've read the Balcony trilogy (loved it) and You Don't Say.

Have to tell you that the last one was pretty disturbing. Had its moments, but James being COMPLETELY abusive in their relationship (seriously, how many times did he say she was a disgusting, nosy cow again?) and Lily this weak crying girl was a huge turn-off for me. :/

Starting on Crazy Little Thing Called Love now.

****** I am definitely generally on the same page, I don't usually like a weak heroine, much less so when it is Lily. However I felt the writing was really good, and though I try and fight it, I do love a 'secretly, he's /really/ a good guy' story.

That's my memory of it, but you know what, I'm not 100% on my memory of this story. I'll re read it and get back to you, but it's likely I read this many, many years ago and added it to favorites at the beginning of making that a habit. I read the summary and I'm certain I've read it before, but I just read the first paragraph or so and I'm not so sure....

Okay, 'bout halfway through chapter 4, and I have to say, a: I don't really remember this story, must have read it at 3A before some test in high school, and b: I don't see Lily as weak. Maybe it's because she just attacked him, but (so far) there does seem to be a line in what she'll take. Their relationship isn't /healthy/ and it could be classified as abusive, but it's very real to the characters and their ages. They're 16/17, so junior year of high school (11th grade, if you're not in the US). It's not okay that he acts like this, or that Lily lets him, but -for me- it's not so far as to be disturbing.

Good news is, the rest of the stories should be much more traditionally Lily- super awesome badass/real and James- nice guy and cool guy.

Maybe it's because I'm so used to reading about Lily being this smart, independent girl that I found her to be 'weak' in this fic... I mean that in the sense that she justifies his (very bad) behaviour all the time, just accepts that he treats her like shit because that's who he is etc and I agree that's very common in girls that age. Heck, I was the same way. Maybe that's why I didn't care for it, it hit a little too close to home.. Anyway, although I liked the writing style, I don't feel comfortable with romanticizing an abusive relationship. But anyway, really liked your other recs. :)

Which other ships do you like?

******** [[/u/iambeeblack]] As I get older, I'm 100% on the icky relationships. If I have to spend the whole time reading the story reminding myself that it is /fiction/ so I shouldn't get upset, it kinda kills the point.

I'm a big fan of Harry/Ginny, I've also enjoyed Sirius/Remus. I can enjoy stores that aren't my ships, like Hermione/Draco or Harry/Daphne. Harry/Hermione can be good, but it is so different from cannon I only read that if it's entirely AU.

I need to branch out though, maybe Theo/Luna? What about you?

********** [[/u/iambeeblack]] Well damn, lol. I only recently got into Harry/Hermione, and it was a surprising enjoyment. I have always stood far away from the Harmony ship, because I really love Harry and Hermione's friendship, but the whole point of ffn is to change things.

Sirius is fantastic, I did read one ffn where he and Lily were dating at the start. It was a James/Lily pairing, the two broke it off pretty quick, but I felt the story gave more depth to Sirius than others tend to. Not that I'm complaining about the fun banter and jokes he tends to have.
