This might sound weird but there are fics I really enjoy except for a couple of grammatical errors (usually stuff like the occasional your/you're). Would it be bad if I copied and edited those fics with the intention of not posting or taking credit for them, but simply so I could reread then without those little hiccups?


** Nobody's gonna care if you don't tell them or post it somewhere.

** I've once re-written part of an ending of an actual book just because I disliked some character deaths. XD

** I've done this for my own personal use before. I took one of my favorite stories and cut out all the whining Harry bullshit as well as a pointless Ginny plotline. I've reread it 3-4 times since. Doesn't really seem like an issue to me.

** I think that the author might actually be delighted if you offer them help to fix those errors in their story...

**** Yeah but then the whole question is kinda moot, because who cares what you personally do with it? That confused me so I decided to ask.
