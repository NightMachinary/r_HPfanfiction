Looking for fics where Harry is experiencing magical things others havent. Hogwarts feels sentient? Try interacting and gets a response.

Goes on adventure and makes friends with a "misunderstood" sentient beeing (spinx, doxy, grim, etc)

Learning magic from faries (-because he treats them as sentient and gains their friendship?)

Any fic exploring Harry interacting with magic/beeings in a new way which ends up with Harry experiencing something noone else has.

  Harry Potter is abruptly thrown into a different world upon receiving his letter from Hogwarts. Danger stalks him at every turn, light and dark are locked in a constant, eternal battle, and weaving it all together is this substance called magic...

** Harry Potter and the Altered Destinies on Wattpad is a lot like this. Its a story where Percy Jackson adopts Harry from the Dursleys. I believe its Hufflepuff harry and Good Malfoys. Its a pretty good read and he is friends with alot of different creachers and he can feel Hogwarts magic. [[https://www.wattpad.com/403492997-harry-potter-and-the-altered-destinies-prologue]]
