** Didn't they all get purged a long time ago? I don't think anybody even bothers writing them anymore because they always get taken down.

** linkffn(A Dramatic Reading) is a complete fic in itself, but only of the first book. It's also the only one of the genre that I think is actually worth reading.

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** Oh! I knew a marauders one where there was a sub plot in which Remus was reading this book collecting that was like "[classic wizard name] and the [title similar to the actual books]". I think I remember Sirius finding them boring and weird.

I can't remember what the fic was though but it was funny.
