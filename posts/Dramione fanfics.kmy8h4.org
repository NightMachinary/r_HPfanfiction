I am looking for recommendations of *well written* Dramione fanfics, or even just Draco and original character fanfics.

*I have read and loved the following:* - dear draco, by malfoyuh - Manacled by SenLinYu - The Right Thing To Do by Lovesbitca8 - All The Wrong Things by Lovesbitca8 - The Auction by Lovesbitca8 - All You Want by SenLinYu

*I have read and disliked the following:* - Isolation by Bex-chan (don't come for me) - The Mudblood by kirstenkrueger - The Fallout by Everythursday (dnf) - Breath Mints / Battle Scars by Onyx_and_Elm

Thank youü§ó

  Hermione is the one who finds Draco weeping in the bathroom. He flees. She chases him into the Room of Requirement, and the room forces them to face their greatest fears together in order to find the door.

  Hogwarts, Sixth Year. Hermione Granger is assigned to tutor Draco Malfoy in Arithmancy. When two enemies find common ground, will that be enough to change the course of events leading up to the Second Wizarding War? Prequel to The Ginger Malfoy.

#+begin_quote
  When all hope is lost, what would you do to survive? Neville Longbottom becomes a Death Eater. Hermione Granger accepts Draco Malfoy's protection and he accepts her help. Theo Nott joins the remnants of the Order of the Phoenix. Ginny Weasley fills Bellatrix's shoes, while her brother Percy toils as a bureaucrat. And all of them have a role to play in overthrowing Voldemort.

** Not coming for you but just curious why you don't like Isolation? I like it when Draco thinks he's going mad and he thinks the walls are moving in on him. Of course that's only a fragment of it.

*** Hey! I think the premise is great but it was so poorly written. Characters weren't ‚Äúin character‚Äù. For example, Hermione Granger swearing at Professor McGonagall?? In what world?? None of them were even remotely close to the original characters, I didn't even feel like I was reading a Harry Potter fanfic. It was a huge let down after everyone hyped it up so much. Like I said, the story had so much potential and the ideas were great, but I could not for the life of me force myself to like it.
