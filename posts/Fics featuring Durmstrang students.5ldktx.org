Does anyone know of any Fics featuring Viktor Krum and Hermione?

Reason I ask is I'm writing a fic where Krum offers Hermione a "nightcap" and I want to try and get his speech and characteristics right.

Also is there any Fics featuring Poliakoff and the girl that was with him as I was planning for them to appear in a Krum/Hermione scene and again want to try and get a grasp on their characteristics.

Cheers


** Well, because I figured "why the hell not" [[https://fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?srt=1&t=0&g1=0&g2=0&r=10&lan=0&len=0&s=0&v1=0&c1=1775&c2=0&c3=0&c4=0&_g1=0&_c1=0&_c2=0&_v1=0][here]] is every single fic on FFN with Krum listed as a main character.

Every.

Single.

One.

**** Weird. I just literally went to FFN, set my filters to all ratings and include Viktor K. Didn't take much.
