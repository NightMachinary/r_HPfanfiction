After the cloak is passed from Father to Son, death will soon come for the Father.


** Much like the One Ring, invisibility is a completely incidental power, which explains why the Death Cloak is only marginally better than a fourth year student's disillusionment spell. It actually bestows plot armor, the ability for the possessor to uncannily evade death until they've lived a full life and are ready to pass on.

With Potters being Potters, giving up ownership of the cloak /does/ tend to lead to a lot of oddly coincidental deaths shortly after, but nobody has been able to connect it to the cloak since the deaths are all /completely/ /normal/. It's just that if they'd still had the cloak, some ass-pull of causality would've led to a fatal spell narrowly missing, or them coming up with a last-minute plan, or whatever got them out of the situation alive without anyone questioning it or having reason to suspect that the cloak was involved.

Contrary to fanon theory about Lily doing weird shit with charms, runes, or blood rituals, Harry's survival in 81 was actually because James had at one point used the cloak as a baby blanket as a prank. He narrowly evaded death at Lily's enraged hands shortly thereafter, only for both of them to die a week later on Halloween.

** This is similar to the theory I've had on the stone.

The Stone causes anyone who comes in contact with it to kill themselves. The three characters within Harry Potter that's we know find out about the stone and use it, all commit suicide. I also found it weird that his parents were saying how proud they were of him when he's willingly walking to his death. Therefore this could be the stone encouraging him to do it as I doubt they'd be happy he was giving up his life.

**** That's what seems odd to me. Their son is walking to his death and all they say to him is how proud of him they are. That's not how parents behave.

***** But what could they say to him? Take your friends and run away? Dis-regarding the fact that Voldemort would never leave them alone, the guilt would completely eat him up.

Harry's choices at that point are a) Stand, fight and die bringing the rest of the students and his friends with him or b) surrender (essentially committing suicide) and give his friends and the students a chance of living (were Voldemort to follow through and spare them). Either case, he ends up dead (either because Voldemort hunted him down or he dies in the forest).

His parents said the one thing that would easy his anxiety. He has already chosen to die. For better or for worse, he's that kind of person.

****** He didn't have to commit suicide. Harry was already the Master of the Elder Wand and the confrontation would've meant Voldemort would've been disembodied when Harry faced him. It would've bought our good guys enough time to clean house thoroughly so that if Voldemort ever returned, he wouldn't have much support. Not to mention, they might have found a way to remove the horcrux from Harry; or even wait until he died of natural causes. See linkffn(Albus Dumbledore and the Limbo Conversation)

Manipulating a teenager into commit suicide because they his information from him until the very last moment is monstrous.

******* I don't understand what you are saying. You comment literally makes my head spin. I think you may be confused.

I'm talking in relation to the info the character had. Any outside info (ie: that he was the Master of the Elder wand, Harry didn't know that or what it meant) is irrelevant. /As far as Harry/ knows, offering himself to Voldemort gives his friends and the students a higher chance of survival than the 0 of not doing so. As such, that's why he does it.

Harry has enough information to figure out that he's the Master of the Elder Wand by the time he sees Snape's memories, especially given why Voldemort killed Snape.

This information changes a lot. It means that Harry can face off against Voldemort without depending entirely upon his own skill against Voldemort's. And the horcruxes /can/ be destroyed after Voldemort and his forces have been dealt with.

Not to mention, he has no reason to trust in Snape's memories.

Harry has passive suicidal ideation; he does not value his own life beyond what use it may be to others. His parents, had they really been there, would've told him to find another way. Also, committing suicide like that has a psychological impact that can't just be walked off.

Anyway, it's clear that my perspective on this is quite different from yours, and I don't want to debate it any further.

You do realise that Voldemort's Ultimatum was hanging in the air, right? There's literally no time to "find another way". At that point of time, there is no other way.

Fine. But please don't start other discussions if you aren't willing to continue them.

****** I don't think you're wrong but I guess it's just the wording of it that's weird to me. I can't exactly remember everything as I haven't read the books in a while, but it seems too positive considering what's about to happen to him.

******* What Harry is most afraid of, in that moment, is letting everyone else down. He feels completely responsible for everyone, an extreme weight that no 17 year old should ever have to carry.

His parents, saying how proud they are of him, are conveying the fact that his choices haven't, and are not going to, let them down. He is not letting down his parents. He has already chosen the path that will end with him dying, his parent's can't change his mind, no one can and they know that.

Essentially commiting suicide, no matter the reasons, doesn't tend to be something that make your parents happy (no shit). When they say that they are proud of him, they are essentially saying that they understand the reasons behind his choice, they accept that this is the path he chose and that they aren't disappointed in him for taking that route.
