** Snape is a very complex character with a great backstory. I would argue that Snape is one of JK's best characters.

Snape was raised in poverty and with physical/emotional/mental abuse in his childhood and teen years. He can sympathize with Harry more than anyone else in the story. Though his personality is very different from Harry's, there are many similarities. The dynamic of their relationship can go in many ways: to emotional, humorous, or just a build-up to some sort of trust between the two.

Snape also loved Harry's mother and knew her more than anyone else in the story. He also was with Dumbledore and the Order through and through, even with all his spying. This gives him many connections to Harry.

They both have somethings to change about themselves, and the other can help that happen, which is the premise to most of the Severitus stories.

** Partially for the same reasons Snape is so popular; he's a complicated anti-hero that people like to read about, so naturally anything featuring him will be well-received by his fans.

But beyond that, Snape has the logical/rebel outsider role in the story, without any real connections to anyone living or any of the heros. Seeing him form a relationship with anyone is like watching Spock show emotion, like Sherlock expressing appreciation for Watson, like finding out Spike went and got his soul back for Buffy. It's both an awe and an awww moment.

Then too, there's a lot of the same reasons people like Harry/Draco or Hermione/Draco. They're interested in how two such different personalities can go from clashing quite violently to getting along so well. And there's lots of humor and touching moments both to be had from the awkwardness of it.

Plus Harry really needs a family quite badly, he was ready to go with Sirius like ten minutes after he found out the man wasn't a mass murderer. That was literally the only qualification he needed to go and want to live with someone who was a complete stranger to him. And he does admire Snape in the end, once he finds out Snape loved Lily and was Dumbledore's man all along and only tried to protect Harry for all those years. If he'd known all those things earlier when he was younger it really probably wouldn't have been completely outside the realm of possibility.

Never thought about it like that, but you are so right. Excellent insight, thank you.

**** Those examples fit so perfectly. Another comparison I love is the moment the Phantom of the Opera lets Christine go with Raoul. That despite all he's been through he still won't let that last bit of good in him die.

** Personally, I really like the enemies to lovers trope, or in this case enemies to family.

I like seeing the ways Snape's behavior and ideals are maintained, carried out and then deconstructed, to be rebuilt with grudging respect or affection. Now, I won't turn down a good 'Snape is one of Harry's parents' story but in this genre 'Severus "Hates-every-ounce-of-James-Potters-existence-and-was-your-mother-even-involved-in-your-conception-Potter" Snape not only overcoming his dichotomy towards Harry but surpassing it and forming familial bonds with a boy who lacks them not out of a sense of guilt or duty to his lost love but because not only does he want to but he can't not get attached to him' will always be my favorite.

I'm gonna stop before I continue to wax poetic (or ramble endlessly, whichever) on Severitus. Also, it doesn't help that Movieverse!Snape is notably nicer than bookverse!Snape, though that's not saying much.

*** Nah, Snape had a huge book following before the movies ever came out. Most of it came from book four, where he's revealed a a former DE trying to distance himself from his past, where he's harassed by Moody, where he once again takes up his role as spy for Dumbledore.

Alan Rickman... he's a handsome man and his voice is perfection itself, but he was much, much too old to play Snape. Don't get me wrong, he did the best job any actor could have done, but the tragedy of the books is how /young/ everyone was when they made the mistakes they did. The Potters were only 21 when they died. To see 65-year-old Alan Rickman grieving over a Lily in her forties makes me cringe inside when I watch it.

*** This. And only this.

I don't play into the whole 'Snape is a good guy' thing that Rowling tried to push down our throats in DH. Yes, he did some good things. But he was also a vindictive, greasy murderer.

And I say murderer not because of Dumbledore or whatever scheme he tried to pull of, but Snape was a Death Eater. Even if he 'showed remorse'. And I firmly believe DE's don't get the mark if they don't murder/torture/rape muggles or muggleborn. So whatever Snape did in later life, 'remorse' is not the ultimate excuse for a clean slate.

Explain Draco Malfoy getting the Dark Mark then. Dumbledore was supposed to be his first kill. Yet he received the mark before that and never actually killed or raped anyone (that we know of).

Plus in canon, it's only [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Mark#On_the_arm][Inner Circle Death Eaters]] who get branded with the Dark Mark. It kind of implies that the grand majority of Death Eaters were running around without a mark on them. Yet they were still loyal to Voldemort.

***** Draco Malfoy was a different story. His rite of ascension was more of strategic value, to get DE's into Hogwarts & kill Dumbledore. He also was expected to fail this task. Plus, Riddle was kind of 'done' with the Malfoys anyway by that point.

****** Then why bother to give Draco a Dark Mark? I agree with everything you just said, but it clashes with the view that you have to kill someone or do anything really really horrible to get one. It seems more like you just have to promise to serve Voldemort. Maybe it helps to be from an "inner circle" family.

******* I think the reason Draco got the mark was kind of a trap. By giving him the mark Voldemort made it really really hard for him to defect or give up on his hopeless task because as far as the rest of the world is concerned the mark proves him to be evil.

I'm not saying that you have to justify your claim, but are there any specific fics that you got this idea from, perhaps?
