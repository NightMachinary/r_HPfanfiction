I don't have a specific idea in mind for what I want, but to me this relationship always has the most potential in the series because to me they come across as similar in goals yet are antagonistic through circumstance. I want to see snape and harry fighting together for once, presumably when Harry's in his later years of school, actively taking part in the war, not a romance between the two. Thanks in advance

linkffn(To Shape and Change) has references to when they were like that before Severus comes back in time.

  Hindsight is 20/20, but when Harry's last steps into the forest set him back further than he'd ever thought, he never realised how grateful he'd be to have Snape there to help too. Mentor/guardian fic, time travel, but not cliched.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** Story: Harry channels his inner Slytherin [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12706909]] By: Slytherinsal

Summery: Set following the pensieve incident during occlumensy, Harry has a sudden fit of the smarts and works to enlist more active aid from Snape. Unkind to Dumbledore and some Weasleys. Umbitch gets hers. Hermione has to think, and wises up. A peek at what might happen if the occasional use of logic and intellect was applied instead of hokey reasoning and blind belief in prophecy.
