I started reading a fic a WHILE ago. It took place during GoF. A girl was thrown into the triwizard tournament and was relying of muggle ways to win. The last thing i remember reading was hermione was kidknapped and in the forbidden forrest and the girl had to find her. She had no idea she was a witch until she accidentally went from Snows car to hogwarts.
