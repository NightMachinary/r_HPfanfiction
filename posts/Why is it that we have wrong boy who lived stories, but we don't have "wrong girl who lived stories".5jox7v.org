I've noticed that in every story with the premise "Harry's twin/older/younger sibling is recognized as the boy who lived even though it's actually harry" it's always a brother. Why hasn't their been a wrong girl who lived? also why is it that in stories where harry has a brother it always devolves into a wrong boy who lived compared to a sister where she basically worships the ground harry walks on.


** Because you're talking about two niche genres within the fandom. First, not many people write WBWL fics. Second, even less write gender bender Harry fics. It's not surprising that there aren't any notable fics which merge these two tropes.

*** I'm not talking about Gender benders, I'm saying how come they haven't had one where say Harry's sister is confused as the girl who lived when harry is the boy who lived

**** Because in these fics Harry's sibling is usually a narcissistic jerk or a self-righteous idiot, and people are more comfortable with a boy playing that role.

**** Because the prophecy explicity names a "He". You would have to change the wording of the prophecy for that premise to work

** Technically linkffn(holly Evans and the spiral path) is a wrong-girl-who-lived fic. Harry is considered the boy who lived until Holly discovers he's not...

  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

** Whats the point? Almost any story thats written has to have a purpose, something to explore. I have never dropped a fic so quick as reading an author's note saying their friends wanted OCs named after them put in the stories. What is the point of WBWL stories? To explore growing up in the magical world or at least to provide contrast. Sometimes it allows competition between the two brothers which acts as motivation justifying a power trip whether its a self-righteous bashing of the other characters or a pure OP Harry. Sometimes the wbwl is used to set up different aims and goals for the Harry, this allows different approaches. What does having the other sibling be a girl matter? All it does is make people feel uncomfortable if the Harry goes off on a self-righteous power trip. We don't have them because nobody feels it adds anything. Feel free to find something to explore and write the fic, I'll probably read it wbwl stories are a guilty pleasure of mine but what is the point of changing the brother to a sister?

** From what I've read, most of the WBWL fics actually have the non-harry sibling as a Flanderized version of Canon!Harry. The OC named Harry, in Slytherin, then insults canon Harry's actions and personality, making sure to mix in quite lot of canon examples in there (sometimes with a twist to make it seem worse).

That's not all of them obviously, but a surprising amount I've seen. It's also true the one GWL story I saw (cannot remember where) she was a sweet kid who wasn't an antagonist.

It seems the people who write these want to give Harry a foil of how life could've gone. That leads to a boy Harry who is a built in antagonist. That said girl Harry would probably just lead to a Lannister situation which might not be that preferable.

** Because the prophecy indicates a male child. Bit hard to rewrite the prophecy so it's ambiguous. It makes more sense to have the boy touted as the hero while the girl is ignored, because that's a sort of stereotypical plot.
