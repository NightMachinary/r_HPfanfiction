Hi! I'm looking for a fic called 'Mapmakers', it's not the series called 'The Mapmakers'. From memory, it's Fred seeing Remus and Sirius on the map and their relationship through his eyes.


** There was a Fred POV Wolfstar fic called Mapmakers (The Suicide Is Painless Remix) that was by casira (aka casirafics), but I poked around a little bit on Google and it appears that it's been deleted from LJ and Skyhawke. It was a remix (with permission, for an annual exchange that used to be popular on LJ) of [[https://autumnalis.livejournal.com/5817.html][this fic]], which is still available.

ETA: The Internet Archive saves the day! [[https://web.archive.org/web/20050318235002/http://www.skyehawke.com/archive/story.php?no=2377]]
