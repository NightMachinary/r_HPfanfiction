So, other than the typical wands, runes, wandless, staves stuff, what do you think people could use to cast spells? Would those tools still use incantations and movements? Have you seen any fics that do it in interesting ways?

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** Jewellery would be cool - a bracelet or ring for hand-based movements, or even a necklace/amulet? Although I suppose technically anything you can hold could be used!

** In linkffn(The Power of the Press by Bobmin356), rings are used in Polynesia. IIRC, it's because of a shortage of suitable woods, and rings use less wood than wands.

In linkffn(The Closer You Look by Tony Samuels), Harry uses a deck of cards as a focus.

  Not a lot of things could affect Harry's mundane life in the house of his abusive relatives. But then, you don't need extraordinary things to obtain extraordinary results. A seemingly simple step pitched his life into a direction no one had ever expected. Harry Potter, the Jack of all trades and Master of Misdirection. Intelligent! Harry.

*** Ah, Power of the Press. Good 'ole Bobmin. Power of the Press is a classic - though I'd forgotten the rings thing. That was fun. :)

A deck of cards? That's pretty dang cool. I don't think I've seen that before - in HP, anyway. :) Thanks for the recs!

** I headcannon this: there are four elements in the spanish minor arcana set: Wands (traditional wands, clubs/rods and staves), Cups (Magical chalices), Swords ("Atames" and "Gryffindor's like swords", and pentacles (coins, orbs, bracelets and rings), each foci has a diferent ability and capacity related to the caster and casting in question.

********* Oooh, nice. The classic set. I'm very fond of the Magician in the Rider-Waite set - he looks like he's about to do the Saturday Night Fever dance. :)

And fair enough - I was just curious, since you had the Minor Arcana as a category of focus. :)

I haven't written anything in the Potterverse yet myself - though I am currently outlining/worldbuilding for my first attempt! - so all I could exchange would be general tips I've picked up from running D&D games over the years. Which is basically just 'everything interacts, everything makes sense to the people doing it, and everything exists in layered networks. Also, naming shit is always the hardest part.' :D

********** Lol indeed, I also use 5e as a template to my worldbuilding in the Potterverse since their Magic system is too soft for my liking. You can find good stuff to inspire yourself in the Harry Potter Fanon Wikia. Naming is Easy if you remember the rules: 1-use an a aboriginal name if there was a first culture before the current, 2-use proper names from the dominant culture if you're dealing with Europeans.

Are you a Critical Role fan? They did a 'Harry Potter' game in the D&D ruleset once. 'Critical Role and the Club of Misfits'. It's where my tag-flair comes from. :)

And yeah, but then... what specific name do you use? That's my issue. "Okay, so I have a rural farming town, it's part of a Rohan-like culture, so I want a name that reflects that... Then what?" :)

Put it this way, I ended up naming that town 'Cropwheat', because they grow wheat. Over a decade of D&D and that's the level I'm at. :D

************ Lol, ok I Will look up that show. Well if it's a farming Town then it should be next to a River, whats the river's name? If you have a fictional language you could use a toponimic, such as "next to X", other option is that the current Town is seated on a former temple long forgotten of another civilization that's no longer around, so the Town could use a "local" version of that temple's original name, even if they no longer remember the original temple.

************* Enjoy. It's on youtube. :)

And yeah, that's a similar path to the one I usually end up taking. It just takes me ages to get there. I remember once inventing an entire mythology about the founding of a city just so I could reasonably use the random name I came up with. :D

Your system works quite well for British places too. Our naming schemes are utterly mad. We have places named Droop, Throop, North Piddle, Upton Snodsbury, Chipping Campden, etc. Those aren't Harry Potter places. Those are real. When you're making British names, the weirder they sound, the more likely they are to actually exist. :D
