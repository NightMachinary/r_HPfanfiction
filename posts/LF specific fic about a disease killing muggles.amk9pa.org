Every few years I look for and reread this fic, and I can never remember the name and it always takes me ages to find. My Googlefu is failing me.

Here is what I remember that also doesn't spoil it for people who haven't read it:

*It was from Dark Lord Potter, as in the community.\\
*It was set pre-Hogwarts, so Harry knew nothing about magic.\\
*A â€˜summer flu' was killing all the muggles, and leaving wizards unaffected.\\
*After the Dursleys die, a traumatised Harry escapes using accidental magic and roams the country trying to reach a pick-up point that Lupin was able to tell him before having to flee.\\
*Harry meets the Creeveys.\\
*It had a really good post-apocalyptic tone, sort of like 28 days later.

Any help gratefully received. I don't know why I always struggle to find it. Maybe I should set a reminder in my phone with its name, for a random date next year, once I find it this time.

#+begin_quote
  A plague has swept across Britain, wiping out the Muggle population. Ignorant of his heritage and the magical world, a ten year-old Harry Potter is left to fend for himself against two factions, each plotting and conspiring to find him before the other.
