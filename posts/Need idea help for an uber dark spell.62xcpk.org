So basically, it's a super, super dark spell. A spell on that same caliber would require sacrificing a child for each time you wanted to cast it. That kind of dark. Every time you cast it, it leaves a mark on the caster, always in the same place, and if you use it too much, it leaves a distinct scar. Anyone who knows the spell can take one look at the scar and know what caused it. Though it's super dark, I plan on having the good protagonist use it frequently enough that it scars.

Problem is, I don't know what the spell does. It can't be anything that has a spell already, because they would just use that rather than this horrifically dark spell, and it can't be super OP or it'd ruin the plot.

A little context: This spell will be used in the future by the protagonist (yet to be decided) who goes back in time as themselves, not into the body of their younger self, in order to stop Voldemort, as they tend to do.


** Something that steals skills from others. Whatever topic it targets, all the memories and understanding of it is drawn out of the owner and granted to the caster.

Voldemort may have used it a few times but found the accompanying memories too distracting or perhaps aspects of the owner's personality can be consumed in the process. He ended up with an irrational fear of boats.

*** I read an interesting fix that is based around the fact that the AK steals the memories of that whih is killed, when Voldies AK back-fires Harry gets the memories (because the spell to access the memories is most to time so Voldie doesn't benefit).

The fic begins with aspects similar to Charlie & Chocolate Factory.

Title is something like 'Harry's Magic Factory' - Really worth reading.

** Well, there's pretty much a spell for everything in the HP universe already; mind control, erasing memories, reading minds etc. The only thing that would be grave enough to be considered dark af is something that deals with paranormal concepts.

Souls and death itself seems to have been personified to a point in cannon so I would assume the spell would affect the target's soul in some way. I thought about it for a while but the only option I came up with is casting the target soul into directly into Hell even if they were meant to go to heaven.

As for the purpose I'm honestly not too sure. Maybe the souls are a power up? How about instead of going into Hell the souls are stored and later used for a massive spell? One thing is for sure, if the spell is something super dark it needs to deal with a level above the physical world, at least in my opinion.

*** Oooooo what about a spell that destroys the soul all together? They don't get to go on to the other place at all. It could be used to prevent Voldemort's return, if you stretched canon so that all the Death Eater's dark marks somehow help Voldemort find his way back from death each time. If the dark mark is some kind of magical vow or spell like the fidelius then it would be tied into the magic user's body and soul. Destroying the dark mark, then, would require destruction of the soul itself and burning/otherwise completely destroying the body. Future Harry could get experience using it while trying to hunt down Voldemort's hidden followers.

Also, Sanderson's First Law of Magics: An author's ability to solve a conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic. This essentially means that we're coming in with canon circumstances, no matter how fanon it is, that is where we start, Soul Destruction is pretty off of that mark, with no real distinction between the magic between both worlds.

*** Building on the 'stealing souls' concept, how about the spell steals the target's soul, storing it inside the user. They can then choose to offload hostile effects onto the stored soul, up to and including a Killing Curse. The soul does get damaged by this, eventually being destroyed (instead of passing on) so they'd need to go and find a new one if they wanted to tank more damage after a certain point. For balance reasons, they can only store one soul at a time and storing a soul causes one to feel as if they are constantly in the presence of a weak Dementor's effect, as well as some slight screwing with the user's head.

This spell would be easy to explain why its used frequently if the protagonist lost somebody. You could also have them get advise from some great person like merlin or the founders. Scars could be explained that its basically a killing curse that you shoot at yourself and always leaves a scar where you pointed your wand to

** *Ideas for your spell based on the description:*

( Body/Blood Corruption Curse )

A spell that causes the person to want to harm themselves due to the belief that their blood or body is poison. The person would basically turn on themselves trying to free themselves of the "poison". Alternatives to this would be something that affects the body itself, causing things like white blood cells to attack the body, or the mind to cut off communication to organs, or something similar.

--------------

( Skins Burden Curse )

A spell that forces the person to try and pull off their skin. Alternatives would be a spell that turns a persons skin inside out, or removes the skin, or burns the skin off slowly, or permanently scars the skin so horribly the person is unrecognizable.

--------------

( The Eternal Darkness Curse )

A spell that corrupts ones soul. Not the casters soul, but the person its cast on. Basically the persons soul would corrode, making them more emotionally unstable at first. Then prone to fits of violence and insanity. Then eventually turning them into a shell of themselves. Aware of their surroundings but unable to fully comprehend them or understand things and occasionally suffering outbursts and episodes of screaming, shaking, and passing out.

--------------

( Life Erosion/Absorption Curse )

A spell that leeches a few years of life from a person transferring it to the caster. Basically extending the casters life by the amount of time stolen from the victim. So the victim would die say.. 2 years earlier then before, and the caster would live 2 years longer. Imagine the grey and dark uses of the spell. Stealing an older terminally ill patients remaining life... effectively killing them. Or stealing from a child barely born. Spell can be used over and over but affects the caster scaring them over and over, perhaps with the scar spreading over time and use.

** I think this spell could be used to destroy souls, and would be really useful in destroying Voldemort without the need to go after his horcruxes. In fact, because Voldemort split his own soul so many times, his soul was far weaker as a result and thus highly vulnerable to soul destroying rituals and spells.

So it's up to the protagonist to use this spell against Voldemort without modifications (guaranteed to work), or redesign it as to use a less costly sacrifice (but may not work).

****** I was going to suggest something similar. I read a book where the worst/evilest spell one could cast turned people into eternally living statues. The point was to drive people slowly insane as they remained conscious over thousands+ of years,. I think these kinds of "fate worse than death" spells are indicative of a immorality that can be quite effective, depending on how you use it. After all, which is worse -- death or eternal suffering? I think something like this or the coma could work in the scenario you described because it gives the protagonist the moral high ground in that s/he /didn't/ use the killing curse, yet perceptive readers could imagine how the as-yet-undetermined-spell is a kind of grey area torture. Kind of like how the Dementors are more amoral than Voldemort, and that's why the Ministry uses them.

** Idea: Spell cost is that the person you last had intimate contact with (note that this could mean sex but could also backfire if someone you care about has since given you a particularly meaningful embrace etc.) will spend 24 hours wracked with pains similar to being subjected to the Cruciatius spell followed by their soul being wrenched from their body, it will be tied to you in the afterlife forever once you die for better or for worse.

The spell itself would directly pull the soul, or a soul fragment, from the target. This could be a way to release the horcruxes and bind them to the caster without allowing for them to possess the caster, who would, upon absorbing all of Voldemort, or all but his current form, have themselves destroyed to enter the afterlife with the consequences of their deeds.

Marking would be up to you.

btw, now that I look at this, if you don't use it, let me know and I may write it up myself. ;)

** Thinking of existences worse than death and it seems to me that this needs to be not a curse per se, but as other have indicated, something that steals something. A spell that makes the target incapable of being loved might do the trick, even a little. The spell leaves a crack scar above the heart of the caster, though the caster gains added attraction in proportion to how lovable the person was that was targeted.

There is a counter curse, but it involves sex after killing the caster. Or if you want it more tame, successfully cutting out the heart of the caster and giving it to a dementor who will draw out the stolen love and then you must kill the dementor before it absorbs the love.

** Magical Bunker Buster maybe? Unlike the bombardment and blasting curse, it penetrates the target (wall/cover) and detonates behind it (with the force of an actual 2000lb bomb). So you go and sacrifice the kid and then you can cast this spell once. Unlike simpler destruction spells it does not create a magical blast but tears the innocent soul from the victim and then detonates it after traveling through the wall.

It is not really suitable for magical combat, because of the lengthy ritual and the collateral damage might get you as well if you cast it in close quarters. The preferable use would be to go to the wardline of your target and then perform the ritual. It could probably level a medium-sized house but not Hogwarts or a large manor so you still have to aim and know where your target is.

Otherwise, perhaps it sacrifices a portion of your ability to forgive (anything at all) or your ability to love, and does not sever the soul from the body as AK does, but obliterates it entirely. This could work if there is an afterlife, and Dark Lords are taking it over.

Sort of like the manga Fairy Tail and the Black Arts (Magic that essentially steals the life force from things both around the caster and that he touches).

One thing I would like to say is that using it with a Time-Warped Harry is a bad idea, as he would be likely to know the effects of this magic, and not use it/hide the marks already on himself. After all, no matter what a type of Magic/Spell can do, there is always an alternative.

Also, disregard all the 'soul destruction, soul magic' type deals, Dumbledore himself said that the soul is infallible, there is always a way for it to reconstruct itself and return to normal after splitting, even from a Dark Ritual, it's impossible for anything to destroy a soul.

** Could mess with sympathetic magic. Some sort of curse at any rate.

Voodoo dolls are classic. Binding a recently dead would slowly inflict the rigor mortis and decomposition while the victim is alive. In fact you could go the route of transfiguration, and have symbolic magic be the branch of magic. So like break a mirror smeared with enemies blood to give them bad luck, or take sandpaper to a pair of bound glasses to sand off the victims eyeballs and cornea. It requires a pure ritual focus though, like a silver ring or a unicorns horn, but when you use it, it "burns" you from being touched by dark magic, and the area touching the item darkens and turns purplish black. So someone with a black ring finger with a ring of blessed silver would be very recognizable.

However for the feel of what you are going for, how about it requires a child of the one you are using it against, and it completely and utterly tells you everything that person knows. Kills both of them. Harry used it to track down death eaters, get through fidelus if you really want, etc. The advantage is occlumency doesn't work against it...and you just need the kid.
