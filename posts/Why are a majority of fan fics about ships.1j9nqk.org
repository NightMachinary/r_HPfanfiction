I'm not so sure if it's 100% true now, but it used to be, that you couldn't move for shipping fics. I'm not saying I didn't like them, I just prefer fics that are mysteries/adventures, reasons I started to love the books in the first place. Why do you think they were/are so popular (not only in this fandom, but others)? Is it a gender issue? That girls tend to like more stories to do with relationships and shipping and guys tend to like any other kind of fic? Or is there another issue I'm unaware of (if you write a shipping fic you get six million cookies) As a writer of the more adventure/mystery line, this does kind of irk me out a bit. Especially when you've written out a great fic, posted it out and gotten no reviews whatsoever, when a fic which is badly written and focuses on Ginny/Tonks or whatever, get's a thousand reviews just because it's a favorite ship of the moment. I'm not bitter, I swear.


** I'm going to bypass the obvious answer ([[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostFanficWritersAreGirls][girls write more fics]], so they focus on what they like) and suggest this: a work, good or bad, gets reviews because the reader is stirred to speak. If the story is emotionally driven, the readers are more likely to have an emotional reaction and feel the need to share.

Action and mystery stories can also stir the reader, but it takes more skill; most of the tension is in description rather than dialogue. It takes more work to write for the reader's inner eye versus their ear.

** From what I have observed, part of the reason I believe there are so many ships in fanfic has to do with the fact that most fanfiction is written about stories/worlds in which there is little to no obvious sex that takes place "on screen". And what few relationships there are, are not altogether satisfying with what the authors/audience think about the characters. Relationships are a part of life and like it or not, sex is a part of relationships, and if we see a part of what should be there, not taking place we will FIX it. Different pairings are more or less popular, in much the same way that styles of music change over time, artists rise and fall. I can only suggest that that perhaps the current favorite changes because, much like memes, they get over done and people stop seeing them as unique. Which is not to say that those badly written Ginny/Tonks favorites will still be popular in 2 months. Where I have left reviews on fanfics that are YEARS old, if they are well written.

As to the difference between the proportion of ships between "male" and "female" fandoms, there could be any number of reasons why, and as no one can speak for both with adequate authority, I will posit my explanations. Guys seem to desire more visual representations of sex, where as women seem to prefer more literary ones. This could be the result of societal training, or natural inclination, not really sure anyone is can fairly say one way or the other.

** Shipping pairings are an easy way to group stories, as many tales defy simple categorization. Consequently, pairings make for somewhat more predictable reading. A horror story could also be supernatural, adventure, crime, romance, or humor. The labels aren't particularly useful much of the time, so it's hard to know what you're really getting when you sit down to read. But a Harry/Ginny shipping story is, at the very least, going to have some semblance of a Harry/Ginny relationship. You're getting what's on the tin. In a fandom with upwards of a million stories, not wasting your time with stories unlikely to be to your liking is a plus and shipping offers that.

The other important thing to recognize is the polarizing effect of slash on the fandom. Readers who enjoy slash seem to prefer slash stories; those who don't tend to be highly unforgiving toward stories where suddenly, out of the blue, Harry's tongue is in Draco's mouth. If I read a story listed as Harry/Parvati, Harry/Draco, or Hestia/Tonks, I go in with a pretty good idea of the likelihood of my squick meter's being pegged.

** Ships have their own culture - there's a solidarity to it. Communities form around them, and with communities come contests, avid writers and readers and ideas; they're vocal and generate the most content and already come with an audience.

From the reader's point of view, if you're already invested in a relationship, then at least in the ship-oriented fics, you're 80% certain of what you're getting (the ship). They're more character driven, and considering that most people are just looking for fics starring their favorite characters, I'd imagine that ends up more in line with what people want. With mysteries and adventures, you can't be sure of what the story might bring you, and more plot-centric genres are tougher to execute well and requires more reader trust to begin.

But I'd imagine the community thing is the most important thing; unpopular ships suffer the same fate as non-ship fics.

*** Are you saying that because ships are quite final (i.e. you know, roughly, what the fic is going to be about) they become mini genre's in on their own, and because other fics may be hard to pinpoint exactly what the adventure is (one could be about dragons the other about leprechauns) they get marganalised? If so what can we do to counter this? I think, in particular, the HP universe is one of the least explored universes in fiction, in that we don't actually know too much about it, if you compare what we know about Star Wars for example. I like reading fan fics that explore what people think may also exist in the universe. So, in that respect, are people content with what they know about the hp universe?

**** Considering how it seems that [[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/spoiler-alert-stories-ruined-surprise-ending-revealed-california/story?id=14282659][people actually like knowing how stories turn out after all]], shipping actually does convey a sense of promise that works in their favor.

I'm not sure that it's possible or even desirable to try to change things, however. Good stories are good regardless of whether they contain shipping. And while we each can point to stories that we don't think deserve the hype (MoR would be my exhibit A), they nevertheless have significant appeal to groups of readers, even if just as idle wish fulfillment.

Incidentally, the lament in your OP seems like the common case. Some of my best writing, of which I'm the most proud, has actually been read and reviewed the least; my most popular story (north of a million hits, 1200+ reviews) owes much of its popularity to being one of the first, complete, novel-length, Harry/Fleur shipping fics; it is not my best writing and contains many rookie mistakes that make me cringe today.

**** I'm very much in agreement with what Pers said. Also, certainly all /major/ ships (as ships are as plentiful as the characters themselves, squared!) have popular dynamics. Draco/Hermione has forbidden love and bad boy/good girl. James/Lily has the love-hate banter. Sirius/Remus has the angst and Marauders angle. They much are like mini-genres.

If you like reading fanfics like the ones you describe, then the best thing you can do is recommend those fics to other readers. Word-of-mouth is the only way an offbeat fic gets known nowadays, because unlike shipping fics, it doesn't come with an audience. If you're frustrated as an author, build an audience the hard way, and hope you can find people who'll spread your fic for you. Engage with the community, request and trade reviews with other authors (ff.net and hpff are active in this). Try different communities; sometimes your audience is waiting somewhere else. HPFF is actually probably your best bet from what you describe, if you don't mind the ratings limitations; the community's still going and they very much like their original concepts. I have a primarily-gen, mostly-OC adventure story that's topped 800 reviews that doesn't get a blip of attention elsewhere, nor did I expect it to.

And finally, the reality is, some fics never find mass appeal because they simply don't /have/ mass appeal, even if they're great. That's the reality of all media and why we have summer blockbusters and Dan Brown. But a devoted following can be even better, if you find your readers, and you never know when a sleeper hit might surface.

** I think it's an issue of classification.

I personally prefer to read stories that don't pigeonhole themselves on one particular genre or storytelling aspect. Story that includes action, adventure, humour, romance and mystery will usually be more enjoyable than stories that focus on just one of these. Personally when going through a list of search result I almost always skip the story that described itself as a "mystery" or an "adventure" or a "romance" story. I've grown up on multi-novel sagas with far reaching, intricate and broad plots - and I prefer to read fanfiction that aspires to the same.

For stories that are multifaceted, romantic pairing become the easiest way to categorize them - especially since many readers have clearly defined preferences in their "shipping".

With regards to "girls write more" - I've noticed that of the stories I've liked by description and saved for reading, they seem to be at most evenly split in gender of author. If anything there might be a bit more male authors. And vast majority contain romance plot or major sub-plot - so I don't believe it's an issue that's to do with author gender.

Plus... the weird part - romance grabs almost everybody, because we can all identify with that aspect of life. It's universally appealing to the entire human race - more so than anything else you can write into a story.

** Writing a romance is relatively straightforward. You know where you're beginning (probably canon) and you know where you're ending (your ship has sailed). Having written (non-fanfic) mysteries, adventures, bildungsromans, and romances, I have to say I think the romances tend to be a lot easier than other types of stories to start and to maintain, and don't require as much advance plotting. The characters have a strong investment in moving the story forward, so it's easy to keep writing, and plot holes tend to be less crippling. Especially in fanfic where you don't even have to flesh out your own characters, there's not nearly as much that the author's required to do, and there's a lot of scope for creativity. Plus you have a guaranteed reader base of people who already like the ship and definitely want to see these characters together.

** I just like to read about drama and romance. Don't know why, don't really care. I just like it. But for me the best Fanfics are ones that combine Romance and Adventure that *don't* use bad grammar, and/or Mary Sue OC ness. Just my opinions trying to be put into words and coming out horribly.
