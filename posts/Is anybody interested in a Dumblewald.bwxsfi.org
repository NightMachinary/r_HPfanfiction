Because I have one! :)

(Yes, I know, one of those shameless self promotion posts. But here it is! xD)

For Albus Dumbledore, that summer was the beginning of the end. If he had already lost it all, what was the harm, at least, of falling in love? What was there left to lose, if everything was already torn to pieces? Choosing between what is right and what is easy isn't always as simple as it seems. Even for the Greater Good.

** I read this! It was soo intriguing. I've been wanting a Dumblewald like this for years.

** Interesting, I'll have to look into this! Your Romione stories look good too..... What's the Platform 9 3/4 contest? Can you share a link? I'm always looking for fics to read through contests.

*** Hey, yes absolutely! [[https://www.facebook.com/groups/amortentia1/][This is Platform 9 3/4]]! They are an HP group on facebook, and they have a fanfic contest every so often. I believe the next one is in July, most of my recent one-shots are written for them. :D If you are interested you can read, and vote, and write for it too if you'd like!

​

And [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/Blooming_Love_OS_Contest_2019][this is the Ao3 collection of all the entries from the last contest!]] My favorites are the Merope/Tom Riddle ([[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/Blooming_Love_OS_Contest_2019/works/18672154][Happily Never After]]), [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/Blooming_Love_OS_Contest_2019/works/18670834][Author: Unknown]], and [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/Blooming_Love_OS_Contest_2019/works/18670063][I'll Take Care of You Always]]. Ah, and [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/Blooming_Love_OS_Contest_2019/works/18669901][What he would miss the most]]! There were quite a few amazing entries this time actually! Seems silly to list all, so I shall just stop there.

​

Hope you enjoy the Dumblewald!
