I'm looking for anything that's related to the Dursleys! Whether it's Dudley-or-spawn-is-magical, Petunia and Vernon's story, Harry being reunited with them years later, their ordinary muggle life - anything. I'm not at all picky with any pairings or ratings, just hoping for something of decent length and quality.

On a related note, I have vague recollections of a fic where Dudley and Millicent Bulstrode meet and make friends. I believe she owned a wizarding sex shop. I'd really love some context to this, if anyone knows this fic.

*** Yes! That's a really fantastic fic. I reread it a couple of days ago, actually, so I think it might be what's put this new Dursley-obsession into my brain.

** [[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/hp_beholder/9836.html][Below the Belt]] is probably the fic you mentioned (Dudley/Millicent).

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year.

** The best exploration of Dudley I've ever seen is a pair of fics by Harmonic Friction.

The first short fic is Harry centric, in the summer post-GoF, where he gets a glimpse of Dudley's life and friends:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3451695/5/Go-Ask-Alice-When-She-s-Ten-Feet-Tall]]

Summary: This is Harry Potter. [This] is Harry Potter on drugs. Finished.

(8k words, complete)

That fic has a much more substantial Dudley-centric sequel which overlaps a bit in events but then continues onwards:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3493409/1/Recall-Alice-When-She-Was-Just-Small]]

Dudley Dursley: champion boxer, crass chav, cannibal?, bad boyfriend, good son, annoying cousin, best friend. It's hard to keep all the identities straight. Fin.

** little0bird has a few that focuses on 'ol Dudders, as part of the wider arc. Well written, and a must-read for all who, like me, have a weakness for the fluff.
