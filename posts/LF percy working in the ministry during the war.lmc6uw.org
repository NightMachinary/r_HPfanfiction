:END:
the only thing i really remember was that near the end of the fic percy and one of the girls on the gryffindor quidditch team (dont remember which one) used a loophole in a law to rewrite almost every law in the ministry

  "Started with what?" Percy asked, feeling as though there was a joke and he'd missed the punchline.

  "Seizing back our government, of course,"

  Alicia was an absolute genius. She'd managed to background check and recruit 14 elected members of the Wizengamot, the minimum number needed to be present to pass a law, if said law was supported by two appointed members of the Wizengamot. Though this loophole hadn't been exploited in nearly half a millenium, Alicia had found it and was using it to its fullest extent. All of the people present were anti-Voldemort, pro-Resistance, and Percy even thought he recognized a few names from names he'd heard Bill, Charlie, and Remus mention.

  Alicia had managed to design a brand-new and completely restructured government. She'd clearly done mounds of research and compiled a thorough new system---how laws were passed, how leaders came into and left office, policy regarding Azkaban-worthy offenses, regulations about bribes and wages reporting, and more had all been rewritten and set up. She'd prepared pages upon pages of documents---both new and updated legislature. Percy read over some of it as they began their emergency session. The 14 people there already seemed to be familiar with the material, leading Percy to believe that Alicia had had this planned for a while now.

  One day in the library, Hermione and Percy strike up a comfortable friendship. As they grow closer, their secrets grow deeper. How far will this unlikely pair go to keep the other's confidences? Only time will tell. Hermione/Percy Friendship to start. Canon to start, but will deviate. COMPLETE. Sequel now in progress: An Inch To The Left.
