Super awesome production of them expanding on the Wizarding World. [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpNp8WdQOoo]]

Even if you don't like the plot, the special effects are very cool.


** Very nice effects, massively boring.

** That was pretty cool.

The smoke thing was like from the movie, is that supposed to be Apparition?

Edit: guess not, they Apparate at the end and there's no smoke. So how do you explain that thing?

*** Not a clue. I mean, the could have stolen the smoke Apparition from Death Eaters in the movie- a sort of modified form. But honestly, no clue.

*** It could also be the difference between regular apparition and side-along?
