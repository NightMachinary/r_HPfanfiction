I lost my downloaded library of books due to a backup failure on my phone and now I'm trying to rebuild and find new stories.

I prefer Harry-centric stories during his time at school.

My favorite pairing is Harry/Daphne although I will typically read most non-slash stories (slash is okay to have in story, but I prefer it to be background characters.)

Stories with strong world building and diving into the mechanics of magic are my favorites, especially fields we don't normally get to dive into.

Even clich√©d stories are fine if it's written well, if there's bashing I expect more than just Dumbledore bad or whatever.

Au is fine as is time travel and humorous stories. I'm hesitant to read many crossovers, but I take them on a case by case basis.

I vastly prefer in progress stories or completed works. If the author updates regularly, although infrequently it's fine. I just don't have the heart to get sucked into abandoned or hiatused stories anymore.

Finally FFN is my preferred site mainly due to my app not being compatible with other sources. Although with a bit more effort I can download them and then have them narrated for me.
