*Summary*:

FINDING MAE | Madeleine Rose Potter was a mediocre witch. Of this, she was certain.

"Of course, you're not your parents. You're so much more."

-

Wattpad? /Yes,/ Wattpad. Before you immediately right the story off because of the site it was posted on, I suggest you at least give it a try. You won't be disappointed *if you're a fan of OC stories.*

The fic follows Madeleine Potter who's the older sister of Harry, but *she has her own storyline* separate from the main plot.

She's a *Hufflepuff* who's best friends with Cedric Diggory and another OC named Beatris. (Beatris is an amazing OC on her own.)

The fic begins at the start of POA and ends in OOTP. You may think it's odd that the story ends before the actual end of the real series, but *it concludes when her character arc does*.

There is romance in it, but it's *not the gross kind of wish-fulfillment romance* you often see in OC fics. The romance is messy, realistic, and anything but perfect. Her romantic interest is George Weasley if you're wondering.

However, I wouldn't say romance is the main plot of the story. (It is relevant, but so much more happens.)

If you like *morally gray Slytherin characters*, then this fic has a great one: Sebastion Nott. I don't want to spoil the plot, but he is a very important character in the story. He's Theodore Nott's older brother, and his character arc is just as prominent as Madeleine's.

It's *not a fix-it* fic. The main plot is going on in the background, but her presence does cause some changes later on in the story.

She has a *beautiful character arc* that really shows her growth as a person and witch.

Overall, it's the *best OC HP fanfic* I have ever read, and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys OC stories.

*The author just posted the epilogue yesterday, so no need to worry about a dead fic. I'm not sure about the exact word count, but it does have 70+ chapters.*

Warning: There is sexual assault towards the end, but it's not graphic or explicit.
