Like just imagine, Ron and Harry, showing up at Hogwarts and finding the kitchens. The house-elves would show them the basics, and I feel like they'd get super into it and hide it from Hermione. Then, after Ron and the Twins rescue Harry, they learn some stuff at the Burrow from Molly... And obviously, Molly (queen) after years of practice, no longer needs recipes- she just eyeballs it, so she teaches Harry and Ron to make food this way too. Eventually, they come up with the perfect brownie batter, but they need a consistent recipe and exact proportions for their mini-bakery at Hogwarts (they make loads of money), which is where Hermione comes in... Jesus, someone needs to write this.

"Thank you. Ron and I found that the concentrated hydrocyanic acid from all the bitter almonds really pulls the whole ting together. We created it just for you."

Yeah, that works too. Could have gone with a strychnine'd apple, but I doubt either man would have appreciated the reference. And it's not much of a culinary masterpiece.

** linkao3(12805206) has half of that. It was inspired by that tumblr post that made rounds of "what if Gordon Ramsey taught Potions?".\\
He gets the potions gig, and eventually there's a Hogwarts editiion of Master Chef Junior, where Ron competes. This takes up the first half, but it gets plenty dark with the war. Several wel developed OCs because contest.

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

** But why would they hide it from Hermione? The only thing that comes to my mind is her disapproval of house elves being owned, but that doesn't really make sense when she doesn't have an opinion about them yet.

*** [[/u/InterminableSnowman][u/InterminableSnowman]] suggested that they wanted a hobby for themselves, which makes sense- it would be nice to have something that's just theirs. Originally, I was just thinking embarrasment- I can see Harry and Ron nerding out about baking, etc. and not wanting Hermione to know.

*** Hermione is a bit overbearing and likes knowing everything about everything. They decide to hide it because they're worried she'll read up on baking and talk their ears off, ruining a fun hobby for them. Whether or not they're right can be left up to the fic.
