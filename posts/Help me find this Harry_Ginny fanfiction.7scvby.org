Hello! I've been searching for a harry/ginny fanfiction (honestly I thought it was part of the original series) that I believe takes place during harry's 5th or 6th year. Harry is at the burrow drinking tea in the middle of the night & ginny comes down and they start talking. Ginny tries to get harry to admit that it's not fair everything that's happening to him/the burden. Finally, he admits "it's not fair" & she says something like "of course it isn't" before going back upstairs. Help??


** Do you remember anything else? Back in my Harry/Ginny reading days, I remember that happening in many fics

#+begin_quote
  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.
