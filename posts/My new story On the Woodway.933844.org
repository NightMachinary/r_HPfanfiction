Hello everyone! It has taken me just under a year, but I've written a new story, and I thought I'd share it here.

This is the sequel to my previous story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12631584/1/Driving-Miss-Weasley][Driving Miss Weasley]], which is a fun short story (25k words). I suggest you treat yourself and read that first.

This one is called On the Woodway. It's more than twice as long, and it's a murder mystery. Summary: A murder case at Hogwarts disturbs an otherwise peaceful summer, and Head Auror Harry Potter struggles to hide a dark secret. Old foes regroup as Kingsley Shacklebolt's Ministry hangs by a thread. Harry quickly discovers that the price he has to pay for a normal life is far greater than he ever could have imagined.

There are 13 chapters in total, and I'll upload them over the course of the next month (or two). As always, please tell me what you think! Critique is always very welcome.

  It should have been a simple task. Escort Ginny Weasley to her Quidditch match. But it all changes when Harry Potter rents the wrong car. What started out as a simple road trip between two friends and past lovers quickly turns into a hellish game of cat and mouse, and Harry and Ginny find themselves running away from a mysterious and deadly group of mercenaries.

** Is "Driving Miss Weasley" required reading in order to understand "On the Woodway?"

*** Good question. I think it can work well if you haven't read it, but keep in mind that some characters, events, etc. won't have the same amount of exposition and explanation as they normally would, were it a standalone. Personally, I'd say give it a shot if you want to!
