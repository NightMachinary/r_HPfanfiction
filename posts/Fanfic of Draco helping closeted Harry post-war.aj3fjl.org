I'm hoping someone might be able to help me find this fanfic, it's quite an old one - made sometime before 2014.

​

It's set postwar and Draco is out of the closet with a reputation as a 'player' and he runs into Harry one evening who is broken and lonely after the war. He takes Harry back to his house & slowly helps him rebuild who he is. Harry eventually comes out to Draco.

​

I remember one specific part where Draco takes Harry hunting with a friend and Harry gets jealous of their flirting.

​

Does this sound familiar to anyone? It was a fairly NSFW fic too, I can't remember how graphic but it definitely contained some explicit stuff.


** Was it eventually a Drarry fic?

Might try [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] :)
