I don't want to see your 'oks' 'good reads' or 'really enjoyed', I want your heart thumping, nail biting, shockingly good fanfics, any type of genre. I want be on the edge of my seat reading every word! :D

This is mine [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/18/On-the-Way-to-Greatness]], but it hasn't been updated in a forever amount of time. So HPF, your ball

Edit: Fantastic work everyone, these are some simply awesome fics :D


** One that immediately comes to mind, for me, is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] by kayly silverstorm. It's devastatingly good, but bring tissues.

*** Hey, bet you didn't expect to get replies on this comment 4 months later. But I just read chapter one of The Lie I've Lived and really didn't like it much at all. Is it more of the same, or does it actually get better?

My problems with it: Harry's "film noir" internal monologue crashes with his 13-year-old personality multiple times, and I don't think the author pulls it off at all. Him being fantastic as chaser without ever playing it is /so/ Gary Stu. Oh and the line "I considered the possibility that he wasn't going to end up a queer after all?" rubbed me all sorts of wrong ways. So, what do you think? Are these issues jbern gets better at with time, or am I going to continue to be dissatisfied?

If you have the time to answer me I'd be grateful :)

*** "Turn Me Loose: A Harry Potter Adventure" is funny case - it is sequel to story that I immediately disliked and was unable to reach third chapter - but it may be read as great standalone story (includes probably the most unexpected use for Patronus).

** The Alexandra Quick Series by Inverarity This series can only be considered Harry Potter fanfiction in so far as it takes place in the same universe, using the same system of magic. It involves no characters from Harry Potter (although it does include historical discussion of Voldemort and the Second War) and it takes place in America. It is however, hands down, the best thing I've ever read online. The American Wizarding world is exquisitely developed, with its own cultural tensions and deep seated flaws. The characters are also amazingly well developed, especially as the series moves forward. I discovered this series a little over a week ago, and have since read through all four books..twice. I really can't recommend it highly enough.\\
Book 1: Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle]] Book 2:Alexandra Quick and the Lands Below [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4684861/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Lands-Below]] Book 3: Alexandra Quick and the Deathly Regiment [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784632/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Deathly-Regiment]] Book 4: Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7689884/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Stars-Above]]

** "The Perils of Innocence" by avidbeader

link: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/The-Perils-of-Innocence]]

Warning: WIP, currently updates are once a month (story reached 16 chapters, with the Letters appearing in 11). It will take years to see this story finished (assuming that it will not be abandoned)

Official summary:

#+begin_quote
  In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day.
#+end_quote

Harry meets with Hermione and Dean before starting Hogwarts, they are able to have some control over their magic (bonus points for this happening in way that is not blatantly ridiculous). Big focus on non-magicals and their reaction to magic. Characters behaving in way that may be explained without "because plot needs this", there is no bashing or turning characters into caricatures.

Quotes are from author, received by PMs

#+begin_quote
  Overall the conflict will be driven by the general stupidity of pureblood society, though Voldemort will certainly be around.
#+end_quote

(...)

#+begin_quote
  my general outline is for four installments covering the seven years and this first installment could run 40 chapters if I'm not careful
#+end_quote

(...)

#+begin_quote
  I don't want the kids to become super-powered
#+end_quote

(...)

#+begin_quote
  I'm glad you appreciate the not-perfect Grangers. I began to get rather sick of them just stepping into the role of Harry's semi-adopted parents with almost zero conflict that we see in so many H/Hr fics.
#+end_quote

(...)

#+begin_quote
  Exactly. The "Dumbledore is pure EEEEE-VIL" thing can be entertaining if the writer approaches it correctly, but all too often the writer just follows the clich√© it's become. I hope to write all of my characters as realistic (well, allowing for the magic thing and all :P ).

  I do intend for the goblins to be independent. They may very well end up helping the Trio, but I would want to back that up with some very good reasons or motivation.
#+end_quote

(...)

#+begin_quote
  I hope to do to Malfoy and other characters what I've done so far, which is mainly avoid caricaturing them. Malfoy will certainly start out as his usual bullying self, but the future is wide open.
#+end_quote

Author usually responds to reviews, beta-like fixes are welcomed and used.

BTW, I would welcome recommendations for similar stories.

** Gravidy apparently took their work off of fanfiction, but [[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ly9zzkw8f981ujk/Bt40VquHyu][God of the Lost]] can still be accessed courtesy of a fan who put the PDFs of the fics they had up on dropbox, and even though the fic is incomplete and forever will be, it was one hell of a gorgeous piece of work.

I kept this fic on my bookmarks for three straight years hoping that the author would come back and finish it, but alas, it wasn't meant to be. Still, the unfinished version is brilliant and I wanted to share.

The seventh year at Hogwarts from Neville Longbottom's point of view. A tale of Neville becoming a badass, and of many a peripeteia the students faced while the trio were out camping. In-universe.

--------------

*"Draco Malfoy, the Amazing Bouncing... Rat."*

/(the author took it down, so out of respect for their decision I won't be linking it, but it's */possible** to dig up. It's long-ish, don't fall for sites that only have one chapter and say "that's all").* Malfoy's previously unseen features come to light when he is accidentally turned into a rat and adopted by Ron. Plus a very convincing (hetero) pairing.

Copy of AN:

#+begin_quote
  I've read many stories about Hermione being 'caught' as a traitor and everyone turning against her. This story was inspired from a particularly bad 'Hermione is caught with the Dark Mark' fanfic. Most of the time, we're simply told that all of Hermione's friends turned against her without being told why they're so quick to believe badly of her or being shown them having any doubts whatsoever on her guilt, and the results seems a little far-stretched. It's usually because the author needs Hermione to be ostracized in order to drive the plot and the characters have to be prevented from thinking too much about it at all costs.

  This is not intended to disparage the well-written betrayal stories, of course, but I had to write a response. I wanted to explore the nature of betrayal in a more realistic manner. It's not simple. One doesn't just switch from like to hate in a heartbeat. It's much more painful and dirty than that. There are reasons to doubt anyone, but that's entirely different from writing them off.

  The second main reason I wrote this was that I felt Harry often got the short end of the stick in these types of stories. Hermione's loyalty to Harry is rarely called into question. The reverse, however, is not true. Apparently, Harry will drop Hermione like a bad habit without even a second thought if he believes she has become evil. I hate that. I believe that despite his trust issues once Harry Potter becomes your friend, he's your friend for life. He won't just give up on you and leave you to rot. His intense loyalty to Hagrid, Sirius, and others leaves no doubt in my mind on that score. Why would Hermione be any different?
