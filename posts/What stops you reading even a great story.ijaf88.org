** If I'm not invested in the main characters, I am not going to read it. You could write the most brilliant story about the Weasley twins, Snape and Malfoy (or, for example in the ME fandom: Kaidan, Jacob, Thane and Vega), and I still wouldn't want to read it, even if everyone here and in the reviews says that it is the best piece of literature in existence and it gets a Nobel price.

I don't read fanfiction for an enlightening experience, I read it to experience more of the characters I've liked.

**** Luna would be the best example here. Absolutely brilliant side character, but if you make her the main character you have to make her less Luna (or a seer), else it'd be completely unbelievable that anyone would want to spend time with what's basically a magical "5G causes Corona, Bill Gates wants to infect everyone, Lizard people run the government" person.

** Bad grammar and no good paragraphing, it bothers me so much to have a wall of text. Just nope. Also when kids are op without any good back story or explanation, sometimes I can just ignore it if it's not something brought up often, but if it's constant then eughhhh.

A recent one made me nope out first chapter because of the sudden OOC with no good lead up to the change, just pansy talking to Harry and him listening earnestly, as if he no longer cared about house rivalry or previous attitudes.

**** To be fair, he burned Quirrel in a 1v1, so under specific circumstances he can actually do it.

** So I really hit the back button if the characters feel too out of character especially if there's no explanation to how they got there. If Snape is a darling without explanation, Molly is a rabid money-hungry user and Ron is an idiot that only likes Harry for his fame and own benefit. It feels like character assassination and I withdraw a bit psychologically. Well done on someone writing it, but not for me.

Oh, and the worst - if a fic uses all the worst tropes of sexual assault, especially if they're stereotypes that are so harmful in real life, eg a victim secretly wanting it and participating because after the assault begins, they really?? Like?? It??

:( no, please.

I might be controversial for not opposing people that write content regarding trauma and assault (I don't know what you've been through, just tag it so everyone stays happy and healthy). But when I see victim blaming stuff eroticised, I just - oof, I hope you're well, I'm ducking out.

**** Yet she is supremely hypocritical when she victim blames Sirius for being illegally incarcerated in hell on earth for a decade, and says that Harry has her when she did not do anything about the Dursleys.

And then there's her reality denial when she tries to keep Harry out of the loop despite him having faced Voldemort more often than anyone else in the room and him being actively targeted. If the Order had just allowed Sirius to tell Harry that Dumbledore wants a prophecy from the DoM, half the drama from that year could have been avoided.

She wants to keep her children out? Fine. But for Harry that attitude borders on delusion.

** -Good Snape.

-Different age than canon of main characters(weird one I know).

-Alive James and Lily.

-Severitus.

-Harmony.

-Too much muggle integration.

-Time travel(other than the 'Closed Loop' like the third year).

-Harry in different house(the only one I can take is Ravenclaw, maybe).

-Harry in different school.

-Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived and Not-Boy-Who-Lived.

-Neville as best friend instead of Ron.

-OC main character.

-Actually, anyone other than Harry as main character.

-Crossovers(I've tried, but I've found that I just don't like crossovers no matter which fandom)

-Harry without glasses.
