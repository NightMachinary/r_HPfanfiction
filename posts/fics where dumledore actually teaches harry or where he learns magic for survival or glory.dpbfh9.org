i have read

linkffn(*The Mysteries of Magic) and* linkffn(*Magicks of the Arcane)*

was hoping for something more along those lines rather than harry being the heir to everyone and everthing and being super powerful and rich because who the hell cares for character growth

i have no problem with the family magiks and houses tropes as long as they are done properly. my favourite explanation for bloodlines and stuff come from linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12101842/1/What-s-a-Little-Death-between-friends][What's a Little Death between friends?]])
