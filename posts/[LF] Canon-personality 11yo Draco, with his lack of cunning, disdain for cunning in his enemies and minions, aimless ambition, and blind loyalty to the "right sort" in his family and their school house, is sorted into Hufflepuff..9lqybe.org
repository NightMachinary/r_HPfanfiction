I'm looking for good, serious examinations of Draco developing in a world where he isn't immersed 24/7 in the Slytherin echo chamber, but crack fics (well-done and sloppily silly alike) are welcome.

The hat would presumably need to overcome the "not +Slytherin+Hufflepuff" request, but I've seen and enjoyed fics where the hat took a hard line on "You DON'T belong in House X, might I recommend House Y?"

  For a thousand years the Sorting Hat has put students where they fit best. Only a handful of times throughout history has it ever been said the Hat picked wrongly. In the year of 1991, that's the only thing people were saying. On the one-thousandth-and-one year of Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat decided to change things around. Pity it didn't tell anyone beforehand.

Hufflepuff was also about fair play, and I don't see "You are next Mudbloods" go down well with that. Slytherin might be about cunning, but all Death Eaters would still end up there because they fit the other houses even less.

Dumb kids can have ambitions too, after all. But because they were quiet kids compared to Malfoy, Harry, and thus the readers, only see them as dumb bookends.

#+end_quote

Don't know where you got "civility". What I've got is "aggressive heroism" --- standing up for what is right, defending your values. Someone like Grindelwald and, if he sufficiently believes in blood-purism, yes, Draco, could fit in there on the basis that they do fight for their beliefs... never mind that those beliefs are villainous.

I also don't think a blood-purist Ravenclaw is so absurd. Perhaps he wouldn't believe in the literal "mixing blood makes the magic weaker" thing (although Ravenclaw is as much about learning accepted lore as finding out new things...), but he could still believe in the absolute superiority of wizarding /culture/ and have a more "sociological" take on things --- believing that Muggle-born's Muggle upbringing pollutes wizarding society with backwards Muggle values and whatnot --- all things which /do/ factor into blood-purists' ideology.

********* Chivalry, as a medieval system, is perfect for blood purists, as oppression of the lower classes was extremely widespread during that time by the same people who were supposed to be chivalrous. Unless you're using chivalry in more contemporary sense as a general system of values, in which case you're dividing Hogwarts into a "good" house and a "bad" house, which is, as a storytelling tactic, incredibly dull, although JKR pulled it off.
