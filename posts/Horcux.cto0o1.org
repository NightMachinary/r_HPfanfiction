What if the sorting hat is a horcux. So here is the thing, the sorting hat as kind of faded into the background. Which so much going on which other magical objects we have seen in the wizarding world.

The hat as we know has the ability to sort students into houses by placing the hat on their head. From the hat to head contact it can see the attributes, traits and values the student favors. From that point it chooses the best suited house. This is some powerful magic, a lot more powerful than a single enchantment or two. There has to be a lot more to it's creation. Now the hat it's self was over 1,000 years old. It was just a normal hat (owned by Godric Gryffindor) made of a leather or suede material. You are going to tell me that this hat, made of everyday materials, had lasted over a thousand years?

Has anyone ever realized how life-like the hat is. It can hold an actual conversation, sing songs, has an immense knowledge, and can read students minds.

It is hard to assume the founders were able to put their spell on the hat so it would embody each of their values, where would that magic even begin. This would mean there may be around 5-6 spells ( each founders spell and probably some preservation magic). This seems way too complex and I feel that there is something a lot deeper to it. It is true that each founder put some type of magic into the hat but could it be that the founders went beyond what is deemed appropriate in order to secure the schools future. Is it possible the each founder extracted a piece of their soul and put it into the hat?

How else would a hat be able to preform on behalf of each founder so well? How else could have looked almost exactly like it had 1,000 years ago? Yes the founders had to commit murder to extract a piece of their soul, but who said it had to be human. It could have been a house elves for example. Yes it was dark magic but in those times there was little order in the magic world.

I know you are going to say,” but doesn't that mean the founders would have become immortal like Voldemort?” Rowena Ravenclaw was ill a long time before she died so it means she would have died anyway, but she still would have been tied to the hat because I don't think a horcux can protect you from an illness you already had before you made it. But when did the other founders die? How did they die? Where were they buried? No answers to any of those questions. These are the greatest witches and wizards of their age and nobody knows what happened to them? It is a little bit too far fetched for you to believe they could have created horcuxes but if you ask me, there is something not right around it.

Anyway the overall point I am trying to make is there is too much magic surrounding the sorting hat with too little explanation. Maybe it isn't a horcux but I believe it very well may be.
