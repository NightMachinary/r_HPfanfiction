** I read it a while ago, and I have no idea what you're talking about, so I presume that it doesn't play a major tole. Somebody who read it more recently might know for sure, though, in which case trust them.

** I think the general topic comes up occasionally as part of ritual magics in that fic, but... Not that precise way? I'd need to know more about what specifically bothers you in the scene to give a better answer.

*** What bothered me about the scene was how different and out of place the scene seemed in a fic that up to that point consisted of a manipulative, self serving Voldemort, some amount of politics and Harry being rebellious. I didn't mind the ritual part, just the sudden, mostly unexplained, shift in character of Voldemort. Who (as I remember) hadn't even mentioned the word love and then says it three times in a very short time span and seems very suddenly compassionate, a slightly more gradual shift that had been occurring, but none the less, it stood in stark contrast to how i had perceived Voldemort in the previous chapters.

**** Oh... I get what you mean now.

IIRC that chapter is around the time Voldemort takes an active interest in shaping Harry into ... err... I think explaining his goals would be sort of spoilery, but I think it makes more sense as time goes on?

***** Okay, thanks. That chapter seemed so unexplained to me and with such foreign characters I probably over reacted (for context it was like 5 i then morning with no sleep). Thinking about it now, I see the hints of Voldemort starting to increasingly use different more caring means to "manipulate" Harry. I think ill give it another attempt and read a bit further this time.

P.S. Read the rest of the chapter, at the end theres an AN where the author basically refuted my fears with it, so if I had just finished the chapter..... Oh well, I can know enjoy the story again.

** If I remember this right, this is harry taking about the pagan goddess they both worship. It happens when they are highly attuned to her during a solstice ritual.
