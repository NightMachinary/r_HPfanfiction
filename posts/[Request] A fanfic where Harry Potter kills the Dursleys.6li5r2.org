  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

*** This story is mostly satire in case you thought the description was entirely serious. Also, the narration in this story makes it worth it.

Here's a quote from the author: "I have no respect for anyone who reads this story. You're all idiots."

Edit: It's not just the narration, but rather the entire fucking writing style of the author is amazing.

Edit2: "Molly, why don't you go join your sons in Diagon Alley," said Dumbledore, a big fake smile on his face. "Nymphadora and I will explain to these girls the dangers of..." He searched around for a buzzword, "...unprotected lesbian premarital sex followed by a cannibalistic ritual abortion."

This is now in my top 5 humor stories of all time.
