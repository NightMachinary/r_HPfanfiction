***** I was thinking along the lines of a branch of mind magic.

One or more false personalities that you can dump emotions and learned habits into without running the risk of multiple personality disorder while simultaneously not affecting your actual personality.

A bit of spycraft magic developed specifically to prevent long term infiltrators from going native.

  Gilderoy Lockhart was a successful con man, but that's all he was. So how did he talk Dumbledore into hiring him? And why was he such a failure as a teacher that a bunch of twelve year olds could see through him? One shot.

** linkffn(4605681) - Snape is not an asshole, he is just that way to be able to pass as a spy. Same with Umbridge. But I don't think there's anything in it about been related to anyone.

** Sort of reminds me of linkao3(swung by seraphim) in Snape's asshole persona being a mask (he calls it "the bloody bat") but I don't think Snape is related to anyone in that fic.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.
