** A caveat on your search criteria: The 'pairings' checkbox element has only been in place for a year or so, thus most of the stories on ffnet won't have it used. A while before that there were only two spots for the primary characters, so it was often assumed to be the pairing, which is where you get all those summaries saying 'NOT SLASH' because the two primaries were Harry and Sirius, for instance.

*** Oh shoot. I did not know that. Well, take the ranking with a hefty grain of salt. Thanks for the info.

EDIT: I'm considering delete the post. Another user commented on how many authors on ffn.net don't bother using the pairing option. The numbers I collected might be representative of the site as a whole, but I don't think it's enough.

*** Even now that the pairing box exists, not many authors bother to use it.

There are far more than 871 Harry/Hermione fics. The actual number is measured in the thousands.

** Stupid Tom Felton making Draco a likable character. But I'm actually surprised Gabrielle didn't have more. I'm a Harry/Ginny guy myself but I feel like I've seen more than 17 Harry/Gabrielle's

*** Same here. Could be that some stories aren't tagged properly. Or maybe you've read them on a site other than ffn.net?

** I don't use the pairings button at all, and I have 3 Harry/Rowena fics posted. This suggests that I am 3/8ths of all posted fics of that pairing, which isn't true.
