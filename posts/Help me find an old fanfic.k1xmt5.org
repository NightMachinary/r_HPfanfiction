:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's been years since I thought of this fanfic and I lost the bookmark for it.

It was on fanfiction.net between 2006 and 2010. Harry ran away to Diagonal Alley after inflating Aunt Marge and got a job working in random shops. He also babysat for some muggles. The author stopped updating because his daughter was in the hospital. If you remember this, please help me find it!


** Is it “Realizations by Wishweaver” linkffn(1260679)?

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help? Additional Story Notes FYI: a. AU Summer before Fifth Year Fic, b. Not particularly fast paced.

  AU Summer before Fifth Year story. If you recognize it, I don't own it. Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What does he do since he's not supposed to contact his friends until he gets the all clear?
