Any fics that Harry has a life outside of Hogwarts and the Magical world?

The idea of Harry meeting up with some Muggle friends and going to a concert maybe, that is far from his usual personality in the Magical world would be fun.

/I had this thought whilst listening to my Dad's old 1985 12" of Dire Straits - Money for Nothing/
