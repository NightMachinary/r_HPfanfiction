*Hello, witches and wizards of Reddit!*

Are you looking for a group of passionate, dedicated fans who love Harry Potter? Have you always dreamed of an immersive experience of attending Hogwarts, casting spells, attending classes, playing some Quidditch, meet new friends and going on adventure? Do you want to build and tell a story of your own making in an immersive environment, and leave your own mark on the Wizarding World?

Well, this is your letter of acceptance to Model Hogwarts! Have a live chat with your professor in their office, or watch as quidditch game unfolds right before your eyes! Brew some Veritaserum, finish that essay on the Goblin Wars of 1812, and go stargazing up on the astronomy tower at night. For some more information please check out our [[http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki][wikia]]!

** *What's unique and awesome about Model Hogwarts:*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: whats-unique-and-awesome-about-model-hogwarts
   :END:
1) Everyone starts off as a First Year. Everyone gets to starts in the same classes and no one gets a shortcut to being a seventh year. This is awesome because everyone gets the same experiences! You and your class will become even closer because you all remember the time that exploded potion nearly shrunk all of your heads into pinpoints, and somehow you dramatically saved the day.

We are also unique in that we have some aspects of tabletop gaming present in the RP, including a robust Spell system that allows for learning and practicing spells, customizing your own spellbook, and allowing you to grow your character's magical ability through the use of a custom spell bot! On top of that we have a Stat system you can use to develop your character, plus special abilities and cool purchases you can make to tell your stories and grow your character within Model Hogwarts. Like many things in Model Hogwarts, much of these are optional but available for you to use if you want!

We also make it easy to graduate. Each year is 11 weeks long, with 2 weeks of summer in between, and no year is the same. Each one is filled with a variety of ideas, events, and classes you can take, along with an always changing and evolving narrative shaped by the players. But don't worry, unlike real school the classes are in no way an obligation, and if you'd rather not attend class events, or are unable too, you can still get to decide on what your character's class performance is like, regardless of your attendance.

2) You get to choose where you are sorted. We're not going to place you in Ravenclaw just to get an even number of students in each house (cough cough Pottermore). We want you to thrive where you'll do best, and find a social environment of like-minded students. Because of this, you get to choose your house, and once you do, a whole world of opportunity emerges. House parties, study sessions, Quidditch teams, and more are awaiting you, so throw on that Hufflepuff scarf and get ready to drink some butterbeer. Don't worry too, if you're not sure where you'd like to go, you can always ask the Sorting Hat to choose for you.

3) We're stable and well established, as we've recently passed our first year anniversary! This is great because you have the chance to leave your mark on Hogwarts in a long term environment. Want to be a Prefect? Want to start a gobstones club, or a writing club, or even a flesh-eating slugs fan club? Hey, we won't judge! Model Hogwarts is ripe with opportunities but still is developed enough to give you the structure to succeed. Want to develop a new system of magic or discover a secret room? Hey, we're game!

4) We have a number of custom bots made specifically for our server! Want to cast spells, practice them and know if they succeed? Want to train your characters stats? Want to practice reading tea leaves or tarot cards? Want to add to your character's chocolate frog collection? There are even bots that will allow you to participate in investigations and engaging plots! You can do all of that and more using the custom bots for Model Hogwarts!

5) We're welcoming to both new and experienced RPers. If you're new to RP it's okay! Model Hogwarts can get you started! We have a [[http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Roleplaying_Basics][detailed RP guide]] to give you some tips and tricks as you begin. Along with community RP, we also have staff lead plots and events frequently, so even if you're new to RP and shy, you'll have plenty of chances to join in on the fun!

6) We want /you/. We're not picking you from a bowl of applicants, you're picking /us/. So ask us your questions, and we'll try to help you. We want Model Hogwarts to be the best experience it can be, and provide students with as many opportunities as possible.

7) Were you a member of Model Hogwarts before, are you interested in returning? Well there have been many changes to the Model! We want to give our players the tools to tell the stories we want, and have had made numerous changes to help assist that. Our Spell Bot is brand new and you now receive 3 learn points a week that will always roll over, which means you will never miss out on learns again!

On top of that, the previous OOC Points system has been changed to Tokens, which allows you to purchase exciting items, interesting powers, personalize story prompts, exotic pets, useful plants, and much more! Everyone receives tokens every year, and can use them on purchases that will help you tell the story you want to tell.

*** *How to start:*
    :PROPERTIES:

1) [[https://discord.gg/56z6GMM][*Join the Discord!*]] This is where the magic is happening. Meet your classmates and professors, roleplay, go to classes, fight mysterious ghosts, and get lost in the library. You'll get a week of â€˜Hogwarts Summer Camp' where you can informally meet your peers in your year and explore the castle without all the annoying upper years.

2) [[http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki][Check out our wikia]] for more information about our classes, professors, and some existing characters!

3)[[http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_%26_Guidelines][Read our student handbook!]] In here you can find info, our code of conduct, and FAQs. Don't worry, if you have a question that isn't answered here, we'd be happy to answer it as well!

4) Take a peek at some of the classes we offer! Classes are drop-in, so even if you miss some you can still attend, but they're totally optional if you're more interested in roleplay! First years can currently attend the following classes:

Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Divination, Herbology, History of Magic, Path to Success in the Wizarding World, Potions, Transfiguration

Once you've reached third year you'll be able to diversify your interests with a variety of electives, as mentioned in the books and films! Currently these include:

Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Magical Theory, Muggle Studies

5) Please comment down below with any and all questions you have. We'd be happy to answer them! We can't wait to welcome you to our roleplaying community!

Also, thank you to the mods for allowing us to post.

*** Roleplaying is basically when you make a character of your own, and you can narrate their life at Hogwarts, and have them interact with other player characters! It's very similar to collaborative fanfiction, and we have a guide to help out people who are new to RP: [[https://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Roleplaying_Basics]]

As for the table top games aspect, if you want to cast a spell, you do it through a bot command and the bot will be able to tell you if you succeed or fail, and there are different things you can do to grow your character and increase your chance of casting successfully! It's a very simple system, more inspired by tabletop games than directly drawing from them, so you don't need any previous experience.

**** OKAY I made a DISCORD and I clicked invite! I also did read roleplay basics and I did read the student handbook just now. :) Basically it is just like writing a story except ONLY writing for my one main character and no other ones. :)

Also I want to ask please about "Stop OOC" command. I might have to use it later, depending on certain things in the game that might come up. And Dirigble Plums, too, is that a more extreme version of STOP OOC or is it the same? I might use that too, if like I don't know, a Death Eater player's character starts torturing mine or something. Or if someone gets all sexual harassy.

**** Oh! So it is like writing a story except interactive because other people are writing theirs too?

Well the tabletop does not sound too hard. I am not good at math so if there is lots of math I will use a calculator.

** I can't figure out how to post anything because even in #characters it says the chat is read only. I know they say to ask questions in #questions, but I don't have that either

Edit: someone please help me. I wrote a bunch of stuff out but can't figure out why it won't let me post when other people can do it

***** No problem! Sorry for the trouble, discord can be a little weird and we've had people with a similar situation before. We'll look into our bot auto-roles soon just to make sure there may not be something going weird with that.
