:END:
Hello! So I read a fanfiction that I didn't save or follow or add to my library or anything, and it's been flitting through my head, so I was hoping that any one of the wonderful people (or perhaps the creepy pedophiles) that are on here know the title.

In the book Harry is older than in cannon. He's in a clique with Cedric Diggory, Roger Davis, The Twins, and a few OCs. Harry has been sorted into Slytherin and does really well in his classes and as such, all the teachers fawn all over him. I think he's in fourth year (or maybe his third year) when his younger brother comes to Hogwarts. Everyone else is Cannon age besides Lily and James, but I think that they died and it is a possibility that the younger brother is Neville Longbottom. Don't remember really who Harry is raised by, but it is definitely not /just/ Remus Lupin and maybe... /maybe/ Sirius might be innocent but that detail is escaping me too.

Really this is all that I can give, but I hope someone knows a fanfiction that holds some semblance to what I described. If anyone can recommend a similar book that would also be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
