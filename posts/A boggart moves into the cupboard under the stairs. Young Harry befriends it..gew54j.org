** Forget shapeshifting. Legilimency! He doesn't have to change his body, he putters around with their perception a bit. Dursleys abuse? They think they are doing it. Harry just alters their perception to let them think they are doing it.

It could go even further. Harry shows up at Hogwarts, very jaded from all the legilimency, having seen what people fear and hope for. Then Peeves shows up. Senses a kinship with him and bam! Harry is now an apprentice to peeves. Learns how to do poltergeist stuff. Year three has Dementors, and they don't like him, since he's either a void area to them, or Peeves outranks them in the pecking order of spirits/wraiths. Maybe because he's sorta like them AND mortal, and they don't like that. Insert some Patronus stuff, and then Harry becomes super crack'd envoy of chaos. Legilimency, Hope, and Poltergeist?

Imagine funneling the Patronus effects through legilimency into say... Neville's parents. Or horcruxes.

Throw on some Spirit-Y name on it.

** Should Harry learn anything from it? e.g. psychology especially relating to fear, shapeshifting (latent metamorphmagus perhaps)?

*** I would love to see it with a shapeshifter Harry. As far as psychology goes, it might lead to him studying fear and learning how to manipulate it himself.

** Oh yes!

A harry who learns how to peer into others and learn their fears, has an affinity for mind magic and transfiguration, perhaps some form of metamorphosis since boggarts can shape shift.

** Harry was on his way to his cupboard when all of a sudden he saw his cupboard door move. Strange he thought he opened the door and all of a sudden this man in a cloak came out laughing he was sure he had seen him before after a few moments he was gone. " What's happening boy? " Came the voice of Uncle Vernon " Nothing " said Harry.

I don't know what happens next feel free to finish it. ðŸ’žâœ¨
