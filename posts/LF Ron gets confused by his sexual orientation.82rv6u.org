I thought about that he caught Hugo and his Boyfriend in the act, but didnt interupt them. Instead he would be to shocked to do anything and so he unintended had been a Voyeur. What he saw keeps coming back in his Mind and he finds himself getting turned on, however not by the fact that he saw his Son, but that he watched 2 Man love each other. So he has unintentional fantasies about Gays and himself having fun. To test himself, he enters a Gayclub, but after a short time he gets aroused by the couples of mating sessions and he even think about shagging the waiter (i lieave it to the author if he do it). In his devastation he confess Hermione about it, but he claims that he still loves her (what he really does. He just has a "new kind of interest"). Maybe Rons works in a Quidditchteam and is "suddenly" attracted by his teammates, or the captn and takes longer for change to get it out of the system in the Shower. Or he finds a Lover or two within the Team and they have a Threesome.

The same happenings but with Harry instead of Ron would also work.


** That's a very specific request, which means that it is unexceptionally unlikely for such a fic to exist. Your best bet at this point is to write it...

*** it can be splitted. So, it would be ok, if there is one, where he is in a Quidditchteam and BAM or any other Fic, he finds himself attracted to Men and is confused by it. But i prefer OC Men
