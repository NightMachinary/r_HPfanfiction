I've been mentally forming a story where Bruce starts out as a determined eleven year old and goes to Hogwarts at the same time as Harry. Over time, Bruce transforms into the Dark knight.

Does that sound interesting?

Are there any other FanFics that cover this?

And any interesting ideas for the story?


** Cross overs are a tricky thing and need to be thought through carefully. For example one of the things that makes Batman great is that he is not "super" in the sense many heros of his home universe are. By giving him magic you might be endangering that part of his character ( though it still may work in the confines of wizarding society wher having magic is nothing special).

Another possible problem is that Bruce is, most assuredly, American. What is the reason for him going to a British School?

I think it is possible that your story would be interesting, but you will have to do some pretty impressive canon-welding to make it work.

*** I think you are right.

Batman generally wins through planning, not because he is more powerful than his enemies. I will probably need to lower his power considerably.

Thank you for your suggestion.

**** It might work out better if the JLA send him after hearing about Voldemort (after his second rise maybe?) due to the fact that he is under-powered and uses just technology and MMA to get the job done.

You know, I think this can be an opportunity for a subversion of the "Hogwarts is primitive compared to American schools" cliche. Instead, have Bruce apply to Hogwarts because American magic schools are shit.

Though I'm not really interested in this kind of crossover.

** I think the best way to do this would be to "recreate" batman in British wizarding society. Have the Wayne's be a prominent light wizarding family that founded st mungos during the voldemort reign. Maybe voldemort is less overt and acts more from the shadows. Joe death eater killed Bruce's parents as they cut home through knockturn alley. Alfred is their well spoken house elf that raised Bruce for the last few years before Hogwarts.

Maybe there was no prophecy, so harry's parents don't die. Bruce is friends with Harry and crew at Hogwarts, but nothing huge happens. He learns magic, but he is obsessed with revenge. He runs away at some point to become awesome, and most things happen post Hogwarts.

While Bruce pretends to be the perfect pureblood Prince he goes around at night to do vigilante justice on the death eaters, crossing paths with auror harry potter, the only straight cop since Moody died. Adventures ensue. Female childhood friend/crush of bruce is on the wizangamot, and gets in danger since she tries to protect muggleborn and werewolf rights.

I'd read that story. But the fun of batman is the competent adult that isn't anything super special, but does everything he can to pursue justice that the law cant or won't. Its not a kid learning the basics at school, though showing some of that in a story would be fine (probably best as flashbacks though).

(Edit: I got excited about this idea now, someone write it for me!)

*** Yes! I really do want to recreate Batman with a more magical origin. I also came to the same realization that Alfred is pretty much a house elf. He even calls Bruce, "Master Wayne".

I definitely agree that the fun of batman is "the competent adult that isn't anything super special, but does everything he can to pursue justice that the law cant or won't". However, I can't imagine Voldemort being a threat against a /competent adult/. I mean comic Batman beats Superman.

Huh. I thought of something interesting.

Thank you so much for your comment, really inspirational.

Can I hit you up when I have something more... complete?

This is where you need to play with or tweak the HP work to your fic. Make voldemort more insidious. He is the BIG BAD, with plenty of minions. He orchestrates from the background, and always has a fall guy. No one ever sees him and lives, is he real or just the boogeyman? You have ready made mini bosses to overcome via the inner circle: The corrupt politician, Lucius Malfoy (whose son inherits the reins? Or is a turncoat spy for the good guys?). The crazy madwoman with a penchant for chaos, Bellatrix Lestrange. The "Poison" master who never leaves a trace, Severus Snape.

Maybe some other characters to add flavor: The corrupt Auror who takes bribes to let death eaters go free, Gawain Robards. The Auror captain with his hands tied, Kingsley Shacklebolt. The unspeakable with new tools/spells who doesn't ask many questions, Algie Croaker.

And that's just a few Canon characters off the top of my head. you can always make OCs too. Each mini boss leaves a clue to where or how Voldemort operates, leading Bruce and Harry ever deeper down the rabbit hole before they can finally chop off the head of the organization.

Who knows! Maybe there's horcruxes too if you want to keep the story going (didn't we kill this guy twice already? What's up with that!). ((Be careful with the horcruxes though, if they aren't done right they can ruin an AU story like this- would be better to leave them out than to force them in))

Because as awesome as batman is, he does a lot of detective work. There's stakeouts and mysteries and he is smart enough to figure it out, while having the tools/skills to do something about it too. Make your voldemort (and his inner circle minions) a criminal mastermind worthy to be hunted by The Batman!

Edit: and batman found superman's weakness, kryptonite. Eventually your batwizard will need to find voldemort's "kryptonite".

PS: batman needs to be a bat animagus. It's just too perfect.

** There's a lot of problems with this.

The most obvious is that Bruce Wayne is an American. Americans do not go to Hogwarts. They go to American wizarding schools.

Secondly, it'd be really easy to fall into the "Batgod" trap of having Bruce be competent to the point of ridiculousness and solve all of Harry's problems. Remember, "If you make Frodo a Jedi, you need to give Sauron a Death Star" and compensate by making all of the problems massively harder.

Ultimately, I am interested in the basic premise. Bruce Wayne is a detective. He'd be interesting in exploring the Wizarding world and discovering its secrets to use them to his advantage. I just can't come up with a way to make him British without just saying "fuck it", and I'd be /really/ worried about Batgod ruining your execution.

Also, as an afterthought, what good is Batman without his supporting cast?

EDIT: If you'd like someone to bounce ideas around with regarding this, or to beta read it, I'd be more than happy to help, since I do think it could be really compelling.

*** that's a great reply. my opinion is: hell yes make Frodo a jedi and have him fuck Sauron right the hell up. That jerk needs to have his lidless eye put out by a lightsaber and I know just the scrappy little hobbit to do it.

*** Squibs don't go to Hogwarts. Rowling said that they can't brew potions as well. Runes aren't used for magic, but even if you go with the fanon that they are, a Squib still wouldn't be able to use them, for the same reason he can't brew potions (/"There is always some element of wandwork necessary to make a potion (merely adding dead flies and asphodel to a pot hanging over a fire will give you nothing but nasty-tasting, not to mention poisonous, soup)/").

**** Well, yeah. But I bet Batman could sneak into the headmaster's office and add himself to the list. And who's to say he couldn't just shake a pixie over his potion instead of waving a wand around. Maybe he keeps a dozen different pixies to shake around in his nifty little expanded pouched BatUtility-Belt. Hell, maybe he overhears a conversation between Dumbledore and Hagrid about the fancy rock, steals it himself, eats it, and gains magic powers. I dunno. He's Batman, what can't he do? Or buy?

A lot. Especially when it comes to castles which muggles can't see or approach. Or magical mirrors. If you want to make him use magic, either turn him into a wizard, or make Alfred/Lucius wizards who make stuff for him. I can't stand those "muggles pwn wizards" stories, they're just so unrealistic.

As to those shaken pixies... read what Rowling said again. It's not about being a wizard, it's about channeling magic.

**** You could ascribe to the point of view that only what is seen or stated in the books counts as canon ( "death of the Author", pretty much). In such a case it would seem entirely possible that certain potions could be brewed even without magic.

But even then there are problems with the Squib!Bruce at Hogwarts idea, I think. Especially if you would go with the idea of him still being a kid at the beginning. Batman can do a lot and it is entirely possible he figures out where Hogwarts lies, fights through any anti muggle wards that play tricks on your mind ( he's got experience with "things that play tricks on your mind"), etc.

11-year old Bruce? He's not really there yet.

** If I was going to read a Batman/Harry Potter crossover, I would probably be most interested in one thing which I think you should seriously consider. Joker. Voldemort. Team Up. If Bats has magic, why no MR. J? It would help you keep out of "batgod" territory, as [[/u/Adekis]] stated could be a problem. If this happens, keep me posted! I'd love to give feedback on such a different idea :)

*** And see, I hate the idea of a Joker/Voldemort team-up because I think that the Joker is usually done poorly and pretentiously by people who think he's more important than he is. And I don't think he fits in very well with the Wizarding aesthetic. There are definitely characters I'd like to see though. For example, a muggle Luthor discovers the existence of a whole subset of metahumans with reality-bending powers. Think he'd take that lying down? He's going to research the hell out of that. Or the League of Shadows, for instance.

But it's worth noting that it'd be really hard to focus on any super-villains when you're in a boarding school in Scotland, unless you do something really dumb like making Cedric into Two-Face. No, I think it's better to just nerf Bruce, except for deductive prowess, and buff all of Voldemort's forces to compensate for having young Bat wizard on your team.
