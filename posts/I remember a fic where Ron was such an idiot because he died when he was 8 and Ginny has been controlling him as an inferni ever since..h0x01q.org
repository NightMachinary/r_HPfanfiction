***** You should ask for humor or crack recommendations (if no one has recently)! One of my go-tos is olivieblake's Real World: Hogwarts, in her Amortentia fic on ff dot net and also AO3.

And Emerald Ashes' Seventh Horcrux. And (short fic, but surefire for cheering up) try “Lessons with Hagrid” by NothingPretentious.

*** Nah Ron was Dumbledore. After his death, his soul traveled back in time thanks to magical experiments he created and parcticed at the ripe old age of three. His soul inhabited the stillborn body of young albus and brought it back to life.

Rons plan was to kill ginny before she was seven by causing an accident so she could not turn him into an inferi. To do so he needed to cosy up to Weasley family. His attempts at cosying up to the Weasleys is why they are his biggest supporters.

Sadly when he dueled Grindewald he did not realise a body switching ritual was going on at the background of the duel. After defeating him, Grindewald imprisoned Ron/Dumbledore in Nurmengard prison and went to shape Britain in his image of greater good.

Grindewald-wearing-Dumbleodres-body saw Rons brilliance and wanted to recuit him. Ron however refused. Furious, Grindewald started corrupting Ginny at a young age and introduced her to dark arts as a replacement. Ginny, however was nowhere near rons intellect. Compelled by jelousy and anger, Ginny kidnapped ron from his bed in the middle of the night and tied him to a slab of rock in the woods. She started to chant in eldritch tongued to remove rons soul from his body. She lost to the soul who fled back in time but she had turned her older brother into her very own flesh puppet.

***** I've only ever seen it in the description for one of two things:

1. Controversial pairings (Snape/Basically-Anyone, Draco/Harry, etc) - the description will specifically call it as "Don't like x/x pairing, don't read".
2. The fic is actually bad to the point of attracting more negative reviews than positive, and the author responds to that by calling out the negative reviewers.

In either case, at best it'll be "abandon all hope, ye who enter here".

  Something is 'wrong,' with Harry. He's hearing voices. or rather, a voice. Its telling him he's been on the wrong side since the beginning. Harry doesn't believe it. But for how long? Dark!Harry, eventual HP/LV slash. Don't like don't read. Complete with epilogue. Sequel up.

******** Honestly, for me his worst crime is leaving Haary repeatedly.

Once, is forgivable. People make mistakes.

One and he never returns is fine.

Leaving and being openly jealous on multiple occasions while also being a general prick to people on multiple occasions in a way that Hermione and Harry are not, and I just dislike him.

Yes Harry and Ron do stupid things, make mistakes, and they are nasty to people sometimes, but something about the way ron does it just rubs me the wrong way.

*************** I just would like to point out that, In half blood Prince, Hermione at one point sent evil birds to attack Ron, and repeatedly was grumpy with Harry because she was jealous of Ron being with lavender, all while Harry was stressed over Voldemort. She actively takes things out on Ron and Harry, too.

Also, Harry and Ron both refused to speak to Hermione for a very long time over Hermione telling McGonagall about the firebolt when it came as a highly suspicious package with no return address or anything. All 3 of them really do do this kind of petty BS, repeatedly.
