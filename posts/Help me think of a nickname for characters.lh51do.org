I desperately need someone to give me ideas for a Marauders style nickname for Ron and Ginny. I've got this snowball rolling in my fic and I can't stop it now. Help please!


** The Marauders' nicknames were based off their animagus forms. Do you have thoughts on what animagus forms Ginny and Ron might have? Or by Marauder style nickname do you mean what the Marauders might have called them?

**** In that case, how old are Ginny and Ron when the Marauders meet them and how old are the Marauders? And also Harry's relationship with the Weasleys at first meeting as well and what he may have told the Marauders about Ron and Ginny.

If, say time travel was some how involved and teenagers marauders witnessed Ginny during the first summer Harry was there, I could see them calling her Butterdish" but I can't see older, more mature Marauders calling a kid that. But, assuming Lily has told James and Co. Muggle fairytales, I can see adult Marauders using "Little Red Ridinghood" as a possible nickname. If they met Ginny for the first time in Harry's 5th year, I can see firecracker as suggested by someone else being used by either young or old marauders.

For Ron, I can see the marauders giving him a mocking nickname based on his undying support for the Chudley Cannons or a more respectful one based on his skill in chess.

***** Little Red for Ginny sounds amazing. Ron's nickname would have to be "Loader" if it's mocking or "Knight" if it's respectful

** Well you could always go the typical root and name them something to do with their animagus forms (if you give them any) or based off their patronus. Personally I would give Ginny the nickname Firecracker

*** Eh, firecracker isn't biting enough for a British style nickname, it doesn't really take the piss like it's supposed to. They might call her a ‘Dementor' as she's a ginger with ‘no soul'.

With the Marauder style nickname, again you've kind of got to be careful. They are supposed to take the piss. I see too many authors try and make the names cool. Your nickname in general isn't supposed to be cool, its supposed to be ridiculous.

For instance, if Ginny's animagus form was a cheetah, the nickname might be ‘Miss Spots' If it's a larger bird, it might be ‘Miss Beaky' For an owl, ‘Miss Hooty' And for a songbird, like a chaffinch or a robin, it might be ‘Breakfast' or ‘Snack' or Miss Tweety.

I was just about to post this. She reminds me of every little girl with that nickname. Spitfire might work, too.

** A little more context would be good. Why do they need a nickname? You said you got a snowball rolling so what are some examples of nicknames you came up for other characters?

** always loved the idea of ron being the King, you've got the chess connection as well as the song from 5th year, plus a whole heap of elvis/mj jokes from the muggleborns
