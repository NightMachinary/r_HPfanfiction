Completed ones would be preferable, but I'm fascinated with the potential of these characters. Also preferably non-Cursed Child compliant.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]], linkffn(6432055): One of the better Draco fics, very much in his canon character.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** Have you read the series by Kerichi? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/322080/Kerichi]]

I think the main stories in the Scorpius/Rose universe are "Our little secret" "Our little secret: lost" and "The green Knight rises". Scorpius is almost a bit too ingenious in them, but he is not omnipotent like Harry is in some fanfics, so I thought it was ok. The stories are about how Scorpius and Rose accidentally fall in love with each other, their families reactions, and also Scorpius trying to wriggle his way out of his grandfather's grasp. It's very interesting imo because he genuinely loves both his parents and his grandparents, and while Draco has become very subdued following the wars, seemingly ashamed of his past behaviour and also trying to avoid thinking and talking about the past, Lucius has not yet given up grooming his grandson to be his new and improved heir.

** The Quietly series on Ao3. by starlightpeddlar. They are Scorbus centric but non CC, go through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Love the stories (think there are 4)
