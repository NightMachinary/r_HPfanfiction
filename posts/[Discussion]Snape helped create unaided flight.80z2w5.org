So as we all know, Snape created the spell /Levicorpus/, which lifts you up by your feet. This is, essentially, levitation applied to your feet, which is AFAIK impossible normally. My theory is that Voldemort flew using something similar to /levicorpus/ except for the whole body, using /levicorpus/ as a base he expanded upon. Thoughts?

Thats not true. quidditch through the ages mentions that levitation can be used like this but people weren't happy with only hovering a few feet above the ground and invented things like brooms and flying carpets to be able to actually fly without becoming birds.

The unaided flight has to be much more than levitation applied to the body.

*** welp, never read Quidditch Through the Ages. Oh well. Still this could be used in the many fics where levitating people actually /is/ impossible :p

although if you can levitate yourself then why did Harry try to levitate the whole side car in DH when it was falling?

**** The side car was loosing height and he was desperate. It probably seemed to be the most reasonable choice during those circumstances.

We also dont know how moving at high speed would affect his attempt to levitate himself. He probably doesn't know either.

*** Cool I've never seen that. Makes sense lol. Although if broomless flight is analogous to wandless magic then it ought to be a lot slower. I mean, Voldemort still used his wand, so why would broomless flight be as good as flight /with/ the aid?

** My take is that it's a partial transfiguration to gas melded somehow with Apparation. That's probably influenced by the film-version of Apparation turning people into morality-colored smoke.

*** So what, transfigure your innards to be gas that moves on its own? That sounds /really/ weird lol. Also I thought only the DEs got smoke-apparation? Haven't watched the movies in forever though so I'm probably wrong lol

**** It's also inspired by the image of Genies- billowing smoke from an oil lamp supporting an upper torso. Generally speaking, someone trying to fly is less likely to need their legs until they need to land. The actual description from book 7 is a trifle vague:

#+begin_quote
  And then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind, without broomstick or Thestral to hold him, his snakelike face gleaming out of the blackness, his white fingers raising his wand again
#+end_quote

So, was JKR being mostly poetic to describe the grace of Voldemort's flight, or was he literally a rolling cloud of black smoke, with only face and hands fully-formed as those parts were needed the most?

BTW - in the films, the Order travels in clouds of white smoke. Battle of the Ministry shows it best. There is a bit of evidence in the earlier films that someone fully Disapparating or Apparating leaves a little wisp of smoke at the center when they do it. That is all at the filmmaker's discretion, so it isn't strictly canon.

This reads disturbingly like a Dementor.
