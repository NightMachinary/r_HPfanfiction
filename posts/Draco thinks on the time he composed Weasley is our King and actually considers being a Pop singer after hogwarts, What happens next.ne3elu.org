** Draco came up with Weasley is our King in 1995. The Backstreet Boys reached international success between 1996 and 1997. Draco was absent from most activities other than curricular ones in 1996 through 1997. Coincidence? I think not.

** He decides to start a really cool rock band called Solence?

Seriously, the lead singer in some of the band's videos looks like a dead ringer for Draco Malfoy. It's weird.

*** I doubt a guy with pure blood ideals probably wouldn't accept a son with a muggle like job. But knowing he accepted Draco's wife, maybe he would be supportive.
