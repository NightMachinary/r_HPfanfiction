:END:
hey guys, so i'm looking for a specific fanfic that i really want to read again but i cannot find it anywhere.

in the fanfic harry dates this oc witch before the war but just before it he breaks up with her. then she moves to America and becomes a model. anyway majority of it is set years later when she has a fiance and ends up visiting London again and reconnecting with Harry and its about them rediscovering their feelings for each other. i really enjoyed this fanfic and really want to find it again but i ahve no idea where it went.

any help is greatly appreciated.
