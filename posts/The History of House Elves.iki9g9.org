Elves used to live in covens, holding great magic. They had to live in covens and build homes so they would be able to expend surplus magic to keep them from overflowing (elves on their own would succumb to this overflowing magic and ‘die', sending their magic back into the world)

The first elf to become partnered to wizardkind did so through a life debt. Having their life saved by a wizard, they asked the wizard how they could repay their debt. The wizard, being aware of the power the elf possessed, asked for the elf to become his partner in battle. The elf came to live with the wizard, being able to expend his magic into the wizard's home, and assisted the wizard in duels as well as full on battles during wartime.

News spread quickly of the duo and other wizard and witches went looking for the elven covens to get their own elf, disregarding the elves' independence. They quickly found themselves outmatched by the elves, who were unwilling to join them as they were quite happy in their coven.

One witch decided to take another route, managing to kidnap a baby elf and raise them in her household. The elf knew nothing of their parentage, and when they were old enough, the witch convinced the elf to sign a contract of sorts, one that would make sure they would remain bound to each other for life, and into the next one. The elf, regarding the with as their parent of sorts, readily agreed.

Other wizards and witches eventually heard the story about how the witch came about her own elf, and soon young elves were disappearing from covens. The elves were furious but dared not give chase, as they were unacquainted with the wizarding world.

The original wizard with his elf returned to the elf's coven around this time, having heard the rumour of young elves disappearing and getting raised in wizarding households. He decided to try and get the elves back to their families, by force if necessary.

However, since elves grow quickly and quite a few years had passed since the first kidnappings, most elves had already signed a contract with their family, being unable to betray them or disobey them, and as such being unable to return home.

The covens, distraught at the loss of their children, and unable to retrieve them back home, relocated, far away from wizardkind. It is unknown whether they even still live in this realm or have moved on even further.*

The once free elves disappeared from history and only the subservient elves remained. Popular in the duelling circles, laws were eventually put in place to keep the elves from participating in proper duels any longer, as only a small percentage of wizard and witches had elves in the first place.

As they were unable to participate in battle anymore, but still needed a way to practice their magic to keep from overflowing, elves were put at work in their households. Eventually, the moniker of Battle Elf (as they were called in the early days) made place for the now widely known House Elf.

The first generation of House Elves were forbidden to speak of their origins to their offspring, and as such their history became little more than a fairytale.

House Elves today are terrified of being freed as it would mean the loss of their home and their place to expend their magic. This is why a lot of free House Elves today reside at Hogwarts, as they are able to consider the castle their home and expend their surplus magic through her halls.

Perhaps the day might come when the House Elves become just elves once again, if only they dare to believe.

(*It is unknown what happened to the first wizard who partnered with an elf. It is thought he helped the elves move their covens before he himself passed away in obscurity.)

This is just a little idea that popped into my head. Very little is known about how House Elves came to be so this is just my take on it. Let me know what you think!


** It's beautiful!
