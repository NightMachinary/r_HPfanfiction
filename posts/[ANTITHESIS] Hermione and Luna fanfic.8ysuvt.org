A Trio of Tricksters: Eclipse the Past, Usurp the Future by The Woman Who Wrote (jesmalestiel)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11786856]]

The war ended, and then it didn't. Voldemort is gone but somehow Harry, Hermione and Luna ended up as Undesirables 1, 2 & 3. Sometimes it takes controlling the past to control the future. And they who control the present control the past.

She's made a deal to change history and save the one she loves the most. Now, she is back in a body five years younger than she should be, abused, orphaned and with a sentence to carry out, but with just one goal: kill Voldemort... and hopefully, see those she loves living a happily-ever-after. Travel-Time story. AU starting on GoF on both time lines. Luna/Hermione and several other pairings.

For one, Voldemort is dead and she is now something of a celebrity. For the other, she is alone and she is not liked. The two meet in an unpleasant way... what happens after? How can they cope with their new lives and the new bridges that will be built and those that will be burned? Who is Loony? But more importantly, who is Morgen? HG/LL. Rated M to be safe.

You guys should read this even though you dont ship HG/LL. These are really great fanfics.


** That "Tricksters" fic is weird: POC!Hermione, "look at all my LGBTQ queer tags" and worst of all making poor Harry asexual. Doesn't the poor guy already have more than enough shit going on in his life?! The kid dreamed of having a family and now people make him asexual just so that they can score points by having more non cis people in their "everyone is special" stories.

*** Hey now, being asexual aint like that. It doesnt mean she/he wont/doesnt want a family. Maybe it's important to the plot or simply a fact? The story is still just getting started so lets see then.

But it is still just a fanfic. I think we should just simply enjoy it. I like the fanfic because the dynamics of Lunar Harmony on this. They are like a family so thats plus points from me.

Of course it won't change his desire for a family. He will just have a pretty tough time to find a partner to do it with. That's why I feel it's like piling crap on a character who has enough shit to deal with. In contrast to what tumblrites belief... having a rare sexuality isn't cool or trendy, it usually comes with lots of problems and challenges... particularly if you lack sexual desire, which is pretty basic for almost all romantic relationships and intimacy that goes beyond "we're best buddies".
