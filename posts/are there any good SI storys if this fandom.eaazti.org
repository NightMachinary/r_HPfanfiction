I know there are a couple lockhart si's but they get way to religious and/or political its weird reading them

most of the others i found were with a female mc in the marauder era and focused mostly on romance so i had trouble relating to them or read like a translated chinese webnovel with different power tiers and magic system and overly cynical/dark characters like seriously those are 11 year olds talking like they are seasoned politicians

the only ones i really enjoyed were [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/umbrus-shade-the-incredibly-annoyed-ravenclaw-harry-potter-si.48980/][Umbrus Shade, The Incredibly Annoyed Ravenclaw [Harry Potter/SI]]] and a couple (nerfed)gamer fics that were abandoned after a couple chapters but seemed to be doing a good job of not making the mc too op

are there more like those ? timeline wise i dont really care when it takes places

no slash no fem!mc

thx


** Unless there's some masterpiece I've missed, the best Harry Potter SI fic /by far/ is What's Her Name in Hufflepuff linkffn(13041698)

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12982855/1/Accio-Butterflies][Accio Butterflies]] is one I enjoyed, and which is complete.

#+begin_quote
  SI tells Dumbledore, and then concentrates on studying and building a new life...

another one I enjoy is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/better-living-through-magic-harry-potter-si.756754/page-72#post-62771068][Better Living Through Magic]]

#+begin_quote
  SI is dropped in front of Dumbledore in the 1960s (before Marauders are 11) as a 11year old version of himself, timeskip 4 years of schooling where he has researched stuff and is kinda an OP artificer.

and a third one I follow would be [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/wizarding-works-a-harry-potter-si.57804/page-42#post-13360168][Wizarding Works]]

#+begin_quote
  SI is dropped in front of a orphanage, befriends Harry&co at Hogwarts, 'gets' potions, Animals like him and he takes care of Fluffy.

** Linkffn(Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal and Other Morals by mugglesftw) deserves mention. In which the SI is a teacher at Harry's primary school, and things escalate from there. Very well done all round, and not a Mary Sue in sight.

** I really like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11745900][Rose Petal Red]]. It has an overpowered protagonist and is tropy but I think the tropes work (most seen to exist for a story reason) and that it's well written. The beginning suffers a bit from canon following but things do off these rails come POA

*** I disagree. I think the issue is people who write this kind of fic tend to suffer from a surprising lack of imagination.

To address some of the critiques of the genre I've seen here and there. A lot of SI fics are fix fics, but it doesn't really have to be. They are fix fics because people choos to write them this way. It can't be that difficult to introduce new threats, or have the SI or someone else fuck something up and send the whole plot in a completely different direction from canon.

Most SI tend to be Mary Sues, but how hard is it to give flaws to the character? Especially when you write about yourself. Everyone has flaws.

Concerning your SI proficiency at magic, I see two possiblities. A 20 or 30 something inserted in Hogwarts is going to be poweerful as a wizard provided he puts some effort into it. This is because magic depends in huge part on knowledge, understanding and practice, and there's just no way someone like this is going to be beaten by most eleven year olds in terms of study habits, attention span, or simply experience to draw from. the alternative way would be to have your protag be an extremely lazy person who just doesn't want to put in more than minimal effort.

The most unoriginal, lazy, and boring fix fic is always one fuck up away from a very interresting story, at least in terms of plot.
