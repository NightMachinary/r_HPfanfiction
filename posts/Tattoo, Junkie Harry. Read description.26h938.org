*** You should probably bump it up in priority, I started that one a bit ago and it quickly became one of my favorites.

The writing in that story is at it's best during the ritual scenes. The author did / is doing a fantastic job of allowing you to feel a subtle vast sentience of magic during those scenes, which is still a relatively unique and young trope within the fandom.

**** I'll keep that in mind. So many fics on the to-read pile, so little time.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9225260/1/Revealing-Ink][Revealing Ink]] is a Tattoo/Rune design fourth year HP/DG fic.

From what I can remember, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5087671/1/Runic-Animagi][Runic Animagi]] is the fic you're looking for. /COMPLETE! AU! Post OoTP, Sixth Year Story. Harry decides to have a little fun after hearing the Prophecy as a death sentence and his life takes on a life of its own! Harry/Daphne, HP/DG!/ Harry gets high with Dobby as far as I know.

**** Haha awesome. I've looked through all my HP/DG and they're the only two of the kind I have on my favourites that are like that.

***** It doesn't have to be HP/DG but it is my favorite ship. If you do see any that isn't, thats good as well. Although HP/DG just makes it better :P

*** I didn't know this was a thing outside of some plot bunnies floating around in my head (alas, I'm no writer); thanks!

Revealing Ink is not in my taste at all, it's hitting my peeves when it comes to powerful!Harry fics one after the other with disturbing accuracy, just in the first couple dozen paragraphs, but Runic Animagi seems promising so far.

** [[http://afallenangel.net/kimberjingle/kindex.html][Kimberjingle]] has quite a few super powerful Harry stories, if memory serves correctly. There's one in specific, [[http://afallenangel.net/kimberjingle/itom.html][Tomorrow Will Come]], I believe, where Harry is into drugs. All of her stories are HP/DM.

*Edit:* Just realized you said HP/DG, not HP/DM. Whoops. Still, if you don't mind slash, Kimberjingle's fics have the elements you're looking for.
