** I could think of Blindness and For Love of Magic, both fics featuring Harry and his discovery of magic, though through different means and setups. Fair warning for For Love of Magic, as it contains a lot of smut and the later chapters include controversial themes and thoughts.

But nothing is ever that black and white. (Runes, Blood Magic, Parseltongue, Slytherin!Harry) (SEE NOTE 1st Chapter)

** Well, my story linkffn(The Coven of Albion) has some of this. Harry develops an intuition towards using magic to survive, and goes on to learn some specific skills from the goblins. But in my head canon it's not that goblins and elves and such use qualitatively different magic, so he's still learning spells from them that any other wizard technically could. They're just tailored to the mining and metalwork goblins tend to do. Hogwarts is still a chapter away though, so how this affects his schooling isn't there just yet.

** linkffn(The Perils of Innocence) has this. Basically Harry got dropped off at a children's heath facility at a young age by the Dursleys and he grows up with doctors who try to explain and develop methods for controlling his accidental magic. Hermione and Dean Thomas later show up at the facility too and they become the author's version of the golden trio when they attend Hogwarts together. Basically they develop a system of magic that's a lot more intuition and desire based (wishing to be safe when falling from a dangerous height and thus making the floor bouncy) and doesn't need a wand. Fic is incomplete but not abandoned and is written pretty well.

** *The Meaning of Mistletoe*

My absolute favourite HP fic series. This is one of four parts. Harry does magic his own way throughout the entirety of the series and does pretty shitty at hogwarts as a result. There's some really interesting magical happenings and a wonderful incorporation of music.

My favourite book is the third one.
