Hello my fellow fanfictioners. Get ready for a long ass post. I have a huge favor to ask, so feel free to comment or not. (I'm probably gonna post this in the more general fanfiction subreddit, but I'm much more active here, which is why I'm posting here first.)

I'm currently taking a mandatory college English class (RIP lmao) and I recently found out that the final project will be a 10 page research paper about ANYTHING we want (up to a certain extent). I decided that I should totally write something to do with fanfiction. I'm probably gonna focus on Harry Potter since that's my main fandom, and there is the most good content here (in my opinion), but if anyone wants to give me relevant info about other fandoms, I'd totally appreciate that. Just for reference, I'm pretty well versed in Teen Wolf, Supernatural, Sherlock, MCU, Game of Thrones and some others I probably can't think of right now. 

I'm most likely gonna be writing about “Why is fanfiction considered so ‘taboo' to the general public?” PLEASE NOTE THAT I WILL NOT BE TALKING ABOUT SMUT!!!!!! I will only be referencing fics that either have no romance at all, or have absolutely no sexual content within the romantic pairings. I will have to post parts of these on discussion board on Blackboard (for those of you who know what that is), and everyone in my class will be able to read it. So it has to be as factual and not “fangirly” as possible. I want to write a bomb ass paper about this, and prove to everyone that fanfiction is legit reading and should be considered as such. It shouldn't be looked down as much as it is. I have to find a way to write this without looking like a weirdo to my entire class.

I would really appreciate if you guys took the time to answer just one or two of my questions, or not, if you don't want to lol. But it would be super helpful. I have my own insight that I can write about, but I'd love to get other people's opinions as well.

1.  Why is it considered “weird" to write/read fan fiction?
2.  Why do you like to read/write fanfiction?
3.  What's so appealing about fanfiction?
4.  What is your favorite part of fanfiction or being in a fandom?
5.  What are some other words you've used, or seen used to describe fanfiction. Ex: “Original creative work"
6.  How long have you been reading or writing fan fiction?
7.  Do your family and friends know you read/write or is it something you keep private? If you keep it private, why do you think you do this?
8.  What fandoms do you write for?
9.  Why do you enjoy reading/writing fanfiction? Do you think it's “easier” than reading an original novel?
10. How do you choose what fanfics you read?
11. How much time does fanfiction take up for you?
12. What are some of you favorite or least favorite tropes?
13. What are some fics you think would have good content for me to use as examples in my paper? 

    1. Give me one shots that you think are incredibly written, or super long novel-length fics that you think are better examples of reading material than most books on the market. Good world-building fics are preferable. If anyone links some fics, I will take a look and then ask the author for permission to write about their fic. Because of that, I would appreciate authors that are still active and can give/deny me permission to use their fics.

Thanks for reading if you got to the end of here lmao. I'd love any contribution you'd be willing to make :)


** I'll see about going through and answering some of your questions later, but, I think something that would be interesting to add in a paper with such a topic is that AO3 won a Hugo Award for “Best Related Work” this year showing that fanfiction is recognized by more and more people as legitimate writing, which it definitely is.

** 1) I think a lot of fanfiction's bad reputation comes from the fact that a lot of early fanfiction is written by women with the purpose of putting two male main characters in a relationship. Star Trek is the earliest example of this from the modern era, with a lot of ff writers shipping Spock and Kirk.

2) I like to write fanfiction because it's good practice. I would like to write original fiction someday, but fanfiction is a good way to learn how to build up characters and plot without needing to create a whole framework of characters and universes on one's own. In addition, I like being able to subvert tropes frequently employed by other fanfictions in the same fandom (ie manipulative Dumbledore, political Slytherin house, etc), and love writing fics that defy the conventional expectations.

3) I mostly only read HP ff for a few reasons. For one, HP canon leaves out a lot of details that give ff writers a lot of freedom in how they choose to build their world. Secondly, HP canon is something I view as being very flawed, and like to see how alternate interpretations of course of events could go.

4) I mostly enjoy some of the meta-ness that comes about from fanfworks. There are entire fics that exist to defy the conventional norms around how fanfiction has been written. I like that the community now subverts tropes that came about from the subversion of canon material.

5) "Derivative fiction" is how I describe it when asked irl.

6) I started reading in December and started writing in April, so not very long. I did have a few experiences with fanfiction before that (namely HPMOR, A Very Potter Musical, and Oh God Not Again, though I only enjoy the latter two nowadays)

7) I am public about it. As someone who used to spend a lot of time gaming, I began showing off my fanfiction as proof to my family that I spend most of my time nowadays writing instead. In fact, several of my editors are long-time irl friends.

8) Harry Potter. I do have some vague plans for some EGS fiction, though I haven't felt any major need to branch out. At this point, I mostly only enjoy HP fanfiction because I am highly critical of canon yet have a lot of nostalgia for the series.

9) I like getting the instant feedback for posting new chapters. Posting a chpater before bed and waking up to twenty reviews is amazing feedback for my ADHD brain.

10) Recommendations from ff-centric discord, mostly. The discord server for this sub is nice and active, and a few fics have specific servers dedicated to them with general fic discussion and recommendation channels.

11) Most of it. It's a stress relief for me, so any time I need stress relief or have downtime, I either pull up a fanfiction on my reading list, or pull up Google docs and begind working on my next chapter.

12) I am a big fan of darker fics and interpretations of the characters, especially ones that explore heroes falling into darkness, especially if it's treated as a messed up thing by the fic. It's a guilty pleasure.

13) Prince of Slytherin is the one fic that I think needs to be mentioned, mostly due to the extreme amount of worldbuilding involved in said fic, along with the fact that it's dedicated itself heavily to subverting the usual expectations of fics (Such as the Weasley twins hating each other, good Lucius and Evil Narcissa, actual reasons for why certain events in canon take place, etc)

To a lesser Extent, DPaSW deserves a mention. This fic is extremely divisive, since Harry is a genuine manipulative bastard who is training several girls to effectively be child soldiers as well as eventual members of a harem, but it also plays with a lot of tropes, so manipulative Dumbledore is an actual antagonist with motivations beyond the shallow ones he's usually given, the usual Peggy Sue trope of "preserving the timeline" is defied with gusto, and the fact that there is a second time-traveller who is trying to keep things the same while Harry is trying to gain every advantage that he can puts an interesting spin on the time-travel angle.

** Why is it considered “weird" to write/read fan fiction?

-If I had to nail down one reason, I'd say it's likely considered "weird" due to a lack of understanding. By and large I'd say the majority of people haven't been SO into a fiction that they wanted to read or write something that wasn't the original works.

​

Why do you like to read/write fanfiction?

-I like to read it cause I enjoy the world. I'm not ready to leave the fictional world after finishing the book, or show, and subsequent re-reads or re-watches are slightly less magical. It helps recapture that first-time feeling.

-I like to write fic because I enjoy writing, and it takes a little of the work out of it by playing in this pre-existing world, though there are difficulties as well if you're trying to stick close to the source material while changing as little as possible. (I'm also not a very expressive person, but reading is one of those times where a gasp when something astonishing happens, or laugh out loud when it's something funny, and a part of me wants to be able to make other people do that with the words I write down.)

​

What's so appealing about fanfiction?

-The first thing I'd say would be a bit of what I said above, you get to return to the world with some of the same 'first-time' feelings.

-The second thing I think is just fun. If there was something you didn't like in the book, or something didn't pan out quite the way you wanted, then there's probably a fic that has explored that avenue.

​

What is your favorite part of fanfiction or being in a fandom?

-This is a difficult question. I think I could probably answer what I /don't/ like more than what I do.

-I just like reading the fics. Reading new stuff about these characters I like. I wouldn't necessarily say I super belong to the fandom. I read, and I write, but I don't necessarily participate in the fandom alongside other people, and to me that's a bit of a necessary part of being in a fandom.

​

What are some other words you've used, or seen used to describe fanfiction. Ex: “Original creative work"

-I have legit only seen it as fanfic, or fan works

​

How long have you been reading or writing fan fiction?

Reading for....jeez. 17 years maybe, no less than 14.

Writing for, almost as long I guess, though the time between the first attempt and second attempt was probably 7 years.

​

Do your family and friends know you read/write or is it something you keep private? If you keep it private, why do you think you do this?

-My immediate family knows I used to. My wife is the only one that knows I currently do, aside from one other friend.

-I keep it private because I find it embarrassing. That's the short answer. I don't think most of my family would understand, but not in a bad way? They'd be 100% fine with it, but I still keep in on the down-low. I think it's got something to do with how I'm not terribly expressive (as mentioned above), and how expressing such a deep interest in something makes me feel vulnerable. But that's a problem for some other time.

​

What fandoms do you write for?

-HP. Used to write for Bleach, Ah My Goddess, Full Metal Alchemist and Avatar, but just HP now.

​

Why do you enjoy reading/writing fanfiction? Do you think it's “easier” than reading an original novel?

-You have this question listed above already.

-To the second half, I think it's a little easier overall because you don't have to work to build the world in your head as much when you read, like you do with a new novel. On the technical side though, fics can be much harder to read because of the author's inexperience.

​

How do you choose what fanfics you read?

-I keep my eye out for recommendations. I tend to lurk most places, and usually someone will ask about something I'm looking for. Beyond that it usually only takes me the first part of the first chapter to know if I'll be making it through a fic. I have really high standards, and it kinda makes it a pain in the butt to find stuff I want to read.

​

How much time does fanfiction take up for you?

-I couldn't put an actual number on it. Couple hours a day on average, since there are some days where it's all I do.

​

What are some of you favorite or least favorite tropes?

-Man. What an excellent question.

Least: Hadrian. I'm pretty sure I'm using that right. Harry steamrolling through the world with this Deus Ex answer to his problems holds no excitement for me. I prefer realistic characterizations, and this style of wish-fulfillment doesn't really do it for me.

Most: I have a soft spot for soul bonds. Dunno why. Hard to find really great ones though. I also like abused Harry, which is terrible to actually write out, but it makes for some really honest and realistic character growth and friendships.

​

What are some fics you think would have good content for me to use as examples in my paper? 

-I don't think, with your criteria, that I have any fics that you could use. Every fic I read has romance.

​

Give me one shots that you think are incredibly written, or super long novel-length fics that you think are better examples of reading material than most books on the market. Good world-building fics are preferable. If anyone links some fics, I will take a look and then ask the author for permission to write about their fic. Because of that, I would appreciate authors that are still active and can give/deny me permission to use their fics.

-The Backwards with a Purpose series is pretty well done I think. Don't know if it fits your criteria, but it's got 3 separate books to it.

** 1.  Why is it considered “weird" to write/read fan fiction? I guess it's not the writing itself, but the being a huge fan of something. Just like being a nerd, being into stuff that's not mainstream, cross-dressing,... it's not mainstream. And a lot of fanfiction is really terribly written or has... debatable/disturbing plots and I guess people think of that (smut, non-con, harem stories, mpreg, genderbending,...) when they think of fanfiction and not of the novel-length briliantly written character study gems that are also out there... It would be interesting if you asked some people that are not into fanfiction this question and post the answer here
2.  Why do you like to read/write fanfiction? I don't really know. I just enjoy it. And sometimes I just think canon is missing something.
3.  What's so appealing about fanfiction? When you are a huge fan of something you just want/need more of it. And sometimes canon is not all that great and you feel the need to change it or have a fix-it. It's also like normal reading, but it doesn't take you as long to get into it because you already know and care for the characters. And escapism.
4.  What is your favorite part of fanfiction or being in a fandom? I just care about the stories and characters and I love writing.
5.  What are some other words you've used, or seen used to describe fanfiction. Ex: “Original creative work"
6.  How long have you been reading or writing fan fiction? 2009 according to FFN, perhaps a bit longer as a guest, so I'd say 2008
7.  Do your family and friends know you read/write or is it something you keep private? If you keep it private, why do you think you do this? I mostly keep it private - it's not a passion a lot of people share. If someone loves the show/books as well, I will talk about it with them, but why talk about it if someone eg hasn't even read Harry Potter
8.  What fandoms do you write for? Harry Potter, MCU, years ago for Kim Possible
9.  Why do you enjoy reading/writing fanfiction? Do you think it's “easier” than reading an original novel? I just love writing and get a lot of ideas while reading/watching, and don't have enough ideas/motivation for original texts. I think it's easier in the sense that it doesn't take you several chapters to actually care about the characters, you already do. And you don't have to invent a background story to round of your characters because you already have that. Sometimes it's just nice to further analyze and play with a character than starting one from scratch.
10. How do you choose what fanfics you read? I have a lot of shows and books I write, but for some reason not all of them make me want to read fanfiction. It's usually specific characters or tropes that get me into it. I love Snape (HP) and Loki (MCU) and at first it wasn't the whole books/movies that got me reading fanfiction, but only those characters I wanted to read more of. Then I usually read a certain trope with them. At the beginning (when I delve into a new fandom) I don't care so much about how the stories are written. But the older I get and the longer I am in a fandom the more requirements a story has to fulfill to satisfy. I don't read poorly written stories anymore, not even if the plot is good. If the chapters are under 2k words I'll assume the story is not great. Other than that, I search for my favorite characters and I usually prefer gen stories, as I find romance as a topic to explore rather dull and boring. Everyone does that.
11. How much time does fanfiction take up for you? Sometimes none, sometimes the whole week. Eg after watching Endgame it will be more or when I have nothing to do or am hooked on a long story. But other times I don't feel like reading or writing anything.
12. What are some of you favorite or least favorite tropes? I love time travel, what ifs, missing moments, character studies. I like well written romance but oftentimes those stories are only about getting two people together and don't offer much of a plot otherwise. I dislike stuff that is too far from canon or OOC, I don't like OC or self inserts, mpreg and changing the gender of the main character.
13. What are some fics you think would have good content for me to use as examples in my paper? There are sooo many. From the MCU, although that's not your focus, I like Beneath by Ninepen which is an excellent example of a character study that's excellently written and the exact opposite of all the stereotypes surrounding fanfiction. It has over 1.5M words by now, 203 chapters, over 5.000 reviews. For HP, I'd say Obscura Nox Animae is really well written, How to become an animagus is a bit shorter and very humerous. There are soooo many.
14. Give me one shots that you think are incredibly written, or super long novel-length fics that you think are better examples of reading material than most books on the market. Good world-building fics are preferable. If anyone links some fics, I will take a look and then ask the author for permission to write about their fic. Because of that, I would appreciate authors that are still active and can give/deny me permission to use their fics. There are also sooo many, it's hard to choose. I do love this one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12629736/1/Calibration]] It's a great missing moment.

** 1. Weirdness of fanfiction probably has much to do with its reputation for slash relationships or shipping in general. To me, the weirdness comes from seeing talented writers doing fanfiction when they clearly have the skill to do something of their own and become authors. Especially, if they have an elaborate AU going on. In Sherlock fandom, I actually saw a story that's no longer available in German, because it got published and I was so happy about it.
2. I suppose I am part of the reason why. Reading fanfiction really is easy. No need to get to know the characters, the setting is familiar, though I do like well written AU stories too. I call it the fast food of reading and often I feel like I don't have time and energy to read better than that. Not that I could do better in all the cases, with how talented some writers are.

edit: that 2 is supposed to be 9 but apparently reddit isn't having any of that.

** 1) A lot of people, I believe, conflate "fanfiction" with "freely published online and un-edited". A lot of fanfiction does fit that description, but not all. Many of Disney's movies are derivative works. And there are free stories online that are original. So there's an assumption about quality that isn't always true.
