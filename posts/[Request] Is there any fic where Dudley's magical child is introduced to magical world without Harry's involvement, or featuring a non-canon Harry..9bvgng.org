For example, Dudley's child is introduced to magical world as any other muggleborn would, by a professor of Hogwarts, either those who knew who Dursleys are not there or don't care about it.\\
As for Harry, he might be a prisoner of Azkaban, or a creature of legend like in Make a Wish, or moved on to another dimension, like in Black Comedy, basically a non-canon Harry.\\
It will be up to that child to pursue the leads of his/her illustrious uncle, a self discovery, like how in many fics Harry discovers his Potter/Evans heritage.


** I know that there are several, but the only one I can think of is /Betrayed/ linkffn(1291535). (Harry is in Azkaban and then exiles himself from wizarding world for many years.) There, however, the pursuit of the illustrius Harry is done by his actual daughter (who doesn't know her dad's identity), and you don't meet Dudley's witch daughter until much later in the story.

*** The fic is a bit dated, but would you recommend it/is it good?

**** It's kind of a toss up. For me it's a guilty pleasure that I read every so often when I've had a crappy day and want to read something that doesn't make me think much. It was also the second fic I ever read, so maybe I'm a bit sentimental about it.\\
Pros: Azkaban!Harry that's actually finished and is about more than revenge, a rather sensitive and interesting treatment of H's relationship with his kids, some quiet scenes with his old friends (who don't know him) where you can nicely feel his simmering resentment, an interesting attempt to portray the Ministry trying to whitewash their history.

Cons: Obviously a young writer who doesn't do complex emotions between a married couple well at all (but is better at kids' emotions), decent grammar and prose but nothing special, a "super magical object" that conveys way too much power, some of the canon adult characters' actions are not believable, a few chapters near the beginning that sum up several years of Harry's life but do so rather clumsily.

So I guess I'd recommend it, but not for when you want something really novel or challenging; it's more a rainy day pass time

**** Like any other Azkaban Harry fic, Starting and ending are cliches, victim and overpowered for no reason at all. But the discovery by his daughter is interesting.

** I really can't think of any that match your criteria. I know of several ones that have Harry as the intro person to the wizarding world, or as Paignion posted Betrayed by kateydidnt.

​

There is Uncle Harry by r-dude, it's not canon harry, but it shows a very interesting Harry/Dudley dynamic. There are also other fics with Harry introducing the kid, usually a girl, to the wizarding world.

​

Sorry, can't help you there.
