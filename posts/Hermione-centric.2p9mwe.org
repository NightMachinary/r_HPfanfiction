*** Seconding this. This is (in my opinion) lorien829's strongest story.

Some other ones worth reading:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127137/1/Palimpsest][Palimpsest]] by Larry Huss.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]] by jacobk
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/14/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Hermione Interlude]] by Perspicacity
- And, just to throw [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] for a (time)loop, I'll plug his [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/7/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][Witch Queen]] story here too. (While not to everyone's tastes, it's competent writing and though not Hermione's POV, it's nevertheless Hermione-centric.)

**** I'll heartily second Applied Cultural Anthropology. One of the only fics I've read that stays true to Hermione's essential character even as it gradually changes her goals and/or outlook.

** I really liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10516951/1/Hermione-Granger-And-The-Quest-For-Merlin-s-Blessing][Hermione Granger and the quest for Merlin's blessing]] for reason that are mostly spoilers so I'll let you enjoy it first :D

** There were two recent threads on the topic, to avoid rehashing:

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2i1r8c/request_all_things_hermione_granger/]]
- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/29uddz/hermiones_perspective/]]

Other than stories mentioned on those threads, there is a crossover, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8525251/][Effloresco Secundus]], which has Hermione reincarnated as Sakura Haruno from /Naruto/.

An interesting new and frequently updating story is [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] by Diane Castle, which is a non-magic AU where +Hogwarts+ Harworts is basically a school for James Bond film characters. Don't let the lack of magic deter you.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger had grown to dread the winter. The season seemed almost to have a grudge against her. And so as she and Ron flew from summer in Britain to winter in Australia to search for her parents, she had both old and new issues to resolve.

One-shot.
