Hey guys, im looking for Afanfics where Harry becomes a Dark Lord.\\
Im not saying something like just Dark or Indy Harry.\\
I want something where he REALLY becomes a dark lord,y'know, spreading terror, having followers, trying to destroy the government, mass murdering and things like this.\\
Preferable post DH.

No Slash or Fem Harry.\\
The fic; Dead Things was one of my favorites, i would love something like that, for those who don't know, in this story, Harry thinks that Voldemort was right to want to destroy the ministry, Hermione argues with him and says that she will bring changes, he then says he will give her a ten years time to try, ten years later the purge begins.


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630][The Sum of Their Parts]] by holdmybeer) does a wonderful job of showing realistically how Harry could become dark with the context of canon, and who his followers would be and the kind of terrorism someone like Harry would go for.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18605401][they say we are what we are]] by TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel) is an age swap for Harry and Tom Riddle. It's really interesting to see how similar and how different the two of them are.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** I've heard good things about Linkffn(The Nightmare Man), but couldn't stomach how evil he was being. He has absolutely zero redeeming qualities of any kind, he's just evil all the time, and to the nth degree.

*** That's a good one! I've read it multiple times. I was going to recommend but couldn't remember if it contained slash or not since Tiro usually write slash pairings.
