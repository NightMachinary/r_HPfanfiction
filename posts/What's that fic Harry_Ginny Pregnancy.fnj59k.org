:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic in the last year - It's set during DH but not canon. Ginny gets pregnant at Bill & Fleur's wedding and goes into hiding, ultimately has the baby. The only specific details I remember is Ginny's morning sickness is triggered by the smell of lemon cleaner (the same as Molly's) and the pregnancy test is positive because her hands glow.
