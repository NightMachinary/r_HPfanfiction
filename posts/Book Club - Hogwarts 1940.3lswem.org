The next fic will be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]]. This one's been recommended three times so far, so hopefully it should be a good read.

#+begin_quote
  The war in Europe and a trainload of muggle children, sent as evacuees to the safety of Hogsmeade, receive more attention in the village than events in the wizards' school. Familiar names wear younger faces. Acts of kindness bring their own punishment.

** Well, I tried reading the first 2 chapters but it was just... completely... boring. Much like Hogwarts 1835. Does it get any better down the line?

*** Speaking for the writer of the two stories... I can speak for him rather easily since I wrote them... Character development is what interests me. Other writers, or readers, may have different tastes. Which is why Baskin-Robbins stocks 57 flavors of ice cream.

**** Awesome! Thanks for writing them. I can't imagine the amount of research it took to get all the details for the muggle parts of the story.

***** Specific research for 1835 and 1940 took less time than you might suppose. In broad terms years of teaching history classes provided general preparation. I liked the idea that the wizarding community would face the same issues as the rest of the nation -- albeit with their own unique solutions.

*** It absolutely gets better as the story moves on, and as the all of the (many) OCs get developed. You also get to see more of the Hogwarts students. The main reason that I like this story is that it gives you the origin stories of many of the older characters - why they are like they are.

*** Yeah, I have trouble getting into stories that are too AU. Maybe ill have to try and give this one a shot at some point...

*** Yes. Responses to the survey indicated that most people who were interested in the book club would prefer it to last two weeks rather than a month.
