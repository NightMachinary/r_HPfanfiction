I love the idea of the Lord Potter-Black etc storyline but all the ones I've come across are either abandoned or so poorly written I can't get more than a few chapters in. Are there any good or even okay ones out there? Bonus points if his friends (i.e. Hermione, Neville, Luna) get in on the inheritance action or if it's not a Harry/Hermione fic (I'll still give those a chance though).


** Just curious, how do you see this happening?

They inherit whatever is theirs to inherit. Do you want them to secretly be founders' heirs or something?

*** That's usually how it happens yeah. I know its cliche but I love cliches. I did read one though where hermione decided to take the blood test as well and found out she was lupins long lost daughter. I'll have to try to find that one again because I dont remember what happens after that.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

** Black Sky is one I would recommend (tho it isn't 'really' surprise you are Lord-* inheritance! and more of growing up with it)

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.
