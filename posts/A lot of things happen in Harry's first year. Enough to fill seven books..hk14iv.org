** A Very Potter Musical does this, I suppose. The events of the 7 years and more are done in 3 years. Seeing Lupin and Umbridge interact is hilarious. As well as Quirrell and Bellatrix.

That will cause some scenes to become even more dubious. I mean, you can probably shoehorn the first 4 books into one (mysterious corridor, Slytherin's monster, Sirius escaped, TWT), but the later ones get very questionable. For example, whoever ends up giving Harry potioned candy is a child molester and not just a wannabe rapist.

The romances stop working since all you can realistically sell is puppy love. And the Hunt would destroy everyone's suspension of disbelief.

  One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FIVE MILLION HITS!
