Are there any decent young Dumbledore fics? Canon compliant, preferably.

Anything that fills in the gaps between Ariana's death and his duel with Grindelwald would be especially welcome.

Any fics concerning his early teaching years at Hogwarts?


** Unfortunately I don't know anything specifically in that genre, but if you haven't read [[http://www.letterblade.net/thirty-five_owls.html][Thirty-Five Owls]] I'd strongly recommend it. It's letters between Dumbledore and Grindelwald from the time Gellert is locked up in Nurmengard to Dumbledore's death. A little out of your requested era, but there's a lot of reminiscing so maybe you'll enjoy that.

The Last Straw is a one-shot I like quite a bit, set before Albus' intercession in Gellert's war.

  A chance encounter leads Dumbledore to finally make the decision to confront his demons. Or more specifically the one demon who started it all - Gellert Grindelwald. No slash!

*** Thanks, yes that was a good one! Wish there was a longer fic with build up to the duel with Grindelwald.

** This is definitely an angle that I always thought would be interesting, but never have I seen any fics.

*** Me too - I have some ideas myself so might try my hand at writing a fic. Was just interested to see if there was much out there.
