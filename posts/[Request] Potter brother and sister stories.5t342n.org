** There's one going on right now called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12201337/1/Red-Sorrow][Red Sorrow]]. It's a WIP and it's really fun to me, even though it can be VERY angsty at times. The angst pouring from the main characters can really overwhelm the story, but the plot itself has been fun. I've enjoyed how the wrinkles of just two different characters has changed the story (besides sister Potter, there is the son of Bellatrix). Author has done a good job of not necessarily changing all the events of the story, but still changing how those events unfold because of the introduction of those two characters. I haven't loved all the changes, and I certainly could see more than just some angst in all of the dialogue, but it's been a fun story to follow along to (used to update on near daily-basis but recently switched to a weekly thing).

*** I've read the first few chapters. Here are the things that annoy me the most. Do they improve in future chapters?

- Constantly uses "would/could/should /of/" instead of "would/could/should /have/"

- Gred and Forge

- Alternating every few words twinspeak

**** Surprisingly "Gred and Forge" is actually canon. "You haven't got a letter on yours. I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid --- we know we're called Gred and Forge."

**** The twinspeak and Gred and Forge definitely die down.

I can't off the top my head remember the would/could/should stuff, I do know the author does better at editing as the story goes along so maybe that's something that was caught.

** Strange Reflections is an interesting story where the potter family from another universe --where James and Lily survived all those years ago, and had time to make a little sister for Harry-- gets transported into the post-canon universe. But they're not what you'd expect...

Without the humbling experience of growing up in the Dursley's household, the other Harry /really/ believes he is the wizarding world's golden boy and can do nothing wrong, he even adopted Lockhart as a mentor for dealing with his fame.

However, beyond the main plot this is definitely a Harry/Hermione shipping fic so if that's not your cup of tea then you probably won't enjoy it.

The story is currently updating with a chapter every second day, always at the same time. I'm pretty sure that it's actually completed already.
