And by badly I mean full-on, frothing at the mouth, inconsolable rage. Cursing first and asking questions never, that kind of thing. Bonus points if he says "I don't care. He killed my mum." or something similar.


** linkffn(For Lack of a Bezoar)

He doesn't kill him though, if that was what you're looking for

Edit: Could someone tell me why Im being downvoted? I do recall that Harry was furious and almost killed Snape in this fanfic, I thought that's what was requested

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

** Honestly, that was always a major plot hole imo. Like Snape himself even recognizes he played a part in Lily's death (although he doesn't give a shit about James). But Harry's more bothered by Dumbledore, James being a teenage bully, etc.?

Snape's character just had so much plot armor by the end.

**** But in the books he initially only tried to save Lily, and even if he tried to save them he still was complicit in their deaths...and he doesn't fully renounce it to dumbledore...he makes it clear it's about Lily. There's no big, sweeping moment where he goes "this is horrific, I'm guilty, x" Like it's good Snape semi reformed, but Harry literally is like "let's give the former nazi a cookie even tho he had a role in his parents death"

Like I said, plot armor/JK had a complex about being bullied, imo, that Harry seems more bothered by Snape being bullied & having a shitty childhood than Snape literally joining the magic nazis and being complicit in his parents death.

***** You're asking him to be whitewashed. It is bad that he doesn't care about the loves of most others at this point, but that is what the redemption is about. It's remarkable that he even cares for Lily Potter at this point of time. They havent been friends for years. And yet he still cares enough to risk his life ('Dont kill me') to warn Dumbledore just because they had been friends once. He has a narrow view at this point. He's only mostly interested in the lives of his immediate circle, not of the general world. Pretty understandable, looking at his backstory.

#+end_quote

If you meant later, there is. 'only those I could not save' implies he takes responsibility for every life lost in the war he couldnt save. That's a bpretty sweeping statement. That is backed up by many of his actions, of course, including saving Lupin, a man he utterly hates, when he was specifically told not to risk his cover by Dumbledore. That's a lot of development from the guy who, mostly wanted the protection of the people he cared for.

He was fully reformed. The only thing that he's guilty of is being a dickbag teacher, but that's not what Harry praises about him. Harry honors him because Snape was brave, because he took huge risks in the first and second war to save lives, and because he overcame his circumstances to become good because he clung on to the goodness of his love for lily by giving 'Anything' in return of keeping her safe, even when he was at his lowest. At his lowest, Snape performed the greatest act of protection that saved Harry.

Was he complicit in their deaths? Barely. He delivered a prophecy, that could or could not be interpreted to mean a child. Voldemort decided that this was a child. He decided to deal with it by killing the child and his parents. Snape's role ended the moment he went to Dumbledore and granted the potters increased protection at unlimited cost, which would have been impenetrable if not for Peter's betrayal.

In the end, harry doesnt consider him complicit in his parents death, because he isn't. He tried to save them to the best of his ability. He honors him for the hero he was, not the misguided boy he had been.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12408440/1/The-Aftermath]]; You poked a dragon; Honour thy blood)

the aftermath isn;t the best written fic but it fits the request, 'you poked a dragon' is a wip and the updates have fairly large gaps in between but i definitely recommend checking it out.

Honour thy blood doesn;t have him finding out what snape did but he is fairly ruthless in his treatment of snape so should scratch the snape getting his just desserts itch

  What if Hermione had accidently Disapparated along with Ron during the hunt while trying to stop him? How would Harry have managed to defeat Voldemort alone? Watch as Harry takes a bold step forward with determination and new allies. This is canon compliant until the scene where Harry and Ron fight in Book 7. Two shot -- COMPLETE

*** Not really. Heck, he names one of his kids after Snape. Don't get me wrong. I love Snape's character. His personality on the other hand? Is a huge no. Some people have a difficult time thinking character and personality are different. You can like someone who is awful, as long as you realize that person was awful.

He wasn't even really angry at Snape, at least not as much as he was at Dumbledore when his magic went crazy and exploded things in Dumbledore's office. (If memory serves, that was after Dumbledore told him the Prophecy).

Also, they're asking for fanfics, not canon. If we wanted to read canon we would. I don't get comments like this, they aren't helpful.

**** Apologies, I should have clarified more. I meant just after Trelawny tells Harry about this and how angry he was. I agree with all the rest, just in terms of Harry's reaction canon does it well. I am not a fan on Snape either, just to clarify.

And my bad, on second thoughts this wasn't helpful at all.
