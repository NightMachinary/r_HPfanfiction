I'm reading through Deathly Hallows for the first time. (I was a fan of the books when I was a kid but only had the first four) So I get to chapter 11 and... I can't describe how livid I am, what is wrong with them!?

I could explain Hermione acting awful away in Half-Blood Prince because of a mix of her being jealous of Harry's use of Snape's book and her anger at Ron plus teenage hormones.

But now Harry is (to me) very clearly in the right. The only explanation I can think of is that Hermione is being a bigger swot than ever and Ron is brown-nosing because they're kinda-almost a couple. Lupin hit him! It might have been a spell but it still counts! Can anybody explain why they're acting this way!? Does anybody feel the same!?

Edit: Spelling.


** It's been ages since I read it, but what I remember of it is that:

1. Harry is the only one who realised what was going on.

2. Harry is the only one who has been in the same position as Teddy out of the three in that he lost his parents when they were attacked by voldemort, and Remus is putting himself in that position now, so he can see this from Teddy's point of view.

3. Ron and Hermione, especially Ron, are happy for thr help and Remus framed it as being a team, not as abandoning his family due to his guilt and insecurity.

4. Both Ron and Hermione had not quite outgrown the idea of looking to a grown up. Ron especially is the last of the trio to grow up. Both Ron and Hermione think of Remus as their professor. Harry I think thought of Remus as family (thinking back to that time in Book 6 where he had hoped for some letters from Remus, who couldn't write because he was underground and spying on Greyback), as opposed to thinking or Remus as "adult supervision".

Also, the moment Harry explained his point of view, I think both of them understood it?

Edit: spelling

Edit 2: Many thanks for the awardS(!), kind strangerS!

**** Thanks!

I think Harry just says something like 'parents should stay with their children if they can...'

As much as Harry can be oblivious about things he doesn't care about, and he is known to be that way, he is very astute about things or people he does care for or is interested in. He is able to read Draco easily just by watching him get annoyed in Book 6 at Madam Malkin for fiddling with his sleeve, or that time Mrs. Weasley chose to believe Rita Skeeter when she was printing lies about Hermione in Book 4 and called her out on it, and similarly here.

And he did grow up much sooner than even Hermione, who even though she didn't fit in to her muffle life before 11 (I seem to remember something like this), and faced constant racism at Hogwarts after 11, still always had her own parents to return to, and still looks at the world kind of in a black and white way, which I think really illustrates how much more she has to grow up in somw ways (contrast this with Sirius telling Harry that the world is not divided into good people and death eaters in Book 5).

I think ultimately Harry is the most emotionally experienced of these three in some ways and is able to understand both Remus and Teddy's point of views. He doesn't hold a grudge against Remus at all (illustrated in how he reacts when he next sees Remus), and deals with Remus in the only way it would have gotten through to him at that moment given how much Remus had emotionally distanced himself from his wife and baby (I think I remember that he spoke quite coldly about them when he was asked what about Tonks, and he said she is with her mum and she will be fine).

He was harsh, and Remus deserved it. Ron and Hermione like Remus lots and look up to him, and could not understand why or even /how/ someone, especially Harry, could call Remus a coward when he already deals with so much, and when they know how much Harry likes him.

** Oh my god, I didn't even remember that happening but a reread confirmed it. You're right, Harry was absolutely right to be furious at Remus. My only possible explanation would be that Ron doesn't know what it's like to not have parents, so he's not as angry? And maybe Hermione understood leaving people for their own safety as she did for her parents, even if it was wrong? But idk, I would have thought they would be just as furious. Especially for yeeting Harry across the room, Harry “flying backwards as if he had been punched” and causing him to slam into the wall. Remus wtf

*** I always wonder what would have happened if Tonks had shown up at Grimmauld (either looking for Lupin or mad and needing a change of scenery). Because with her being the affected party, the dynamic would be quite different. A lot less "get your head out of your ass" and a lot more "that ass doesn't deserve you" (I can see Hermione pushing that kind of sentiment).

Because I'm not going to lie, Tonks would be a hell of an asset on Harry's team. The whole "ministry infiltration" would be a walk in the park for her, therefore not compromising Grimmauld. Not to mention the rest of her knowledge, Auror training and such.

Not entirely sure if I'd really even call it fanon, tbh, since it's one of the only plausible explanations for people living through getting hit by cannonballs and falling hundreds of feet and not dying instantly (bludgers and Quidditch) or any one of dozens of other instances. Neville survives what, a hundred foot fall off his broom with only a broken arm at age 11?

********* Meh, not really. Just not overtly friendly maybe. What I disagree with is what you said about Harry knowingly pushing Remus to his breaking point so that he would go back to Tonks and the others realising that. Both were not the case IMO.

Harry throughout the discussion has a probing stance in his responses and the others were definitely not aware of his intentions.

I think that both Hermione and Ron were reacting to what was happening between Harry and Remus without any active thought or intention guiding them.

Whereas Harry makes it up as he goes along as usuall but here he gives himself time and room to respond in accordance to his beliefs. It is obvious that Remus is presenting a very tempting offer and is at least partially right in his fears.

Still Harry is reluctant to trust him, is very much against the concept of abandoning families, and argues to that point not giving in to Remus' fears.

Personally I see this conflict as both parties being in the right here. Remus is just succumbing to his fears that eventually he allows to control him in a mental breakdown situation, while Harry stands firm to his convictions and for once doesn't let his emotions get the better of him.

What I find absolutely reprehensible in this situation is how Ron and Hermione acted. Both just got a sudden case of mental regression\retardation. Either that or just pre-emptively attacked Harry verbally to stave of the coming abuse in the form of Capslock Harry.

** Harry started the personal attacks and the low blows. While Remus escalated the confrontation by physically attacking Harry, Harry is the instigator of the fight. That Remus reacted so strongly was to be expected and quite understandable.

Harry's accusations were not wrong, but he delivered them in a manner that was obviously meant to wound in the worst possible way. It is that delivery that Hermione was protesting against. And Ron really only entered the conversation to defend Hermione against Harry (so you're right on that part).

I'd also like to point out that while Harry could empathize with the baby that Remus was abandoning, neither Ron nor Hermione can truly understand what being abandoned feels like. If anything, they are more likely to empathize with Remus about wanting to leave his family to keep them safe. This is especially true of Hermione whose method of keeping her parents safe far surpassed Remus's in terms of harshness and violation.

It's all a matter of perspective and understanding. They all reacted according to what they could empathize with which, given their vastly different lived experiences, were all very different things.

However Remus was straight up abandoning his family, not because of their safety, he admits that he regrets marrying Tonks, maybe he should have backed out before getting her pregnant.

**** It is not /justifiable/ for an adult to punch a kid in the face. But we can /understand/ why he did. Those are two very different things.

Harry hit his worst buttons. Remus truly believes that he is protecting his family. He believes that they are better off without them. His self-loathing is so bad that he cannot imagine why people would love him. And Harry pretty much spat on his idea of self-sacrifice. Harry is asking him to face his worst fears and mocking him for not being able to.

Don't get me wrong, I am definitely on Harry's side. But Remus's anger and hurt were just as understandable as Harry's was.

Edit: As for Hermione and Ron shrugging off the hit, that's a book problem. Physical assault is often shrugged off and ignored in the books. This scene isn't special for it.

**** I'll also note for Hermione that she's the one that first thought of Tonks - by rereading it, Harry initially thinks only of the difficulty of keeping the secret from Remus if he's there with them, while she immediately jumps to that and is hesitant (and that's what gets him to admit he's having a kid).

That's what gets Harry thinking along that line. She's just got more hesitancy about pushing Lupin, from what I can see.

Obviously he's also got his own experience, and that's what's driving this.

After Lupin storms out, Hermione seems to me to be talking about how Harry /deliberately/ tried to hurt him in the deepest possible way - because let's be honest, that's what the language he used was aimed to do. Is it the right move to do after Lupin used a spell to do that to Harry? Maybe not, but it's obvious that Harry provoked it tbh and it'd take a moment for others to realize why he reacted so emotionally/strongly, especially in a suddenly heated situation.

IDK, I don't think anyone is particularly terrible here? Harry is right, but Lupin hates himself and is scared of what is happening (understandable), and Hermione/Ron are torn and see Harry just go off in personal attacks on an adult figure they deeply respect and who moments before was there to help them all.

Edit - also, the spell is played off by everyone as being a minor effect. Harry doesn't seem concerned by it himself, either. It shouldn't be, but... That's how the text treats it, not just individual characters.

It's dark that way: good people betray each other and lose their way. It's the real darkness of the book, not that Voldemort is positioned to kill people, but that he makes loyalty and love so difficult.

We're not _meant_ to justify a grown-ass man giving a seventeen year old a right-cross. We're _meant_ to feel how life in Voldemort's Britain doesn't even need magic to drive wedges between people.

I mean, "I got my own troubles, Remus, what the hell is YOUR problem?" While Remus, very much like That Guy We All Know, is all, "You don't understand! It's harder for me!"

And so it escalates.

While Hermione, as you point out, looks for the conciliatory path. We see in other places she's less inclined to direct conflict than the others (except with Ron).

I dislike reading the book because it's so full of such dark discordant notes, but I'm sure JKR wrote it that way to illustrate how life in Voldemort's Britain isn't just about hiding from the Bad Guys, but having to try really hard not to become one yourself. Even good people crack under pressure, and she makes it abundantly, even painfully, clear that Dumbledore wasn't blowing smoke when he said that Voldemort's talent or spreading discord was very great.

**** Remus's lifetime of werewolf insecurities and losing his friends have given him a jaded outlook, which, unfortunately, causes him to be dismissive of Harry's judgement.

He's a complicated character for sure. His arc is almost more of a silent, show don't tell, one. His lack of faith in Harry's opinions seems to get wrapped up with the Potterwatch broadcast. “And I'd tell him to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly always right.”

****** I'd say that it's worse than that. Most of them are either passively or actively malicious in nature.

Snape and Dumbledore are both supposedly 'good' Guys but I really can't see it.

Snape was an active bully who took pleasure in hurting his students. Not just harry. But neville's boggart was snape. Not Belllatrix. or her husband and In law. Snape was his boggart, Not the people who tortured his parents into insanity/coma.

And Dumbledore. well he was fine with a whole lot of horrible actions. I know it's a trope and a bad one at that. But the whole Greater Good or evil manipulative thing makes sense. Just not the Edgelord harry who foils him easily bit.

The greater good dumbledore comes from the fact that he was willing to have CHILDREN sacrificed and hurt just to stop the terrorist that He could have dealt with.

And the Evil Manipulative bit. Well you could take good guy Dumbledore and replace him with an evil mastermind and very little of the story would actually change. Nothing major. Maybe just the epilogue. There was a Fanfic collection of one-shots that explored that concept where the Train station scene was actually Dumbledore's soul anchor in harry.

As for the rest of the adults, they would be passively malicious. Edmund Burke once said "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing"

Fudge was willing to toss a someone in Azkaban without a trial. We don't know who else got this treatment, but I'm sure more than a few have considering it's never brought up.

Azkaban itself would break all sorts of international laws regarding torture and inhumane treatment.

The weasleys treated harry's situation way too casually. "Bars on the window"?

Remus only told harry about his connection to his parents in a pinch. Not to mention the whole "I forgot to take my potion bit even though I had to take it once a month for years on end" bit.

The staff at hogwarts is a can of worms I really don't want to go into. But all the danger at hogwarts should have had the authorities looking into things. But when the headmaster is the most politically powerful person in the country Its hard to do anything.

Hagrid had no problem putting children in danger left and right. He has NO place being at a school. A dragon? Fluffy? Bringing Kids into a forest to find what is hunting UNICORNS? Telling kids to go meet giant monster spiders.

Triwizard Tournament?

Fake Moody using the unforgivables? No one brought that up with anyone in charge? Thats a lot of trust to give a random guy.

Lockhart.

The Basilisk? Why was school not closed?

This is all just a few things. There are loads more but I'm going to end things here.

[[https://rosalui.tumblr.com/post/68144327913][*rosalui*]]

Ah, let me count the ways in which fandom interpretation of Sirius Black infuriates me. One day, I'll write an essay, but as I don't currently have the time to pen a thousand-page epic -

This is literally the moment that possibly defines Sirius the most, and it's the one that everyone forgets.

Everyone knows the story - Sirius arrived at Godric's Hollow, saw the Potters' bodies, and tore after Peter Pettigrew in a blind, thoughtless, reckless rage.

Um, except he didn't.

He tried to take care of Harry. He tried to get Hagrid to give Harry to him, and when Hagrid refused, he tried to argue.

What, you think he was planning to tear after Peter with Harry tucked under one arm? Of fucking course not. It didn't change that he wanted to kill Peter, that he probably would be happy to find and kill him later - but he wasn't planning to murder anyone, to throw his life away, to even sit in a dark corner and drink himself to death while holding a goddamn baby.

This is Sirius's godson, the person he promised his dead best friend he'd protect, and whom he now loved more than anyone alive. He's asking for the kid so he can take the kid, and that means devoting himself to a lifetime of raising, nurturing, being patient, being parently, changing nappies and nursing fevers and a million other VERY. RESPONSIBLE. THINGS.

Do we know how good Sirius would have been at doing that? Hell no.

But what we do know is the most important thing - that he was willing to try.

Hagrid cites Dumbledore's orders and won't give Harry up.

So it's really only once /everything/ is really gone - that Sirius's responsibilities and attachments are nearly all truly severed - that he decides there's nothing else to do but go after Peter.

Sirius could have stated that legally and morally, Harry was his to take care of. Hagrid... well, it's about 50/50 whether that would make a difference to him compared to the Holy Dumblefuck's orders. But even if it didn't, even if Hagrid INSISTED on bringing Harry to Dumbledore, there's nothing stopping Sirius from going along and then arguing with Dumbledore, or even taking the issue to court. He didn't HAVE to instantaneously give up and go do what he actually wanted to do. That's essentially equivalent to Remus giving up on Tonks to go off and adventure with Harry and co, the way he really wanted to.

I agree he should've gone along with Hagrid, but there was No way he was going to struggle to take a baby from him given Hagrid's strength and the emotional distress all were going through.

I just think too many people judge too harshly what is 'In The Moment' too highly emotional an event. Would you be able to think coldly, clinically step by step what you should do if you were in that situation?

Sirius likely thought he would be following soon after to retrieve Harry, but remember he was part of the Order and trusted Dumbles not to do him wrong. The added bonus is that Pomfrey (sp?) was at Hogwarts and could check Harry over as well.

Too much happens in stressful situations that we, in our normal rational minds, might or might not do.

*** I don't think Remus is a coward. He risked his life in the first wizarding war, went undercover with other werewolves in the second war, and died trying to create a better world from his son.

However, given his history with family, I think it was understandable he freaked out.

He was bitten as a child in revenge for his father insulting Greyback.

His chosen family, the mauraders, resulted in (what he believed for thirteen years) two of his friends dead, and the other in jail for betraying one and killing the other. Remus then spent the those years in poverty and as an outcast due to his condition completely alone.

I don't really blame him for freaking out at the prospect of becoming a father. The actions of his own father severely impacted him, how could he not think that his condition wouldn't impact his own son?

Harry's harsh words were what he needed to put things into perspective. His son needed a father and he couldn't leave that, werewolf or not.

And, at the end of the day, he didn't go through with it. He returned to Tonks and was there for her and Teddy until the final battle.

**** He's fundamentally a coward in many ways. In POA, he KNEW that Sirius was an animagus. At the time he firmly believed that Sirius was a mass murderer who had betrayed their mutual best friend's family to Voldemort then callously murdered Remus' only remaining friend and a bunch of muggles.

Yet he never alerted the ministry to the fact that Black was an animagus.

When he became a teacher at Hogwarts and the students' safety was his responsibility, and he KNEW that Black was trying to get into the school and murder the only surviving child of their mutual best friend (this is what he knew at the time) he never told Dumbledore Sirius was an animagus.

When Sirius got into the school not once, but twice. When Sirius literally entered Gryffindor tower and slashed up Ron's bed with a knife, when everyone was scrambling to figure out how this mass murdering psycho had even gotten inside the school Remus STILL did not say a word to Dumbledore. He didn't tell them about Black being an animagus, and he never mentioned the secret passages from Honeydukes or to the Shrieking Shack.

In his own words, it was because he was "ashamed" of his teenage escapades. This grown man endangered hundreds of children and especially the child of his dead friend over teenage shame. That's reprehensible. The only reason nobody was actually killed in that scenario is because Sirius turned out to not be targeting a student after all, but nobody knew that at the time.

The only one who doesn't argue with Remus about staying with his unborn child is also the only one with a 'culturally appropriate' reaction to werewolves. Even good-natured people like Molly seem worried if it's save to be in the same room as a strange werewolf in human form, nevermind leaving a vulnerable child with one.

It's entirely possible being a werewolf in wizarding britain carries a stigma on the level of serialkillers and childrapists and Remus obscuring his child's ancestry would be the morally right course of action.

** Remus is one of the worst characters throughout the series. At least from Harry's perspective. He didn't call, write, visit, or even spy on Harry from the moment of the Potters' deaths until... wait for it, not until Harry went back to the Wizarding World, no, no, until Harry was in his THIRD YEAR. And even then he acted like little more than a helpful teacher (which is already suspicious in Hogwarts, with how terrible the staff are!) rather than Harry's dead parents' best friend. He only came clean when HARRY brought it up near the END OF THE YEAR. And after that he basically fucks off again, going back to being a near-stranger. Remus was a terrible character from the first moment he showed up, so him being a dick in the (badly written) sixth or seventh books was hardly a surprise to me.

** I mean, Hermione had just wiped her parents' memories of her, gave them false identities and shipped them off to Australia. Ron had basically vanished without a trace, knowing how worried his family would be especially they had already "lost" a child. Even Harry had broken up with Ginny before leaving.

I think all of them were familiar with pushing aside loved ones in order to shield them from the task they're trying to accomplish. I don't think this aspect of the scene is out of character or odd at all.

** I /think/ it may've been that they could've used Remus' experience? I haven't read it in a long time. I don't think they considered Harry wrong in his points, really, but they were slightly more concerned about, y'know, surviving and finding Horcruxes than being morally right and considered Harry's wording too harsh. Plus, Hermione had no issue leaving her parents behind in a situation she considered safe, and she'd assume that Lupin wouldn't leave Tonks in a unsafe situation. And Ron has never experienced not having his parents, so he wouldn't empathize with how that feels. Both of them likely know Lupin as their professor, and esp Hermione looks up to professors and thinks they should automatically be respected. Lastly, IIRC they mostly stayed quiet after that - which is understandable, as Harry does tend to lash out somewhat when angry - and Harry, feeling (unless I am mistaken), slightly guilty, interprets that as anger/disapproval.

Sending your parents off for their safety and abandoning your pregnant wife are two very different scenarios. Remus wasn't trying to protect his wife and kid, he was running away from them and abandoning them. At that point, Remus' concern was only Remus, not anyone else. Everything else was just an excuse.

I don't think they could've gotten Tonks, a known Order member, out of the country at that point. So she was as safe as possible, assuming she wouldn't go stir crazy and do something reckless. And Remus, being used to think of himself and his kind as 'creatures', /would/ think of himself as protecting his son from the shame of having a werewolf father. He really would think he was doing something good or noble by this. Of course, he isn't, as Harry correctly points out, but these are motivations, not excuses.

It was entirely reasonable to ask how Lupin was dealing with his existing responsibilities before trusting him with any new ones. Since Lupin's plan was "not to", it was pretty damn audacious of him to expect to be trusted with anything at all.

  Lupin hesitated.

  "I'll understand if you can't confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission."

  "He did," Harry replied, "and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they're coming with me."

  "Can you confide in me what the mission is?"

  Harry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, and wished that he could return a different answer.

  "I can't, Remus, I'm sorry. If Dumbledore didn't tell you I don't think I can."

  "I thought you'd say that," said Lupin, looking disappointed. "But I might still be of some use to you. You know what I am and what I can do. I could come with you to provide protection. There would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to."

  Harry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be able to keep their mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine.

  Hermione, however, looked puzzled.

  "But what about Tonks?" she asked.

  "What about her?" said Lupin.

  "Well," said Hermione, frowning, "you're married! How does she feel about you going away with us?"

  "Tonks will be perfectly safe," said Lupin, "She'll be at her parents' house."

  There was something strange in Lupin's tone, it was almost cold. There was also something odd in the idea of Tonks remaining hidden at her parents' house; she was, after all, a member of the Order and, as far as Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the thick of the action.

  "Remus," said Hermione tentatively, "is everything all right... you know... between you and--"

  "Everything is fine, thank you," said Lupin pointedly.

  Hermione turned pink. There was another pause, an awkward and embarrassed one, and then Lupin said, with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant, "Tonks is going to have a baby."

  "Oh, how wonderful!" squealed Hermione.

  "Excellent!" said Ron enthusiastically.

  "Congratulations," said Harry.

  Lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace, then said, "So... do you accept my offer? Will three become four? I cannot believe that Dumbledore would have disapproved, he appointed me your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, after all. And I must tell you that I believe we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined."

  Ron and Hermione both looked at Harry.

  "Just-- just to be clear," he said. "You want to leave Tonks at her parents' house and come away with us?"

  "She'll be perfectly safe there, they'll look after her," said Lupin. He spoke with a finality bordering on indifference: "Harry, I'm sure James would have wanted me to stick with you."

  "Well," said Harry slowly, "I'm not. I'm pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you aren't sticking with your own kid, actually."

  Lupin's face drained of color. The temperature in the kitchen might have dropped ten degrees. Ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it, while Hermione's eyes swiveled backward and forward from Harry to Lupin.

  "You don't understand," said Lupin at last.

  "Explain, then," said Harry.

  Lupin swallowed.

  "I-- I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against my better judgment and have regretted it very much every since."

  "I see," said Harry, "so you're just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us?"

  Lupin sprang to his feet: His chair toppled over backward, and he glared at them so fiercely that Harry saw, for the first time ever, she shadow of the wolf upon his human face.

  "Don't you understand what I've done to my wife and my unborn child? I should never have married her, I've made her an outcast!"

  Lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned.

  "You have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore's protection at Hogwarts! You don't know how most of the Wizarding world sees creatures like me! When they know of my affliction, they can barely talk to me! Don't you see what I've done!"

  Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage, what parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf? And the child-- the child--"

  Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite deranged.

  "My kind don't usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced of it-- how can I forgive myself, when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child? And if, by some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times so, without a father of whom it must always be ashamed!"

  "Remus!" whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. "Don't say that-- how could any child be ashamed of you?"

  "Oh, I don't know, Hermione," said Harry. "I'd be pretty ashamed of him."

  Harry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had propelled him to his feet too. Lupin looked as though Harry had hit him.

  "If the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad," Harry said, "what will they do to a half-werewolf whose father's in the Order? My father died trying to protect my mother and me, and you reckon he'd tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us?"

  "How-- how dare you?" said Lupin. "This is not about a desire for-- for danger or personal glory-- how dare you suggest such a--"

  "I think you're feeling a bit of a daredevil," Harry said, "You fancy stepping into Sirius's shoes--"

  "Harry, no!" Hermione begged him, but he continued to glare into Lupin's livid face.

  "I'd never have believed this," Harry said. "The man who taught me to fight dementors-- a coward."

  Lupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for his own; there was a loud bang and he felt himself flying backward as if punched; as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor, he glimpsed the tail of Lupin's cloak disappearing around the door.

  "Remus, Remus, come back!" Hermione cried, but Lupin did not respond. A moment later they heard the front door slam.

  "Harry!" wailed Hermione. "How could you?"

  "It was easy," said Harry. He stood up, he could feel a lump swelling where his head had hit the wall. He was still so full of anger he was shaking.

  "Don't look at me like that!" he snapped at Hermione.

  "Don't you start on her!" snarled Ron.

**** Wow, it has been a while since I read this. It makes me feel disgusted with Remus, and sad for Teddy, to have a dad who was willing to abandon him before he was born.

I think what JKR was -trying- to convey was the struggle of werewolves to be accepted in society. I think it's an issue she wanted to address more, but there was so much else she had to fit in the series. So she fit it crappily into book 7, in this brief scene. I wish she hadn't; it makes Remus look terrible, and I had really loved him ever since book 3, until this scene.

This scene felt like a huge betrayal. Honestly, it makes me mourn less for Remus when he dies towards the end of the book. And Tonks deserved better than him, so sad that she died being unable to care for her child.

I wish that JKR had spent less time with the stupid camping in book 7. Then scenes like this wouldn't have felt so abrupt and strange. She puts a lot of stuff like this in book 7 and 6, and it made for a disappointing ending to a great series, IMO. I really, really wanted to like the end of Harry Potter and was pretty disappointed. And this scene is a perfect example of her attempt to squeeze in another worldbuilding/character-building sortof element that should have been introduced earlier and fleshed out to have greater effect on us.

Did she want us to hate Remus? If that was her goal, she achieved it here. Otherwise, this scene does not work, for me.

***** The thing is, we don't get to see all that much of Remus after year 3. His character as established then /is/ a coward - a man so terrified of disappointing Dumbledore that he convinced himself (or tried to) that Sirius escaped through dark magic, and that that somehow meant there's no reason to tell Dumbledore he is a Animagus. In other words, letting someone he considered to be a mass-murderer who was believed to be targeting his best friends son run wild around a school with said son was preferable to admitting to /ever/ having done something that broke Dumbledore's rules and trust. That would be less of a problem if, at any point, he grew out of it or developed beyond that. Instead, he's static. He's /always/ that odd mix of wanting to be all noble and brave yet stumbling over his own nature. I get that it's painful to be a outcast and that, y'know, he can't exactly see a therapist and irl people /do/ get stuck in patterns, but it's annoying AF at some point. Personally, I don't think I hate Remus (he /has/ good qualities), but he certainly deserved a better character arc.

I still like the Remus from book 3 though. He was kind to Harry and the other kids. His teaching was innovative and fun. Yes he and his personal life were abject and pathetically sad, but, I like how he built up the children and helped them believe in themselves.
