** Men don't like being second best. If the protagonist is meant to be their eyes into a fictional world then they like it even less. Notice how it's okay when it's Harry and his harems?

** Didn't know this was a thing. I must have been reading too much Harry/Trelawney/McGonagall.

**** Nah there's definitely tension there. Clearly one time when they were alone together Trelawney foretold their love and McGonagall begane years of divination mockery but... Sybill is never wrong.

** The girl is there to be a walking pussy for the protagonist not an actual human and anything beyond being a perfect virginal hole for the protagonist is a sin and or slight against the reader. That's why unrealistic Harems are OK cuz Protagonist has the hugest dick that makes all females into a pocket pussy and all the men envious.

*** Honestly though most male readers are either teens or neckbeards who use the protagonist as a sexual fantasy realization who have never been in a real relationship. If they were in a real relationship they'd know that the girls with experience make the best sexual partners.

** I personally don't mind prior relationships (no one is obligated to remain "pure" for some vague future "the one"). The only thing that annoys me is when the prior relationship takes up most of the story when I was looking for a particular pairing to be the centerpiece. A bit of drama is fine, a bucket's worth of it is irritating.
