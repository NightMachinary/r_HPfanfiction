** Ahhhh, most of those are pretty bad. Lots of bashing, indy Harry, friendly goblins, op Harry that still follows canon to the letter, etc... I personally love OP Harry stories, and i've even seen some fics that can pull friendly goblins off if done right, like one where he had to show his fight with the basilisk, and the goblins respected him as a warrior. That can work as long as the only advantages he gets would make sense in a warrior based culture.

What I hate about fics with the aforementioned conditions is that they still follow canon. WHY?!? If he has power greater than Dumbledore, than most complications in the story aren't insurmountable. Like i've seen an OP Harry story before(and i'm talking several leagues more powerful than Dumbledore powerful) have more difficulty with the troll than canon Harry. That's bullcrap. If you're gonna go with an OP Harry story, you go all in. Otherwise you make it boring, and pointless. Also I hate harems in such stories, because 99% of the time it takes up more of the story than what drew people in to it.

Sorry, that got away from me there. Try looking into "indy!Harry communities," you'll probably find a good chunk of stories along those lines there. When I get home, i'll look through my faves to link(if I remember. My memory can be crap).

** I think there are some Harry/Tonks fics which work like that.

But most of them are after OoTP and in that summer. I just seem to remember one which was before fifth year.

Tonks kind of replaces Hermione and Ron as the primary friends, but I can't remember which one I am thinking about.

Sorry

** I remember an one-shot that did it well, though I can't remember the name. In it Harry took Dumbledore keeping distance and telling R&H to not send him letters as a form of saying that Harry should learn to be more independent and then he ran with this idea pretty much cutting contact with them.

Besides that one I think linkffn(Guy Fawkes Day) does it the best. It seems to have a bit of Manipulative!Dumbledore, but this is so low-key and in the background that it really don't make any difference at all, Hell, it is hard to even be sure if Dumbledore was being manipulative or not.
