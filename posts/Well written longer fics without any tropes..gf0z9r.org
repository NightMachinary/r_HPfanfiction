Give me your best *Harry-cetric* fics with preferably no pairings (rare and slash pairings are fine), no tropes of bashing, Powefull/IndyHarry/evil Harry.

/BUT recommend stories which havn't been recommended before./ I see the same stories being recommended again and again and would like something new. And believe me when i say that i have gone through tons and tons of posts to find such stories on the subreddit. Dimension travel fics are also very welcome.

Should be well written and Complete or Regularly updated.

Thank you


** Without tropes, also can have dimensional travel

WTF

*** I have read quite a few really well written ones with dimension travel without any of the tropes. And they were really good.

** A fan fic without tropes, bashing and hasn't been recommended constantly? Have you tried Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them?

Hear the author got published and is getting the second movie made.

â€‹

That's a tall order and unless you widen that search can't really recommend anything

** Okay, I am not sure if this has been recommended or if its something you are looking for but its called "Sorcery, united, independence, space" by Tangerine-Alert. Harry centric, there is no pairing, no tropes as far as I can remember. There is no dimension travel but there is space travel. It's completed.

  Post-OotP, Harry decides to leave his relatives to ready himself for Voldemort, something Dumbledore seems unwilling to do. He meets a Brigadier and quickly finds Earth is not alone. Not Horcrux compliant. (Written Post-OotP) ARCHIVED-Errors/issues won't be fixed.

*** Oops, well from the summary there might be a little Dumbledore bashing but since I haven't read this in a while I remember the extend of it.

** Well, you've ruled out all the early classics because everything that is now a trope was once an original plot device.
