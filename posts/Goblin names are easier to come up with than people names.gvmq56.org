** One fanfic I read had them actually have normal names, and all those harsh sounding names like Rockgnasher and Skullcrusher were mostly just goblins trolling wizards. Same with the whole “Goblins own what they make,” was down to a Wizard misunderstanding a joke.

Oh, and Griphook hasn't been promoted for 7 years because he was a backstabbing little jerk to /everyone/.

**** Yeah. It's linkffn(Albus and Harry's World Trip)

It tends to work on subverting a lot of the tropes that other writers bash for.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** I've never seen more than like 7 unique goblin names across all of fanfiction. It's always the same three dudes: Griphook, Ragnok and a series of interchangable combinations of "blood, bone, flesh, skull, fist, breaker, crusher, gnasher".

Honestly, I don't even know why their names have to be so gruesome all the time. They may have guards on their bank, but the name we see isn't violent at all - it's Griphook. What about Sidestep, or Rockchip, or Glasseye, or Steelfinger?

** Two words smooshed together into one, resulting in something vaguely threatening?

(I like the premise I've seen in a fic or two, that these are their working names and not their actual Goblin names. Just as many immigrants choose an English name in place of their native one, so that they don't have to constantly correct people's pronunciation and spelling.)

*** Well, the goblin language is said to be very hard for a human to speak, just like mermish, so this is probably correct.
