I really enjoyed Exile although the ending was weak, given that it was split earlier than the intended end and then never had a sequel written.

A fic where any canon character has to at least temporarily cope in the muggle world with realistic struggles (for example drawing the wrong conclusions initially). For muggleborns, it could simply be that the world has moved on.

- Any type of pairing or none, excluding anything along the lines of Harry/Bellatrix or so on. Relationships must involve characters over the age of consent.

- No guns, or fighting with muggle weapon style fics.

- Characters don't have to see everything in the muggle world as better, but it would be reasonable to them eventually concluding a few things have been done well or at least that muggle life is more complex than they imagined.

- Set in Britain.


** Draco Malfoy experienced a similar, albeit shorter stint into the Muggle world in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855). That part is hilarious to say the least. Unfortunately, the pairing is Harry/Bellatrix, although it's a time travel and deals with a pre Death Eater Bellatrix.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

*** Thank you, a pre-death eater Bellatrix is manageable enough.

**** My own experience was that the first half works well, and then the second half... drops all the narrative tension. The power couple basically just strolls to victory. Quite disappointing, because the first half really was quite good.

***** Ah, I got distracted onto 'The Secret Commonwealth' shortly after getting to what I presume is the half way point and one easy victory. So, it was a fun read for me.

** linkao3(Summer Vacation by Forest_of_Holly), the last episode of the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]] deals with a pureblood girl who is hit by car and taken to the Muggle hospital. Many nice situations happen afterwards.

**** It is really good. It is by far the best Dudley-has-magical-daughter series (and very very different from all others). Highly recommended.
