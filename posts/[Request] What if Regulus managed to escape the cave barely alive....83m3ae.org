He managed to escape the cave barely alive by a fluke or pure luck after Kreacher left, so no one knew. Maybe he needed a lot of time to recover, and when he did recover, he found out that his brother was thrown in prison and had probably turned to the dark side, so he could not even turn to Sirius for help. He had to live undercover and he did not even try to contact Kreacher or anyone else so as not to put anyone in danger, maybe even live as a muggle, trying to find out what happened to the Horcrux and if Voldemort was really defeated. Maybe he found out somehow about the seven horcruxes from a drunk Slughorn and worked to try and find out what the rest where without arousing anyone's suspicions. He did not confide in Dumbledore because he knew of his past with Gellert Grindelwald (he had been a nerd and studious student), and did not want another power hungry dark lord to arise.

Maybe then he meets Harry Potter while he is searching for the Horcruxes and helping him along the way, and finding out that his brother was in fact innocent. Maybe ends with him meeting Kreacher again, and together leading the attack on Voldemort in Hogwarts, and flaunting his disloyalty to Voldemort and revealing that the Horcruxes were all destroyed (Voldemort did not find out what Harry and co. were doing in the year they took off camping).

Anyone up for it? I am not much of a writer. Would be interested in reading this fic!


** This is the closest I've seen, bit of a spoiler because they don't find out he's still alive till pretty far in, but I liked it. Linkffn(Presque Toujours Pur)

** The prompt of Regulus surviving is good, but canon rehashing isn't. Regulus surviving most likely happens because Kreacher bends his orders a bit like we see from Dobby. He comes back and takes Regulus back to Grimmuld Place.

What happens next depends a lot on the timeline. How close are we to the BWL event. A year, two? Regulus needs to recover, but he's still a death eater. He cant hide, but recuperation is a good excuse to avoid Voldemort, but that will only work for awhile. If Walburga is alive this could cause more problems still. The answer to these determines what the fic is actually about.

Maybe Regulus ends up in azkaban, but Dumbledore gets a 15 year head start on Horcrux hunting. How does that change Harry's story?

Maybe he knows it has to die to protect his secret, but shares it with Sirius first. How does this change the end of the first war and what comes after?

Maybe he lives long enough to see Voldemort's demise and assumes he's dead properly since the locket is destroyed so he never tells anyone. How does his presence alone change things without his more directly effecting our protagonists?

*** Uhh... to be honest, I was not expecting him to change much the course of the story. It would still be nice to have Harry and Dumbledore go about their story and finishing it like they did in the books. I would have like Regulus to be able to look Voldemort in the eye and tell him that he quit, and proceed to fight and survive that battle in Hogwarts. Voldemort did not even know that Regulus defied him, and that he found out his secret. In Voldemort's eyes, Harry and Dumbledore managed to crack that particular problem, not Regulus. Regulus did not get any type of recognition for his work, and it would be nice for him to see at least the absolute end for Voldemort, and live to tell the tale.

That was my thought process anyway, with him not actually doing anything else with regards the Horcruxes, and joining the gang in Hogwarts to help the fight against Voldemort, with the trigger being something else rather than Voldemort finding out that his secret immortality formula has been discovered.

**** If you change things you need to change things. Regulus living is significant to the story in many possible ways. And in no way is it insignificant. There is nothing worse in fanfiction that rehashing canon despite divergences.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** I always wondered why Regulus didn't write it all down, and have say Kreacher the letter to either Sirius, or Dumbledore. Tag it with "I am likely about to die, and I turned on Voldemort." In the letter it would explain about how he discovered Horcruxes, how he lived his life, and why he grew to hate it. maybe he fell in love with a muggle, who his death eater colleague killed.

Maybe on a mission he was spying on Sirius, meant to kill him... and couldn't do it. Couldn't fire the killing curse. He claimed that it was impossible to try, as Sirius was with James and Lily that day, and Voldemort approved.

I would totally make it into a one shot, that ends sadly, like Walburga finds and burns the letter, because no son of hers will be a traitor to the Dark Lord.

*** I guess he did not know who he could trust. Or maybe he thought there was only one and that Kreacher would find a way to destroy it. Probably thought that if not Voldemort, then his Death Eaters would find him anyway. Might be he had no faith left that he could survive, and went in for a suicide mission. Or maybe he was too fed up of the world already, poor thing!

** I read this story a while back that fits most of your criteria, though Regulus does end up changing a lot by the end of it. There's also a bit (more like a lot) of time travel involved, but I really enjoyed it.

Unlikely partnerships are forged, and trust must be earned in a race against time to protect the next generation from the mistakes of the past and guarantee a future for the wizarding world.
