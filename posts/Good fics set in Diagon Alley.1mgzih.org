I find diagon alley such an interesting setting that I would like more stories set there. I'll read almost any main character/pairing. Any recommendations?

Out of the Night by Raining Ink was another one that was quite amazing for its characterizations and relative restraint in improving Harry without succumbing to illogical overpowering. It was removed from fanfiction.net but I believe there's a copy floating around out there. Obviously (and sadly) abandoned, but it was good enough to be worth recommending.

Harry suffers a mental breakdown while being convicted to Azkaban. He serves his time and rebuilds his life away from the magical world.

Rated: Fiction T - English - Harry P. - Chapters: 21 - Words: 73,611 - Reviews: 517 - Favs: 1,250 - Follows: 1,851 - Updated: 04-15-13 - Published: 07-30-09 - id: 5262122

It's a bit angsty with the Azkaban!Harry stuff and Harry doesn't really stay away from the magical world- he gets a job with Ollivander. Incomplete, but maybe the author can be prodded into updating it by getting a few more reviews/visitors.

A senile shop visitor sets Harry up with her reclusive son as a shop competition between Harry and the Weasleys rages, and love blossoms around. Postwar, ignores HP7, SSHP. Inspired by too many Love Actually viewings.

Not /technically/ Diagon Alley, but the Ministry built a new alley after the war. It's just shy of shameless crack, but it's the good kind. Gives you a look at the day in and day outs of owning a magical sex shop during December holiday rush. Main character's include Harry, Hermione, Draco, Ron, the twins (yah, DH didn't really happen, can't remember the exact details of the end of the war), Luna, Severus, and a senile old lady named Emma Thompson. I linked both FF.net and AO3 to make life easier. There's also a sequel that's just as long.
