:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey, a while ago I read a fic(pretty short and dead) about a world that Harry got transported to where Tom Riddle was a politician who went by a Thomas Slytherin or something like that. Bellatrix Lestrange was his daughter in law. Harry ends up going to the old version of diagon alley where there is a stone that records all pure bloods and finds TR's grand daughter. Please help me find this, any questions I'll try to answer but it was awhile ago

  Harry sacrificed everything to kill the Dark Lord. He sacrificed more to kill the next one. And the next. And the next. By the end, he had nothing left to give, and nothing left to win. Burdened by failure, he's thrown into a new world with familiar faces and unfamiliar personalities, and must fight to survive. AU, Dimension Travel, Graphic Violence.
