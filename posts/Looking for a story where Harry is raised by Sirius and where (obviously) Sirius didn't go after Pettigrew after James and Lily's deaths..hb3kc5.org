  Sirius had made a slew of different decisions that night he had arrived at Godric's Hollow. With Sirius' focus on Harry rather than revenge, a very different Boy-Who-Lived is going to make his return to the wizarding world at the age of 13. But the question is, why did Harry return so late? And will he still be the Hero the Wizarding World needs? Haphne! AU-ish, slightly mature!

** The story A Godfather's Promise by TheMetalSage has Sirius raising harry in the muggle world after that Halloween night. Until Harry gets pulled into the TriWizard Tournament. Be aware story has quite a few explicit scenes.

One of the more well known ones of Sirius raising Harry though this occurs after he escapes from Hogwarts is called A Marauders Plan by Catsarecool(Rachel500).

  Instead of Durmstrang Academy, Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was invited to take part in the 1994 Triwizard Tournament. When Ilvermorny arrives at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore is shocked to see the long-thought-dead Harry and Lily Potter appear, as well as the missing Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. This has certainly thrown a wrench in his plans!
