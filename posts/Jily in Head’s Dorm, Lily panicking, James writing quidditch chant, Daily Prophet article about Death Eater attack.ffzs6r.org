:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello! A little while ago I had read this July fic. I was hoping to reread it but I cannot for the life of me remember the name or who wrote it, so I was hoping there would be somewhere who knew.

I am pretty sure it's a one shot. From what I remember, James and lily are in their seventh year and as head students are living in the heads dorm common room I think. James is trying to write a song or chant for the quidditch game while Lily's trying to do homework and keeps asking her questions and she starts to get annoyed. Lily has a breakdown over news of a death eater attack after listening to water drip off of James's gear onto a newspaper.

I really appreciate the help!
