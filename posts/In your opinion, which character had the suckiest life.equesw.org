Fans love to point out what an awful life Harry has had (often before launching into a tirade about how very, very evil Dumbledore was to have allowed this)... but looking through the various characters, there are a LOT of people in the Potterverse who got a really raw deal. Not to go all "this character's suffering counts more than this character's suffering" or anything, but I'm kind of wondering if people don't ignore the fact that there are a lot of characters in the Potterverse who have easily suffered as much as, or even more than Harry.

Just to mention a couple of characters who had pretty sucky lives:

- Snape: Abusive father and weak-willed mother, only had one friend growing up, frequent bully victim. While much of his suffering was self-inflicted, he ALSO had to see the one person he loved die, he was stuck for years in a job he didn't like and then his role as double agent meant he was detested by pretty much everyone except for Dumbledore and Voldemort. And Voldemort ended up killing him.\\
- Sirius: Ostracized member of dysfunctional and probably abusive family, lost his best friend and discovered that his other friend was a traitor, and of course he spent twelve years going through absolute Hell in Azkaban... then most of the time post-Azkaban spent cooped up in a place he hated and didn't ever get a chance for happiness because he was killed while trying to save his godson.\\
- Dobby: Worked like a slave and treated like vermin his whole life, repeatedly forced to punish himself with methods like having to iron his own hands. He did have four happy years as a free elf (being ostracized by other elves for being a weirdo who liked freedom didn't seem to bother him), but was unceremoniously killed off, again while saving Harry.

There are plenty of other examples... now I'm wondering, which character or characters do YOU think got the worst deal in the series? (On the top of my head I think I'm going to say Dobby, but that's me.)


** I'm surprised no one has mentioned Luna - Didn't she watch her mother die, while old enough to understand what was happening (as opposed to Harry or Neville, who were infants).

She also spent quite a while imprisoned in the Malfoy basement, and was bullied relentlessly at Hogwarts.

  Professor Umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to Neville.

  "You can see the Thestrals, Longbottom, can you?" she said.

  Neville nodded.

  "Who did you see die?" she asked, her tone indifferent.

  "My . . . my grandad," said Neville.

  "And what do you think of them?" she said, waving her stubby hand at the horses, who by now had stripped a great deal of the carcass down to bone.

  "Erm," said Neville nervously, with a glance at Hagrid. "Well, they're . . . er . . . OK . . . "

** Difficult to choose just one, but maybe Lupin. He got attacked and cursed as a small child and doesn't even count as human after that in wizarding society. His parents spent all their money on unsuccessfully trying to cure him and hide him from the rest of society. He experiences some good stuff when Dumbledore to his family's surprise accept him to Hogwarts, but there he also lives under constant threat of exposure and being shunned if anyone finds out. Snape obviously wants to do exactly this to him but is stopped from telling the school he's a werewolf by Dumbledore. Then there's the guilt of almost killing someone that Lupin has to live with, too. The transformation is said to be very painful, and he goes through with it every month. Then he gets a few years of transforming with the animagi by his side, which is said to help him. But then the war begins and everyone suffers from that. Lupin's best friends suspect him to be a spy and soon three are dead (he thinks) and the fourth in jail for betraying everyone. His friends who have supported him financially and emotionally and know his secret and still accept him are all gone and he's left to his own devices for 12 years until he finds out that what he knew about his friends deaths was all lies and he's blamed the wrong person for ruining his life. After that he gets to live a little again until he's killed.

Like you said, it makes no sense for James to support Sirius. But she actually discussed Remus separately, like he's some sort of separate case. And I don't see why James wouldn't support him if Remus was unemployable, as she put it. Where did he live? How did he get food? Working for the order is all well and good, but he has to eat something and live somewhere, and she said nothing about him living with Sirius. She drives me mad sometimes.

** Also Neville. His parents were basically as absent as Harry's, but he got sent to live with his grandmother. While It's good he wasn't abused or anything, Neville was constantly being reminded of how great and talented his parents were, while Neville struggled. In some ways that's more stifling than being completely ignored. He also got none of the benefit of the doubt that people have to Harry.

** Hagrid? His mother left when he was 3, his father died when he was 12. Very obviously different from everyone else, so he had to put up with constant bullying and verbal abuse. Certainly he's not respected by most people. Expelled from school, banned form using magic, and ostracised for something he didn't do. Later casually sent to Azkaban without a trial just as a suspect. Has very few friends in his entire long life, and it seems like most of them don't spend much time with him. Loves animals, but is usually unable to share that love with his less-durable friends. Constantly has his animal friends taken away from him.

I think the reason people don't generally think of Hagrid as a tragic character is that despite the shitty hand he's dealt, he's an overwhelmingly positive influence on Harry's life, and is generally portrayed as jolly.

** For me, it's Harry. Kid had: his parents killed, and he himself hunted down by a terrorist leader. He was forced to grow with abusive relatives for a reason whose validity is questionable. Both Voldemort and Dumbledore tried to have him dead. His school years were a freaking catastrophe where death stalked him at every corner. His only family was wrongfully imprisoned, then forced to hide away (he still not being allowed to go away from his abusive relatives though), then said relative died arguably because of him. He was thrust into the middle of the war by some junkie's ramblings and everyone around her taking her word as law, and yet nobody actually trained him or treated him as the Chosen One, even though they fully expected him to fill that role. Then he is sent on some wild goose chase across the UK with only some cryptic hints as to what and where to go. Oh, and all the while, the person without which all this misery would have never befallen him was his teacher and humiliated him at every given opportunity, but Dumbledore trusted him more than anyone just because he wanted to bang Lily.

​

Tbh, it's a shame that dark!Harry stories tend to be too edgy and riddled with unneeded bashing and tropes. The kid has more reason than most to snap and turn into a sort of serial killer/dark lord, and it's all already in canon.

** I think it depends on what one considers to be the worst.

​

Dobby suffered the worst physical abuse being forced punish himself in painful ways for any slights; actual or imaginary that he might commit and treated like a servant.

​

Snape blaming himself for Lily's death and hating himself for it; not to mention his childhood.

​

One can make a case for Dumbledore. His sister dying maybe by his hand because of his ambitions and near the end knowingly sending Harry on a suicide mission and taking who knows how many hard decisions that would haunt him.

​

Even Hermione's life was not that good. Social pariah for her early life and then experiencing near death experiences repeatedly in Hogwarts. Making her parents forget she ever existed and having to make an impossible choice between her potential lover and best friend. Being tortured, seeing that best friend suffer and helping him complete the mission despite knowing it was going to lead to his death(based on movies).

​

If you want you can argue about Ron, stuck in a tent with little to eat and no progress made, while constantly worrying that his family will be killed if he is caught.

​

In similar vein Molly losing her brothers and worrying about her family.

​

[[https://www.reddit.com/user/nirvanarchy/][nirvanarchy]] made a really good point about Remus.

​

Even Voldemort suffered as disembodied spirit for 10 years.

​

Sirius had a dysfunctional family that hated him and that he hated. He was disowned by them and watched as the little brother he had loved became a death eater. It was his idea that led to the death of James and Lily his family in all but blood. Then he was thrown into Azkaban where he relived his worst memories for twelve years then after living on the run for two years had to live in a house that was filled with memories of his brother and childhood waiting for his godson to call him and talk to him.

​

And then there is is Harry. He was a social pariah growing up and was often bullied by his cousin. At home he was neglected and treated as a slave. At Hogwarts his schoolmates turned on him at a dime, treating him with awe, then fearing him as if he is a dark lord in training. Thinking of him as if he was cheat, liar, delusional, insane, etc. He was slandered in the newspapers and tortured. Then the hefty expectations forced upon him for being the Chosen One. That's not even counting the many near deaths he experienced. He also killed someone after *having to reject Voldemort's offer to have his parents back in exchange for Philosopher's stone when he was eleven*. He relieved his parents deaths whenever he was in the presence of a dementor, was given a opportunity for a family only for it to be taken away from him. He watched Cedric die; was used in a ritual to bring back Voldemort, tortured and suffered constant nightmares while being in information blackout. He force fed the potion that caused Dumbledore great agony despite him begging to stop. He had to make someone he loved suffer.

Now let's get to the visions. He feels everything in first person perspective. Let that sink in. He saw Frank Bryce die and Arthur being attacked. He saw people die before his eyes and was helpless to save them. He saw people he cared for in front of his eyes and in one case in his arms but was helpless to save them. He blamed himself for their deaths.

And now lets get to the war. Countless people he knew died. He continued his mission knowing that in the end he would have to die(based on movies); and in the end walked to his own death.

*And what I personally think was his greatest suffering. He watched his parents get murdered from the perspective of the murderer while feeling all the the emotions that the murderer felt.*

With that I have to say that Harry had the worst life with Sirius coming a close second.

*TLDR- Harry*

Edit- I completely forgot about Merope Gaunt. Abused and neglected at home, no contact with anyone else, other people thinking of her as crazy, falling in love with a muggle in a staunch pureblood house, said muggle leaving her after learning he was bewitched and dying while giving birth. She had a tragic life.

I also forgot about Luna. Saw her mother die. was bullied relentlessly at school. made fun of even by her best friend. Was held in Malfoy basement for a long time.

PS- I don't condone her use of love potion.

** Snape might have had a shit childhood but once he grew up I have no sympathy for him. He was a self-centered, arrogant asshole who believed that not only was the one person who cared about him beneath him, but should also belong to him. His situation is a result of his actions and he led a far better life than he deserved.

Sirius definitely had a shit hand, I feel like since he's the de facto adult in Harry's life a lot of people don't think about how bad his life actually was. Granted a large part of that is due to canon, and despite JKR being a pretty mediocre author in a lot of aspects I don't think Sirius's portrayel is far off of what we'd expect, at least in regards to how he handles his upbringing and time in Azkaban. We only see him through Harry's eyes and it would make sense that he would try to be as strong as possible when around Harry in order to try and be there for him. We don't know how he acts when Harry's not around, and he's by no means perfect when he is, but I think that at least explains why he doesn't seem as affected by his past as he should be.

That excuse doesn't really work with Harry, who really just doesn't seem to be affected much at all by the many years of abuse/neglect during his childhood or facing Voldemort during his earlier years. The main points where we actually see him affected by these things are when JKR decided to go from a children's novel series to a young adult one, with Harry basically having PTSD in OotP. Though it's mostly gone by Harry Potter and the Hormonal Book of Pregnacy-scares despite his godfather and one of his closest connection to his parents dying the book previously. Then in DH he goes through the horrors of being on the run during a war, which is written decently, but again there's no real lasting impact on him that we can see. Now, different people do handle trauma in different ways so it's possible that Harry was just very emotionally strong and able to handle grief and mental trauma extremely well, but it would have at least been nice to see more of an impact that his upbringing had and seen him overcome that trauma in some more detail, rather than it sometimes affecting him and then just not later on.

Dobby is pretty sad. Honestly I need to reread the books both for a thing I'm planning on making and for a palette cleanser from all the fanfic. But it's been so long I remember the movies clearer than the books at this point, and Dobby just wasn't done justice in them. Shows up in CoS then I don't think he's seen again until he dies in DH. Just makes the whole scene lose most of it's impact. Goddamn I hate the movies.

** Harry: His parents were killed when he was a baby. Sent to live with neglectful and verbally abusive relatives.

Is constantly ostracized by Hogwarts students/Professors. is constantly slandered by the Ministry. Sirius was put in Azkaban without trial, he could have cared for Harry if he had been given a trial. Seemed like almost every year one person tried to kill or turn Harry over to Voldemort.

Neville: Parents killed when he was a baby. His relatives always put so much weight on him being magical, and up to par to his parents, when he was just Neville. He was great with Herbology, could have been great in Potions, if it hadn't of been for Snape. (And I'm a Snape fan, saying this). As shown when Slughorn taught the students Neville was a lot more relaxed and able to do his work, than when Snape was Professor. Making less mistakes.

Neville's constantly being called worthless by the likes of Malfoy, even his own classmates get kind of done with him.

**** It's been a while since I read the books and I def don't disagree with your point.

But from what I remember of my impressions on the last read-through(and please correct me if I'm misremembering, I have the worst memory) he joined due to being sort of youthfully niave. He was what 15 or 16? He had been raised around people that constantly glamorized death eater life without actually being a witness to what it would fully entail aside from the perceived prestige and "respect" it would bring him on a personal level. He would get to brag to his other teenage buddies and be the cool kid that got the mark first.

But I remember thinking he seemed tortured over his task to kill Dumbledore and got the sense he regretted it. Granted he still continued being a terrible kid/death eater for a bit after due to cowardice. I kind of got the sense that had he been given the chance to do it all over he would run away screaming for Narcissa, or maybe Harry to save him 😂😂

Def gotta do another read. And this is in no way a dig on Draco. He's not my cup of tea fandom wise but I do think his character is interesting

I actually had two friends when I was in primary & middle. Both orphans.

One had lost his mother to cancer and his father nine months later in an accident that happened just a few months before we met. The other was from an abusive home who was bullied. I met him a few years before the other one.

I did my best to help both of them, helped them with school work, shared home cooked meals,told the teachers about their good behavior so they can be rewarded etc.

But I changed schools often so eventually we fell out of contact. Anyway I am too close to look at it objectively.

By your logic shouldn't people like Remus, Sirius, and Snape come before house elves.
