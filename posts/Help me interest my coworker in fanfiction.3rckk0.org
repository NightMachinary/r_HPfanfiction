He once started reading a fanfiction (I suspect someone Rick Rolled him) and all of a sudden there was just slash everywhere in very graphic detail.

He likes the HP universe but is scared of fanfiction now.

Any recommendations for nice (zero romance) stories that are plot-heavy vs ship-heavy?

I tried recommending the one where Q teaches at Hogwarts (he's also a Trekkie) but he doesn't trust me to not sneak slash at him. I have no idea why; it's not like I ever prank him... ;)


** I imagine most newcomers to fanfic will like stories that feel like as much like canon as possible.

In the old days these would be the "fanfic writer attempts to write the next year" fics like Harry Potter and the Power of Emotion by Melindaleo, but these will probably hold less interest to newcomers now because they're essentially AUs.

If I wanted to get someone interested in fanfic I'd probably link them something like Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian. It has an adult tone, is canon compliant, and is well written.

If I knew a bit more about the person in question I might recommend something more specific, but for an unknown adult who likes HP but isn't obsessed with it, I'd stick to something general.

**** I'm really enjoying 'A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles' at the moment. It's Snape centric but does have quite a bit of Marauder stuff in it. It's also 600 thousand odd words, I never had much interest in Snape but it's probably my favourite thing I've read so far.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

**** I don't really read Marauder stuff either.

Still, you could try Timely Errors by worfe. It's a complete time travel story where Harry goes back in time and meets his parents at Hogwarts.

*** It's like the exact inverse of Really Dead Montage and it's perfect.

This story is the main reason why I hate post-war fluff. People died, were physically and emotionally maimed, had their families and lives torn apart. Nobody is going to be normal for a long while. Yet you never see participants in the war (willing or otherwise) with severe injuries unless it's specifically part of the plot. Authors often forget that wars leave scars, and not just the kind where [male] is depressed and [female] changes their lives.

Heck, JKR did that in HP. There was the obvious name-flinching and Moody's injuries, but beyond that, there weren't people walking around with curse scars or missing limbs like you would expect from a decade long war. Are we just supposed to assume that every single victim but three (Moody, and the Longbottoms) died? Or that their issues could be healed but not Hermione's scars or Moody's limbs?

You get all that in this story though. it's beautiful.

**** Without the benefit of actual photographs, /Cauterize/ somehow manages to evoke things like Alexander Gardner's photographs of Civil War battlefields ("if he has not brought bodies and laid them in our dooryards and along the streets, he has done something very like it") and Ernst Friedrich's 1924 collection /Krieg dem Kriege///War Against War/ (which in its closing pages presents images of veterans that literally no longer had faces). That's an impressive accomplishment for 1,500 words, I think.

Just from a world-building perspective, I love how the story situates the Wizarding world in a time and place before the over-saturation of media, before the serialization and mass-marketing of gore, such that a single exhibition of photographs can provoke a profound cultural and critical response from the public.

***** I agree wholeheartedly on the world building aspect, but part of what connects us as readers to the imagery is our exposure to the gore. We know what those scars would look like on a person and it's horrifying. Then she goes one step further and describes magical aspects to them. To think that these are fictional characters who by most accounts had a fairy tale ending, but in this reality actually bare the scars of the soldiers they were forced to become. It's unsettling because if not even your fictional heroes are sacred, then who is.

And man, the phrasing is just like knives to the heart. I'm usually pretty much alright until the end of George:

****** At the same time, I think the device of the photograph exhibition is key to the punch of the story. It creates this uncomfortable negotiation (transgression?) between public and private spheres, as the subjects commodify their wounds in order to shape their own narratives. They seem to recognize that art has power, but also requires sacrifice . . . and even then, they're at best only somewhat successful. They still get the critic's complaint about the composition of George's photographs, the public's furor over the inclusion of Draco . . . and yet they clamor for more. They're fascinated by these images, but will never truly understand because /they weren't there./

** I highly recommend [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=313068][Run]]! It has characters from all eras, including the Marauders, because it's set in an afterlife. Timewise, it's at the very end of the war. It's an ensemble adventure/character drama about the annual races and its prize of 24 hours on earth. It's my favorite HP fic.
