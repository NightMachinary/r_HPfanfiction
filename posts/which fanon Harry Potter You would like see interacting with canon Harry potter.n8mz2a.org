Canon Harry: Oh so your a prick on purpose and not naturally.

** Salazar Slytherin. Most of fanon has him as a not evil, genuinely great guy (I will die with Of A Linear Circle Salazar in my heart forever I adore that man).

It would be great to see the discourse if he met Dumbledore or the Malfoys.

(And I'm saying this as though it isn't already done brilliant in Of a Linear Circle just read OaLC)
