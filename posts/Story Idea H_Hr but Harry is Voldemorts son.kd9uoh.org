So I used to write alot of HP Fanfiction but haven't lately and this idea has been rattling around in my mind for the last few weeks.

Its like this...on October 31sr, 1980 Voldemort killed lily and James but instead of killing Harry, he took him and blood adopted him as his own child before taking over the British magical world. Muggleborns are turned into slave, halfbloods are either slaves or the common person while purebloods are the only wealthy one and the only ones in power. Voldemort will be a stern but dotting father -at least when not in public view- while trying to mold Harry into his philosophical heir. Sounds cliche, right? Well this is where my idea comes in. Every pureblood has a personal slave that must cater to them and always be there when they're needed. A purebred is not supposed to mess with anothers muggleborn but it does happen at times. For Harry, when he's 6 he gets introduced to his muggleborn (hermione) and is curious about her and she the same when he shows interest in her as a friend. They keep it a secret, playing to societies current standards because they don't want to lose their friend because hermione will be either given to another, killed or put in The Pen which is basically a very unhygienic brothal. He shares his lessons on magic with her, developing plans and finding other pairs like them such as Daphne/Dean Thomas and Luna/Tracy Davis to form their own inner circle to fight back. The pairing may not be the same as mentioned above but friendships will be, the only for sure is is HHr.

Whatcha think?
