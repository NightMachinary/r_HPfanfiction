Hi everyone! I've been writing a fic which involves a twist in the way Tom dealt with things after school - he's still evil, but less obvious about it. As a result, Dumbledore isn't too concerned about making him the DADA professor, which means Tom joins Hogwarts.

Now as Harry enters first year, Dumbledore is dead and Tom is Deputy Headmaster with Minerva as Headmistress.

I'd really love to hear from you about what you loved/hated in this fic!

** Too. Much. Exposition. I'm referring about Sirius's 3/4-long diatribe about politics, btw. Having him drop cryptic/brief hints to colour the readers' perceptions of characters and events is fine, but reading a sermon is just... no. Spread it out over several chapters -- and, far more importantly, over several character arcs. The whole legacy-not-rights speech would have been far more memorable and impactful if it had been delivered after a conflict representing the power struggles of the entrenched and the newcomers, such as a long conflict on the topic of muggleborns.

Also, about Riddle. He was born >1 decade before WWII, and then promptly stuck in an orphanage. So i suspect he would not have assimilated much of muggle culture at all, since he had zero role-models he respected, and was all but isolated by his peers and the orphanage staff.

Also, the idea that scientific principles would give one such a massive edge is something that i feel poorly thought out. The Statute of Secrecy was implemented only in 1689, if i recall correctly, so wizenkind (i think that sound better than wixen, which sounds a bit too much like vixen :) ) had plenty of time to absorb the initial paradigmic shift in epistemology, metaphysics, and even part of modern physics (newton) to have a solid foundation to build upon. In fact, with magic, they may even have an easier time doing research. So unless this is a massive AU...

​

p.s. also, you're using american slang, not british one as far as i can see, but ah well; unless accents feature as a plot point in your story, then it's irrelevant

*** Thanks for your advice - I do see why someone would find Sirius' diatribe boring, but my objective was to make it clear from the start that Sirius thinks rather differently in this fic than most others in which he wants nothing to do with the system. Having said that, my writing is a WIP and I will most likely try and work on some of these chapters to make them flow smoother once I get better at writing.

Riddle was isolated by his peers and the orphanage staff at age /11/. Canon does not expound too much, but given that in Sixth Year we see Tom as a delightfully devious manipulator of people, I thought it would not be a stretch to assume that he got better at using people to meet his ends.

For science impacting research - you're right that research was /much/ better in this as opposed to canon, and that wizards had plenty of time to understand some of the founding principles. But Riddle is somewhat of a prodigy in his field, and my idea was to convey that he used more /modern/ principles than what most of the wizarding world was using - in a span of two centuries, the implementation of the Statute meant that research in the wizarding world had taken off tangentially. Riddle used a bit of both worlds to great effect.

I do understand your points, and thank you very much for responding. I'd love if you read the rest of the fic and gave your opinions too - I'm looking to get better.

**** Integrating perspectives from two divergent schools of thought? Well, perhaps if you could make that point a bit clearer... And when i said 'peers', i meant muggle peers; but sure.

As for Sirius... i think merely mentioning his somewhat-successful political career would have been enough. Perhaps you could have extended the breakfast/letter scene, to include more by-play between the adults and Harry. Maybe along the lines of James and Sirius talking about some bill the latter was trying to push through, or his efforts to court some faction or another, and then have Peter inject some levity by acting out some comedic routine. Then maybe have Lily/Snape/Remus cut in (also, where was Remus in chapter 2? Did he have prior obligations or did he replace Peter somehow?).

Alternatively, you could keep things simpler to reduce the word count. Brevity is the sister to Success (the much, much plainer, but also wiser sister).

Or you could do it in many different ways; i just feel like if you're going to un-kill canonically dead characters, then you might as well get some mileage out of them :D. But the bottom line is, i think that simply mentioning his political career, or even having him speak up /against/ pranking would be enough; in fact, i rather like the latter, since it would immediately hook the attention of anyone who's been in the fandom for a while.

Seriously, having Sirius act responsibly (and also not use /that/ joke in every chapter) is novel enough that i'm starting to like your Sirius in chapter 3. Just maybe don't use him as your mouthpiece all the time? I'm experimenting a bit with spreading my opinions among several characters (though i kinda got caught up with WB; whoops).

​

Also, what's up with Draco&Narcissa-in-leather-pants? ( :P ) Also, people rarely use 'it is' casually, so do keep that in mind. Also, despite your gag about children speaking Victorian English, Draco uses some surprisingly complex grammar structures and words (well, for his age anyways).

***** I'll keep that in mind for Sirius - maybe a rework of that scene is in order to inject a bit more levity, I agree. I'll try and see what best I can do. :)

Yeah I've had another person tell me that I went a bit overboard with trying to make Draco sound Victorian (aka snobbish pureblood). I /think/ it gets better as I acclimatized to writing children, although I can't say for sure :P; feedback on that one wouldn't hurt ;).

Also, where was Remus? Remus doesn't attend Hogwarts in this. Tom was appointed DADA professor in 1970, and there was no way he was allowing a werewolf to attend Hogwarts. He made some arrangements for Remus to attend a school where he would be safer and lesser of a threat to the general student populace. That being said, Remus /will/ show up - I have plans for him. Should be around the same time as in canon

** I really like this, especially the Twins being Slytherin. That's a pretty original idea

Like the other comment said, there's way too much expositions sometimes, and it can really take me out of the story.

​

Overall it's a really great fic and I look forward to more from you!! You're a talented writer!
