The title says it all. I'm looking for adorable fics without sex. My favorite ship of all time is tomarry or Harrymort. Hurt comfort is a huge bonus! I've read a lot of tomarry already. Open to other ships as long is Harry is main character! Prefer slash.

** With no sex, do you mean no smut? So just normal fics where it is fade to black when the action starts? Or do you literally mean the characters living in celibate? Your wording has me a bit confused.

** The Marriage Stone by Josephine Darcy. It's HPxSS, I know some people don't like that, but it's like a really slow burn and as far as I know no sex. linkffn(3484954)
