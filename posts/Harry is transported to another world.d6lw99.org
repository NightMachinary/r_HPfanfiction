I would like to read fanfics that Harry Potter is transported to another world that is well written.

Such as Wizard Runemaster of plums.

It doesn't have to be an overpowered Harry Potter, just that he has enough power to deal with enemy minions.

Preferable if he don't have a harem in the story.

It doesn't have to be a crossover, it just needs to go to another world where nobody knows him.

If the final boss is not Voldemort it would be good.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/][The Power He Knows Not]], linkffn(11027086): Harry ends up on Middle Earth, defeats Sauron, and gets together with Éowyn. It's a very good LOTR crossover by Steelbadger.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

** linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhal) is Harry transported to Westeros from Game of Thrones. I really liked the ending.

Do dimension hopping fics count? if so, there is World in Pieces. Canon!Harry, just after the Battle of Hogwarts gets summoned to an Alternate Universe by an Order that's on their 4th Harry Potter.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/790488/chapters/1493333]]

There is also, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/0800-Rent-A-Hero]]) which has a similar premise (Harry gets summoned by an AU). Nobody recognizes him as Harry Potter because there was no Boy who lived in their universe.

  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another!

** One that I've got my eye on is linkffn(Rise of the Dragon Child), an in-progress crossover with Skyrim. It does strain credulity a bit -- while Harry is explicitly 13 and is treated with appropriate levels of care and concern by the other characters in that regard, his actions and inner monologue do not mesh with his age at all. Regardless, I've found it an enjoyable enough read so far, and the author has been quite open with their bullet-point plans for future plot beats which gives me hope that they'll actually see it through to the end.

A MoD!Harry gets rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic 4, and later teams up with the X-Men before taking the Marvel world by Storm. Occasional lemony bits between adults that can be skipped without detracting from the story. Nearly 2 million words.
