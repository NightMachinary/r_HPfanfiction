I'm really interested in what a Harry more influenced by Hermione would be like, but I'm not the hugest fan of het and I'm trying to avoid anything very..... well, het /: not sure how to inoffensively describe it better than that. Does anyone know any good Harry/Hermione friendship fics, or very very mild relationship fics? During Hogwarts, please =)

^{bonus points for non-romantic Harry/Percy friendship fics ;D}


** You /are/ reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146][The Accidental Animagus]], right?

#+begin_quote
  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth.

No ships so far (77 chapters), but it does start before 1991, so ... we'll see. The odds of H/Hr in particular are very low.

*** I am now ;)

Actually I read this all day Saturday from when I woke up til when I went to sleep, and then again on Sunday morning. (And I'm still not done??!! That's new...)

Also I wanted to thank you for finding a fic with both competent adults /and/ competent children, and a huge heap of politics ;D <3 how did you know most of my favourite things?

** The author of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks]] obviously ships H/Hr, and the story has some hints of it but it's more of a friendship/mystery fic than anything else. It's quite well done and if you haven't read it it's well worth it.
