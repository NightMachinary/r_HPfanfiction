Are there any fics where Harry is raised by other people? I mean like where he gets adopted by say Oliver wood family or Colin Creevy's family.

  When Hadrian James Potter felled the Dark Lord Voldemort, it wasn't only wixenkind who celebrated their newfound freedoms. When the Chief Warlock then moves to leave their apparently beloved little Harry Potter on a doorstep on a blustery November night it is the creatures that step up to care for and raise the Boy-Who-Lived. In the process the Boy-Who-Was-Left-Alone becomes something that no one quite expected. Not Voldemort, certainly not Dumbledore, nor any other wizard either.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!

** The Creevys were in a story called the milkman or something like that if I recall correctly.

I would die if there is a wood family adoption fic... imagine how quidditch obsessed Harry would be pre hogwarts.
