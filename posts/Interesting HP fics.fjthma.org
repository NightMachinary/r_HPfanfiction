can anyone rec me some rlly interesting fics uhh as long as harry or sirius is in it i'm good any wordcount is good no adult dating any of the kids unless it's timetravel and they're the same age uhhh i fucking hate snape he doesnt deserve the redemption arc he got cause he's piece of shit so no fics where he's a main character

EDIT: I'm okay with slash.


** Since no one recommended anything for now I'll rec you a WIP. (Wordcount currently about 100K) Might not be your thing but it's 24 year old Harry traveling back in time but the Author marked it underage because Harry lands in his 15 year old body. Sirius is pretty present in the fic. Ships are Harry/Death and Wolfstar. Pretty interesting since Death is an actual character and Harry is a bit on the darker side but not outright evil and cliché. Snape is also in the fic but he doesn't really play a major role he is just regular Snape. Not bashed not elated to some position.

** Also here are some other good fics.

My fav. Marvel x Harry Potter crossover. Good plot. Pairing Loki/Harry Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136]])

This time travel fic. I love it. Pairing Sirius/Harry Hermione/Remus Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]])

Linkffn(On a pale horse)

Sherlock x HP crossover Linkao3(1134255) Harry interacts a lot with Mycroft in this, less with Sherlock but it's one of my favorite Crossovers. Very unique.

A WIP Very interesting (Dark materials crossover in terms of every Wizard has a daemon) Horcrux Tom ages with Harry and appears as his daemon Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14476725]])

A Fenrir Greyback/Harry Potter fic. Obviously ooc Greyback. Harry is an adult in this. Surprisingly well written. Good worldbuilding. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8434153]])

A fun fic. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14291154]])

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  turning up to his ex-boyfriends wedding without a partner on his arm is something oliver wood refuses to do. which wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't painfully single when the invitation to percy weasley's wedding dropped on his kitchen table one monday morning. with three months to find a love to take as his plus one, oliver seeks out the first person he can find who will agree to fake-date him for an evening. it's just pure coincidence that the person ends up being hawaiian shirt wearing, bar-tending marcus flint.
