So this is basically all I have written right now for a fic where Harry's grand plan to take out Dumbledore and Voldemort doesn't involve any streamrolling. He has to stay as unnoticed as possible and had been successfully (sort of, Dumbledore doesn't know he's been working with Voldemort and Voldemort hasn't caught on that he's hiding a lot of skill. He thinks) played both sides for years. This is the first bit of his final preparations for the final battle. Would love your opinions on it, content wise.

"He took a deep breath. This was it. Staring down at the plans and plans within plans and plans he'd obliviated himself of and only learned about recently littering his desk, he didn't think he could be more nervous if he tried. One way or another, only one Great Power would be walking away from the battle tomorrow. He had no doubt that Dumbledore would kill whoever survived between himself and Voldemort, Voldemort would turn on him if he killed Dumbledore, and he'd kill the both of them at once if he could. He didn't doubt that the two of them knew this as much as he did.

It was no longer a battle of wits or stealth, of cunning or riches. Tomorrow it would be a battle of luck and planning. Who brought what to counter who, what was set up days or months or years in advance and if it was kept secret, how many good calls were made and how many useless precautions.

He also knew as the youngest and most inexperienced among them, he was at the biggest disadvantage. Both Voldemort and Dumbledore had decades on him to feel out the other and hone their predictions. They were more versed in magic he'd probably never be able to learn, and had had six years of studying him to learn how he ticked.

His only hope was surprise, bring dragons where they expected demons, use ice where they countered wind, be as unpredictable as possible. It was drastically hampering his abilities to prepare beforehand, but it was all he had. Then again, he always did best as the underdog."

Side note: No idea what to tag this


** Seems interesting enough. Slightly concerned about the implication that Harry (I'm assuming it's Harry) is fighting both Dumbledore and Voldemort and he expects Dumbledore to kill him if he beats Voldemort.

I have not read many stories where an evil Dumbledore is at all believable. But the writing's alright and it's an interesting enough start since we're in the action from the word go.

*** I'm still not 100% sure if it's evil!Dumbledore, opposing views!dumbledore or if he'll just realize halfway through the battle that, "Hey, Harry's throwing around a LOT of dark magic, like wow, okay that's something from a ritual you need to kill someone in cold blood to use properly, maaaaaaybe he's not as light as I thought."

**** Oh okay. I would advise against evil, and argue for opposing views. Dumbledore being evil is really hard to do right whilst not having the story feel like a massive cliche.

But to be honest it's your story so you should write it the way you think it needs to be written. Just write the whole thing, then if you want, get a beta and work through it again.

***** I have a writing partner, but he's been out of commission for a bit. I'll probably throw ideas at him and he'll either most certainly veto Evil!Dumbledore or make him so good I'LL have to veto it since Harry will have no chance whatsoever.

******* He's more of a, "what? You want X to happen? Yeah sure, so---oh. Oh wait. If X happens, then Y can happen and then person A is the most powerful being alive!" kind of beta. I give an idea, he turns like, someone buying milk into something that ends with said person having the powers equal to a god. It makes it very difficult to make steamroll Harry.

**** One simple change to the scene that means you don't need evil!Dumbles is to have Harry more worried about being locked up forever by Dumbledore than just straight killed.

** Your premise sounds interesting, but I have some questions about your settings though:

- Did Voldemort lose his body on Halloween 1981?

- Was Harry the BWL?

- Was Harry a Horcrux?

- How old was this Harry in your story?

- Did Harry go to Hogwarts?

- Did Harry have a significant support base?

- What was Harry's political or ideological leaning?

- Who were Harry's key supporters?

- What was Dumbledore's motivation?

- Who were Dumbledore's key supporters?

- If the Halloween 1981 event happened, how did Voldemort gain his body back?

*No idea, but his right hand is Blaise for now

*No idea

*No idea

Also why are there no dots? I tried to ask for dots here!

**** You've got conflict for the sake of conflict if you don't know how the characters' views are different. Ideally, the conflict should be because of their different views, not vice versa.

***** Oh I'm fully aware. At the moment I'm toying with the idea of Harry learning about great rulers as a child and deciding he wants to be one, then switches his desire over to taking over the wizarding world (Or at the very least magical Britain) once he gets his letter.

I'm also toying with this being a time travel fic but that would take away a bunch of his natural disadvantage.

Either way, what I have written up there is the very basic bare bones of the endgame, so it's subject to a lot of change depending on what I have his motives be.
