** Canon Slytherin never actually got better than "evil house". The one good Slytherin, Snape, gets a line like "sometimes I think we sort too early". Snape is the only cunning Slytherin and Slughorn is the only ambitious one.

Slughorn isn't evil but he's like, sketchily self serving. Draco teased us with motions towards a redemption arc but it never happened.

For all the sorting hat telling us that the houses should unite, Slytherin never actually stopped being evil caricature house.

*** I really liked Slughorn, I'm not going to lie. He was really put emphasis on how well a person does in the world, (which could get annoying, depending on the situation), but despite that, he didn't care if someone was Pureblood or Muggleborn, and while he did care a great deal if you were really good at one specific thing, he didn't seem to ignore the other students who were more "normal" "average" than the ones that had a special subject that they were good in.

In a book, that makes it a lot easier for the Golden Trio to be part of scenes involving each other. For example, Hermione gets to be there when Harry and Ron are leaving for the duel in Year One. A little later, when Harry gets his invisibility cloak, Ron gets to see (or not-see?) the first time he tries it on.

Excuses me, what? The one good Slytherin in canon is Andromeda Tonks, the outcast. Slughorn was a decent person as well, but he did a lot of damage with his cowardice.

Snape was an abusive teacher to the point where he became what Neville feared most rather than the insane witch which tortured his parents to insanity, the soul sucking demons outside the school or the death of said parents. And that's not even talking about his membership in the Death Eaters or the fact that he never rejected the ideology, but merely took offence at the fate of his crush.

****** Expiating one's sins is a "creepy" motivation?

We also never see Snape embracing the ideology - he joined for personal profit, not because he genuinely believed that Muggle-borns were inferior. It's pretty obvious in the books, and it's further confirmed by JKR.

So his character arc involves him going from being selfish and only caring about himself, to actively and repeatedly risking his life to save as many people as possible, including his former bully.

As for the "damage" his teaching style did... it's mentioned that his students are "advanced for their level" before the exams, and /at least/ 10/26 students get an O on their OWLs, even disastrous student Neville (as noted by Harry and Ron) passes, and Crabbe and Goyle are the only ones to fail. Even Ron and Harry get EE - the same Ron got for DADA, where he had private tutoring, and the same they both get for Transfiguration and Charms, where they supposedly put in more effort because they like the teachers more.

(Also, the Boggart of Dean Thomas isn't a manifestation of abandonment, or his mother and sisters dead, it's... a hand! Hands are evil, confirmed!)

Why did he protect Hermione, Neville, Luna, Sirius, Lupin, Draco, and "only those whom I could not save" in general, who are not related to Lily? That singular motivation was to atone. There's nothing creepy about it.

> We never see Snape reject the ideology or enforce basic human decency from his charges.

We never see Snape embrace the ideology either because he never did. If you look closely, you'll see that his charges make an effort to hide their nastiness from Snape, except for Draco. Draco, son of Lucius, one of the DEs Snape has to stay close to, because that's his more important task, not enforcing basic human decency. Also, McGonagall failed to enforce basic human decency on her charges quite badly as well, and their violations are much more egregious.

> And that's not even considering the damage his teaching style did to magical Britain (only O students for NEWT classes and his generally toxic personality are all but guaranteed to have had a negative impact on postwar magical Britain)

LOL that's so much speculation, but fine let's examine it. out of 26 students in Harry's year, at least 10 got Os. That's nearly half, so that's not even a high standard.

Nevermind that potions are basically medicine. It's hard to get into med school in the real world. Is that something you legitimately consider to be damaging to the real world?! I mean, if you do, you have more of a case, because doctors are scarce and scores in standardized tests aren't reflective of intelligence, so...

>Saying that Snape was a good person reminds me of the joke that whoever killed Hitler must have been a good person. A good deed does not wash away a lifetime of evil.

Lifetime? Snape was a true DE from age 17 to age 20 max. A good deed, singular? Give me a fucking break.

If you give your word of honour (marriage vow), you keep it. If you are not convinced, you don't get married. If you don't want children, there are many ways to prevent their conception and if, like Lupin seems to be, you are dead set against them, you can cut the supply permanently.

He had plenty of ways out. Yet he took none of them. It was evident that they were not on the same page, but he didn't care and therefore is to be blamed for the consequences.

****** Funny that you say fanon Remus Tonks rewrite is better because I cannot stand Tonks after reading fanfiction with this pairing. From what I've seen, they take Rowling's idea and turn this relationship into an awful mess. Remus comes across as emotionally manipulative and Tonk is the abandoned girlfriend. I have no idea what's so fascinating about this, but to each their own. Though it's very funny thos girls are angry with Rowling for what she did to Tonks when their own version is no better. Literature is full of disfunctional relationships, it seems fanfic is full of them as well. I am not familiar with the AU versions of this romance, though, maybe the situation is better there. I think my point is that fanfic authors take their hints from the original source, and if it's done badly in the original, it's difficult to save it.

That's why any decent Tonks story ditches that pairing completely. /Remember/ was the only fic where I could stand that pairing (It's a H/G fic with Lupin and Tonks as important character). And there are a lot, and I really mean a lot, of fics where their relationship is perverted beyond belief (and not in /that/ way). A lot of time travel fics have an obsession with that pairing because Harry wants his godson back. He does not care about anything else, he will ship people because he wants their child.

To be fair here, I use Tonks in a lot of my fics, mostly in an "adoptive big sister" role for Harry because she has not failed Harry in the same fashion like for example Lupin did. I really like the way she is characterised in OotP. The happy, easy going young woman in high spirits who at the same time was a competent witch with an interesting family background. Therefore I consider the Lupin romance nothing but a character assassination because it removed everything I liked about Tonks and made her a moping mess instead. So take my opinion with a pinch of salt.

**** I would say you're trying to read into it too much, to be honest with you.

Certain people have reservations and need pushing to get to where they need to be; not everyone, but I would argue that Remus and Tonks probably know each other better than the reader knows either of them, based on the very minimalist view you get of their relationship. It seems rather presumptuous to assume there's not more going on there than you're shown, or to take a stance based solely on 2-3 circumstances (wherein Remus and Tonks both clearly do not separate from one another, but continue to engage).

I'm sorry that happened to you, but what happened with Remus and Tonks is not at all emotional or verbal abuse or any sort of grooming, and while you might feel it is, I would not agree it's similar.

YMMV tho. seems to just be making a mountain out of a molehill to me.

** That fanon has come up with a more believable Harry. There are a lot of interpretations for Harry, but, excluding canon-compliant fics and power-wanks, pretty much all of them give Harry a more proactive personality rather than making him a complete pushover.

There are many examples, depending on the setting of the fic. Be it a more active DA, or Harry not naming his children after the people who, together with Voldemort, were responsible for all the suffering in his life (Snape gave Voldemort the prophecy, Dumbledore did not stop him despite the obvious importance, Dumbledore did nothing to keep the Dursleys in check and so on). Harry taking the threats on his life more serious would be another example. Or reaching out to other people (although that one can quickly turn into bashing).

***** I think that makes Charlus an interesting character if somewhat predictable and played out, but Fleamont can make Harry a more interesting character. Especially in the case of Noble house fanon. Malfoy is a rich pompous noble heir, and then orphan Harry finds out he's actually the rich noble heir to perfect noble Charlus. In my opinion that is a less interesting set up than Harry finding out that his grandpa was a "common" business man, that he is new wealth rather than old wealth, that he is set for life but will never be treated as an equal by the actual Noble Lords that view his family as nouveau riche upstarts who had to dirty their hands with work to get by.

** I like retroactive justifications of canon events:

- the obstacle course defense in Book 1. Was a trap. Of /course/ it was. You know someone's after it. So you layer it in defenses that look strong, but then get to the end, and /bam/, the Stone is protected and your enemy has exposed himself.

- the two-way Portkey Cup. Harry grabbed the portkey, and it brought him /back/ from the graveyard? Portkeys are supposed to be one-way! And even if you could make them two-way, Voldemort had no interest in doing so! /Unless/... Moody simply layered his own portkey spell over a pre-existing spell. Original spell brings the winner to the winner's circle. Moody pastes his graveyard Portkey on top, nobody notices because hey, they already KNOW it's a portkey

- Time Turner stuff. Maybe changing the past is perfectly possible, Hermione and Dumbledore just were super duper careful because she's anal and he didn't want to get caught

Seriously, it doesn't. Look at all of these HIGHLY Magical locations smack dab in the middle of muggle society:

If magic really interfered with electronics as they said they do, those areas would be electrical dead zones. And then the muggles would investigate. The magicals would oblivate. The Muggles would go back to investigate. This logic loop would eventually end up with the statute of secrecy getting broken and maybe a muggle vs magical war.

** Honestly, I'm not a big fan... in fact I dislike... the two most notable recurring things in the fanfics I've read, i.e. wards and House X (which I might go as far as hating). And I'm not sure what else I would really call fanon given the relatively small number of fics that I've read.

However, the third recurring element is romance... it's hard to call it fanon since everyone does different ships... but, for example, fan depictions of canon relationships often work better.

It also seems a lot of people agree that it's weird/dumb/boring that Harry's only a parselmouth because of the Horcrux. I'm definitely on board with this... I mean, it's pretty much the first magic we see Harry really do and it just seems wrong to me that it's his scar that's doing it.

I guess I can chuck in the more persistent presence of emotional scarring too (aside from the first chapters of OOTP it's not really in canon)/playing up the "war" part of Wizarding War.

Wards are annoying because, as you say, they are "logical" but they are also quite odd when you consider the canon depiction. I think the line's from the Cursed Child but it runs something to the effect of "let's see if the rumours that Bathilda Bagshot never believed that there was a point in witches and wizards locking their doors is true". That wards don't exist in the fashion generally depicted in fanfic seems a much part of the fabric of canon as Hogwarts' being a school instead of, say, a hospital. (Not that, as we see with the camping trip, you can't do some pretty decent "warding" in canon anyway... which covers the "it's logical" pov.)

** I much prefer Fanon over Canon myself. While Rowling wrote a rich and interesting world, there are numerous issues and inconsistencies that bother me. Here are some of things that I enjoy

1.) Canon Harry is not (it appears) competent and does win on a fluke. I enjoy stories where Harry is smart, powerful or really cunning. I like stories where he shoots Voldemort with a gun.

2.) I like the romances in Fanon better: Harry/Hermione and Ron/Luna

3.) I like that people like Draco has a true redemption and stories where Ron actually has to work at being forgiven but does grow up and become awesome.

4.) I like stories where Dumbledore is a good person, but flawed and makes changes. This does not seem to adhere to the story, where Dumbledore seems to be a strategic genius (and he really is not either), but an awful person.

5.) I like scenes are more realistic: where Harry asks could the horcrux been removed another way and did you have others research it? It seems that in Canon when Dumbledore says something, it is.

**** I dig the idea that he started out as a freedom fighter (eg with a Baltic heritage trying to free his people from the yoke of Tsarist Russia). He had a thing for Arianna but spun Albus along because Albus was very powerful and therefore useful. Albus eventually figured things out and was the one who killed his sister by accident, something that Grindelwald never forgave him for. Nor did he forgive the British for screwing him over in the aftermath.

And slowly, the realities of fighting a war drove him over the edge and he completely lost it when Stalin annexed the Baltic States (together with the Soviet/Russian Ministry for Magic). At which point he dropped the freedom fighter pretence and went all-out Dark Lord, making a deal with the Third Reich because he had no one else (hence the defeat in 1945).

  Remus Lupin is gay.

How exactly is that a good thing? I get LGTB representation, but what about Lupin makes it good that HE is gay in fanon? As opposed to making anyone else gay?

I know that some see lycanthropy as AIDS metaphor, but I'd argue that it's beyond tasteless since werewolves are murder machines who, other than Lupin, join magical Hitler and that has all kinds of negative implications if they indeed represent AIDS. Especially since lycanthropy is transmitted exclusively through acts of violence. And wouldn't it be kinda too stereotypical for the gay one to have magical AIDS? Because honestly, magical gay people having magical AIDS sounds like a Family Guy joke.

And other than that, I see no benefit in having Lupin as the gay one. It does not excuse him breaking his marriage vows three months into the union and it does not add anything to his character compared to making anyone else gay.

And let's not even talk about the weird bit about the Potters' sacrifice in PoA.

And he was a pretty shitty father when he ran from his pregnant wife and needed marriage advice from a 17-year-old boy who probably was a virgin and had a pretty awful track record when it came to relationships.

I get the desire for Harry to have a parental figure, but other than a Death Eater, Lupin has to be the least qualified for that job based on his canon (in)actions.

******* Here's what cracks me up about the Remus Lupin gay man/AIDS allegory (one which I agree was intentional if not fully thought through).

Remus doesn't like being a werewolf.

During the war he infiltrates werewolf packs and tries to convince the members not to join with Voldemort, and more relevantly, to be more like him- a man who suppresses the wolf in all ways possible and strives to fit into wizarding society.

So really, in this allegory, he's the mostly-straight AIDS sufferer who condemns gay people. No wonder he couldn't make much headway on his secret mission.

Making the whole thing about civil rights just feels very wrong given that they side with Voldemort despite him being the posterboy for pureblood supremacy and he was not accepting of them in any shape or form (the conversation about Tonks pregnancy is a good indication).

The whole thing was not about civil rights. The choice was "stay out of this conflict" or "murder rampage" and they still chose murder rampage. That are not people you give civil rights to, those are people you hang for war crimes.

******* Well, for what it's worth, you have an upvote from me. You've answered my question really well and 'Remus is queer in fanfiction where canon failed that representation' is a relevant answer to the OP, and you've certainly given me a lot of interesting things to think about and look into further, so an upvote is the correct response.

As a preface to give some context to the rest of this, I identify as asexual-aromantic and borderline agender myself, but my 'blend' translates practically to disinterest and lack of involvement in sexuality and gender and romantic relationships and issues in general. I'd call myself Sexuality Switzerland to emphasise my dis-involvement, but that sounds like the most bizarre porn parody ever so I'll stymie the urge.

Instead, I'll start with the thing that jumps out to me most. I had no idea that moustaches were gay fashion in the eighties. So many shitty macho-boy/Harry Enfield-esque jokes from guys I knew in my childhood make sense now. Still not funny, mind, but I get what point they were trying to make.

Sure, those things may be small, but it certainly isn't stupid. If you're fearing for your life - or even 'just' your friendships and social standing in the more 'tolerant' areas - then you're going to want to be you in whatever small way you can. We have and claim identities for sound psychological reasons, after all. Obviously you'll try do that in a way that doesn't attract attention or discrimination from the people who despise you and those like you - even supposedly neutral academics like the Tearoom Trade twat - and if that can double as communicating with others like you to build that community you can empathise and emulate, all the better. I'm big on the buddy system. So much of life's issues can be made so much easier to deal with if you've got a buddy to go through it beside you.

Anyway. Onto the response proper. I actually do get what you're saying about Queer Coding/Baiting. I've never heard it put quite like that and it makes far more sense explained that way. It's a really interesting point, that dichotomy between could and is. 'cause you're right, it's not absolute, but patterns are patterns for a reason and as much as we rebel against generalisation of demographics, it is academically valid. That last point about how Rowling didn't have to make Remus queer, but it doesn't make sense that she didn't is a really good itemisation of the Queer Coding/Baiting concept. All the set-up with none of the pay-off, so to speak. I can also see the alternate argument for Remus not being queer, though - nobody could possibly argue that Tolkien, a traditionalist Catholic reactionist who liked Viking Literature (a culture that was quite anti-gay men), would have intended the blatant homo-eroticism of Frodo and Sam, so it is possible to give a queer subtext without author intent of queerness.

Speaking of set-up and no payoff (wink), it did take me a second to see what you were getting at with that first image. That first motion really does look like they're about to kiss, doesn't it? Damn, I really need to rewatch the movies and reread the books. I didn't even recall them hugging in that reunion bit. I can definitely see the queer subtext in that one for sure. It's damn-near blatant.

(Apparently it is still legal to discriminate against gay people in 17 states, of however many there are. I can't find anything about the weird satellite territories the US has (Guam and the others, I mean) though. That is depressing, but utterly unsurprising. For the 'land of freedom', America certainly has made an art form of oppression and discrimination.)

I can see the demeanour comments, too. Again, I didn't know that quiet and reserved was queer-coded, but I can see the reasoning and logic behind it. I wonder when that transitioned to the 'camp' stereotype we tend to favour nowadays? Or if it crosses cultures? Side note - I would be interested to see a gay relationship that was still machoistic and emotionally constipated as fuck, but that's more out of my own interest in how that would turn out than any particular need for realistic representation. I am with Hellstrike on Remus not being there at all for Harry in Canon beyond something any teacher should do anyway, I'm afraid, but I do agree with what you said on fanon re-imaginings correcting that failing.

I admit, despite my prior comment on patterns, I don't quite see the implied definitive-connection between 'he has magical-allegorical AIDs' and 'he's implied to be queer', because it may be correlative but it's not causal so the connection by nature isn't definitive and 'he's an allegory for AIDs-sufferers, which was referred to by bigots as the gay plague, therefore he should be gay' seems a little bit of a strange sentiment to hold, but my field (in practice and training) is mental health so I've never really had cause to look into AIDs or AIDs history myself and that's entirely an assumptive opinion based on no actual knowledge or experience.

If those articles you shared are right - no insult or disagreement intended here, but those articles very definitively have a conclusion they believe in and argue for and I prefer to read wholly around a subject before I make my own mind up either way - then it does make sense that people would make all that connection out of sheer probability and historical linkages and be irritated when it, along with the subtext from the demeanour and near-snog, was co-opted out from under them for yet another straight white dude character.

Anyway, to conclude, I do get why Remus would be queer-coded now, thank you. I may not absolutely see all of it, but I went from unknowing and disinterested to understanding and wanting to know more.

For the record, I'd be happy to listen to more of what you have to say, should you be interested in sharing. Either here or in whatever Reddit calls its PM system. You've got an interesting way of writing and you seem pretty knowledgeable about the issue and the socio-cultural contexts it happens in and I'm always delighted to learn more about the technical and discussed side of the feelings of the young people I work with (we have a strong queer presence in our service user population at the youth mental health service I work with). If that's not something you're interested in, that's okay by me too. No complaints here from me, what you've written thus far has been very interesting and informative.

I've asked a few people about this, and no one ever talked about moustache or being quiet and reserved being a requirement for gay men. So thank you. I've ranted many times about how Remus deserves better. I do not have HIB, but I have some idea of what Remus goes through, and I agree with you Rowling treated him horribly. I mean, that canon fact I i happily ignore, i.e., how she finished his story is horrific. People suffering from depression identify with him. So that' what all of us deserve. Like if you're discriminated against for whatever reason, goodbye. And where was that message of tolerance again? I recall her beating us over the head with the idea that intolerance is wrong, and that Remus suffers horribly because of that. But hardly anyone cares.

********* Needed to, no, but should do, yes. It's the Wizarding version of seeing an advanced kid floundering in your basic classes and giving them some guidance so they can get into your AP Course (I think. I'm not American, so I'm not sure how AP actually works and we don't really have that here). Could also be like picking a particularly articulate kid for a Debate Club competition or the like, I suppose. He's also a theoretical family-friend-uncle to the kid, so teaching him self-defence and trying to help him with his nightmares is a pretty Uncley-parental thing to do.

Thanks! I'm glad to hear it. I write a lot of mental-health and social-implications stuff in my professional contexts, and discuss issues and how to work through or fix them, so I'm quite used to talking through these issues. I was worried about 'yucking your yum' though, so I'm also glad to hear I didn't. Always difficult to imply deliberate tone and subtext through international/inter-culture internet chats.

I really like the way you put it about Queer History and AIDs History being intertwined. That makes the link make sense, despite also allowing for the fact that it isn't necessarily absolute. Even if a straight character with AIDs was written, like that Hamilton fic you mentioned, that... nod, I suppose, to the Queer end of things should be made. Makes it a more holistic, accurate exploration of the topic, rather than only covering one side of it. Right?

And it's less not seeing the connection at all, and more not seeing the connection as definitive. While AIDs mostly affects Queer people, it doesn't only affect Queer people, so it's not an absolute connection - that's what I was trying to say. It's correlative, not causal, in that most AIDs sufferers in the UK and US are likely to be Queer, but they're not definitively Queer. Though the majority (70-ish%, apparently?) of cases are apparently in African nations, their general homophobia means we don't really have accurate demographics on the sufferers there. Could all be closeted Queers, for all we know.

Your intertwined comment also covers the things you and Wordhammer said in the other comment attached to this bit. Remus being a closeted, self-hating makes unfortunate sense in an eighties-esque gay-context where, like you said, being gay was akin to being a child-molester. I don't know what cultural opinion is in the US, but here in Britain people who hear about child-molesters/paedophiles don't even bother hearing the rest of the context before loudly calling for re-institution of the death penalty or chemical castration. If you're told you're a monster deserving of terrible things all your life, you're going to believe it, and doubly so when you start to tell yourself that. And an active person might then start to proselytise following his example. So, while he may not be a positive symbol of Queerdom, he might be a realistically dark one for the time period he grew up in/is allegorically representing. Also makes him giving in to Tonks make some sense, too, if he's an allegorical gay man that thinks he should be straight and runs from his own identity. In short, I infinitely prefer fanon!Queer!Remus - him being less self-hating and queer makes the darker sections of that canon interpretation a lot less brutally dark and depressing. Darkness may be realistic, but there's enough of that in reality. We need more positive looking-forward examples in fiction - look at where we should be, instead of where we were and often still are. So, yes. If we're gonna have a Queer Remus, I'd prefer a fanon Remus that loves himself please, rather than a canon self-hating Remus.

And on that note of Darkness - well, yeah, of course Remus being turned by a man isn't used that way. Being assaulted by a man doesn't make you gay. Even the bigoted stereotype about Lesbians would have it be the other way around. Queer assaults straight, cis assaults trans, male assaults female, and all of those can be flipped and still be perfectly accurate and not one is causal. You can be gay and assaulted by a man and you can be straight and assaulted by a man. Sexual assault is about the 'enjoyment' of the assaulter, not the victim, no?

Whether you go for Dark Realism or Happier Tones, I do wholly agree that Remus should've been handled better. His abandonment thing always did feel to me like Rowling just tucked him back into her toyshelf until she needed him for the plot again. In all honesty, most of her characters felt like that to me. Just toys she took out to further her plot when she needed and put away when they weren't useful. It's why I'm not quite as marmite-esque (love it or hate it) about the Harry Potter characters.

I'd ask for links to those fics you mentioned too, but I don't know Hamilton and I find superhero stuff so exhaustingly dull that I wouldn't be able to appreciate the intertwining.

Out of curiosity, what would you think if Rowling had never intended all that Queer subtext? If she'd stumbled into it by accident and had intended all along for Remus to be a straight, hetero-normative, HIV-allegory?

** I like the Lords of Noble and Ancient houses and the savvy 11 yo Slytherins, specially Ice Queen Miss Greengrass, the parliamentary politics, ancient rituals and ancient rivalries. And I love young Tom and young Gellert, brilliant , decadent and bored.

OTOH I have zero interest in spoiled bully James. Give me caustic, tormented Snape any day, thank you.
