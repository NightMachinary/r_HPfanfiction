It seems like every original character or SI is female, or genderbendered to be female. Are there some wellwritten stories that have male OC protagonists?


** linkffn(Out of the West by Larry Huss) would qualify. A pretty extreme AU.

**** On balance, yes. It was good in the sense that Larry Huss is a talented writer who pens in a Jack Vance style, which I enjoy.

The story is an AU world of mutant-types existing (and with plot evolving) parallel to the events of HP canon with a few crosses over between the two. It would be perfectly serviceable as a stand-alone novel if not for the ties back into the Magical world.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

**** It's not relevant to the plot... I think the intent was to explain the SI recognizing many people on sight.

If you landed in the book verse you'd mostly need to be introduced or otherwise learn many of the character names before being certain of who they are (with obvious exceptions)
