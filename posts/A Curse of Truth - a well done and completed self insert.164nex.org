** I've never read a self-insert that said upfront that it was a self-insert, instead of just sneaking in a terrible, horrible, no-good Mary-Sue (note: not being mean there, that's a tongue-in-cheek reference to the children's book).

I think I might give it a try! One more fic on my to-read list.

** Thank you for the rec. First self insert I've read, turned out much better than I expected for the genre.

** Holy crap! I guess I know what's behind the bump in hits a few days ago even though there much in the way of a response here. Thanks for recommending my story.

** Just started reading it, it's really funny and not at all what I expected when I saw "self insert".
