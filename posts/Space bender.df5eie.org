Someone figures out that the ancient bigger on the inside enchantment for bags is just the tip of the iceberg of what's possible with bending spacetime, and becomes super powerful with it. Examples: Curses aimed at them don't hit their target because the space around them isn't euclidean and constantly changes, making it literally impossible to hit the space bender. Gravity? That's just bent spacetime, let's just control that too. Voldemort? Down the black hole he goes.


** As an avid fan of scifi as well as Harry Potter, I am a little ashamed that I never thought of that application. Soooooo overpowered, though. Maybe a great crackfic.

** Now you're thinking with portals.

*** Might not be that difficult actually....

If you can make a box that's shaped and sized differently on the inside than the outside, you can make a tunnel that's 100m long, 0m high and 0m wide on the outside but 2m high, 1m wide and 0m long on the inside.

Obviously it'd get a little more complicated if the two portals aren't fixed in pre calculated positions, it might be a little easier if instead of trying to create a spell that creates connecting portals on the fly you connect two or more rings with protean charms and enchant them to calculate their relative positions and velocities and create the stretched space tunnel accordingly. That way you could have as many gates as you want able to connect to each other, maybe by turning a ring to dial a sequence of runes unique to each gate... I've been binge watching too much Stargate SG-1 recently.
