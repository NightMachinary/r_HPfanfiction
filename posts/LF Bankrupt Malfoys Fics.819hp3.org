Want some fics where the Malfoys go bankrupt and what they do, how they live etc is followed on. Can be during Hogwarts or Post DH. No slash or shipping with Harry or Hermione preferably.


** Mentioned in the first chapter of linkffn(Havoc Side of the Force) The Malfoys didn't realize how much Harry and Ron had played them until Ron moved his entire family into Malfoy Manor.

linkffn(Thorny Rose 3: A Spring Clean For The May Queen) What assets weren't frozen by the Ministry were taken by Narcissa when she fled to France or Harry's Group Of Variable Long-Winded Titles Assigned By Sirius, who accidentally burned the manor down in the process.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

** linkffn(6432055)

One of my favorite harry potter fanfics.

- Draco-centric
- No Shipping
- Canon Compliant
- Post-Battle of Hogwarts.

Don't want to spoil it too much, but the Malfoy family does lose everything at the start of the fic due to war reparations.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
