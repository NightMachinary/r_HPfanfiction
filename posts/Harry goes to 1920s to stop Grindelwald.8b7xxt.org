***** Honestly, I was disappointed at how straightforward Grindelwald seemed in Fantastic Beasts.

This guy duelled /Dumbledore in his prime/ to a standstill. He could wield /untold power/. He likely instigated a /world war/. He had the Deathly Hallows. And despite all this awesome power, he basically got his ass handed to him by a couple of stationary Aurors and some random bird in under 15 seconds, just because they wanted the movie to have a happy ending.

Perhaps I've read too much fanfiction, but I expected that confrontation to be a bit more momentous.

****** Well, it sort of fits with him being the kind of wizard who could lose /even though he had the unbeatable Elder Wand/.

You can make it work if you figure that the real reason he was so scary was his ability to manipulate and nudge behind the scenes: if you look at the actual history of the rise of the Nazi party and their initial warlike successes you see a lot of absurd coincidences, people acting wildly out of character and enemy commanders having remarkable rushes of shit to the brains at critical moments.

In real-world history, this was just the normal cake-and-arse-party that history actually is. In the Potterverse, Grindelwald had a fanatical cadre of invisible wizards, all skilled with mind-altering magic, apparating all over the place and keeping the third reich going like one of those juggling acts where the guy is spinning thirty plates, juggling thirteen flaming chainsaws and farting a tune at the same time.

It worked until brute force - the combined industrial and military outputs of the western allies and the Soviet Union - could be brought to bear, at which point the whole elaborate mechanism came crashing down.

And Dumbledore arrives at the last minute to beat a despairing, depressed, beaten Grindelwald and take him into wizarding custody so he doesn't blow the Statute of Secrecy wide open at the Nuremberg Trials...

******* I see what you mean, with Grindelwald's power stemming from his manipulations, but it was pretty explicit that in magical prowess he was /at least/ as good as Dumbledore. Grindelwald's ability to manipulate was another type of power, albeit not one that came at the expense of his duelling ability.

I'm tending towards this being shoehorned in so people don't leave the movie theater without a happy ending. (Regardless, it was shoehorned in terribly, and the battle should have been far more of a conflict.) It is a family movie after all, and doesn't have the same momentum to pull off what HBP did or DH Part 1 with the depressing, sad endings. Perhaps later in the series they'll feel confident enough to insert a good ending regardless of if it's happy or sad.

Who knows - maybe Dumbledore would break him out in the next movie! Now that would be neat.

******* A full auror brigade of entirely stationary wizards. For 15 seconds. He was nowhere close to winning. He barely took 2 steps when he was forced to the ground.

Anyways, at that point, the disguise might have well been up anyways. Grindelwald was not surprised when they tried to reveal his identity. His fast nod at the beginning of the fight was probably an acknowledgement of the fact that the jig was up.

****** There were thirty MACUSA Aurors opening fire on him, and he got blindsided by the Swooping Evil while shielding from thirty people whose combat philosophy is "there's no such thing as overkill, only 'open fire', and 'shield'."

** Linkffn(3155057) This is the closest I can find. Great story IMO. Harry goes back in time to kill baby Riddle, but some stuff happens and he gets involved in the magical World War 2.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

  Harry is the girl who wanders in and out of time. Tom knows nothing about her, and despite the fact she has whisked him away from the orphanage to live with her, he's starting to think he never really will either. Regardless, he is determined to never let her go, not even in the face of time, space, or dark lords. timetravel
