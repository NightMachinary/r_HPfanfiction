Hi, I've been reading Harry Potter fics for a long time, but lately I really can't find anything that would be actually interesting to read. I'm not into romance at all and I would love to read something that has creative plot twists, appealing friendship/camaraderie, intelligent or authentic characters, non righteous or obnoxious main characters, stories that don't follow canon events, good AUs... I'm tired of seeing countless Lord Potters (although I enjoy the trope when done right), I'm tired of countless Harry/Daphne stories that I can't tell apart, and bashing is still in such big number of fics it's depressing. When I try to search fanfiction.net and filter out romance and Hermione for a good measure, all I see is slash or bad tropes. Help me please

Edit: Just got from work and...I'm amazed and overwhelmed by all your responses! Thanks so much! Although I read some of those I'm happy to see a lot of stories I have not come across.


** I've recommended all of these before, but there's a chance you haven't read them all... There's no bashing, no Lord Potters, no Harry/Daphne, no slash, and no real romance either (outside some references to crushes and canon pairings, anyway).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/236735][Muggle Fairy Tales Are Mad!]] isn't so heavy on the plot -- in fact, it can be summed up in one sentence: "Hermione tells Harry and Ron a bunch of Muggle fairy tales while they play running commentary." But if it's light on plot, it's packed with comedy, characterisation and charm; This may be one of the funniest stories I've read. Ron especially is hilarious as he nitpicks and snarks at the fairytales, pointing out logical fallacies, sometimes being very insightful and sometimes missing the point entirely.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/554931/1/Harmless-and-Easily-Domesticated][Harmless and Easily Domesticated]] is is an older story, written before HBP was published. it's essentially about Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures lessons after the Ministry have forbidden him to teach any dangerous beasts. It's a lighthearted and funny story with spot-on characterisation.

If you don't mind a crossover story that takes place in a different time, then we have [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3991385/1/Sherlock-Holmes-and-the-Ravenclaw-Codex][Sherlock Holmes and the Ravenclaw Codex]], which takes place during Phineas Nigellus Black's tenure as Headmaster in the 1800s, and where Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson are called to Hogwarts to help solve a mystery. It's a pretty good story, which captures Watson's narrative voice well, and Holmes's ties to the wizarding world are really interesting once explored.

Or for a crossover that takes place during the books, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7826115/1/Megamorphs-The-Wizarding-World][Megamorps: The Wizarding World]], a crossover with Animorphs. Essentially, during DH, the Yeerks have started to infest select people at Hogwarts, and the Animorphs infiltrate the school and team up with Dumbledore's Army to help fight them. This reads and feels very much like an actual Animorphs book that just happens to guest star the wizarding world. There are two sequels as well, focusing exclusively on the wizarding world.

If you don't mind gender-bending stories, then there's [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/241642][the Weasley Girl series]], where Ron Weasley was born a girl, and the various changes that comes about because of it. It starts out looking like it'll just be a retelling of canon, and then it goes totally off the rails... but it keeps very close to the whimsical tone and feel of the early books.

Saving the best for last: If you like large-scale AU fics with a really epic feel, and canon characters in new contexts and roles, then look no further than [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]]. It's a brilliant story where the wizarding world is ruled by an immortal Salazar Slytherin, and society is split up into a strict caste system; the Serpent caste rules, while the lowly Mudbloods are stolen from their Muggle families and made to be casteless slaves or cannon fodder in the war against the Dark. However, when a particularly smart Mudblood named Hermione Granger is taken from her family, she sets out to try and rise in the ranks.... fic also contains Tom Riddle as the disgruntled Headmaster of Hogwarts, and Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix as wanted outlaws and rebels.

*** Thank you so much for these stories, I haven't seen your recommendations before. Half a year ago I frequently checked this sub, but in recent months not so much - didn't have time to read fanfiction.

I like the "Muggle Fairy Tales Are Mad! " so far, it's very lighthearted and funny, no plot, but, as you said, it really does have its charm.

I will check out the rest of your recommendations, they all seem quite interesting from the brief summaries you provided, well, except for Megamorphs - I'm not very familiar with Animorphs series.

But, once again, I want to thank you, I'm so happy when I see something interesting I haven't come across before!

** linkffn(11858167) - Harry goes Dark Lord for Teddy and brings his friends along for the ride --- I'm going from memory here but no romance, cannon not epilogue compliant, pretty sure Daphne isn't mentioned, characters are believable based on cannon. Not sure if it's too well known but I didn't find it until recently.

** You should try [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/][Scryer]] for better filter of stories.

As for stories I would recommend three one-shots linkffn(Quo Vadis? by Ruskbyte) and linkffn(Masters of Death by Ruskbyte) these are pretty good horror stories. The third is linkffn(The Double Agent by bourkem).

And if you didn't read it already there is one Lord Potter story I've enjoyed. linkffn(Midnight Gold, The Rise Of The Forgotten Lord by InheritanceConfessor2011) I think it's one of the few Lord Potter stories done right.

EDIT: There is also this one [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7553478/1/A-Phoniex-Rises][A Phoniex Rises]] It's AU tho.

** /Cracks knuckles/

Okay, let's see what we've got in the ol' favorites tab.

I'll warn you that most of these are ongoing, because complete fics are recommended all the time and I personally prefer potential over satisfaction.

Before that, though, may I recommend trying branching out into other fandoms as well? There are some really great stories that I've read without knowing more than a wikipedia article about the subject, and it really kept me occupied with reading for a year or so of decent quality. (Let me know if you like what's below and I'll recommend fandoms, if that's something you're up for trying.

-Okay, here's the list: (I won't be summoning the link bot, because meh, just reply if you can't find something)

Non-crossover

- Seventh Horcrux- If you haven't encountered this yet, there's something wrong with reddit. Very clever book.

- Harry Potter ad the Accidental Horcrux- It's a bit of the lord harry jam, but a lot darker than most. However, it's not far enough down that hole to be /edgy/: This one's probably the closest to what you asked for in the title so far.

- Core Threads: Power fantasy on the surface, but done really creatively with a side of multiple personality disorder and some really good world/character building. Basically throws cannon out the window, and you asked for that.

- Applied Cultural Anthology- It's from the perspective of Slytherin Hermione: You asked for creative plot twists and an intelligent main character, here's cannon Hermione being thrown to the wolves first year and beyond and making it work for her.

- October- From the perspective of Tom Riddle beginning his first year, the rest I leave to you reading: This fic is probably the best done 'redemption' of Tom Riddle that's out there, mainly because it acknowledges that there really isn't a turning point towards being a caring person when you're a psychopath, just towards being a decent one. It's technically romance, but the romance isn't the point of it. (My favorite out of this whole list, I believe)

Crossover, but based in HP world, so basically just HP fanfic

- Evil be Thou My Good - Harry Potter solves the Hellraiser Puzzle-box: knowing nothing about hellraiser it's a damn good horror fic.

- Knowledge comes at a price- Harry potter gets involved with Hermeus Mora from Elder Scrolls: It's a pretty interesting read about deals with devils and all that.

- When Harry met Wednesday: Harry tries to commit suicide after fifth year, the adams family gets involved: This one has a bit of smut to it, but in between that is a really interesting plot that promises to only get more so.

And finally, last and least likely to match up with your request, but recommended nonetheless:

- Harry Potter and the Most Electrifying Man- Harry Potter is raised by The Rock: It is the crackiest crack to ever be written, but it's short, and worth a look if only for a half hour of solid chuckles.

*** I totally agree on potential over satisfaction . Half of what you recommend here I've already read, and others seem interesting. I've never even encountered October, which is surprising, seems like something people would recommend more often. Thanks very much and I'm curious about other fandoms that you mention. For me it's always easier to start with crossovers before reading stories about completely unknown characters, so I'm also going to try your suggestions on crossovers, and I don't really know much about Elder Scrolls.
