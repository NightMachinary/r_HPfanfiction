I just want to reach out to those who share the same sentiment as me, who were so invested in the story. It's been more than a year since it's been taken down. I remember while searching for it, I kept repeating to myself "Where is it?" and then I read in her tumblr that she wouldn't be posting anymore content online.

I was so devastated.

It was so petty for me to cry over a fic. To cry for someone I don't even know, someone who changed fanfiction standards for me. So I kept searching of any memory of her existence on the net, until now.

Ichor had received so much backlash back in its days. Nocturne has spoken about it a lot before, and it hurts to read. The reasons for the hate were: a) Tomarry, b) Non-con, and c) Blonde Harry. Like, really people? The color of someone's hair?

My recollections for this fic are slowly fading. Charity thou art a lie, Yes I have a thousand tongues, and Bittersweet undefeated creature was the best fan fiction I've ever come across. I didn't have a pdf file of it because I always believed it would always be there. Funny looking at it now. I just want to see if people still remember it, or Nocturne for the matter. She responded to all the comments, you know? It was so sweet. She responded to all my comments and each reply was made me the happiest person ever. But now it's all gone. And I respect her decisions for taking it down.

Edit: I hope this gets noticed by more people. I know there's more of us who are fans of this fic.


** I've seen this fic mentioned a few times, and its always praised. Why was it deleted in the first place though?

*** People complained. A lot. First was because of Harry's character. It was genderbent, blonde (but the reason was actual good, and all fics had Harry [or Harrie] either red or black haired, so it's pretty refreshing), and in here she was slightly more aggressive, one who can bite and give snarkier remarks. They told her it 'this' wasn't Harry, or that maybe this was a self-insert.

Second was the rude comments posted on every update. Each of her chapters were very long, and to see harsh comments after posting something you worked very hard on? Not the best thing.

And third, I think she mentioned about comparing her fic to other fics, and she was tired of comparing. But I know she said this far before deleting it. Sorry this is so long, I wish you had read it before it was taken down :")) it was really good.

**** There was also an incident with another author writing a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14695419/chapters/33957573][similar themed fic]] (Fem!Harry shipped with Voldemort, who discovers they have shared souls), copying elements of characterization and imagery, and straight up plagiarizing a couple of lines from Nocturne, with zero credit. (Though I won't hesitate to say everything in the copycat fic is inferior. The author doesn't know how to use punctuation, and it's infuriating.)

The similarities are eerie.

From Nocturne:

#+begin_quote
  He wonders how she can place such importance on other people when she has his fucking soul in her chest. How much more of a home can one carve out in another person? How much more of himself---

  How infuriating it is to know the succession of her thoughts, the succession of affection she holds for other people when he---

  How much more of a home could that be?
#+end_quote

.

From Runic Warding:

#+begin_quote
  /Now you need to accept us, all we are and are not, and accept that once you made a home in me. Open up your eyes and ears and your nose Harry, your heart and your mind and everything you are, so that I may in turn make a home in you as well./ He told her all this with solemn inevitability, holding the waiting dark in his red right hand.
#+end_quote

.

That said, I thought the writing of Ichor was polished, but it was way too angsty for my taste, and I didn't like the characterization. Harry was okay, but turned into a punching bag for drama, via X_TREME Dursley abuse worse than canon, and later Voldemort abuse. I wasn't a fan of Voldemort's characterization either; the buff horndog Voldemort doesn't work for me, because I've always interpreted him to be asexual, or at least uninterested in working out or obsessing about his physical/sexual needs when he could spend his time obsessing about magical power. And pursuit of magic above all other considerations like body, soul, or afterlife, is what I consider one of his defining traits.

The reason I didn't like him in Ichor is the same reason why I couldn't buy the Daddy Voldemort of Cursed Child.

****** If you read it because you're jonesing for something that feels like Ichor, prepare for disappointment. Because not only does it poorly regurgitate Ichor's themes and imagery, but it uses a lot of the cheesey old Indie Harry tropes as well. Fem!Harry in that fic gets that Gringotts will reading and becomes Heir Potter-Black, and also gets a creature inheritance. Though I'd say the worst part would be the complete destruction of Voldemort's character, by making him a moral crusader instead of a selfish narcissist.

Chapter 22:

#+begin_quote
  "I immediately decided that the logical course of action would, of course, be to overthrow the muggle-loving government who was abolishing our traditions and in some cases even making them illegal, because safeguarding the Purebloods would have the dual benefit of protecting both the Olde Ways and the Ancient Houses. The hope was for it to buy me enough time in which to find a more permanent solution to the real problem of magic dying a slow and painful death."

  He gritted out between his teeth. "That this is a war for the fate of magic itself, and that the means will always be justified when the ends are so vitally important."

  She rubbed her face, unable to believe that a man as intelligent as Voldemort was really this appallingly thick. "I'm going to be completely honest, knowing what I do now about the Fade I'm not even sure that your winning isn't actually maybe, maybe a good thing. And I mean that is one hell of a maybe Voldemort. It's definitely something I'm going to have to sit down and think about, but only on the condition you stop treating 'saving magic' and 'not committing genocide' as if they're mutually exclusive!"

  "Muggles are the reason for so much of this mess and the most immediate and direct threat to our way of life." He sneered. "They are killing the planet with their pollution and their overpopulation and their greed, and if we don't find a way to deal with them then we're unlikely to make it another century before they've either decided to kill off either us or each other and indiscriminately blow everything away! You might have forgotten what it was like to huddle in a cramped air raid shelter night after night, listening to the bombs dropping all around and wondering if the next one was going to be the one that finally killed us, but I never have. They have to be stopped!"

Canon Harry doesn't get seconds but isn't starved until 2nd year when Vernon installs the capflap, and the Dursleys just tell him James and Lily died in a car crash. They make a point of pretending James and Lily never even existed, instead of trying mock him for being an orphan, or passive aggressively hinting about the magic.

She's too thin, too pale, her hair is a tangled mop around her face, thick and golden like a gnarled halo. There's a faded bruise around her wrist and then the cold, snick of scissors that jab into hair, scrape her ears. The pieces fall around her eyes, like gold feathers floating past, settling like a defeat around her.

  Harrie learns the word mother at school, her aunt sneers at the word, she's dead, you don't have a mother... Trust she'd burden me with you, like she hasn't taken enough.

And on the Voldemort abuse, yes, I know it was there and it was tagged. I'm not complaining about its existence, just the fact that the angst contains a lot of repeated emotional beats that may be a realistic depiction of abuse survivors, but in the context of a narrative, slows the pacing to the point where any sense of an act structure (beginning/rising tension, middle/building tension, end/resolving tension) or linear progress becomes muddled. The characterization of the story was thorough, but ultimately it read more like a character study fic than anything else.

******* I respect you don't like voldemort, but I never understood asexual Voldemort at all. But that's me, it's so predictable and boring, just like labeling him a pure psychopath like most people do. He's complicated and very human in Ichor and they appeals to me. Something completely new that worked really well for who he could have been in a more adult book.

As for the abuse, Im pretty sure the whole point was to show how someone could overcome the things done to them, how someone else could grow as well in regards to their own choices, like yeah...it was a character piece, but it was human and complicated and they was the whole appeal of it and something, if you followed nocturnememory, would have seen was her whole reason for writing. A lot of het posts are still there on Tumblr, she really wanted to explore the characters and the consequences of choices and the whole Horcrux soul thing.... I think people really just didn't want to read what she was saying in her author notes, that all clearly stated it was primarily a story about those to characters and how to get them from one place to another.

******** Perhaps it's overdone in fanfic, but the reason why it's so pervasive is because there's a lot of evidence in canon. Voldemort might be human and complex, but he doesn't see himself as human, and chooses to reject his humanity (destroying his soul and becoming a snakeman) and human weaknesses (mortality, emotional fallibility, desire for friendship and kindred/familial connection).

Voldemort rejects the things that makes him human, because they disgust him and remind him of weakness. Accepting and embracing his human desires, especially if they require the involvement of other people, doesn't seem like him. Voldemort hates the idea of depending on other people (even though he is forced to multiple times by circumstance) and that was the whole idea behind using horcruxes instead of relying on a potion for immortality.

It's all well and good for an author to write whatever they like, that's the beauty of fanfiction. However, reading Ichor was an extended session of suspending my disbelief, because it felt like I was reading a very out there AU interpretation of Voldemort. It was well written, but it was difficult for me to reconcile myself with the idea of the character /being/ Voldemort, and my immersion level ultimately affected my overall enjoyment of the fic. I am very aware that I'm a canon purist, and this wasn't the only thing that bugged me. Another was Ichor Harrie referring to her mother as "Mommy", in the American spelling.

Some people don't care, some do. Different strokes and all that.

You know, smart, cunning, willing to manipulate via looks and popularity... Anyway, I'm not a canon purist, obviously, but if I was, I mean... Voldemort did have a kid, lol.

********** I don't disagree that Voldemort is an egotistical dickwad. My personal interpretation leans toward Voldemort being delusional enough to believe that he's transcended humanity, even when he hasn't. But a big part of his persona is being aspirational, which is why he rejects his muggle origins and re-names himself Lord Flight of Death, rejects his muggle father's looks, and tries to reject everything he thinks will make him weak, including physical/emotional desire. He's also hypocritical as fuck, because he exhibits greed and triumph, but it's what he thinks he is that's important.

I also believe that Tom Riddle and Voldemort are the same person, as shown in that line, "Voldemort is my past, present, and future". Tom isn't Voldemort's human side, and there was no point that Tom Riddle suddenly decided to become Voldemort. Tom was always delusional, narcissistic, ambitious, impulsive, egotripping, with no moral boundaries or limits, and that's exactly the same character traits that make Voldemort the monster he is. Tom Riddle is just someone with a handful of external limits preventing him from being as monstrous as he wanted to be.

Quoting [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]]'s post on Tom Riddle:

#+begin_quote
  There's a common theme in fanon that Voldemort "lost" something when he stopped being Tom Riddle and became Lord Voldemort. Usually this is done to enable a Harry/Voldemort pairing, by making "Tom" more reasonable than Voldemort was. But this is just not how Tom Riddle was. Tom Riddle did not "become" Lord Voldemort. He was always Lord Voldemort, always cruel and sadistic and inhuman. He's a psychopath, simple as. "Tom Riddle" was the mask, not some kind of more rational, calmer person who developed into Voldemort. When I read about Tom Riddle at Hogwarts, I want to be reading about someone who is having to constantly hide and restrain their true nature in order to present a front to the world. If Tom is to develop into a person who is capable of living peacefully within wizarding society rather than practising murder as a hobby, then this is a development which has to be shown, not a characteristic which is within him from the start.

*********** Except this is literally what nocturnememorys Voldemort is, minus the description of psychopath. He says it many times, he is lord Voldemort, he isn't ever referred to as Tom riddle unless it's actually dealing with Tom riddle. The only caveat that nocturnememory makes is that Voldemort, at the height of splitting his soul six times was not as intellectually sound as he was...which, completely reasonable imo. He went after a freaking /baby/ like...that is not a sound choice of an apparently incredibly smart villain, sorry, but no. Nocturnememory herself says that Tom riddle was the boy, Voldemort is the man. There's no difference between the two, only the amount of soul he had at any given time.

I, for one, don't believe he intentionally mutated himself physically, just like Grindelwald it was a side effect of dark magic exacerbated by his Horcruxes. He always thought he was above everyone else, even when he was a child, him changing his physical appearance was a byproduct not a goal. The last time we saw Tom riddle as tom riddle, he's still aiming to maintain his 'mask' by applying to the dada position, whatever goals he had, that doesn't scream someone looking to throw off their human form entirely. He can still be 'other' without looking it and it would seem, interpreting the text, he had goals to do so.

I'm pretty sure if it was more adult, all of these things would have happened. Vernon yells and belittles harry, petunia swings at him and belittles him, he's harry hunted constantly and has zero friends until he's 11. Hes skinny and wearing taped glasses and hand me downs that don't even begin to fit. Hes locked in a cupboard. He doesn't get fed properly. He does chores that Dudley doesn't have to do....

** I am sooo thankful for this thread. I hope Nocturne sees it. I adored her writing, it was hard, soethimes unpleasant but it was beautiful and sooo well written and you could sense her pouring all her heart into it. It was so mature, so poetic, so stunning.

​

It is a shame that such a community as ao3 would treat one of it's own that way. I haven't seen it so I can't comment but apparently that was the reason of her leaving :<. Especially since she tagged her stories sooo carefully and her writitng was hardly in top 10 of unusulal HP tropes. She was sooo humbe and kind and I do agree with [[https://www.reddit.com/user/Pookingshet/][u/Pookingshet]] , I do respect her decision and it's heartbreaking that she did not feel comfortable in the fanfiction community :(.I wanr people to remember er, it is quite hearbreaking and funny in a way that stories ere, on the internet, can get forgotten and lost but they deserve to be remembered, for the next generation of readers/writers alike.

Nocturnememory, I hope you are getting better and we love you <3 take your time and we still think of you, your magnificent works, rememeber that :)

** I had a copy somewhere, but I'm not even sure where I put it. Whenever I mention that someone messages me to ask about it so I redouble my efforts to find it, but I don't know where it's gone and that makes me sad. I half suspect it was on my stolen phone...

Edit: after digging through fairly extensively, it appears Nocturnememory was very thorough with purging it from the internet, even requesting that The Wayback Machine exclude it.

**** I'm actually incredibly tempted to pay for personal access to one of the other archive sites, but I'm worried it'll be fruitless. Do you know of any of the illegal/grey area archive sites other than fichunt and fanfics.me? Fichunt had it removed, and fanfics.me doesn't have it.

I also searched through torrenting sites to see if it had been uploaded to no avail. I don't believe for one moment that it doesn't exist somewhere on the internet, the question is simply where?

Actually, I just found a near complete scrape of FFN that ran from 2013 to 2015, which means part of her stories are likely there, assuming she started one by about early 2015. I might download it and unpack it to see what's there, but it is very large.

I know that the bot offers ePUBs when called for fics, but I haven't managed to find a comment that linked it yet.

****** In retrospect, this is absolutely hilarious and very desperate. It appears that the bot pulls ePUBs directly from the site, so that doesn't work. screenshots.com is the most common paid archive, and Alexa is another.

*** Except it was all tagged and warned for, many many times so... If you haven't read the story obviously this post was not for you...so why comment? Also, petunia and Dudley are blonde, the whole point of changing Harrie physically was in an attempt to explain why no one in the muggle world looked twice at how out of place harry seemed in a family like the dursleys. Harrie looks more like petunia, thin and blonde, it made perfect sense.

I don't understand the hate on hair colour, I've seen so many creature fics, so many op!Harry where he's suddenly a Calvin Klein Model (actual words used too) or fics where he's another race altogether... Like what does it matter what he/she looks like, if the writing is good, if it can be made sense of.... Then who cares?

That wasn't stated in the original post, so how was I to know that? I did qualify my statement.

#+begin_quote
  I don't understand the hate on hair colour

Generally something like that would. Be changed for one of three reasons:

1. Lily had an affair with a blonde person, and the story is gonna have the whole 'your real father' thing
2. The story is gonna cast Harry as a similar personality as the other blonde characters in the series (stuck up Slytherin or dreamy ravenclaw).
3. It is to change how Snape acts toward Harry. (Not looking like father/mother to avoid the standard reactions).

I would consider the first two of those red flags for a fic. The third one is a bit more acceptable. It doesn't sound like the fic in question here went for any of these, but you wanted to know why it would be concerning.
