So I've never come across a fic where Harry actually /craves/ immortality.

In most fics I've read, even the good ones, Harry doesn't care for immortality. Thing is, that irks me, that partially kills my suspension of disbelief. There's this theme in fanfiction that immortality is a petty desire craved only by Voldemort - when, in fact, it has motivated much of human literature.

Even in Harry Potter, immortality is a strong theme. Dumbledore and Gellert's endless quest for the Deathly Hallows; Nicolas Flamel and his stone; the lengths people will go to for unicorn blood; and most obviously, Voldemort himself. I imagine if we were in the Harry Potter world, many of us would be willing to go to some rather horrific lengths to achieve immortality, and Voldemort's search for immortality is understandable - that's part of what makes the series so interesting! So to read a Harry that tosses away the idea kind of irks me, and it makes me care less about Harry.

I'm trying to write a fic where Harry craves immortality, but I can't really find the time, and it's basically abandoned at the moment.

** This is certainly an intriguing idea but it isn't a theme of fanfiction that immortality is bad. This is a canon concept that is first brought up in book 1 when dealing with the philosophers stone and carries on through the entire series. This is a philosophical debate that is given life in HP and in many other fictional worlds. Almost universally immortality is considered burden as much or more than it is a benefit.

linkffn(The Last Enemy) Is a oneshot based on Harry conquering death, its very good.

** This is a one-shot based on exactly the thing you are seeking, it is based around a rituel that would give immortality to the caster (Harry) at a high price. But be warned, its VERY cruel and features a HORRIBLE Harry. Horrible as in evil enough to make canon Voldemort look tame. So be warned, here is [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1213&chapter=1][A Veela's Worth]].

** Haven't you ever read the fan theory that "neither can live while the other survives" and the prophecy could mean that after voldemorts defeat Harry /can't/ die? Harry sacrifices his death to stop voldemort, this isn't a good thing to him because he will never see all the people he lost. Sirius, Remus, His parents, he won't go on to "the next great adventure" like everyone else.

**** Thanks for finding this. I hadn't read it in awhile and couldn't remember the other line of the prophecy about "either must die at the hand of the other" I always like reading this. And jus because it's not confirmed in canon doesn't mean it's not. We don't have a death date for Harry, he could have sacrificed his death and not even known it.

** Harry is the true Master of Death. This means he accepts it completely and realises that death comes to everybody some day. This is straight up written in DH. So I've no clue why you'd think Harry would search for immortality. That's not Harry at all.

That being said, HPMOR.

*** You could make the same argument of 'That's not Harry at all' against a Harry who usually works hard rather than usually just going with the flow (as far as I recall, literally the only time Harry works hard in the books is in learning the Patronus charm).

Regarding HPMOR, the Harry character is in several parts quite literally an aggressive preacher for his particular philosophy, which is annoying to many readers.

However, if you are either extremely open (not hostile to even the most bizarre ideas or to the most annoyingly confident characters), or already believe in the utilitarian philosophy, HPMOR can be very enjoyable.

  Do you want to live /forever/, Harry?”

  “Yes, and so do you,” said Harry. “I want to live one more day. Tomorrow I will still want to live one more day. Therefore I want to live forever, proof by induction on the positive integers.

**** It's flagrant abuses of 'logic' like this which demonstrate why Methods of Rationality is frustrating. The author acts like he's being clever while being categorically wrong /and/ being condescending about it.

Only an adolescent would believe that behavior can be explained by such simplistic mathematics. 'If this, then that, else the other'. The disproof of this assumption can be accomplished by presenting even a single exception.

"Either you want to live or you want to die.' No, sparky. Every human being is distinguished by the capacity to change its mind even if the conditions around them don't appear to have changed. Just realizing that infinite life can also mean infinite pain, infinite sadness, infinite ennui would prompt the unaging to pick up a gun and aim for a life-ending target. I don't want to live forever- I want to live for a fair span and enjoy myself during it, and if it looks like the potential enjoyment isn't going to balance out the difficulty of struggling to live, I will consider looking for an exit strategy.

I want to keep living /at the moment/. Things look good. I can expect some bad with the good but overall, my flawed expectations for the near future appear quite positive. If I knew I was going to get into a car accident where I would either live the rest of my days limbless and in constant pain or die suddenly, I'd be hard pressed to select the first option.

What's more, the idea that Flamel is any more liable for his choices for living nearly a millennia than we are for living almost a century is utter crap... 700 hundred years during which millions died who could have lived if you took action is the same as blaming everyone else for the hundreds of thousands of deaths that happened during their typical 80-year span. Immortality doesn't change the rules of cause and effect- if you don't know what's going to happen next, you can't be expected to change it. Yes, a whole lot of people can be saved if I decide right now to dedicate my life to being a doctor or a firefighter, but I don't wanna. Am I therefore a murderer? An arsonist? Crappy wordplay isn't the same as logic, and the elitist tone that's used to convey it is a kind of insincere salesmanship that makes me rage.

***** "Being Categorically wrong"

Are you being hyperbolic here? Because I would be suprised if you actually thought that morality isn't exactly a settled science: there's still lots of debates going on.

I'm quite sure you could find a lot of philosophers who would say that immortality would be an extremely good thing (and that depriving others of it would be an extremely bad thing).

And some philosophers, such as Peter Singer, do in fact blame people for indirectly causing deaths they could have prevented, and advocate donating as much money as possible to charity (99% of income).

Regarding the specifics of the character's argument: "either you want to live or you want to die". The character is saying that if you want to die later, you still want to die.

****** It's categorically wrong because the character is trying to reduce this particular moral concept into a simplistic mathematical algorithm. The character very specifically does NOT say 'if you want to die later, you still want to die'; he's suggesting that his lack of desire to die today can be applied by inductive proof to apply for all days to come, and suggests that because it's based on mathematics that the argument is unassailable.

Of course morality isn't settled- it's a cultural model and therefore subject to revision and reinterpretation for the standards of the time. What I can say about it is that it defies application of absolutes, which pretty much invalidates using abstract mathematical concepts to define it.

******* Peter Singer, a professional philosopher, does the same thing: he reduces a moral concept (whether we are morally responsible for others) into a simplistic mathematical algorithm.

And yet he is still an extremely respected philosopher and people debate about whether his ideas have merit. To me, that is not the same thing as 'categorically wrong'.

****** I'll skip the extensive argument of whether the main character can be considered a mouthpiece of the author and simply say 'oops- meant the character'.

You have a right to be angry if I'm withholding a useful life-saving technology, and you can even lay judgements about it, but that doesn't make me a murderer, just someone who decided how he wanted to use his discovery. By informing others that the Philosopher's Stone existed, Flamel left it open to others to discover it on their own. He didn't patent it nor is he trying to market it. Whether or not he made those decisions based on higher principles or self-interest is irrelevant. It still doesn't equate to blood on his hands.

If your absence would not change the flow of things, i don't see how you can be held responsible for being there but not interfering, especially if you made no promises about intending to interfere.
