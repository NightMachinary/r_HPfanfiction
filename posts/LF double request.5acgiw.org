- The rules of magic:

We know magic can't bring people back to life. It can bring you from un-life, but reviving is impossible... but why? Is that ever explored?

Can magic create gold? is gold mined only, or the goblins have a monopoly in gold mining/minting? Can a smart wizard tank the economy by creating/transmuting lesser materials to gold?

We know souls exist, and we know the afterlife is real, at least for wizards. Any fanfics that explore religion/spirituality/the life beyond life?

and any other rules you've found interesting in fics, really. Not many fics explore magic itself.

- Magical extermination.

Reverse Rise of the Wizards. The mundanes have had it +with those motherfucking wizards in their motherfucking country+ and they decide to take matters in their own hands. Bonus points for eliminating every single wizard, or for being specially gruesome.


** There are fics where raising the death doesnt seem too impossible; linkffn(Too Young to Die). The fic goes through the steps Harry has to take and is quite a nice read.

The problem with creating gold is sometimes explored, though mostly in some indy!Harry crap.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** Magic explicitly is capable of creating gold in canon, as transmuting lesser metals into gold is one of the notable properties of Flamel's titular Philosopher's Stone from the first book. The fact that it is notable that the Stone can transmute implies to me that it is not something that is possible through lesser means, though. It would take a wizard of Flamel's competence, years of study, and whatever else he went through to create the Stone to replicate.

It's a plot point in linkffn(6671596) that Voldemort gets his hands on the Stone and uses it to manipulate the economy and the government via bribery, which was mildly interesting as I'd never seen it before. It's a WIP and that particular plot is still developing though, if that turns you off.

Some indy!Harry fics I've read have had him get rich(er) quick through manipulating the pound/galleon/muggle gold price exchange rates. I don't think that's something Rowling ever looked too closely at in canon so it's not implausible that weird numbers there allow this.

*** It sounds interesting, but 26 chapters in 5 years, plus the last update being in March, makes me want to avoid it as much as possible.

Could we safely assume then, since Flamel is presumably dead, that there is no feasible way to transmute gold right now. I think I've never seen a fic that deals with economics and overabundance of gold, other than D.S.S. Requirement linkao3(3412346)

**** Well, that depends on when your particular "right now" is. If you start a fic at year one, Flamel is definitely alive and the Stone is intact. It's been awhile since I've read canon, but iirc at the end of book one after the Stone is destroyed he had stores enough of the Elixer of Life to put his affairs in order, so I'd find it plausible if an author wanted to have him alive in year 2-3. After that, he's probably dead. Having a new Stone would likely require stumbling across his research notes, and recreating it. Outside of the Stone I generally assume creating gold is impossible, otherwise every two bit wizard would and the wizard economy would be shit.

If an author wanted to explore the effects of infinite gold on wizard society, it would require altering year 1 canon such that either: the Stone itself survives, or Flamel's knowledge survives, whether that's in his head or in other form (written, Pensieve, other magical artifact). It''s sadly not commonly explored, as the demographics of "HP fanfic writer" and "person with above average interest in and knowledge of economics" don't seem to have huge overlap. The fic I previously mentioned is the only one I can recall that goes into the implications, but I can totally understand not wanting to start an unfinished story that is unlikely to update soon, if ever.

Point taken. It'd depend on "when" the story is based.

Usually I won't start a fic that has not been updated in 3+ months. I know it may sound bad, but nobody wants to invest time on something that will go nowhere.

****** Depends. I generally check the first chapter and see if they have written a note about it. Sometimes the authors have to take a hiatus for 6 months or so for work or other reasons and if they specify the duration and return date, it's generally okay.

** My headcanon is that the HP world revolves around the concept of a "soul". You have the dementors which can suck out your soul and is irreversible and horcruxes which hold portions of one's soul. My theory is that as long as the person is still in the process of dying/still clinging to life for whatever reason they can be revived because their soul is still keeping them together. As soon as they pass the point of death though, something irreversible happens to their soul and there is no way to bring it back so the "person" can't be revived. Thoughts?
