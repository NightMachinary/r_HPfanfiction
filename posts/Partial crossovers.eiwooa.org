I'm looking for some crossovers but without characters from the other saga.

For example, Blood magic is similar to that of Dragon Age, or Muggles know the magical world and treat wizards exactly like mutants in Marvel comics. Dumbledore has the same purposes as Xavier and Riddle has the same purposes as Magneto. Without ever appearing mutants or their powers.

Is there any such story, even with other sagas not mentioned by me? The important thing is that they follow the principle described above.
