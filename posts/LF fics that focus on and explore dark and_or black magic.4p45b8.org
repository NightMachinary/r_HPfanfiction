I was reading [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] and got to the part where Billy-trucks runs diagnostics on the Riddle Manner bedroom. She describes the magics within as some of the blackest she's seen, and that made me wonder about explorations of the evil portions of magic. I'm a large fan of The Black Queen series, and like the descriptions of rituals there, but I'd like something that focuses on that, rather than just having it happen now and then.

 

Ideally things that aren't 3edgy5me, indifferent to pairings.

The Travel Secrets series, but it only happens in Second and Third.
