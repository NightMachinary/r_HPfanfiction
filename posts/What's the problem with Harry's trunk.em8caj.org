In Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them, Newt lives in his suitcase and literally has a whole fucking zoo inside it complete with lakes, forests, caves, etc... and nobody cares but I see people complaining almost daily about the "Harry gets an 乇乂ㄒ尺卂 ㄒ卄丨匚匚 trunk" trope.

I mean, if Newt can have a national park in his suitcase, what's the problem with Harry's trunk being as big as a house inside?

**** I honestly can't understand what's the point of these movies. Are they kiddie movies about magical animals? Or are they grown up movies about the conflict between Dumbledore and Grindelwald? They are trying to be both and I just don't like them very much. Plus David Yates is still directing and he is one of the few people I genuinely hate.

Not that anybody asked my opinion, but the way I would have done it is make a tv series about the magical animals with Eddie Redmayne like Steve Irwin. And then leave the more serious stuff like racism, love and war for the movies that will be only about Dumbledore/ Grindelwald.

Well, the first film was more lighthearted and focused more on Newt and the animals. And then the second one suddenly became about Grindelwald. I'm just curious- do they want to make an adventure/ comedy with Newt and the funny muggle or a thriller/ drama about Grindelwald murdering people left and right?

I admit there are more movies to come so I might not be seeing the whole picture. But I'm not holding my breath. I don't see what's so "edgy" about this, but throw your little epithets around if you must.

I loved the first one, because it had amazing characters (and a Hufflepuff lead to boot!) and the coolest fucking beasts, which is the thing that fascinates me the most about any fantasy land!

I didn't like the second one. I'm glad they're still making HP stuff and all, but it just goes against so many things established in the original books that it drives me crazy. And it feels so much different from the first film that I don't understand why it's still even called Fantastic Beasts.

**** I love the first one so much, it's such a good little adventure film, both light hearted and dark at the same time mixing it perfectly into its own little story. That even sets up for a bigger picture to come with grindelwald. But I think where they really went wrong is they put too much into the fantastic beasts / Newt idea. I love Newt and really all the characters in the first one, but like... it just did not fit in the second one. The second one felt like it should be more about grindelwald and Dumbledore and the likes but it was too busy also trying to still market to Newt and the fantastic beasts... and it just was all over the place and did not flownaturally like the first one.

I think they should've gone with a new concept and maybe a new lead for the second one? Idk but it still wouldn't fix all the plot holes like... Credence's origin just canonically DOES NOT WORK that part is just unforgivable. Ugh... maybe the third one can be better I hope

***** Skill in novel writing does not necessarily preclude one from being a bad screenwriter. I picked up on a lot of details in both films where it felt like a really bad novel adaptation: there are pacing issues all over the place, tons of exposition dumps, set ups that don't seem like they'll be paid off until much, much later, etc.

For example, the muggle guy on their team gets obliviated in the first movie to forget about magic and presumably has a pastry shop or something -- then immediately gets his memory back in the second film and is totally in on their adventure in France right away. Why was this important? What impact did it have? For character tension? Set up for something we don't know is coming? It just screams like the writer didn't have a plan and or cut a ton of important material for the screen.

If Jo wants to write the novels for someone else to adapt into screenplays, it could work a lot better, but she doesn't really get the structure and language of film, IMO. At least not in these two films. I'm sure she had people helping her, too, but at a certain point you run into George Lucas syndrome where everyone around you turns into yes men so they can continue to work in the industry.

In some ways they are, they add things or take away things that were in the books: Hermione doesn't have Mudblood written on her skin in the books, yet n the movie she does. Many moments were taken away from Ron or another Weasley and given to Hermione or another character, Peeves wasn't even in the movie, even though he was in the books, et cetra.

** You're being too literal in understanding people's complaints but I can understand the confusion for someone who can't understand the simple plot of Crimes of Grindelwald (I'm being mostly cheeky here) so let me explain.

When people complain about Harry's trunk, it has the added baggage of Harry getting a magic trunk with hundreds of secret compartments in a powerwank fic. Nobody really doubts if such a thing can exist in HP world. The problem is what it usually means for a fics standards and quality.

If Newt started solving all problems by escaping into the suitcase where time is so dilated that he can stay for hundred years without a second passing outside, people will have a problem with it too.

The shopping chapter where harry buys all of the best stuff in Diagon Alley, including the trunk, usually happens in one of the first few chapters, before the author knows if they're going to finish writing the story. It makes a lot of sense for the author to just go over everything that makes sense and that they might use, screw Checkhov and his guns.

*** I've seen exactly one of these fics, and it was overall ridiculous (on the level of "Harry murders every bad guy in his universe and then goes to another to become a goa'uld-wizard"). The most I see trunks used for is like three compartments, one "normal stuff", one "wardrobe" and one "library" one, which should be pretty standard in a world where that kind of thing is not only possible, but affordable to a basic middle-class person. The rest is established magic also - shrinking and weight-reducing magic exists, which makes the trope of the matchbook trunk possible and normal.

I'd also say that spatial expansion, being as available as it is, is probably used liberally all over the place, the least of all being the entirety of Diagon Alley and the hidden platform at King's cross (I refuse to believe what JKR said, that they're really there and just hidden - people would be smart enough to find inexplicable holes in their city and investigate)

Though actual pocket dimensions without a real-world anchor point are the coolest, imo. Like, establish an extradimensional space through magical means, throw a large rock platform in and build yourself a home that is perfectly secure, no entrance required if you apparate in and out.

** it's not the trunk that's the issue, bur how authors tend to use it. a lot of the times it comes up because the author just wants to write a bunch of cool shit (read: wish fulfillment) and Harry is a dementor animagus with a phoenix familiar and ten wives and owns the daily profit and uses his money to buy a sick trunk. All of this is introduced in the obligatory diagon alley scene, or worse, the summary, and none of it matters in the fic because the author only wants to write cool shit

or the trunk just becomes this awful Deus ex machina. Where are we going to hide? the trunk! where do we want to hide our stuff so people can't take it? the trunk! I want to study alchemy/runes/etc? oh, the trunk has a library and a tutor in the form of a portrait of salazar! there could be some interesting plot in the form of someone stealing his trunk, but no, it's always blood charmed or whatever and shrinks to fit into Harry's necklace or never ending pouch or whatever.

** I believe that undetectable extension charms are very difficult to cast correctly and highly regulated by the ministry or something like that. In DH I got the impression that Hermione's bag wasn't strictly legal. Newt's suitcase was very illegal, as was his bringing all those magical creatures to the US.

Another point is that Hagrid wouldn't let him but a ridiculously expensive and unnecessary expandable trunk, as he stops Harry from purchasing a solid gold cauldron on his first visit to Diagon Alley.

If undetectable extension charms were easy to perform and unregulated, then every Hogwarts student would simply carry a small duffle bag instead of those large and unwieldy school trunks.

** as ive said in a previous thread about magical trunks, i actually like the idea of trunks like Newts, what i dislike is how readily available they are in fanfiction. If such trunks were so easy to come by, why would people like the Weasley's live in such a ramshackle house that's falling apart, rather than a 'manor trunk'.

I personally would like to see a fanfiction where Harry puts a lot of effort into creating such a trunk, rather than just going to a trunk shop and buying one.

Same with Remus, yea werewolfs can't get jobs apparently but if you can make a home in a tent or a trunk, I'm pretty sure you can do it in a tree house or a cave.\\

** The existence of a magic trunk isn't an issue, it's how it's written and used. Much of the canon books have OP items that everyone conveniently forgets about until a specific plot point needs to be reached. That's fine; we all kind of agree to let OP things get forgotten after they've been used.

What causes an issue are the extremes when it's used for everything or used for nothing. I recall one person complaining about "when there's a full chapter description of a magic trunk that's used as... a trunk."

Each example from canon solved a specific, limited problem. How do you fit a whole bunch of wizards camping in a limited space? Magic tents. Where can an imprisoned Moody be? Magic trunk. How Hermione have whatever minor thing they might need? Magic bag. Any new magic thing of holding needs a likewise limited scope, yet definite use.

It therefore does not appear that the UK is inferior or backwards. Fanon also loves to exaggerate social injustice so that the heroes can fight for justice and fix that.

** The problem is not about expendable trunks, the problem is about how this trope is used in most fanfiction.

Newt has a super trunk because it's linked to his job (expert in magical creature), and it's used in the narrative since he use it to always has the animal he needs for a situation.\\
In most fanfic, Harry has a super trunk with a 10 room appartment inside including a musculation room and a jacuzzy, which cost him 10 000 galleons. Yet, after the interminable scene of shopping in Diagon Alley, the trunk is never mentionned again (making Tchekhov role in his grave).

Because of all the bad fanfics, this trope got a bad reputation (though some to like it as a guilty pleasure), but there are still some case where it is well used (like in Seventh Horcruxe where Harry litterally live inside and use it to brew potions).

** I don't mind the idea of it but the issue I have is that 1) it's always on power wank/wish fulfillment fics 2) Harry always has 100 million galleons and this trunk cost 100 galleons so it's like there is literally no feeling of “does the cost justify it?” 3) it's always fitted with all this stuff automatically that take away a feeling of suspense for me. Like has been said the trunk becomes the answer to all their problems. 4) Harry is always the only one to have such a thing because he's so cool. Basically I think for it to be done well any trunk like meets would be the equivalent of many years of work to be able to afford it for the average person if they could ever attain it. It would be amazing to read a fic with Harry learning enchanting and trying and failing countless times to make an apartment like trunk.

***** Those are called scene breaks. While paragraphs generally serve to separate out different ideas, a scene break will mark the changing of, you guessed it, a scene. Fun fact, there are two main styles of writing paragraph and scene breaks. The one you'll most often see in print has a paragraph break portrayed through a single carriage return, and then a single indent to mark a new paragraph, and a scene break is shown simply through two carriage returns. The second style has a paragraph break shown through two carriage returns, forgoing indents entirely, and usually has either a simple horizontal line or some other customized series of symbols or image to create a scene break. The first style, the one with the indents, was used to save paper and squeeze more text into a smaller space.

** I don't know about others, but for me it's the excruciating detail that is often used to describe it. The sentence "Harry went to Gringotts, withdrew money and bought some clothes and a trunk with several compartments" is often stretched into several paragraphs or even a whole chapter.

I suppose it's okay the first few times, but there are so many fics where Harry goes shopping that it's just boring. You don't have to describe every shop, their owners, clerks and every little thing Harry buys. Sometimes less is more.

*** As a writer of fics let me tell you why I do the Alley intro, if the fic is an AU where Harry is being introduced to the Wizarding World for the first time it makes sense that you have to introduce characters as well as places at least once. I do it with the understanding that you the reader may not know every necessary location in the world, but I also only go into some detail for the relevant stores where things happen like character interaction. I like the idea that you the reader haven't had to necessarily read the books to understand what's going on in my stories. I assume that's why everyone else does it.

**** I absolutely love reading various fanfic authors' unique versions of Diagon Alley! And particularly Ollivander, who may be an eccentric old man, or a being with rather a large degree of omniscience who's old enough to be Salazar's grandpa. The ubiquitous Gringotts experience is always great fun to read, as well. And Harry might get a few galleons and a cart ride, or an inheritance test showing him to be Lord Everything of the Ancient and Noble Houses of Yadayada! It's great fun to see what a creative fanfic writer will conceive of, that's not been used before! Thank you for sharing your insight, and for sharing your stories.

** Arguably the problem isn't with the trunk itself but with the baggage it comes with (pun definitely intended). Its always used as if its the most ridiculous thing that Harry wouldn't have one of these because they are "oh so common and useful," in a fairly clear backhanded compliment of canon HP. That already sets a large precedent for what the fic will be like.

The obvious problem on a more in-story level is that if its so easy to get these as is depicted in fanfics, why isn't it more common? We only see this in the case of Moody and Newt, both of whom are fairly specialist and talented wizards in their own rights. Rather than a more reasonable explanation, most authors seem to arrive at the conclusion (or some such variation) that its because Harry/Wizards are idiots or being manipulated and kept ignorant.

A more nuanced (and real world explanation) would be less annoying, such as these suitcases/trunks being specially made, unbelievably rare, extremely expensive, or are in fact made and prepared by the individuals themselves. Its a more balanced explanation for why no one else is ever shown to have things like that than "because their morons."

** Even beyond the sheer ridiculousness of the baggage that comes with the trunk, the trunk itself is often problematic. The magic on such a trunk would likely be impressive and the price exorbitant, or perhaps it might not even be possible to buy it normally. And yet if it was possible to buy Draco and a bunch of other kids would probably have one, and then it probably wouldn't be used as a plot device since more people would know of it. With people like Newt or Moody, it makes sense since they're adult wizards who probably spent a lot of resources obtaining it, but for Harry, it's just usually ridiculous.

** It all boils down to Chekov and his gun. In Fantastic Beasts, the super trunk is used often and is plot relevant. In fanfics, the magic trunk is often mentioned early once and never talked about again; you introduce Chekov's gun but it's never fired--this is bad writing.

Is it a good trope? Depends on how the trunk is used, but if you have an Indy Harry story where he gets so many powerups he never then uses, you might as well not have those powerups mentioned in the story (parodies and satires notwithstanding).

  I mean, if Newt can have a national park in his suitcase, what's the problem with Harry's trunk being as big as a house inside?
#+end_quote

The "Harry gets a massive mansion-sized trunk, sometimes even with entire pastures inside" idea existed as a trope (cliche?) in the fandom for a long time, at least since the Goblet of Fire book (2000).

Newt's suitcase has been introduced pretty much recently (2016), and I have a strong suspicion that it has been added deliberately after fan fiction made mega uber massive trunks popular.

** It's because A trunk like Newt's only recently appeared in Fantastic Beasts. It was absent from the books and movies. Also before the trope became canon, a trunk with a national park in it seemed a bit unrealistic, even for Harry Potter.

Plus Harry with Trunk trope is usually used in those cliche overpowered fics. That could also be why it's not liked.

** I actually cringe when Harry (Newt) closes living creatures into ‘Teh Trunk' and then shrinks it. It seems to me that even magical creatures need OXYGEN. And when wizards shrink everything from a trunk to a muggle subdivision and pocket the stuff, I feel like it's got to be super-dense and weigh a TONNE. And that anything living in there has imploded. There must be some laws of science and nature operating, despite Wizard Space, when living things are shrunk within a magically constructed trunk, to the size of an iPod. I can only suspend disbelief so far!
