I was browsing my old favorites on ffnet from when I was a teenager. The oldest one was a Draco/Hermione empathy fic where they drink a potion and can accidentally feel what the other is feeling for eternity.

It was really bad ---- but now I'm curious.

What are your favorite empathy fics? It could be as a result of a potion, or charm, or accident. I'm open to any pairing, 2+ people, AU or canon-compliant, romantic or within any genre, etc. If specificity is helpful, the ships I've been reading lately are SS/HG, DM/HG, DM/HP, NL/PP, and PW/PP.


** Probably not exactly what you mean, but did you consider the idea of an Empath? Like a specific gift for a wizard/witch allowing them to feel other peoples feelings, emotions, pain? It is what [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] series is based on, and I really like it.
