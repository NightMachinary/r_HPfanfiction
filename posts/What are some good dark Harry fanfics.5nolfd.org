** My reply and list derived from my previous reply here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5b3ggn/lf_really_dark_harry/d9m2bew/]] You may find that thread useful for other possible stories that may fit your criteria.

With respect to evil Harry stories, you might enjoy some of the following stories. They mostly focus more on psychological, character driven horror than outright blood and gore. They're also relatively quick to read, so you shouldn't have any issues digesting these stories:

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3375683/1/Gaslight][Gaslight]]/ by BellonaBellatrix | linkffn(3375683) : A post-DH Ginny-centric story of psychological horror and suspense that explores the phenomenon and concept of "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting][gaslighting]]," where Ginny's grasp of reality is progressively assailed, as primarily seen through interactions between Ginny and Harry.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/982805/1/][Ruined in a Day]]/ by Net Girl | linkffn(982805) : A sixth year and on oneshot that explores Harry's psyche and relationships as he becomes colder, more ruthless, more Dark over time, goaded on by forces both external and internal. This is the the first part of a series of oneshots that explores Harry's descent, followed up by /[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/998830/1/][Sea of Sin]]/, /[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1012428/1/][Black Celebration]]/, /[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1053367/1/][Examination of Conscience]]/, and concluded with /[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1327830/1/][Through a Glass, Darkly]]/. These were written prior to the /Order of the Phoenix,/ but I think if you enjoy reading Dark Harry stories at all, you will definitely enjoy these.

/[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=750393&postcount=73][Intoxication]]/ by nos tres reges: A portrait of a deeply disturbed Harry, who stalks and obsesses over Daphne Greengrass. While the pairing between Harry and Daphne is front and center here, it is used to explore and develop Harry's burgeoning darkness. Unfortunately taken off of FFN, so you'll have to download the attachment in the link provided. (You may need DLP membership, which is free to obtain)

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11564067/1/The-Last-Enemy][The Last Enemy]]/ by Luolang | linkffn(11564067): A post-DH divergence oneshot that attempts to sketch out a route through which Harry, via his canonical character traits, hopes, dreams, and fears, might descend into darkness on his own terms. /Disclaimer/: I wrote this story, as you can see.

**** As I've mentioned before, I had partially written a follow-up multishot to /The Last Enemy/, where Harry comes back to Britain as a very changed individual after several years. It would be a Hermione POV though, with Harry acting as the main antagonist. (Though Tom significantly features as well...)

However, I ultimately nixed the idea because I feel that /The Last Enemy/ largely accomplishes what I intended it to: it shows a somewhat plausible path by which Harry could turn to darkness through the very traits that served him so well in canon: his love for others, his determination, his "saving-people-thing," etc.

It might be interesting to read about Harry's journey into darkness with Tom, or his plans when he returns to Britain, but I felt that such a story wouldn't have much of a point or focus behind it. The ending to /The Last Enemy/ was deliberately left open-ended in that the actual nuts-and-bolts of the plot itself aren't as important to the story as exploring the themes aforementioned and any addition to the story would probably be beating a dead horse at best.

That said, I have planned out and likely will write a trio of oneshots in the future that explore similar themes, sort of spiritual successors to /The Last Enemy/ instead of a proper sequel, so you may want to keep an eye out for that at least.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** i haven't read it in a couple of years but i think linkffn(2044600) might fit what you're looking for? harry isn't deliberately cruel at first but he does end up doing a lot of evil things because (imo) an in character reason. it's a sequel to linkffn(1646940) which isn't quite as dark

  To what length would Harry go to keep his promise? Harry goes back home and is about to start his fifth year in Hogwarts 'again'. He is confused and doesn't know what to do with Voldemort anymore. Are they friends? Or foes? Sequel to Learn from History

** "The Sum of Their Parts", linkffn(11858167): he, Ron, Hermione, George, and his other DA friends became progressively darker and more ruthless. By the end, they left behind a huge body count and were quite fond torturing their enemies. And yet, I couldn't help but root for them.

"Broken Chains", linkffn(7718942): Harry fell through the Veil along with Sirius and ended up in SW universe. Palpatine captured him and successfully turned him into a vicious Sith. After spending 4 years in the SW universe (but only 41 days in the HP world), he returned. Hermione and later Luna moderated him somewhat, but at cost of becoming quite dark themselves. They commit a serious number of atrocities, but also did many good things.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** Here's a couple. The second one (repercussions) isn't the best writing or anything but it does have a Harry that's as bad as Voldemort.
