are there any fics that deal with how legitimately awful the weasley family treated percy, even before he cut ties? also, if you're commenting just to say he's a horrible person and deserved it, please just don't


** On the one hand, Weasley bashing fics are a dime a dozen, but on the other hand, you'd be hard pressed to find one that brings up legitimate issues of theirs, rather than just saying "I mean they're /probably/ evil, based on nothing in particular."

** They don't quite call out the rest of the Weasleys, but they're written from Percy's perspective in canon events and give good reasons for why he acted the way he did.

** Am I allowed to mention one I writing? It's Percy centric but is based in the timeline of another story I wrote. The dynamic between his family and the split is looked at but because it diverts from cannon certain events unfold differently.

The story is Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12373273/1/Mr-and-Mrs-Percy-Weasley]]

While not finished it's very nearly there and I am actively writing it I promise.

*** Oh, you are the author! Ohhhh ... “Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley” is one of the best stories I know about, and you certainly made my head firmly decided that Audrey just had to be a Muggle. ;) Thank you!

**** I had some problems with “Escape” (my attitude towards Harmony is rather problematic and your story shows many of its problems), but when Harry & Hermione are out of picture, the story is so much better. And yes, Snape-McGonagall relationship is another beauty (again, that's one of saving graces for “Escape”). Thank you.

There is [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/review-of-escape-and-mr-and-mrs-percy-weasley.html][a complete review]] of those stories.

*** I love your story. I recommend it here all the time. It's brilliant and the most in character yet sympathetic Percy and I feel like his relationship with Audrey is believable. I like your angle of Percy working undercover but since he's alone he only has so much time to save people

  Post DH AU. Percy doesn't reconcile and Fred isn't dead: Percy is now assistant to his father... the new Minister for Magic! The man that Percy said had no ambition! Arthur tortures Percy with worthless errands and tasks out of spite. However, realising that Arthur knows little about managing the wizarding world, Percy tries to make sure the Ministry doesn't collapse overnight!

  AU-ish. After the Percy/Arthur row---Percy wanders into muggle London where he is a victim of a memory charm during a Death Eater attack. Having no memories of his life in the wizarding world and lacking the most basic understanding of how the muggle world works, Percy struggles to adapt. Audrey, a muggle, takes interest... and an owl is following Percy around for some reason.
