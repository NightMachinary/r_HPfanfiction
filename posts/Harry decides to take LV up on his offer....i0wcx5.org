Towards the end of PS, Voldemort offers Harry the chance to join him saying

"â€˜Better save your own life and join me ... or you'll meet the same end as your parents ..."

Does anybody know of a fic in which Harry takes him up on the offer and joins the dark side?


** I'm pretty ashamed to say that I totally would have taken that offer at 11. The ability to bring people back to life and gain power? Even now, I'd be tempted.

*** Well, if Voldemort had lied, then you would have been totally screwed.

At least Harry was smart enough not to trust him.

Throughout the series, we have witnessed multiple times that Voldemort was indeed a pathological liar.

**** Well, that's the only reason I wouldn't take it. He's someone who lies and who would kill their subordinates if they become threatening.

If I knew 100% that I could become as skilled as him, at the cost of helping him get the stone, I probably would.

*** I like to think that eleven years-old me would be smart enough to ask for a guarantee and after some research ask for an unbearable vow, but truth is, I don't know for sure, though the bit about not being restrained in which magic to practice would be very tempting, maybe put something about Snape having to die in extreme agony somewhere too?

** linkffn(8704528)

Harry is raised in an orphanage and /hates/ Muggles.

He is slowly manipulated by Voldemort(without him realizing), who uses his ambition on gaining power and his thirst for knowledge to gradually(and secretly) guide him to the Dark Side.

He does become a Death Eater(Inner Circle) IIRC.

  Harry was left at an orphanage after his parents met their demise. There, he finds nothing but suffering until he rejoins the Wizarding World. Dumbledore may hope for Harry to be a kind soul, but he's made mistakes. And what he gets is a future Death Eater. Harry is Dark, Harry is ruthless, and he is siding with Voldemort.

  Voldemort persuades Harry to assist him in a war against unspeakable evil. Hermione gains a second father, and the Gryffindor boys discover that Animagus transformations are as hard as they sound. Meanwhile, the enigmatic, murderous Marionette Man unleashes destruction on the wizarding world. An AU fifth year.

** !linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chaos of Ashes by SlenderGnome) is a fic with that premise. It's a spinoff of ACI100's Ashes of Chaos that diverges in the mirror room.

  Departing from 'Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos', what would happen if Harry had taken Lady Voldemort on her offer in the mirror chamber? It's not like there was anything for him in the outside world. Might as well get some tutelage from the Greatest Dark Witch Since Morgana and some sweet revenge.
