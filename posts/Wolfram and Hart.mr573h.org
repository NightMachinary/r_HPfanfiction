Hi all, I've got a fic search request I hope you can help me with.

I know that Buffy crossovers are pretty common, but are there any with the Angel sub-series that focus on a terrifying Harry interacting Wolfram and Hart?

I vaguely remember three/four? stories, one being a Buffy cross, that fit this search, but I wonder if there are any more?

- Fallen, which petered out: Harry may or may not be the avarar of Lucifer; everyone becomes convinced he is Lucifer and are terrified, the demons especially. He also begins to pseudo-date Dawn, who knows that he's actually just Harry compared to the Mr Black reputation he's starting to gain.
- I can't remember the name of this one, but it's where Harry joins their junior program because of a pact Lily made to keep him alive -- his soul was kept safe by them. Lily herself is in a Lilah-like state, working eternally for Wolfram and Hart's record department. It was a one-shot in someone's one-shot collection, IIRC?
- Another one I can't remember the name of: Wolfram and Hart try to persuade Harry to do something. Luna turns out to be one of the great grandkids (not like Eve, but an actual biological grandkid) of one of the Senior Partners, and she scares the shit out of Holland Manners. This may be the same as the second fic, I'm not sure. Another oneshot.
- A oneshot somewhere (part of a collection?) that had Lily, James, and Sirius as the Wolf, Ram, and Hart deciding to live mortal lives as a change -- until Voldemort came'a'calling. After re-embodying herself with James after being "killed", she goes absolutely batshit insane, which terrifies Wolfram and Hart employees worldwide as each office sets off an "oh shit" signal (I remember the Hawaiian branch being the goddess Pele's moan).

Are there any more like this? Or where Harry's this unintentionally terrifying force/entity in the Buffyverse?

I had a weird thought about Harry making a deal with the Senior Partners to be their new go-between in the White Room -- Jasmine and the Beast hesitate to go in there unlike in canon with the other gods because "death comes for all in the end, including beings from a higher plain of existence. Death is universal, eternally patient, and ultimately inescapable. We all have an expiry date, be it one year, a century, a millennia, an eon..."

Lilah ends up being reassigned as his personal gofer, with the promise her contract will be released after a hundred years or so (so she can finally die/move on to a heaven-like afterlife, thanks to a deal the Senior Partners made).

I kinda like the angle R Blot had with Mr Black -- all the misconceptions growing and growing were hilarious. Even though Terminal Justice got a bit silly for even that setting in the end, I did love how they kept coming to conclusions like he was an archangel, et cetera.

There's Lily and the Art of Sisyphus, but I never could get into that or its spin-offs. No idea why, as it's pretty interesting a concept.

Just one caveat: I'm not interested in slash. Sorry, just not my preference.

**** For the record, this one only became an Angel crossover because some of my pre-readers remarked that my utterly fictional law firm was a whole lot like Wolfram and Hart.

The whole story was intended as nothing more than a 'lawyers have no souls' joke. I've never seen a single episode of Buffy nor the Angel sequel.

***** To be fair, I'm pretty sure that Wolfram and Hart in Angel was originally intended that way too :D
