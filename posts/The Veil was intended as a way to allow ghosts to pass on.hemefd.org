So we don't really know if canon ghosts can just "do the thing" and vanish, but most evidence suggests they can't, or if they can, they don't do it for various reasons (conscious or subconscious).

We also know that the Veil is a portal to what is believed to be death, or the Afterlife.

So what if the creators of the Veil intended for it to be a device to allow Ghosts passage to the afterlife, artificially? We know that nothing survives passing through it and that nothing has ever come out apart from strange whispering. I think it's a fair theory.

Perhaps it works as intended, or perhaps it works too well, but I doubt it was originally designed to be an execution machine. More likely is this theory, research into the Afterlife or an attempt at exploration.


** I think in canon, the veil was discovered and the ministry built around it. But there are any number of things it could be. I've seen it used as some kind of Stargate, as a dementional wormhole (A Black Comedy), one fic even made it the office the unspeakables work in. I think it's most often used as time travel, which makes my fic feel more cliche, haha.

I have seen some where it does, technically kill. Any matter passed through would vanish, leaving the soul to move on.

*** I read one that had it be a stargate too, but that story wasn't very good.

However, it could make sense if you reinterpret its description from the perspective of someone who has absolutely no idea what a stargate is.

- It obviously has a frame. The movies depict it as square, but this doesn't have to be the case, it could be round as well.

- It stands on a platform of sorts.

- We don't know if it has runes or symbols on it, but if the constellations were present, that would be instantly noted considering all wizards have astronomy in school.

- Curious, then, that the only type of Stargate we know of that doesn't have constellations is the Generation 1 Gate, as present on Destiny.

- Curious also that this gate has a grey event horizon as opposed to a blue one, much more reminiscent of fabric than water.

- It could even be translucent to enhance the ethereal effect - which also has precedence in Stargate Canon. A gate which is open but not connected to a wormhole basically accesses its internal buffer and will have a translucent event horizon.

- This type of gate can't be manually dialled, it needs a remote control or a fixed console, so turning it is out of the question. This remote or console would also be the only way to interface with it, including the retrieval of the patterns inside, if they continue to exist or are even saved in the first place.

- This goes into speculation, but the whispering heard may be the souls of wizards attempting to reach out from the gate's storage, let anyone know they're still alive in some way.

- The activation time would also be explainable - the gate has a time limit on connections, but not on actually generating the horizon. So this gate has been 'open' for untold millennia, the buffer packed with people, some of whom are the worst criminals the world has to offer.

All in all, it's a very plausible way to do a crossover, given some considerations like the gate's type and such. It could easily spin off into someone reversing the gate's horizon and sending people tumbling out - first Sirius, who is just confused, then a bunch of hardline criminals who start tearing shit up in the chamber, and over time the people coming out start to change - they begin to remember their time in the buffer, remember being trapped in a virtual darkness, aware but not awake - then, people begin coming out that found ways to reach out, the whispers - and finally, people come out that aren't really people anymore, driven mad or to complere apathy by the isolation. The last layer would be those first unfortunate souls who were at the bottom of the buffer, and therefore compressed without mercy as more was piled on top. What was meant as short-time data compression turned into millennia-long consciousness suppression that only got stronger over time, until their minds and bodies and eventually souls merged together on a conceptual level. The last thing to come out of the gate is a lovecraftian abomination, a shoggoth made from the compressed, smushed and warped bodies and souls of hundreds if not thousands of wizards, muggles and everything inbetween.

We need more Stargate crossovers that deal with something other than "Harry is an ancient" or "Harry is a child".

** It would explain why there are so little ghost everywhere when Hogwarts has dozens of them. I'm personally fond of thinking the veil to be the bridge mentioned in the Tale of Three Brothers. The veil originally had a purpose that allowed one to cheat death, so Death gave the three brothers each a gift in exchange of turning the bridge into a bridge leading to death.

** Well, however it does it, we do know it kills the people who pass through it. Sirius was able to be called by the resurection stone.

** Ghosts aren't souls, they're merely imprints one leaves behind.

It seems that if you die with great regrets, while you'll move on, you'll leave behind a ghost.

Given that ghosts are imprints driven by past regrets, it seems like moving on would be more about letting go of the past.

I think it's more likely that some unspeakable created a portal to the afterlife for research purposes. They are a research division, after all, and not SAC.

***** It would still be true that the ghost we know as Nearly Headless Nick didn't die if Sir Nick the ghost was not precisely the same as Sir Nick the Human.

what he said was that he was irrelevant, and that he chose his feeble imitation of life.

I think it's fear of dying, and either way, the only reason Voldemort didn't become a ghost is likely because there was little to imprint. Although, we aren't really given that answer, maybe the ghost of Tom riddle does in fact haunt Hogwarts these days.

*** The veil predates the ministry so they cant have made it.

I don't like the idea myself that anything mundane created it. Some of my favourite scenes in HP involve the overlapping of old, mysterious magics with the modern magic of HP. Gives the world much more depth.
