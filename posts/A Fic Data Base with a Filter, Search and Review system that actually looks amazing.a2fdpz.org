There is a new fanfiction database being made: [[https://ficdb.com]]. It actually looks really good. I just wanted to know if any of you had heard of it, and what you thought of it?

** Looks very slick. Needs more members, submissions, and reviews as there's barely two pages of HP fics.

** These kinds of things are user generated, so the sooner we all get in there and start adding fanfics, the better it'll be. I can see it being a huge well supported database, for at the minimum easily tracking your own reading much less helping others.
