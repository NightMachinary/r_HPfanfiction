I think the bonding takes place in the CoS and I know that as a result they get a phoenix that bonds to the two of them and they can talk mentally with it and each other. I believe it also lets them know that the dog Harry sees when he summons the knight bus is at least an Animagus if not Sirius black. Been looking for this for awhile any help would be appreciated.


** Possibly The Bonds of Blood. Definitely bond in CoS and opens a mental link, but I don't recall the rest. Linkffn(The Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs)
