Id say spoilers, but i think it has been long enough.

So in a fanfic i have recently finished, Harry captures Voldy at the end of book 4/the fic. He is put on trial and sentenced to death. Receives a dementors kiss and thats that.

Obviously that got me thinking a bit... Does this way circumvent the whole safety net of horcruxes? If the soul is destroyed/taken (sorry its been a while since i read PoA), what happens to the pieces in the horcruxes? Do they fade, do they stay, could Tom return from this?

Anyhoo, id love to hear your thoughts on this

Edit: as some of you mentioned, Death ≠ Dementor Kiss. I am aware of that, i simply mispoke. My apologies.


** Anybody's answer is just going to be guesswork but...

My gut says that that only takes care of whatever soul he's got left. Somehow I just don't see dementors being able to pull whatever threads are connecting the pieces and get the rest, too.

Of course the whole thing assumes that he's got enough soul left in his body that the dementors even care. Because I'm honestly not so sure that he does - it's not as if he's got a whole lot left no matter HOW you think it breaks apart during the process (series of half, concious choice, some sort of random percentage idk). And they feed on happiness. Idk if happy is a word I'd use to describe Voldemort. I'm not sure it's an emotion he can even feel. I just... is he even worth the effort?

But that mess aside... if Voldemort thought the dementors could get to the horcruxes through him... would he have recruited them? Somehow I doubt it.

Also random side note in this comment of side notes: the dementors kiss and death are... not the same thing.

*** Mostly agree with all this, but a couple corrections:

  And they feed on happiness.
#+end_quote

They usually feed on happiness, yes, when they're doing their usual going-around-making-people-miserable thing. But we don't know that the Dementor's Kiss is just an extension of that --- maybe they eat souls for completely unrelated reasons, and so the happiness in the soul doesn't matter.

#+begin_quote
  Idk if happy is a word I'd use to describe Voldemort. I'm not sure it's an emotion he can even feel.
#+end_quote

I mean, he certainly seems to be doing a lot of "sibilant laughing" in the books. It's probably not cuddly fluffy happiness, but it does seem like he can feel glee, joy, pleasure, etc. just fine.

#+begin_quote
  But that mess aside... if Voldemort thought the dementors could get to the horcruxes through him... would he have recruited them? Somehow I doubt it.
#+end_quote

You could flip that on its head, though --- they are, as a species, the one greatest threat to his immortality, so he makes sure they're on his side early in the game so no one can use them /against/ him.

** Same thing that happens to everyone. He loses that soul that is being kissed. I'd don't think the Dementor would just vaccum all the pieces across Europe, just the one it was kissing.

He'd still have his horcruxes and they might be able to possess someone, but that piece in specific would be eaten.

At least that is what makes sense to me.

** It depends on what a Dementor actually does. We don't know what happens to the soul of a kissed person. Does the Dementor merely extract the soul, which then moves on to the afterlife? Or does the Dementor somehow consume or "keep" the soul?

Assuming that the Dementor's kiss would have any effect on Voldemort:

- If the former, then you'd have the same situation as if Voldemort were killed: his soul would be floating around, anchored to life by the horcruxes. The main difference is that there would be a ready-made soulless body for him to inhabit.

- If the latter, then presumably Voldemort soul would be stuck inside the Dementor. The horcruxes would still exist, and still anchor him to life, but since his soul existing inside a Dementor is not death then the horcruxes would do nothing to protect him from that fate.

There's insufficient canon evidence to determine which of the two situation holds. However, I suspect if JKR were to answer this question, she would give the former answer. This is for two reasons:

1. Harry Potter has a broadly Christian mythology when it comes to the nature of the soul and the afterlife. I doubt JKR would create an Earthly, evil being which is capable of subverting the salvation which awaits pure souls in the afterlife.

2. Dementors represent depression, a condition which is tied to life, and accordingly their powers should not be able to deny people their final peace in the afterlife.

*** But what of the option that the Dementor's Kiss /obliterates/ the soul?

Incidentally, I have my doubts on the first option being the correct canonical one. If the Dementor's Kiss is simply a really scary way to have your soul leave your body and move on, in what way is it a "fate worse than death"? Why is it so much scarier than just being murdered?

I'll grant you that it would be uncharacteristically dark of Rowling to pick the "oblivion" option. But I think the most sensible position for her to pick would be that the soul gets trapped inside the Dementor, being fed on constantly with no way of escape until the Dementor itself dies --- making it the /Harry Potter/ version of Hell (or Purgatory, depending on how you look at it). Which would not be everlasting; tough to kill as they may be, Dementors /can/ die in some circumstances, and so probability dictates that even if it manages to survive for billions of years, any given Dementor will /eventually/ kick the bucket.

If you read the sections in which the characters ruminate on the horror of the Dementor's Kiss, it's the experience of the remaining shell of a body they are horrified by:

#+begin_quote
  “They call it the Dementor's Kiss,” said Lupin, with a slightly twisted smile. “It's what Dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly. I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and --- and suck out his soul.”

  Harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer.

  “What --- they kill ---?”

  “Oh no,” said Lupin. “Much worse than that. You can exist without your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. *But you'll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no... anything.* There's no chance at all of recovery. You'll just exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever... lost.”

***** But that sentence, "you can exist without your soul", only makes sense if the body is all there's left, doesn't it? If your soul is merely separated from your body, one would expect that the /soul/ would be what you'd refer to as "you".

And to this disembodied "you", the body's just a discarded shell, not "yourself". It's probably creepy to look at, but hey, so's a regular, rotting corpse.

By the way, in the same quote, don't the phrasings of "what Dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly" and "your soul is gone forever" seem like they support the "the soul is destroyed" option?

** Firstly, one wonders how Voldemort was ever successfully put on trial. Presumably, if he was somehow captured without possibility of escape, he would just kill himself (that is to say, his body) and float away as a spirit, just like when he abandoned Quirrell's body in the novel version of /Philosopher's Stone/.

One also wonders what Dementor would be willing to Kiss Lord Voldemort. After all, in canon, all the members of the Azkaban Colony sided with him in a heartbeat both times he offered, since he gave them greater freedom (and more souls to eat) than the Ministry did. So I'd expect the Dementor to just escape with Voldemort and work to bring him back, rather than comply with the Ministry's orders and eat his soul (which would make a rather poor meal, being a disgustingly mangled, shriveled cadaver of a soul).

And one wonders at what point your fanfic authors equated "sentenced to death" with "sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss". Those are markedly different sentences, the former of which doesn't even exist in Wizarding British law as far as we know, and the latter of which is reserved for Azkaban escapees.

But moving on...

There's no canonical answer. Perhaps the Dementor would find itself unable to "swallow" Voldemort Prime's soul for as long as the Horcruxes existed. Perhaps the Dementor would refuse to eat the soul even if it theoretically could, due to it being so horribly scarred and mangled, much like even the hungriest lion wouldn't take a bite out of a month-old rotting corpse. Perhaps it would work and Voldemort Prime would be destroyed.

On the other hand, it seems clear to me that having a Dementor swallow Voldemort Prime's soul^{and mark that we don't even know what this does, trap the soul in eternal suffering or dissolve it or /what/} would do diddly-squat to the Soul-Shards in the Horcruxes. The whole point of Horcruxes is that they're split from the main soul.

So theoretically, any of the surviving Horcruxes could get a body for itself, like Diarymort did in /CoS/, and, realizing the original Lord Voldemort was dead and gone, decide to take up the mantle. However, Horcruxes aren't protected by each other (Diarymort died for good when the Diary was stabbed, without the existence of the other Horcruxes mattering an inch), and, already being cast-off soul-shards, I doubt they have enough substance to create Horcruxes of their own --- I think Diarymort would have blown up in a Chamber-shattering KABOOM if he'd tried to create a meta-Horcrux.

This creates interesting possibilities, as this leaves the incarnate-Horcruxes much more vulnerable than the main Voldemort with no way to protect themselves further. Best they could do would be to hide the Horcruxes their sprang from /really really well/, but the moment someone who knows /Fiendfyre/ finds them, they're goners. So perhaps the Horcrux-Voldemorts would be a little less brazen about their plans of conquest, their fear of death overpowering their powerlust, and they'd live obscure lives under false identities, cursing fate and desperately researching some way to grant themselves full existence and immortality.

*** I should probably clarify a bit. The plan during GoF is mainly the same. Harry arrives at the Graveyard, but chooses to sacrifice himself to stop his fellow champion (Fleur this time around) from dying. The horcrux in Harry takes the hit and he survives.

He takes Voldemort by surprise, disarming and stunning him, then takes him back to the castle via the Cup. Voldemort is put in custody, so he cant kill himself. He is put on trial, refuses to speak, is put under veritaserum, then sentenced to a Dementors Kiss (i mispoke here, my bad)

Since this is before he has a body larger than a fetus, and hasnt even talked to the dementors, they are not opposing the ministry and as such he is kissed.

Regarding the rest of your reply, i think i agree. The shards wont be able to create horcruxes themselves but may gain sentience given enough time.

You're telling me Voldemort lacks the wandless magic to self-Force-Choke or something? I find that extremely unlikely. And besides, he could just "float away" from Quirrell without requiring Quirrell to die first; who's to say he couldn't he do the same here with his fœtus-form? Oh well.

But it's not a matter of having talked to the Dementors again. The Dark Lord's alliance with the Azkaban Dementors dates back to the First War --- he didn't have to convince them all over again, they just instantly jumped ship once he let them know he wasn't quite as dead as the Ministry had said. From there it naturally follows that if they just let all his followers escape, they'd be back to the old arrangement, so that's what the Dementors did.

So the moment the Dementors heard the Ministry had captured Voldemort, they'd start thinking up ways to break him out so they can go back to the good old days days of roaming free throughout England and Kissing everyone they please. And when the Ministry requested a Dementor executioner come over to Kiss him, well, the course of action to enact the breakout would be obvious.

I doubt Dementors think in those terms. Being amortal creatures who seem to just coalesce into existence like fungus and never age past that point, they would have at best a shaky grasp of what it /means/ for a wizard to be 14 as opposed to 67. In both cases, that's rather young for a Dementor. It may not occur to them to assume that a 14-year-old wizard would tend to be less skilled than an older one, per se.

Besides, this is assuming the Dementors know the circumstances in which Voldemort were captured.

I'll say that being bested by a half-breed and a relatively poor halfblood wizard would feature in Voldemort's worst memories. I'm going to go and say that there's some form of impassable Legilimency behind the Dementors' ability to make people relive their worst memories, so they can clearly see Voldemort getting bested. If not impassable legilimency, then Voldemort would be injected with so many drugs that he can't properly employ Occlumency.

Albus sort of implies there is a considerable difference between a 16 yo and a 18 yo wizard in the cave, and that even the magic of the inanimate boat can detect that difference. If inherent magic can detect the difference, I see no reason why a creature of magic couldn't. They don't treat bystanders and their prey any differently because the author intended them to be that way, I think.

Also the very fact that Voldemort got himself captured and imprisoned by the Ministry gives anyone the idea that he's not as powerful as he claims to be. Not very good for a Dark Lord to get captured like a common criminal.

He'd still be upset for reasons of their being teenagers, but I don't think their blood status would matter much to him. It's widely believed that he doesn't put much stock in blood-purity per se, but merely upholds its traditions and appearances so the Blood-Purists will do his bidding (his genuine position appears closer to Grindelwald's: Muggles are inferior beings, but a magical's a magical, and if they renounce their non-wizard family and embrace their powers there's nothing wrong with being a half-blood or even Muggle-born /per se/).

Yes, he has Snape working for him, and he offers Harry a place in his ranks twice, and approached Lily once apparently.

He's not obsessed with blood purity, but he's quite intent on eugenics and overall purity of humans. He makes his distaste of half humans and beings not fully human clear quite a few times with Hagrid and Lupin's marriage with Tonks. He definitely views goblins as inferior, but does respect Flitwick (probably because of Flitwick's ability, as you said).

I think that Dementors would have turned their backs on Voldemort as soon as he was destroyed the first time. They definitely strike me as fair weather allies - ones that will stab you in the back the moment they sense an opportunity. Albus (and everyone else) often says that they're twisted beings whose only desire is to feast on happiness and breed - sort of like a very primitive, feral animal, albeit one capable of higher thought where necessary.

What makes you think /these/ comments are any more sincerer than his protests of blood-purity before the Death Eaters?

In truth, my impression is that Lord Voldemort generally despises everyone as pathetic peons that are hopelessly beneath him. Wizard and Muggle and Creature alike. It's politically advantageous for him to pretend that he doesn't feel that way about pure-blood wizards, so he turns off the demeaning comments for them and them alone, all while continuing to spout insults at everybody else. End result is he /looks/ like a human-supremacist blood-purist rather than the omnicidal misanthrope he really is.

Sure, but I don't think this necessarily translates to them not helping Voldemort get back to power if he asked. It's not a /sure/ bet, of course, but a shot at returning to the "Voldemort lets us roam free and eat whatever souls we like" state of events, I think, would always outweigh the status-quo of "the Ministry confine us to the Island, don't give us much of a turnover of food-sources, and only ever let us eat a soul once in a blue moon".

Before being reborn as snakeman!Voldemort the war seemed more wizard-driven than creature-driven, the Acromantulas only joining in later on too. It wasn't until after a number of the Death Eaters had spent quite a while in Azkaban and THEN the Ministry bungled things for years that the Dementors defected, perhaps having been swayed by exposure to the vileness of the incarcerated Death Eaters and finding a complementary resonance with them...

But as of the third task of the Triwizard Tournament the dementors had no obligation to do anything for homuncuMort.

I'm pretty sure this is the reason they went off easy on the inner circle Death Eaters in the interim, and thus why they are still mostly functional after over a decade in Azkaban when Voldemort frees them. But I could be wrong --- the /Harry Potter Wiki/ doesn't seem to record any such thing...

There it's /my/ turn to correct your fanon. Voldemort didn't significantly change appearance in his Resurrection, and if he did, it was not because of the resurrection itself but because he'd made an additional Horcrux in the meantime (Nagini). He already looked basically the same in 1981 as he does in 1994.

#+begin_quote
  the Acromantulas only joining in later on too.
#+end_quote

This is not technically false but a bit of a misleading statement. The Acromantulas never joined Voldemort. They were a third distinct side in the Battle of Hogwarts, whose grudge was, in fact, mostly with Voldemort, though by that point, without Aragog to lead them, they were too unfocused to pay any heed to the fact that not every wizard is a Death Eater.

If there's one "evil-looking" species that would /never ever/ join Voldemort, it's the Children of Aragog. Voldemort is, after all, responsible for blinding their patriarch and driving them into the Forbidden Forest in hiding and for awakening their ancestral enemy the Basilisk... and all that's /before/, in /Deathly Hallows/, he callously drives the entire colony out of their home clearing so he can make it his base. (The clearing where Harry gets hit by the Killing Curse is Aragog's lair emptied of spiders, if you never made the connection.)

That's a clever explanation, but I'd still expect the chosen Dementor to pull back when he actually sees who it is he's supposed to be kissing.

  I always saw it as he could leave quirell because he was dying and he was possessing him.

The movie is obviously coloring your view of this, but in the books, Quirrell /wasn't/ dying from the burns Harry gave him. Instead, he died /because/ Voldemort left him, having realized that Quirrell (whose cover had been blown and would probably going from the Hospital Wing straight to Azkaban) was of no further use to him as a vessel. It's suggested that Quirrell would have died the moment Voldemort decided to leave his body, whatever else happened. This may have been an added incentive for Quirrell to work hard at getting the Stone, since it would have been the only thing allowing him to survive once Voldemort got a body of his own.

  Otherwise why was he dropped in the cauldron?

Because the Regeneration Potion could only /grow/ the rudimentary-body /into/ a fully-functional adult body, as opposed to create the latter ex-nihilo? That's always how I interpreted it.

** I assume it would only SUCC out the soul fragment in his body.His soul is split into 7,so he would still have the 6 in horcruxes.

*** Yeah, i guess that makes sense. Could he recover though? Is there even enough sentience left? Since the horcruxes dont appear too sentient, i has assumed that his mind is connected to the soul in his body...
