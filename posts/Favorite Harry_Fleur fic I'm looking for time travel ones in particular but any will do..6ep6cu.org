**** Yeah it's not exactly a story I'd recommend to someone looking for a certain pairing. Not to mention that it seems to large degree Harry Potter in name only. Shouldn't take much effort to turn it into original fiction.

*** It's an old fic with it's own set of issues, but IMO, it is hard to find a better fic with a better interpretation of Fleur or HarryXFleur.

Most importantly, it avoids the angst so present in a lot of HXF. Better still, I saw no tears. I hate it when harry cries like a little bitch.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  An opportunity comes along that will enable him to make the change and once again reunited with the woman he truly loved. But circumstances have its own plan. A sacrifice would have to be made that will make or break everything he work so hard for. This is the story. Attention:Time Travel. To new readers, please read my profile first before continuing.
