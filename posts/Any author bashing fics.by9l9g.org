I had this idea about a fic where the main character has read canon (pretty common in the SI genre) and knows that he's in a fictional universe and constantly points out plot holes and lazy writing, but criticizing the fanfiction author instead of J. K. Rowling's original work.

For example "Alright, why is it that the story is still following stations of canon even though I changed stuff years ago? Guess you can't think of an original plot? And why is Umbridge called Delores? It's Dolores, stupid!"


** Most authors who write bashing do not perceive it negatively. Therefore you will be hard pressed to find a self-parody which incorporates bashing. There are certainly fics which throw shade at popular tropes or pairings (eg "I'd rather shoot myself than touch Snape's cock!"), but usually its an offhand sentence or paragraph at most, not entire stories.

I almost prefer honest bashing to authors making petty meta comments about other pairings. Maybe I'm too contrary, but they always make me defensive even if I don't care for the character/pairing in question. Like if you hate, say, Draco Malfoy with burning passion, make him an antagonist or something, but throwing in a mocking paragraph on how he is completely unsuitable romantic interest out of nowhere in the middle of the fic that has nothing to do with him and where he doesn't appear once just reads as salty (saw that one recently).

**** The fine art is to set it up in a fashion where it doesn't stand out, eg bantering about UST and then throw something like "Me and Padma? What about you and Snape?" as a comeback. Or, if your story is a little more explicit, Harry (or Hermione) checking out a group of girls and then Malfoy walks through the picture ("hot, hot, meh, nice ass, 7/10, not even when the hell freezes over, meh"). Obviously, the second example is more suitable for erotic comedy like "The Sword of Gryffindor" or "It could only happen to Harry")

** I love these small comments in larger stories where just by the way heroes comment on the book. For example in linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) after Draco Malfoy challenges Harry for the midnight duel, Harry with Hermione (they are adopted siblings in the story) look at each other with the look of incredulity, “Who in the world would be that stupid to fall for that?”.

Or I just finished rereading linkffn(Petrification Proliferation by White Squirrel) and his “I am not JKR” notes in the beginning are hilarious (they always are from him). Like “Should a twelve-year-old girl get counselling after being possessed by a cursed diary? Yes? Then I am not JK Rowling and do not own Harry Potter.” or “Is telling literally no one besides your double agent about your secret plan to kill the bad guy a good idea? No? Then I am not JK Rowling and do not own Harry Potter.”
