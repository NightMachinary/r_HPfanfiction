I just wanted to go on a brief rant about marking fics as complete when they aren't. I've seen it done for a variety of reasons, like it's abandoned but instead of saying abandoned they just stopped and marked it as complete. As complete as it's going to get isn't complete, it's abandoned! Then we have the most common type, the first part of a series where without the sequels it has no ending, and the sequels are abandoned of just as yet unwritten. Can it be read as a stand-alone piece? No? Then until the sequels are done it's not complete, is it. Yes, I know real authors do the same thing, but they have a publisher pushing them to actually finish the sequels on a set deadline, and to help them with finding an appropriate wrapping up point for each book.

What does everyone else think? Should complete mean /everything/ is complete? Should fanfiction even have sequals/trilogies? It doesn't exactly matter how big the book gets if it doesn't need binding.


** I think if each fanfiction in a series is distinct enough that it has its own themes, character arcs and resolution, then it's probably best to separate them. Clumping together a bunch of clearly discrete stories and implying they're a single coherent story is misleading in its own way. I have seen it done before, and if that's how you prefer to write your series then I don't necessarily have a problem with it, but I also see the appeal in writing a series as multiple separate entries.

If an author writes a completed fanfic, for example, then sometime later decides to write a sequel, the first fic doesn't suddenly become incomplete. And if the first book was written as stand alone, it would be really weird to append the sequel to it.

Just to give an example from a non fanfiction:

The webnovel Worm is already insanely long. By itself it's already longer than the entire Harry Potter series. There's no practical or technological reason then, that when the author decided to write a sequel, he couldn't just attach it to the end of Worm. As you said, "it doesn't exactly matter how big the book gets if it doesn't need binding". But Worm was written as a single story. Sure there are sequel hooks, but at the end of Worm the protagonist's character arc is complete, her journey is over. The sequel, Ward, is separate enough that it would be incredibly jarring to go straight from one to the other without some kind of delineation. Hence the author decided to upload it as a separate story, with its own website. I don't think the fact that Ward is currently incomplete makes Worm any less complete, nor do I think they should have been published together as a single story

On the other hand if an author arbitrarily divides up a story that is clearly being written as a single unit, then I think that is rather misleading, and should be avoided if possible. Obviously though, this isn't black and white, and some stories in a series are more stand-alone than others.

*** Well put, I think I was pissed as the story I just read was not a complete, stand alone fic. It didn't have an ending, it just stopped. There were no character arcs resolved, and the "sequel" was just a continuation of the story. The sequel is of course abandoned.

** Finishing a work - actually completing a story - is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated qualities of a fanfiction author. I know we're doing this for fun, not for money, and no one should expect us to work as if we were professional authors - meaning, force ourselves to write even if we don't want to - but I don't consider any author great if they don't go that extra mile and finish their stories, nor do I consider any story great if it's not finished.

*** And creating a good ending seems to be a challenge in of itself. I have read more than a few stories that have weak endings.

**** I've gone the J.K. Rowling route for my story. I /already have/ my ending written out. The best part is at worst if I completely lose interest I can just add a few paragraphs summing up the in-between, add it as an Epilogue, and bam, instant closure. Not that I plan to do anything like that, but it's a nice contingency solution to have.

***** That's probably a good idea. I wish the same could be said for other stories I have read.

** Series are not the same as long stories. They have distinct books, with distinct arcs and plotlines. Marking book one as complete is perfectly reasonable even if book four is still in progress.

Much more so with HP, we have a preset yearly template with the series itself, it's only natural that fanfiction writers would follow the same 'one book one year' formula.

That said, I've seen people post a story in short 'books' that clearly don't follow any sort of structure, as though to just top the 'recently posted stories' list as frequently as possible, and /that/ irks me.

** The first ever story I've read (back when I was unaware that a "complete" tag existed, was abandoned 200k words in because apparently, the author had died. Lesson learned, I began with bonds of time (which was marked as complete). ~400k words later, I find out that there's a sequel, so I read another 400k words. And oh look, there's part 3. I soon realised that it was abandoned ~50k words in and the author moved on to different projects. I felt more than a little disappointed back than, after reading nearly a million words for nothing. The author had blasted himself in a gigantic hole and didn't know a way out (and I don't see one either without massively rewriting what is already published).
