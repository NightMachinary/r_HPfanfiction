I have no idea how this would go down, but we have fics where Harry becomes a church inquisitor or learns magic before Hogwarts.

So how about one where he finds a book on Buddhism or maybe Taoism and when trying to find more on it, he uncovers some of those Wuxia novels where Taoist monks can seal spirits with talismans or Buddhist monks can become incredibly durable and ends up recreating those feats by magic?

It would be good seguay into comedy too, can you imagine a Harry Potter who either pretends to be a wise monk is in actuality one? It would piss of the Dursley's something fierce. Or he could meet Dumbledore and they have contests on who is the better at mysterious and enigmatic speeches.


** there is a brilliant story about harry finding his chakra and then deciding to start an apocalypse.
