** There's one where he is MoD and gets summoned by Dumbledore to a new universe, with a Harry already in it. Can't remember the name of it, but it's quite good. After 5th year, I think? But it's not terribly long, and still in progress (I think/hope). The HP he gets summoned to is the only person he can physically interact with without soul-removal, so he's kinda desperate for contact. And becomes a hugger.

its not what you're asking for, but it's similar. if someone else can remember what its called, its worth a read.

edit: yeah, that one. thanks friend.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

***** Hard to explain but possible. "Symbolic vanquishing" shenanigans could land the Elder Wand into his possession early (or perhaps Dumbledore hoped to bypass the wand's bloody history by gifting it to Ollivander to sell as one of his normal wands, and it ends up choosing Harry?), Dumbledore already gives him the cloak in first year... The Stone is a harder nut to crack, but I can think of a few leads (if one wants to keep it simple, maybe his having already vanquished Voldemort once means he has a claim to the Stone and only needs to actually /claim/ it for it to be considered his).

****** For the Wand I suppose you could pretty easily say that Voldmort already got his hands on it. Maybe he actually beat Dumbledore in a duel, but Dumbledore got away.

That would mean that when Harry becomes the Boy-Who-Lived, he gets the Wand. It just like.. appears when he goes to the wand shop or something. Works for me.

In that case, you'd better have a good reason for how Harry survived Voldemort's Elder Wand Avada Kedavra.

Harry gets the Cloak easily.

Hmm. If Voldemort owned the Wand, I don't think it would be unrealistic for him to also want to wear the Stone at the same time. 2/3. He might have spent more time researching and could have expected to take the Cloak at the same time as killing the Potters. I think this actually works quite well, it would provide a solid reason for why Dumbledore took the Cloak. Just in case Voldemort got to Potters, he wouldn't get the third Deathly Hallow.

******** Why thank you.

... I can't think of a good reason why Harry would survive though. But I guess we didn't /really/ get one for why he survived in canon either.

Unlesssssssssss....

Voldemort cannot truly master a Deathly Hallow - he is utterly incapable of accepting or facing Death.

The Death Stick strikes again, sabotaging him. Maybe combined with Lily-Sacrifice.
