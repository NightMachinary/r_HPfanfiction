I look for fics in which snape gets fanoned. He becomes this super magic powerhouse realizes his mistakes with Lily and them kills voldemort. Or something like that.

I ask because I read the worm crossover [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/path-to-victory-%E2%80%93-a-severus-snape-story-worm-hp.357413/][Path to victory]] in wich snape becomes op and is on the way to do the above said.

Sadly it's not finished and I realized that I am deeply in sympathy with Hogwarts aged snape.


** What is "Hogwarts aged snape"? He spent basically his entire life from 11 there apart from his brief stint as a Death Eater -- do you mean teacher Snape or Marauder-era Severus or something else alltogether?

  Dying with those wonderful green eyes filling his vision, Severus Snape travels to the afterlife to be given an offer by Dumbledore: a chance to return to his tortured past to have a second opportunity at life. Awakening at the moment of his worst memory, can Sev conquer his teenage demons to become the bravest man ever known by the one he TRULY cared for, Lily Evans?

** Linkffn(6586583) The Prince's Harem is pretty funny. Snape gets pantsed (as in canon) but it has a different result that leads to him basically winning the war. No actual harem (thank god) but also he doesn't end up with lily.

It's lighthearted, and the writing is ok. It is first person which I normally can't stand

  Inspired by the movie "Easy A" & Severus in the staring role. Hogwarts Rumor Mill starts working overtime & Severus is no longer shunned by those of the female persuasion. Warnings for teenage type humor and bizarre ways of offing Death Eaters and Horcruxes.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

  In Worm you might gain phenomenal powers on your worst day. Snape snapped after the werewolf incident and triggered with Path to Victory, the power that tells you the steps necessary to attain any goal. Follow Severus as tackles his troubles, and the Wizarding World's, with the help of a nigh omniscient voice whispering pretty things to him in the back of his mind.
