Has anybody else been getting ads throughout the chapter when reading on their mobile? I use firefox for my fanfic reading, and lately I've been getting ads all down the page, interspaced in the words.

Just trying to figure out if it's me, my browser, or common now.


** Just get brave browser. (Adblock works very well)

Or install the ffn app.

*** It happened on a fic I got recommended from here, and on another. Also with one I didn't find here, but from an author's page. It's not unbearable, but it is annoying.

** No ads for me. Only at the end of the page. Using chrome mobile incognito window.

Edit: Now I'm getting them.
