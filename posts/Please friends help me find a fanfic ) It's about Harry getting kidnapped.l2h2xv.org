:END:
It was a really good one I read about Harry getting kidnapped by Death Eaters in like maybe 5th year or something, and he gets held at Malfoy manor and Snape rescues him and then he goes to the BURROW and he is struggling with trauma with help from WEASLEYS!!! :) Please help me if you know what it is, I can't believe I didn't download it already! :( But I will if anyone can find it! I love sweet good Weasley family!!!


** Is this it? [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13621957/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-AU-Rewrite]]

How might OoTP have panned out differently? After failing to escape Voldemort in the graveyard Harry is captured and imprisoned in Malfoy Manor - almost certain this is the end until Voldemort lets him go free.  An Alternate Universe story where not everyone at the Ministry believes Fudge's story, and Harry has to take matters into his own hands.
