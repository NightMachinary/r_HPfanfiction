Just an idea.

Probably gave nightmares to every chemical engineer on the subreddit.


** Presumably you're giving this death trap to some construct I hope? Because I would not want to be the one using that lol.

If we're talking about nightmarish fusions of magic and muggle science, how about cooling some nerve gas down until it freezes, transfiguring it into a pebble or something, the tossing it and casting finite to remove the transfiguration?

*** A time-based alchemy trigger that swaps the subatomic charges on a knut - turning it into pure antimatter, which subsequently annihilates and causes quite a large explosion.

Choose an area. Cast a spatial expansion spell on it, causing space-time to warp into a bubble of stretched space, with a border of compressed space-time. Ideally, your construct takes up an almost flat plane in the corridor you want to trap. Now, use transfiguration to collapse the higgs field inside your trap - the vacuum collapse will not propagate past your bubble, because its edge is too compressed and high-energy. Now, lure your enemies into the corridor, and watch their bodies dissolve as the atoms they are made from lose the concept of mass.

Cast the spatial expansion spell, tied to a trigger that undoes it, on a strengthened nook about 10x10cm in size. The spell should ideally create a chamber with a fake door at the end. Bespell this fake door with as many locking and sealing spells as you can. Once all your enemies are busy unsealing the fake door, close the real door and transfigure it into part of the wall, locking them inside. Cover the room in an anti-apparition charm. Undo the spatial expansion.

**** Are you /really/ sure you want to be messing with vacuum decay anywhere within several billion light-years of Earth? Because in any practical scenario, that's an /oops/ that deletes the entire Earth in 1/25 of a second.

***** Harry can do it. Because vacuum decay isn't Voldemort, so it can't kill him while Voldemort is still alive.
