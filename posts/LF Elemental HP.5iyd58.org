Hello all, I'm hunting for a specific FF where Harry is trained in various elements one at a time. The key piece I remember is him leaving an rose created from ice that wouldn't melt on Hermione's pillow while he was in the middle of training.

As an aside, any Elemental stories would be interesting to read.

Happy Christmas!


** I have no clue about the story you requested, but I like Linkfffn(Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power) as a guilty pleasure Elemental Harry fic.

  A story about Harry in Slytherin house wielding the elder wand and the powers of an elemental. Features annoying Weasley's, an OFC, a flawed but good Dumbledore, an indifferent Snape and lots and lots of twists.

***** I've tried reading this but all of the characters seem to be total brats at least in the first 4 chapters. I know you can argue that 11 yearolds acting like snots is reasonable, but McGonagall was incredibly unprofessional for someone who regularly introduces muggleborn into the wizarding world. I guess it just wasn't to my tastes.

** The fic you requested sounds really familiar, but I can't seem to find it. I think it was a "Harry and three friends are heirs to the Founders" fics, so you might try looking for those. As for other elemental stories, try these:

  Ginny is setting everything on fire, and Harry is calling down storms and throwing lightning out of his hands. How things would change if Harry's power was something different and he had to learn how to use it along with understanding a mysterious bond.

  Harry Potter's temper has always been rather dangerous, but it's not until things start bursting into flames that people realise exactly how fiery it is. And now that the fire's been lit, Harry isn't all that willing to let it be smothered again, in fact he's all for letting it burn. And should the Ministry or Voldemort stand in his way? Well... fire solves everything.
