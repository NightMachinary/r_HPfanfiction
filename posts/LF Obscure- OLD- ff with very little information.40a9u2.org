OKAY. So I read a really- REALLY- good fanfiction that started in marauder era, and followed an OC into the HP canon. I don't remember names or anything, the OC was partnered with Sirius Black, and considered him guilty like Remus and the rest of the wizarding world. She went on to become an auror because of it all, with Mad Eye Moody as a mentor. In the story Mad Eye had had a family who was killed and that was what made him what he was.

I so wish I remembered more, I don't even remember WHEN I read this- some time between 2001-2005? forever ago.

I am currently writing my own ff along the lines of this plot, but would much rather read the original inspiration again!

Thanks!


** pretty sure it was on FF.net

*** Something about those details is scratching at a memory but I can't quite place it. I think maybe the OC is one of the named members of the OotP. Hestia Jones is the primary suspect, but it could have been Emmaline Vance or Dorcas Meadows (even though she died in 1981 in canon).

**** That DOES sound familiar, but I think it was before the release of OotP- damn my memory!

***** This is probably not what you're looking for, but in Reunion by Rorschach's blot, Aurora Sinistra (astronomy professor) was in love with him but believes him to be guilty. It's a side plot at best though.
