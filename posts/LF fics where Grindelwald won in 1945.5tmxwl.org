I can only remember reading two fics where Grindelwald won. One was where Harry accidently apparated into Dumbledore's house, and Tom Riddle was Headmaster of Hogwarts, and Riddle additionally wore mask covering his face, as he'd been heavily disfigured during his days at the "MRS". All I can remember of the second is that Grindelwald personally killed Harry's parents.

Are there any other good ones out there?

In linkffn(10210053) Grindelwald didn't win but neither did Dumbledore. Harry's parents were killed by Grindelwald but Britain is not under his control. The fic isn't very far yet but as far as I can tell the war is kind of on pause. Grindelwald controls most of Eastern Europe, the fic isn't that clear on the borders but i'm pretty sure France and Germany are under Allied control.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.
