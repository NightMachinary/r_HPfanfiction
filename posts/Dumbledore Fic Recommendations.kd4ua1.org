Hi guys, I love a bit of Dumbledore bashing as much as the next FF reader but fancy some good Dumbledore atm. Looking for fics where Dumbledore has a overall positive influence on Harry's life and maintains a good relationship with Harry. Dumbledore doesn't have to be infallible, just mainly good.

Also, any fics that tell the story from Dumbledore's POV would also be appreciated; these don't necessarily have to be good or bad Dumbledore.

Thanks in advance.


** Dumbledore is a major character - and a positive influence - in many of my stories. You might like "Divided and Entwined", "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief" and "Patron" as well as "The Dark Lord Never Died" and "Uncle Quentin's Spy" - he's one of the POV characters in all of them.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** - The delightful “Wallpaper Moments by St Margarets” linksiye(2036) leads to few sequels which lead finally to longer story “Red Is The Heart By St Margarets” linksiye(2902). Highly recommended.

- And aside from being hilarious, “Wondrous Apparition Provided by Magician Abracabadger” linkao3(20364421) and its sequel “Harry Potter and the Malleus Mallardeficarum by Abracabadger” linkao3(20403121) have absolutely awesome Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  Marietta Edgecombe and Cho Chang have unleashed an unimaginable catastrophe upon Hogwarts in the middle of the Triwizard Tournament -- freedom of apparition. Showing all the common sense that wizards are known for, the students can't wait to start practising, and those in Gryffindor Tower are no exception.With chaos in the corridors and the teachers stressed to breaking point, Harry Potter is focussed on just one thing -- not looking like an idiot at the upcoming Yule Ball. That requires a date, but as he finds out, with just the right company, sometimes your problems almost solve themselves.If only the teachers could say the same.Imported from SIYE. Written for their Apparition Challenge (2016-1).

  As the mayhem resulting from the lifting of apparition restrictions at Hogwarts settles down, Harry Potter is trying to survive the last few days of term without going mad. His best friends are behaving strangely, Malfoy is being a git, and, most importantly, he has to learn to dance before the Yule Ball. He's not the only one with problems, however, and somewhere amidst all this he needs to help Neville Longbottom in his search for a way to restore Luna Lovegood to normality after her avian apparition aberration.If there's one person he can rely on to keep him sane amidst all this, it's Ginny Weasley, his best friend's little sister... and now, his date for the Ball. Oh yes, her twin brothers are very interested in that development.Harry may be in even more trouble than usual, here.A sequel (and very definitely the finale) to Wondrous Apparition Provided By Magician. You probably need to read that for this to even begin to make sense.No ducks were harmed in the writing of this fic, although one was severely inconvenienced and extremely confused.

*** hahaha i can totally understand that, i'm personally of the belief that canon Dumbledore is in no way a bad person who had any bad intentions, sure he made mistakes but everyone makes mistakes. When i first started reading FF Dumbledore and Weasley bashing was very hard to read for me but overtime i've gradually learnt how to separate my preconceptions of characters and now bashing doesn't really bother me anymore.
