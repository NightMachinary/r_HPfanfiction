When authors try to force their fanfic to follow the events of the original plot. If it doesn't fit don't force it. It's fanfiction, be creative! Deviate from the source material, that's what makes it fun!\\
What's your pet peeve?


** I definitely agree with you on following the canon plot line. If you are deviating from the main story, adding a character, changing a power, time travel, etc., you can't expect everything to stay the same. Some people just add new reactions to characters and situations where overall it's just the same plot with no difference.

Also if the fic is one big paragraph or no separation between dialogue and description, I back out right away. Some look so promising but the format makes it impossible for me to enjoy.

*** Right!!! I get that if you actually time traveled you'd keep things kinda the same so your foreknowledge is useful, but it makes a very boring read, the best time travel stories are the ones where everything changes. And yeah if you add a new character, it should add more than a few lines here and there, screw the plot, make your own! I mean keeping some elements is ok, but change up the other stuff. Some don't even add new lines for OCs, they just give the OC some of Hermione or Ron's lines and it's dull.

Ohh the formatting is very important. I hate when people don't capitalize letters too. Also using “Bold” for dialogue instead of quotation marks is something that annoys the crap out of me.

** My all-time favorite thing to hate.

The green eyed boy looked at the brown haired girl, and gave her a ruefully, roughish, lopsided grin.

"You know Mione, being the heir to the Potter-Black-Pevrell-Griffindor-Slytherin-Merlyn households gives me a lot of power. I'll also need a lot of wives, wanna join my harem?" The scarred boy said

"Oh Hadrian, I'd love to. Please let me read all the books you have." Said the girl.

And also over emphasizing what people's facial expression are like. That drives me up the wall. I'm not a dumb reader, I can project emotions onto characters and imagine what surprise looks like. It's mostly the superfluous words used to describe what expressions/ emotions/ actions people are having that bother me at the moment.

*** Lol you've encompassed a lot of pet peeves here. The funny thing is I can (just barely) tolerate the Lord of everything crap if I'm in the right mood and it's well written, but I HATE harem stories. What runs through someone's mind when writing something so gross? That said, the lord crap is usually really irritating too, it's a excuse for people to live out their fantasies of being crazy rich and powerful but it's overdone and boring. The over-emphasizing facial features is a big problem with a lot of new writers, sometimes in long fics they get better but even then people shouldn't hesitate to just use the characters names.

**** Yea, if I'm in the mood, a good political story hits just right. Especially if it has romance and intrigue. I used to be fine with harem stories but reading Under the Banner of Heaven turned me off of them. But honestly, I'm much more interested in the human side of things where they act like people and have problems and whatnot. Having three castles and a million bajillion dollars is only interesting so many times.

***** It's been a while since I've read a canon-era fanfic that's truly unique. One that deviates significantly from canon but still focuses on Harry, Ron and Hermione. If you read fiCs that came out before book 6 or book 7 they're so different and clever. After the series finished people seemed to become afraid to deviate from what JKR did which is so disappointing. I've started to read more crossovers actually, especially ones that are centered after book 7, they tend to be different enough even if they're usually unfinished.

I do like the human side of things too. It's fun.

**** Though, there is one really good harem fic linkao3(The Power of Seven by VelvetInferno) where harry genuinely cares about each of his girls and is actually reluctant to start the ritual-thing in the first place, so Hermione has to convince him. No one is too out of character except maybe Dumbledore, Bill Weasley, and maybe Ron.

There is a LOT of smut but it's really well written, and it's not completed but it updates pretty regularly.

Dumbledore bashing, Bill bashing, Ron bashing, I think a little bit of general Weasley bashing because they're convinced that Ginny has been cursed or doesn't actually want to go through with the harem thing, and also bashing of Fleur's mom.

Oh and pansy's stupid and horny.

** Most of the tropes are so overdone that if I see them I'll stop reading immediately, also turning Dumbledore into a Disney villain who acts like doofenshmirtz but is somehow this “master manipulator” yet he can be beat by an by an 11 year old in politics? My main hatred is crappy villains, so many of the fics have OP Harry but the villains may as well be wet tissues because there's no challenge or actual plot it's just ooh look big explosions and sex! Let's totally ignore the horrendous writing and story that reads like a SI fanfic from a bullied and socially inept fifth grader.

** I hate unmitigated bashing. Now characters don't have to get along, some can even suck if give a reason for it. But just erasing all positive traits and ramping up all negative traits tells me you just took away the old villan and weren't creative enough to make a new conflict. Dumbledore was kind of a manipulative bastard but he worked with what he had at the time (really only excusable because it actually worked). Ron is kind of a volatile ass to his friends sometimes and doesn't like to apologize but in the end always supports them. Hermione is a know it all who hates to be wrong but is happy to share her knowledge with others.

People are nuanced and complex. Don't try to just shove them good or bad boxes because you'll find noone really fits in one. Even voldemort was a victim of his own circumstances (don't get me wrong he was still a dick and worthy villan) but he was also charming enough to attract followers and CHOSE to be evil through a believable series of events.

*** Beautifully said. Most bashing fics take those complex, nuanced characters and turn them into caricatures.

Voldemort was a good villain, but it would be a lot of fun to see his rise to power because he wasn't always so bat-shit crazy. He clearly was charming in his youth, I enjoyed book 6 because we got to see how people perceived him back in the day (even if we viewed those memories through Harry's eyes).

**** Right like. Who would voldemort be if the kids in the orphanage were nice or he was adopted. If he could stay at hogwarts over the summer? He wasn't born evil. (Probably born a sociopath) he could have channeled that into something good.

***** Canon implied that he was born without the ability to love (aka evil) because of the amortentia. I never bought that because they have love potions and obviously people abused them before Merope Gaunt. No way he was the first. Besides an inability to love doesn't necessarily mean you're evil. Even in fanfic about young Voldemort he's usually still kinda creepy, which is totally fun, but people (other than Dumbles) thought he was charming at Hogwarts so I want to see that.

****** Right but you don't have to 'love' to be human. Even if you only ever care about yourself it's totally possible to maintain positive relationships. I know a sociopath and when I asked what it was like not to love his wife he just said, "she is a good mother and caring partner. I take care of her so that she'll take care of me."

Its kinda weird but it works for both of them so....
