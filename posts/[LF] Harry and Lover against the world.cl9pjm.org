So basically i am in a mood for a few of my guilty pleasures when it comes to HP fan fiction.

​

The premise is fairly simple.

Harry and his lover (no specific pairing as long its not slash) against the world.

What i mean by this is that there is no drama in the relationship itself, and that they take no crap at whoever tries to meddle with them. The relationship is ideally preexistence but can also be built during the book itself as long its setup early in the book.

​

Bonus Points.

- Strong Harry and Strong Partner
- Interesting plot
- little AU is always appreciated

​

You may consider this fic as reference. I am pretty fond of it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/]]

Thanks in advance.


** As long as you don't mind a three way relationship between Harry, his sister rose and Gabriele Delacor

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).
