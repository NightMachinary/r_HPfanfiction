That particular trope is one I love reading when I have had a rough day. Its just so soothing to watch the manipulators plans come apart. Bonus points if Harry is OP as well. I would love to have some suggestions.

Thank you!


** There are a few I have bookmarked.

1. Enough : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052816/1/Enough]]

2. Poison Pen : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5554780/1/Poison-Pen]]

*** k, listened through *Enough*; I think it had about 4 places in it's 64k words where I got annoyed about repetition of info, or overly-explained things...

While it also contained bashed-Ron,Hermione and Dumbledore characters it didn't get stuck dragging it up multiple times (except for Manipulative!Dumbledore being a background(ish) antagonist).

It concentrated more on Harry doing stuff behind their backs, and I was able to overlook the annoyance I felt to continue listening.

--------------

In other words, I too can recommend this fic.

  Harry Potter wasn't stupid nor naive. He grew up having to look out for himself. Why would that suddenly change in the Wizarding World? But a snake in lion's clothing wouldn't reveal itself until it was to late to stop him. He wanted freedom, and he would get it. No matter what Dumbledore, the Ministry or Voldemort might think. Alternate from Order of the Phoenix

Takes a while and there are a ton of them. Not that OP though.
