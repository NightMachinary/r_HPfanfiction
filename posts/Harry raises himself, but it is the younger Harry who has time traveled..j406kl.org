I really love Harry raises himself fics. Of course that involves an adult Harry travelling back in time to the 80's. But what if it was the younger Harry who accidentally time travelled to the time after the War? How it happened doen't really matter, but if done well this could very well be a wholesome and emotional fic.

Also in this case, the younger Harry will have a family involving the Weasleys and Hermione, unlike the other version of such fics which involves older Harry more or less abandoning them/leaving them behind (which I really hate the idea of tbh).


** Sounds great.

I think young Harry will have a big surge of accidential magic brought on by a wish to be "sonewhere he is loved". As Harry is loved by his family he makes later on his magic sends him forward in time. - Insert magic-babble explanation about how/why this somehow did not change the time line. -

You could even have some drama happening if you don't want just sweet slice of life. Young Harry is still stuck to a part of Voldemort's soul, after all.

*** :o That last part could be great. Like if because there's a new anchor in the living world, it yanks Voldemort's main soul out of limbo and into the living world again! :) Total accident and unintentional, but now Voldemort is back AGAIN. And now adult Harry can even deal with him on a more even footing! :) After all his Auror career time and stuff.

Maybe even a plot twist on the prophecy about how it never specified WHEN Harry would be Voldemort's equal, or that neither can live part wasn't too specific either. That it meant in the future, not the seventh book.

**** Adult post war Harry going head to head with Voldemort again? Yes please. Especially now that he's capable of fixing it and knows how to too.

Of course, I feel like there's no way he's going to allow an Avada kedavra to hit little Harry. It was fine when he was sacrificing himself, and even tho it IS still him, he's young and kid and he isn't even sure if that would even work now considering Voldemort now doesn't have Harry's blood.

This gets more interesting the more I think about it hahah

**** Somebody in the comnents/reviews will ask at some point, so even if you go with "I have no clue why, it's just happening this way" you'll probably do better to acknowledge *this* in some way within the story. - Also, Hermione would definitrly try to figure out how the hell this is possible if you keep her in-character, so you might as well give sone kind of "explanation".

***** Of course that's a must. She WOULD look for an explanation for months until she finds one. If something as big as time travel is involved maybe even years. It always annoys me in fics when accidental time travel is involved and Hermione just doesn't ever try to make sense of it. Highly out of character.

*** Also I really hate the idea of Harry time travelling because he wished he were loved n ends up with teenage or at the most some 20ish Marauders n Lily. Maybe that's just me because I don't like reading the Marauders era fics, but the connection that Harry needs with a family won't be there with them. Lily and James may like the kid but they wouldn't actually Love him as much despite knowing who he is.

But travelling to a huge Weasley family is something that would totally work. You bet that Molly is gonna take him under her wing as she did og Harry.

**** I think it would work with "already parents" or "about to become parents" Lily and James, but there is a war going on, and their time is running out even though they may not know it (and it is not as if kid Harry has any knowledge that could truly help them). - He would be simply safer in the future than the past, and if he did not specifically wish for his parents maybe crazy magic like this may take that into account.

** When Harry Potter walked into his kitchen, he knew something was instantly off. It wasn't his years of Auror honed skills nor was it his overworked gut telling him there was a problem. No, it was the fact that a small human who looked a great deal like himself was standing by the sink looking extremely guilty.

“Gin,” yelled Harry exasperatedly. “Al has somehow managed to de-age himself!”

The boy flinched.

“What?!” Ginny's voice shouted sounding eerily like her mother when Molly used to yell at the twins.

“What are you talking about Dad?!” exclaimed Al from upstairs.

“James, Lily are you two playing a prank?”

“No Dad” two voices answered from different parts of the house.

Faster than could be seen Harry had his wand out and began casting as many detection charms as he could. /Homenum revelio/ Six humans in the house. /Specialis Revelio/ no odd curses, hexes, jinxes, or charms. /Revelio/ no spells or glamours on the boy himself. The wards were still up and everyone seemed alright. It was only after making certain his family was fine that Harry began to examine the boy in more detail. As he did so the rest of his family came down to see what had happened only to come to a dead stop at the sight of the young boy who seemed to shrink even more on himself with the addition of four new people. With every second of examination Harry could feel his trepidation spiking. Ragged, overly large clothing check. Bruises and scrapes check. A too thin look as if malnourished check. Broken wire frame glasses check. Messy hair that can't be tamed check. Then hair caught it, the briefest glimpse of a jagged red scar in the shape of a lightning bolt on the boy's brow.

*** Double Back - Long, but incomplete and likely abandoned. A fair bit of bashing.

The Peverell Legacy - It's complete, even if it isn't marked as such. There's just, like... a never ending epilogue? I guess?

That Universe Over There - It's in-progress and getting regular updates. It's also hysterical, as expected from any fic with "accidental world domination" as a tag. Young 'Harry' is a she, named Ivy. It's ridiculously amazing.

A Brand New Start - It's complete. It also has a bunch of well-hated tropes, like prongslet, and dude calls himself Hydrus instead of Harry. Oh, and the author uses shit like "the dogman said" on the regular, which is... interesting. It's a fine read, just be prepared to roll your eyes a bit.

The Crownless King - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23382799][LINK]] - I forgot one! This is crack, written for COVID. Also: Adult Harry is insane, and that and his toilet paper hoarding skills are half the fun.

  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Changing time is difficult though, and the more changes he makes, the less predictable the world turns out to be. Though now maybe he actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well.
