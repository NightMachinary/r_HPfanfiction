So, are there any fics where the majority of the plot takes place on Diagon Alley? I vaguely remember there being a spate of fics where a time-travelling Harry set up a shop (sometimes older, but once or twice as a kid travelled back with Bill, I think? I think that Bill one also had Draco crushing on him or something?) on the Alley and a lot of the 'action' took place there in those. And that one where the Shopkeepers of Diagon work together to build Harry a home in a trunk or something? Can't remember the names of any of those examples, unfortunately, but if you know those, do feel free to rec too! :)

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D)

** The best Diagon Valley story I know about is [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. by Aaran St Vines]], except it happens in the fourth century B.C. There is some romance there, but the story is bascially PG-13, if I remember correctly. It is really lovely story (slightly too long, but that's too common problem of most fanfiction stories).

*** Indeed. A problem with a great many published books as well, IMO. There's a very good reason most novels are 80,000-100,000words and not several million. :D

It looks good. The premise is certainly interesting, and the amusingly promotional, yet self-deprecating comment on the front page bodes well for an author not getting too full of themselves. Thanks for the rec!

**** I think self-published books (including whole fanfiction universe) are worse. My mum (now long retired) was an editor in the publishing house, so I was always interested in that, and I know that a lot of editors' was to make authors cut their works to reasonable size (e.g., [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Jules_Hetzel][Pierre-Jules Hetzel]] was known to be almost co-author of Jules Verne). Main impetus used to be cost of paper and printing, true, but side-effect was that published works from serious publishing house tend to be much better and not only because of better selection of authors.

***** Heh. You're probably right. It makes me sad how few people appreciate good editors and editing. If you listen to the big names, it's a significant part of what makes all these books we love so much the masterpieces they are. Gaiman and Pratchett have said some really interestingly appreciative things about their editors.

But yeah, you're right, it's not just about cost - or even reading time - it's pacing and tone, character and plot (and the development and growth of both), stuff outstaying its welcome or not sticking around long enough for the needed detail, etc. Word count is way more important than most people give it credit for and I can totally wax lyrical about editing for ages if I'm allowed to (which probably explains most of this 'telling you what you probably already know as the child of an actual editor' thing I'm doing now, huh? :D) so I'll stop there and simply say that (as you might've guessed) I agree completely. :)

** Linkffn(damned by Hecateslover) quite old story about female!harry deciding to live on knockturn alley and discovering shocking bias against simple unlucky and poor people, later decides to do something about it. I remember liking this story for making knockturn alley into a real neighbourhood where real people live, not just shady street with some shops and bad reputation

  Reuniting? Dividing? The wizarding world is a Chaotic place. The war is over...or is it? Bit of a AU, featuring a Darkish Fem!HP/SS. Warning- bit of violence, bashing, a touch of smut, and character death. Rated M, just in case. COMPLETE

*** When it says 'a touch of smut', is that smut I can skip without losing too much plot or character development?

**** Sorry for late reply, have been working. In answer to your question, I don't remember too much smut and it should be easily overlooked as I do remember story for it's focus on knockturn alley. On other hand it's been years and years since I've read that story....
