The author of a story I follow mentioned a group called "Critics United", so I decided to dig deeper.

My digging has produced almost entirely negative feedback and opinions on this group of individuals. From what I've gathered, they are a group of petty trolls who use bullying and harassment in pursuit of a petty goal.

What are your thoughts about this group of individuals?


** It honestly bewilders me how much of a life one must not have to be a busybody backseat mod on FFN.

I always picture a bored, pudgy middle-aged woman with a "can I speak to the manager" haircut when I hear of CU.

** Here is an example of a review made by a CU member. I'm still searching for other examples of reviews made by CU. I really hope their other reviews and PMs they send to authors aren't worse than this.

*Just to make you aware, this story contains sexually explicit material, meaning it really should be rated MA. MA-rated content has not been permitted on this site since 2012, and therefore this story violates the Terms of Service we all agreed to when we first signed up. Not saying you can't write it, but saying that this is just not the place for it. There are plenty of other sites that would gladly take it, including but not limited to AdultFanFiction, DeviantArt, and AO3. You could also write a watered-down version that does not involve explicit scenes to keep this kosher with the site rules. Take all these suggestions into consideration as they will help you avoid ToS issues in the future. Please understand, I say what I say in the spirit of what this site is about; making good stories great, if not brilliant.

Best, Zad Critics United*

What a load of bullshit, in my opinion. Specifically the end. Your spirit is to be a special snowflake and have stuff you don't like removed. You do not act in our best interests. Sorry to burst your bubble.

** I remember having a few interactions with them around 2011-2012, when another forum I was a part of caught wind of them, and when CU were at their zenith, so to speak. We'd heard about these rules lawyers going around and bullying people out of posting their fics. So, we all sort of lurked around their review requests page and asked them to review our fics to see what they really were like.

Long story short, I ended up getting a really long, well-crafted, lovely review from one of them on one of my old fics. While another person I knew from the forum got a really nasty, mean-spirited one that almost seemed to be goading him to respond from another person from CU.

So, while I think the whole focus of the group is a bit fucking stupid, especially since they're in no way affiliated with ffn and just making more work for everyone, I think it has all sorts in it. Some of them are just dickheads looking to pick a fight, while others are just genuinely think they're acting in the best interests of the site

** I've always thought the mission statement was good but the execution is the problem. They swoop, gang up and harrass. The diminutive, demeaning language and condescension is unconscionable. The leaders when challenged attack on a personal level in reply. I'm all for the rules if they are being applied consistently and /by the appropriate enforcement body/. I think in this instance it is often power tripping vigilantes who fixate on a target.

** I have no issue with them, and appreciate the manner in which they go about it (informing first, and reporting as a late second). Personally, I think there'd be /much/ less of an issue (and no need for CU to do this) if everybody could just read and respect the site rules.

** Critics United? I haven't heard of them since the purge of 2012, which they claimed partial responsibility for. I'd hoped they had withered away.

Arguably, their goals in and of themselves are acceptable, even noble, namely the enforcement of the FF.Net rules (which I do not support). Unfortunately, their methods leave much to be desired.

First of all, they are in no way qualified to take such a burden upon themselves. They are not moderators, and should not behave as such, which they certainly do. It reeks of arrogance. Moreover, the content rules are famously unclear and subject to interpretation.

Their methods often degenerate to little more than cyberbullying, it's true. They spam post reviews until the author responds, and then often claim the moral high ground in the conversation if the author responds. I'd argue that's not right; if they want to PM the author /once/ warning them of a potential rules infringement, that would be one thing. Even reporting them multiple times would be okay. Keep it private, avoid spam.

It's not okay, however, to spam reviews on a story, call in other friends to spam reviews, and generally make annoyances of themselves in an arena intended to give the author meaningful feedback. Their reviews can sometimes be downright insulting and infantile, resorting to personal insults and containing nothing of import in the way of criticism. It's at this point that it verges on cyberbullying and is morally wrong.

They can also be hypocritical. Some of the members have published smut on the site, and CU doesn't criticise them.

** Personally I think these were the kids that in high school were never invited to parties so they called the cops to report them so no one could have any fun. I'm guessing they also got bullied a lot and now have found a way to hold power over someone else.

And to answer some of the comments on here, yes they are still active though probably not as many as there used to be. It doesn't really matter because the admins don't really remove smut fics anymore even though it's still against the rules.

** They seem like Warriors For Innocence 2.0. This is way too coincidential to ignore. Same tactics, same goals, and it only looks like they improved.

For those of you who don't know, "Warriors for Innocence" was an online group that had its heyday during the late 2000s, and a group that had ties to Christian dominionist groups. It was pressuring LiveJournal staff to take action against accounts they deemed as "offensive" or "inappropriate", resulting in Strikethrough and Boldthrough. Many of these accounts were posting fanart and fanfic, and it is thought that WFI led to the creation of AO3. The most recent "action" by anyone supposedly affiliated to WFI was in late 2015 on Tumblr.

*** I think you fundamentally misunderstand the dynamic. The rules aren't there to be enforced, they are there for plausible deniability. Critics United isn't making the FF.Net admins' jobs easier, they're making it harder because every report flagging up a story as in breach of the rules is a story that the admins would have preferred not to know about (and thus do something about).

We can talk about the merit of rules put in place by FFN staff (some of which are to cover their asses in legal matters, which is understandable), but those rules are in place and I don't see anything wrong with users using tools available to the end user to enforce them.

****** You can draw that conclusion, but that doesn't make it truth. I agree with some of the rules: regarding RPF, smut (because I personally don't like it and also AdultFiction and AO3 exist for that stuff), updates that are just Author's notes. Some, I think, are stupid, like all the script and 2nd person fiction things. But my opinion matters little, because I'm using the site for free and in creating an account I agree to follow the rules. It's the prerogative of FFN owners to set what rules they like.

My initial comment was meant more as "CU over the fuck-off attitude of FFN mods towards policing their website", but yeah, I'm not really opposed to the activities of CU, you can say I agree with what they're doing, or more precisely with the ideal of their mission statement. I'm certain they have their bad apples.

** I've always felt it was nice of them to try and educate FF.net's populous on the rules of the site. It always amazes me how few seem to actually know them -- especially since there are so few to begin with and you're constantly being made to re-agree to them before publishing fanfics.

I also don't agree with the idea that people seem to think they spam authors or cyber bully. From what I've seen, they have a system in place for their group that limits the amount of times their people review a rule-breaking entry and while I do feel sometimes their reviews are harsh, they don't, from what I've seen, outright insult people in their reviews.

**** Not personally, no. First time I heard about them was from an author who mentioned them when explaining why they deleted their list from FF. I looked into them after that.

How they work is pretty transparent. If you want an idea of what their reviews are like it's not difficult at all to see them. Since they link to all the stories on their report list in their "Clean Sweep" and "Stories in Violation" threads, all you have to do is browse through there and hit some links for stories and look at their review pages.
