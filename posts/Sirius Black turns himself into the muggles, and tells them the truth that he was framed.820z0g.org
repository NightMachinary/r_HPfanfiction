Remember how in the start of Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry saw on TV about how a supposed murderer (Sirius Black) had escaped from prison and had a gun? Vernon complains that they don't even mention where he escaped from (and I made a request for that a year ago, actually).

Does anyone know any stories where Sirius turns himself in to the muggle police, and tells them the truth about who and what he is (possibly breaking the Statute of Secrecy), or just getting the police to investigate the paper trail behind his supposed crime and sentencing?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/Memorium][Memorium]] deals with muggle investigators being confused by the fake drugs Aurors are leaving to mask Death Eater murders, but that investigation never takes center-stage or affects the rest of the story, unfortunately.


** The muggles would follow due process, contact the ones up top, and then they'd call in the Aurors and the Obliviators, all while Sirius is telling his story.

Great. Now the muggles know the story, but only do so for a couple of minutes until the Obliviators remove said knowledge from them.

*** Mm, I do have to wonder; what kind of paperwork does due process create? What if Sirius mentioned that he was falsely imprisoned and the ones after him liked to disappear witnesses and paperwork? And the so-called murder/s he was responsible for don't exist (remember, the explosion Peter framed him for was passed off as a gas explosion, and Voldemort was the one who killed the Potters)?

How much can memory charms and false-memory stuff change? We see in the Deathly Hallows movie (part 1) that Hermione edits herself out of photographs pretty easily, and in the books Dumbledore confounds a woman at the orphanage into believing a blank piece of paper are his credentials.

But would that work for all the paperwork in an office? Defence attorneys and/or prosecutors that might have been contacted? Usage reports and book-keeping, arrest records and all that sort of thing? What happens when the police find reports and testimony from someone they don't remember having?

**** 1. If the Oblivators didn't know to get paperwork as well, then the statute would have been broken so many times over already. The best time I've ever seen that angle taken, is in the story Harry Potter and the Natural 20. Which I recommend.

2. The Ministry workers would definitely be intimately familiar with the concept of paperwork.

3. How many prisoners claim they're innocent on a daily basis? How often would bobbies pay attention?

4. Good point on the movie thing, that's OP as fuck. However I like to ignore the movies for the most part.

**** While adults are often seen as incompetent in the Harry Potter world remember that muggleborn children disappear from the world for all intents and purposes and nobody has ever noticed. The statue of secrecy has been kept. They can't actually be that awful at their jobs given how easy it is to spread information, truth potions and the like would make it much easier too, instead of simply blasting away their memories you can ask who they told and if they made any record of it.

***** Mm, that's true...but in the 'muggleborn children disappearing' thing, there IS the advantage that it's only an absent person instead of overt displays of magic, and the parents are helping to maintain the masquerade, having fabricated documentation if necessary.

[[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]] did have a thing in one of his stories (Divided & Entwined, I believe) where Hermione asked how Obliviators respond to breaches in the Statute so quickly; they apparently have a whole bunch of diviners to detect the breaches in advance.

****** Potential breaches. In that story, the Obliviators wouldn't bother to appear when two wizards duel in a forest without witnesses and the resulting fire would be blamed on a careless smoker.

Although I think it would be a little easier than people assume to keep the SoS. Sirius talking about being imprisoned without trial, and being hunted for a mass-murder that didn't happen? Approved by the government?

Smells like secret service cover-up, doesn't it? The guy might be a spy or traitor they can't let out. If he's talking about magic, then he's obviously crazy, too.

*** What if the muggles put it on the news right after their discovery and quote some of Sirius' statements? I don't know how British news work around that time period, but I'm pretty sure reporters would inform the people if they caught an â€˜escaped prisoner' with some inside scoop they could've dug up. It would be pretty difficult to Obliviate the public by then.

**** He'd have to surrender himself to news agencies, something like a public broadcaster for a live interview for which they can have cops on hand for an unrelated issue to bring him into custody after. I can't see it working any other way. He'd have to get the story out immediately.

*** He doesn't, actually. He just adopts a new name when he moves in with Harry. The PM's office figures out who he is and they figure that since he's been there with Harry so long that the story must not be 100% right.

*** I am musing on the possibility of writing a snippet...though I have a lot of other stuff to write first.

Basically it's like, Sirius is discovered collapsed on the beach by some muggles, after swimming away from Azkaban; he's taken to hospital, his emaciated appearance and heavily damaged robes and visible chill and stress are all noted...then when the news comes on on the TV, and it turns out their patient Sirius Black is the same Sirius Black that's supposedly escaped from prison and has a gun, questions are raised; why was he starving, those ruined robes are definitely not a prison uniform, what did they do to him, and who is this Peter Pettigrew that he's accusing of framing him?
