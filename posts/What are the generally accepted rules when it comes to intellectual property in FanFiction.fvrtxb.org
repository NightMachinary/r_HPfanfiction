I obviously get that if you have an OC or sequence of events that is clearly your own creation, you have every right to ask others not to use it in their own writing. But lately I've been coming across more and more authors that start a fic with “x, x, and x are my intellectual property and may not be used without my consent”. But x x and x are random, and don't seem really original.

It doesn't make sense to me, for instance, that an author can “claim” a common pet name (in a circumstance when used by a particular character) as their original creation. Is this fair?Can someone explain?


** They can say they don't want anybody to use their fanfics, but their already playing around with characters and worlds that aren't entirely their own, so good luck to them trying to find somebody actually willing to enforce any of that at a legal level.

That said, the fanfiction community (and the sites that host their works) will look down on anybody who decides to take whole works and claim that it is something that they've written. So takedowns of identical copies of a fic are rather common. If you attribute the original person who wrote it though and if the original is no longer available on the original account (like the case for /My Immortal/), it's likely to stay on.

** There are times where this whole really long fic or series is based on this one OC. A lot of the time, the names for the OCs are really original and have a backstory. In these circumstances, I think it's pretty ok to get mad if they use your OC. However, there are names like Antoinette Stark, Harriet Potter, Persephone/Persia Jackson, Anthony Chase that are basically that name in a different gender. In that circumstance, you really can't get mad.

With copying complete fics, that area is kinda murky. In fanfiction, we're using someone else's characters and using their ideas, so there isn't really any major consequence we can take against someone that steals a fic. However, most authors, if using sections directly from the book, will note at the bottom saying that parts in italic are copied. Also, copying more than a paragraph of someone else's fic that they thought up is highly frowned upon, and will probably end up with you losing your account, or the fic being deleted.

If you're doing a character reading the original series, you should probably annotate it, as people can see that as you violating copyright laws, because someone could just read what the characters are reading, and not buy the book. If you're writing the books that the characters are reading, that's perfectly fine. If you're doing the characters reading someone else's fanfiction, you should ask the author if they agree, and write a note at the bottom acknowledging that the fic they are reading is not yours.

*** The whole “reading the books” thing.

There's no grey area. There's no “can see it as.” If you word for word include the original novel, that's flat out plagiarism and a copyright violation - regardless of what you're using it for. Fair use doesn't apply to using entire texts.

*** That is wrong. You own your OC. Rowling or Warner Brother's can't come, and take your character. And they especially can't come, and simply make a movie out of your fanfic.

Will you sue a random fanfic writer who uses your characters? Probably not.

But would you sue WB if they just copy and film your story without consent? Likely, because that's an easy way to make a lot of money. (Which is a reason why authors often don't even read fanfic , although that'd be a harder fight in court most likely)

Anyway, intellectual property is complicated, but the gist is: whatever /you/ make, /you/ own and have control over.

**** The only way you get to own something in Fanfiction is if you delete any traces of it being fanfiction, and rewrite it as original work. As that lady did to her Twilight fanfic to make it Shades of Grey.

Otherwise Rowling can come at you for stealing all her shit. All Rowling needs to do is claim she never read your story.

***** No, Rowling can't "come at me", since she has explicitly allowed me to write fanfiction.

  "Her concern would be to make sure that it remains a non-commercial activity to ensure fans are not exploited and it is not being published in the strict sense of traditional print publishing."

  He said writers had to ensure that the stories were not obscene and were credited to the author and not to JK Rowling. [[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3753001.stm]]
#+end_quote

So, I have the permission to publish my fanfic online, as long as I don't make money of it, add sexual elements, or claim it's written by her.

If she asked me to take it down, I'd likely have to comply, but if she outright sued me without warning, she probably wouldn't win, because of those statements. However, that's the part of this I'm least sure about, because you can probably make an argument either way whether that statement is a license/okay for me to publish my fanfiction, or not.

Anyway if the plot of her movie matches my story 1:1, and it even has some of my original dialogue and uniquely named characters, she can claim whatever she wants. The standard for civil cases is "more likely than not", not "beyond a reasonable doubt".

And please do try to convince a judge that you accidentally copied the entire weird plot of my story in your film, and even had some matching dialogue by accident, I wish you the best of luck.

The reason why 50 shades was altered is that they did not have a license to publish and make money using the characters of Stephanie Meyer. But you know what E.L. James owned?

- Her plot
- Her own characters
- Her dialogue

James owned that, however bad it was. Not Stephanie Meyer.

Which is why James could publish it, and make money of it once she removed / renamed the characters. Because, and I know I'm repeating myself here, she owned what she came up with herself.

** Any disclaimers, assertions, etc. that people post at the start of their stories are meaningless. Copyright law isn't easy to pin down as far as hard and fast formulaic rules.

Instead, I'd focus on being polite. If someone has a great original idea and character and asks others not to spin it off, I'd probably abide by their wishes, just as I would be very hesitant to publish fanfic for a fandom whose author requested people not to. However, that's manners, not legal obligation. I wouldn't be any more obligated to respect their wishes than I would be obligated by an author requesting people not to write fanfiction (I would imagine a fanfic author would have a MUCH harder time overcoming a fair use defense than an original author would).

Let's do a hypothetical. Say an author writes a fic where Luna getting a pygmy puff and naming it Harold. The author asserts that this is a totally original idea and no one else can use it. Obviously, if I steal the fic and pass it off as my own, I'm behaving immorally and almost certainly illegally. The situation is really no better if I do a find and replace so that the exact same story has Luna getting a mini hippogriff named Benny.

What if I wrote a completely original piece in which Luna gets a pygmy puff and names it Harold? Would that be moral? It depends. Am I stealing their idea? Well, probably. It's rather specific for a certain character to have a certain pet with a certain name.

What if it's just the mere fact that a character gets a pygmy puff and names it? Well, that's more clearly established in canon. Neville getting a pygmy puff and naming it Gordon would be more likely to be inspired by Ginny's pygmy puff (Arnold) than some other fanfic version, unless there were other similarities. Even if the other fanfic author threw a fit, nothing would likely come of it.

Lastly, in the interest of politeness, I'd ask myself if the story would be just as good distancing itself more from the other story. If an owl would work just as well as a pygmy puff in my story, why not write it as an owl and dodge any potential bad feelings?

** Whatever their actual rights are, what these authors are "claiming" is not the names, but the characters, aka the names associated with traits and a backstory.

For example, if author A made a character have a cat named Kitty, it would still be fine for author B to name cats Kitty in any other work. But if author A's Kitty was black with a white patch around its left eye and was known to love bacon more than anything, it wouldn't be right for author B to have their Kitty look the same and be a bacon lover above all else.

** Ask first. I would never think it important, given that we are all writing on the top somebody else's work, but most of my stories are actually meta-fanfictions (my alternative ending of an unfinished fanfiction story) and in one case the reaction of the fanfiction story whose (long time abandoned) story I have continued was pretty wild, and I think I have been kicked from SIYE for it (or at least my story was). So, even if you think it completely doesn't make any sense, ask first. Some fanfiction authors do care, even if I don't or if you think it is ridiculous.

** If you make original content that cant survive on its own outside of the anchor for the basis for your story then you don't own it. Like if you make a cool hipster slytherin girl who flirts with harry and you wanna claim dibs on her, no you can't. You have no rights to make fan fiction, you can't claim any of it, none of it is yours.

Also stealing any ideas off of anyone who writes any fan fiction is free game. Since no one owns anything.

** I've been involved in various fanfic communities since the late 1990s and have interacted with many old-timers who have been writing TV-series based fanfic since the 1960s. Yes, the sort which was written on a type-writer and distributed via snail-mail mailing lists and published in zines.

Several ethical guidelines were drilled into my head at the time:

*Rule one*: No fanfiction of real, living people. Ever. (Using the actors instead of the characters was a ban-able offense in many fanfiction communities and IMO always should be. It is rude and disrespectful towards their person and their work.)

*Rule two*: Give credit where credit is due. Name the original creator(s) of the canon your work is based upon. Do not pass off another's work as yours, no matter who created it.

If you got an idea for your fic from another work (fanfic or not), give credit.

*Rule three:* Do not use original ideas, plots and original characters of another writer without permission. This means fanfic as well as original writing.

For example there is not much Babylon 5 fanfic out there bc the creator J. Michael Straczynski specifically asked fans not to write fanfiction.

On the other hand there were creators who deliberately turned a blind eye to fanfic or even allowed it. Star Trek is such a fandom, the Star Trek books are nothing but fanfic that got rubber-stamped by Paramount/Viacom.

With books, it depends upon the stance of the author. (I remember long discussions whether HP fanfic was ethical bc at the time there had been no comment from J.K.Rowling on the issue.)

So yes, you do own your OC and your plot ideas, as long as they are original enough to be recogniseable as yours. (Mirror of Maybe or Alexandra Quick come to mind.). But because you are coming from writing fanfiction yourself, you are (within reason) expected to give permission when other people want to use your characters.

*I am totally aghast that some people think that OCs of other fanfiction authors are fair game bc "it is all fanfiction anyway". This is wrong on so many levels.*

If you want to use the concepts and OCs of another author, message them and ask! If you want to continue an abandoned fic, try to contact the author in question at least 4 times over the course of a year using different accounts and document that. If you get no response and post your fic anyway, don't get your knickers in a twist when the original author shows up, is less than pleased with your work and asks you to take your fic down. Be nice about it and take it down or try to resolve the issue in some way. I totally side with any fanfiction site who will side with the original author on the issue like [[/u/ceplma][u/ceplma]] described. This is how it should be done.

That said, most of the time I've seen it happen that other people borrow OCs is when authors are friends with each other and beta each other's fics. Then one writer might write a "birthday fic" for another writer using the OC of that writer. Or somebody might write a companion piece or "left out scene" to a fic of another author. The key point here is permission from the original creator and giving credit.

*Rule four*: No Mary Sues. Self-explanatory.

*** To my defence, there was never any shadow of plagiarism, I have always very prominently displayed notice, that my stories are continuation of other fanfiction. And yes, unfortunately after two tries during two months, I have never got any reply from the original author now, so I have posted my last story anyway (very unfinished actually, BTW, linkao3(23267857)).
