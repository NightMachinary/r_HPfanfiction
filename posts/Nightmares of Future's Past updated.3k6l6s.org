Like the title suggests, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by S'TarKan has just been updated. Yay! :)


** Decent chapter.\\
It's been a while since I read this story, don't remember what's going on with Draco and Millicent. Anyone have a short summary?

*** [[/spoiler][Draco was expelled from Hogwarts at the end of second year for attempted murder. Though he only cast a stunning spell at Harry, it was at the top of the stairs and was deliberately to prevent Harry from going to get help about the Chamber, I think. Harry ended up in a coma for about a month? Millicent's sister died in third year (another murder) and it was passed off as accident by Slytherin, and Millicent was the target of bullies like Pansy Parkinson to keep her quiet. Harry, who owed Millicent's sister for her help, quietly helped Millicent get a scholarship at Beauxbatons so that she didn't have to keep being bullied.]]

***** Bashing is [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=829062&postcount=7][objectively terrible]] writing. As such I have cause to doubt the intelligence of anyone who calls a story with "major Ginny, Ron and Dumbledore bashing" a good story. And this one uses the "Molly Weasley feigns lack of knowledge of Platform Nine and three Quarters, so the entire thing is a set up" trope, so it is terrible even by normal bashing standards.

The rest of the tropes can be worked around, but in almost every case they do denote bad writing. The "Goddess of love" thing is an incredibly lazy plot device used for time travel, as if the author couldn't be bothered to think of any well reasoned time travel mechanics. Soul bond similarly is a lazy plot device used so that the author wouldn't have to write an actual romance, and this one is terrible even by normal soul bond standards, with the Goddess of Love pronouncing Harry and Hermione soul mates in chapter one, followed by vomit-inducing declarations of love.

****** Whenever anyone tries the "Molly Weasley feigns lack of knowledge of Platform Nine and three Quarters, so the entire thing is a set up" I always assume they've never been around parents with young kids.

Asking a silly question - especially if you know the answer - to distract the kids is like, parenting 101.

***** Soul bonds were new-ish around 2005, when fate's debt and Meaning of One came out. By 2010, it was like beating a dead horse. And this one isn't well written by any standards.

#+begin_quote
  "Yes Harry. Just one kiss and we go back to being best friends and get on with our lives."

  "Ok, well here goes." Harry leaned closer to Hermione, and watched her eyes close. He hesitated when his lips were only an inch away and finally closed final distance. As their lips touched, they each heard music that reminded them of a phoenix song, and a golden glow surrounded them. The kiss deepen, lips parted and tongues intertwined in a soft battle. All conscious thoughts of the two participants of the kiss were lost. When they finally parted they found themselves not in the Gryffindor tower but in a room of pure white.
#+end_quote

LOL. Oh, and this:

#+begin_quote
  Ginny Weasley was still fuming about the previous day as she lay in bed scratching a rash. She had put on three times the amount of perfume today and walked slowly past Harry numerous times and nothing. Now every where she had put the perfume on herself had developed a nasty rash. Ginny knew she'd had to see Madam Pomfrey in the morning about the rash and then she'd figure some way to get her Harry out of the clutches of that know-it-all.
#+end_quote

And this:

#+begin_quote
  "Now before I send you back, I need to discuss Dumbledore with you." Miranda said.

  "What about him?"

  "You know he's been manipulating you all of your life don't you?" Miranda said. "The Dursley's" The petite Goddess actually growled the name out "Talk about a family that needs some love in it. I know he sent you there until you went to Hogwarts, but why afterwards?"
#+end_quote

Because of course Molly has to be in on it as well:

#+begin_quote
  "Then why would Molly Weasley, who has been sending her kids to Hogwarts for over eight years, not remember the number? That's at least four times a year she goes there, including Christmas break. Then, of course, there is the seven years she went to Hogwarts herself. Could you imagine ever forgetting what the platform number is?"
#+end_quote

Finally:

#+begin_quote
  "Do you really think Ron and Ginny gave us potions?" Hermione asked.

  "Does it matter if we don't give them a chance this time?" Harry replied.

  "I guess not. We can take a trust but verify attitude, though if you're my soul mate, Ginny better not try anything with you."

  "Same with Ron and you."
#+end_quote

This is Robst Level of terrible-ness. Lets see: Love Potions, evil Dumbledore, buffoon Ron (and possibly worse. I don't have the energy to check), author insert Goddess of Love, Long exposition scenes, True Love in chapter one -- this isn't a story, it is a rant vomited by an angry Harmonian. Ultra-Fail.

This is just hysterical. Are we supposed to be laughing? The author must have a pretty dim view of Harry and Hermione if this is the level of genius necessary for Ron, Ginny, and Mrs. Weasley to hoodwink them!
