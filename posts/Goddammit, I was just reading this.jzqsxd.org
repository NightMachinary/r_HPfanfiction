:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
4th year AU, the GOF picks Harry, and Ron and Hermione both subsequently believe he did it. Because of this, he starts really putting himself into his studies.

After the 1st task, Ron sticks his foot in his mouth, and Harry tells them to piss off. Some sort of altercation happens, ending with Ron and Hermione being tied up. Harry gets called to Dumbledore's office, is urged to reconcile or take blame, and refuses, and when asked why says that he's clearly doing so much better without them, why would he want them back?

There's more after that I can't quite recall. Please help.
