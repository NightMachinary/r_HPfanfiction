Hi! I'm trying to look for fanfics where Harry and Draco like act like they hate each other in public but they secretly love each and make out in secrecy. I can go angsty as well if they developed such feelings in sixth year or during the wizarding war. Preferably a smutty one if you know any fanfics like that since it's sometimes to find them sometimes. Thank you!
