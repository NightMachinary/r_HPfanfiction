  Harry ends up back in time on the steps of Wool's Orphanage. Raised in institutional squalor with Tom Riddle, he has a very different attitude toward magic, Hogwarts, and friendships. dark!harry, brotp!tomarry. ABANDONED (sorry - just wasn't fun to write once they left Hogwarts)

Fate's Favorite is a great fic. It also isn't slash, even the author said so in their notes.

Another is you belong to me (i belong to you). Please mind the tags on this one, this story has themes that may be triggering or disturbing. So far, the relationship between Tom and Harry isn't slash. And I'm not sure by dark, but Harry certainly has a connection with death.
