:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Okay, I'm about to ask for a fic on a weird detail. I don't remember if Harry was Slytherin or Gryffindor. But at one point, they were basically teaching Hermione how to not be obnoxious in class. How raising and flailing your hand doesn't do you any favors. Blaise Zabini was there, and I think Nott too. And it was like, a subtle chin nod to show you know the answer, or a casual hand raise after its obvious no one else knows. Obviously there was friendship among them too. I don't remember how involved or not Ron was.


** I'm not sure, but I'd guess Sarcasm and Slytherin, [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648]]

*** Not sarcasm and Slytherins, but similar feel, I think.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
