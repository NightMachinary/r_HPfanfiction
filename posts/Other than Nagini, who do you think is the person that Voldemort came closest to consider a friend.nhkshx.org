While this may sound like a discussion thread, it's more a prompt. Who do you think was the person that came closest to be Voldemort's friend. Maybe it was someone from the orphanage staff or maybe even one of the kids. Or maybe it was the original Lestrange. Or maybe an OC. What would their backstory have been? What do you think they could have done to make Voldemort so wary of relying on friends? For example it could have been someone who always told him that he was special as a kid only to later find out that that person was spewing the same bullshit to anyone or maybe it was one of the original Death Eaters who ratted him out when they realized the direction he was going in. It doesn't have to be a romantic interest.

Any thoughts?


** Barty Jr. We know they discussed Voldemort's disappointment in his Muggle father which seems like an unusual level of personal disclosure from Voldemort. And Voldemort calls him his most faithful servant. So I think Barty Jr was his favourite Death Eater.

** In canon he calls Lucius "my slippery friend" but that of course doesn't really mean that he sees him as a friend. I think the closest we see to actual friends is the one very brief scene in the Pensieve where he is sitting with his teenage gang. I don't think any of them are named but they would be a generation older than Lucius - perhaps Lucius's father was one of them.

I've been working on a story about Tom's interactions with the non-magical world for aaaages in which he has a close muggle friend in the orphanage before he goes to Hogwarts, but I don't think I'm going to give him any other friends. His gang's first words to him are “piss off mudblood”, which is hardly fertile ground for friendship :-)

** My first guess is Nott or Dolohov or Malfoy, or one of the other dudes from school? Though if things went down how I assume they would have for a penniless orphan in Slytherin, even if the houses/blood purity weren't quite as vicious as they would have been once he stirred stuff up to a furore as an adult, I don't know if I believe he would have seen them as /friends/, even if he called them that...

Maybe he met someone on his travels who he got along well with and left behind for some reason...

*** It's weird when I read Malfoy (Abraxas) as a member of his crew cause my headcanon was always he was never in his gang. Either too young or too old as he's never specifically mentioned. Also as Slughorn seems to have a bit of a fondness for him when he expresses his regret over the fact he died in HBP makes me think he really was not that interested. Also as Malfoys were smart enough to never align with someone that might ruin their reputation, I always sort of assumed that despite their common views he would reject any association with Malfoy. But since Malfoy was such an influential name, he went for Lucius who would have been around the same generation as his current Death Eaters so it was both a punishment for Abraxas's rejection by making Lucius such a high ranking member and an attempt to get to the financial resources and connections of the family. Of course this is all headcanon and no one has to agree with me.

**** All of that is totally believable for sure. I always look at is as Malfoy's try to be kingmakers (or king topplers) and also people who spot promising young people that they can exert control over and mould into whoever they want (Draco was definitely trying to /be/ the king, but that's another story) so I feel like I can see Albraxus courting riddle and riddle courting Albraxus and potentially Albraxus thinking he's got more power in that relationship than he actually had because Riddle is kind of hard to manuipulate the way I see Albraxus trying to manipulate Riddle but yeah that's not exactly a golden shiny friendship any way you look at it, ha ha

***** But Abraxas would have been around the same age (give or take a few years) as Riddle. It's interesting to see that his most loyal followers are a generation after him so I will assume Riddle recruited them as young and brainwashed them to be his servants while the original Death Eater, although respecting and looking up to him, would have always considered themselves more or less his equals.

****** This is true but that doesn't mean that he felt the same way about them. He genuinely thinks he's better than everyone else, smarter, better looking, more charming, more willing to do what it takes to become immortal

The fact that his inner circle are mostly younger tells me he either runs his friends into the ground or prefers to have people around him that he's trained (read: groomed) himself. I'm assuming both

All of this is just bullshit though, because we know next to nothing

I 100% agree with this. The earliest Death Eaters (Nott, Rosier, Mulciber, Dolohov, the ones named as waiting for Voldemort while he tried for the D.A.D.A job in HBP) were probably around the same age as Abraxas, and they were definitely taking a BIG gamble in aligning their interests with him. He was only just making a name for himself and things could have gone terribly wrong at that point-- much to soon for the self-preserving Malfoys to give their support.

However, as for Lucius being recruited as punishment for Abraxas's refusal... I don't know, I think young Lucius would have been desperate to get at some of that power and would've sought to join him on his own.

Lucius joined on his own but as a rebellion to his dad.
