*Arithmancy class, 9:52 am*

Hermione looked at the cloudy sky outside the window while everyone else was still working on today's math problem that she had solved five minutes ago.

/Crack!/

Lightning flashed at the top of North Tower and it started to rain heavily. Hermione sighed in boredom and looked at her watch. Eight more minutes until class would be over. Arithmancy was supposed to be hard and yet all they were doing so far was basic algebra and magical number theory. The magical properties of number seven were interesting, but Hermione was rather disappointed that they wouldn't cover those of Pi until fourth year.

*Seventh floor corridor, 10:04 am*

Hermione walked into an empty unused classroom, checked that nobody was there, pulled out a small device and spun it two times. The next moment, she was gone. Two hours earlier, she had appeared out of nowhere and made her way towards Trelawney's classroom.

*Divination class, 9:51 am*

Hermione looked at her watch again. She hadn't managed to recognize anything in her tea leaves. At least this useless class would be over in nine more minutes.

Suddenly, she had an idea. She closed her eyes and calmly intoned: "I see... No, hear... Thunder. And rain. Heavy rain."

She opened her eyes again. Everyone was staring at her.

"Hermione, we are supposed to read tea leaves, not.."

*/"CRACK!"/*

"What the..."


** I read a sort of crack fix where everyone makes her seem to be a deer and she just gets frustrated more n more that they're taking her common sense to be seer ability.

Will try to remember what that was.

Edit : Crack fic* and yes Hermione is treated as a seer not deer ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

*** I read a fic like this. It wasnt the focus, but it definitely happened. For the life of me I cant remember what the main plot was

Hermione saw Neville about to drop a teacup. She catches it as it falls.

Trelawney makes the prediction about something bad happening to the other gryffindor girl. Hermione has the girl make a list of what she thinks it could be, then makes sure those things won't happen.

That gryffindor girl ends up convinced that hermione is a seer on par with Trelawney.

/What the hell was this???/

** There was a story that i've been looking for myself where Harry Luna and Hermione are doing some time travel shenanigans. And in one of the chapters Hermione has to replace Tralawny taking the class she herself was in before she went back in time 12 hours. She ends up using her prior knowledge to mess with the class a lot.

It was an interesting fic that i've been looking for. It involves Fae, and something to do with the goblet of fire being a really REALLy powerful artifact that wasn't engaged to its full potential during canon GOF.
