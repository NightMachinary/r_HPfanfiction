It's never made any sense to me that an older war veteran Harry can fit in with with a bunch of 11 year olds easily\\
Are there any fics where he just doesn't fit in ?


** I just picture him striking up conversation with his professors (finally someone that I can relate to) and the professors thinking he's adorable and not taking him serious.

I've been watching 3rd rock from the sun so I picture a Tommy like Harry that's old stuck in this teenager body and having to go through hormones and acne. Maybe getting a crush on a professors because they are actually his real age.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

He's still friends with Ron and Hermione as well as people in the other houses but he takes up an almost mentor role. I really enjoy the characterizations in this one, it all feels a lot like canon.

  When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.

#+begin_quote
  A mild send-up on a popular genre of Harry Potter fanfiction. As much as I enjoy them, some practical considerations come to mind. Inevitably, Harry has one specific ally in all those fics ... but what if that entity took a different view on things?

#+begin_quote
  When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.
