I like crossover fics where a character from another fandom teaches at Hogwarts. I liked the Colours of The World, Umino Iruka and the Will of Fire, Crosswinds of Fate, and Dark Defence. I would much prefer over 100k but 50k or more would be ok. I'm more well versed with anime than other media so ideally either that or ones where knowing the other fandom well is unnecessary.


** Does Genkai count from Yu Yu Haksusho count? Someone was asking for a specific crossover so I still have that one pulled up...if you know the fandom. Genkai being the teacher. Super long fix and hilarious as well.

The Best Defense

In the wake of Cedric Diggory's death, after another Dark Tournament in Japan, Koenma discovers problems in the Wizarding World. Who to send but his team, undercover and under false pretenses? New magic and new companionships, as the Reikai Tantei are set loose on Hogwarts.
