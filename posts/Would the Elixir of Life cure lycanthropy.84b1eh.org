** Considering we know almost nothing about it for sure, who knows.

But it is "claimed" to be able to cure all diseases as a side effect which would somewhat make sense if it was an eternal life/youth elixir. And since Lycanthropy is considered a disease or illness in canon, well it likely would be cured.

However, you can also start to question is it actually curing the disease or simply halting it like its halting aging, so that once you stopped drinking the elixir, you would have lycanthropy again? Perhaps it never actually goes away?

Again... too little is known to pass judgment.

(PS: Lycanthropy = HIV in terms of what JK intended to be the symbolism)

** I think not, as lycanthropy is a curse rather than a physical disease.

*** Watch it also cures Lycanthropy of you.

The elixir splits both of you into separate beings and now you're in a room with a pure lycan wolf. Suprise!
