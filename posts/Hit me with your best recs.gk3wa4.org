I thought I'd posted this last night but aparently not! Let's try again.

I'm looking for a Hogwarts era or second gen f/f romance. It must be age appropriate and please no student/teacher type stories. Other than that, I'm open. Canon characters or OCs.

Does anyone have any recommendations?


** I have two recs for you. The first is the popular Its TeaTime series, 3 stories, the last third of the second story does have some f/f and that follows through in the third story, where the next gen are out of school and working/getting married etc.

The other is by littleRose13 the first story is Sweeter than Fiction and the second is Ten Feet Tall. The second story probably has more f/f than the first.

Both these stories are mainly focused on Scorbus and the f/f pairing is secondary. Hope these are kind of what you are looking for, sorry no link
