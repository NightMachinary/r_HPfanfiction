** There's I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For

It's a star wars crossover and it's ... okay. Basically Harry hasn't really aged since the whole "uniting the Hallows" thing and has lived a long, long time and eventually decided to bugger off to another dimension after his many times great great grandchildren required his ... /intervention/* as a dark lord deterrent.

The fact that he's very, very old doesn't really actually matter or impact his character in any way, so it's quite disappointing in that respect.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
