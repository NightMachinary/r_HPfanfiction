  Young Tom Riddle watches Dumbledore set his wardrobe on fire and thinks it's the coolest thing ever. From that point on, Tom only wishes to become a man as great as his Professor. Dumbledore really, really doesn't know how to deal with the little psycho kid following him around. Series of short drabbles and snippets into the life of Tom Riddle, star pupil, future Transfigurations master, and president of the Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore Fan Club (the APWBDFC, for short).

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

  Harry goes back in time due to a quirk of being the owner of the invisibility cloak (reincarnation deal). Time-travel, professor Harry with new (OC) identity, child Tom Riddle. No bashing involved. HP and canon belong to JK Rowling. This is less of a show and more of a tell story i.e. Dialogue gets really scarce at about ch. 9 and lots of time jumps.I may merge some of the chapters as they're so short and I already have them written.Cross posted on other sites.
