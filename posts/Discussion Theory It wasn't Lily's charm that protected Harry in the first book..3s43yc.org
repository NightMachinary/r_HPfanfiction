One thing that has always bothered me is the Unicorn's Curse in the first book. Supposedly one who kills a unicorn and drinks its blood will be doomed to a half-life thereafter. I don't believe it mentions how long after, but that doesn't matter. My question is, what exactly does it mean to be cursed to a "half-life"? The curse is never mentioned again in the books, despite the fact that such a thing seems like it would be powerful, for killing such a pure creature.

My theory is that it wasn't Lily's charm that protected Harry, it was the Unicorn's Curse. Lily's charm was used up against Voldemort the first time, blocking the unblockable curse. After he drank Unicorn blood, Voldemort was cursed to a half-life. That half-life meant that he shackled himself to the Dark half of life, unable to interact with or understand things such as love. As such he was unable to touch anything Light and pure of heart, which saved Harry the second time around.

Thoughts?


** I think it was Quirrell who suffered the curse from the unicorn blood, not Voldemort - that's why it wasn't mentioned after PS.

*** One would think that with Voldemort piggybacking off of Quirrel, he'd get a portion of the curse. I doubt that kind of thing is just pick and choose. Simply my opinion.

**** If Voldemort had been possessing Quirrell, maybe. But Voldemort was a passenger, he wasn't controlling Quirrell's actions. HP makes a big deal of free choice, and Quirrell made the free choice to drink the unicorn blood. He did it for Voldemort, but he did it under his own power and will.

** Harry isn't particularly "Light" or whatever. That's not really a thing in Potterland. It usually comes up in fanfic from authors who like Star Wars.

** I always was fan of the theory that voldemort unknowingly entered a binding magical contract with snape when snape pleaded for him to spare lily. He agreed, a contract (similar to a magic oath, maybe formed through careless wording + intention ) was created and Voldemort broke it.

He asked Lily to step aside (showing that he actually intended to fulfill his promise to snape), but when she refused he didn't care enough to stun her, instead he killed her, breaking the terms of the contract in the process.

The punishment for breaking a magical contract more often than not is the loss of magical power, death or something else specified in the contract.

Now either Voldemort died the moment he killed Lily, but was able to fire the killing curse at harry (maybe one of the horcruxes was already at work keeping him alive), splitting off a tiny fraction of the soulpiece which was currently working on filling his body again (thus making the remaining piece too small to save his body, forcing one part back into the horcrux it came from, and the other into the nearest being with his magical residue, which was harry with the curse scar). Or his magic was leaving him, making the AK so powerless, that it didn't manage to kill Harry (exhausting Voldemort to death), or some other part of the contract was fulfilled (e.g. Lily gets recognized as part of the contract, she says 'kill me, spare him', Voldemoet kills her, her sentence becomes the punishment-clause, leaving him unable to kill harry).

I like this theory, because it gets rid of this 'the sacrifice of a mother is special', because it's not. Actually, I think it would be a fairly common thing, which would leave hundreds of orphans AK-protected.

*** I also have something of a contractual view of the situation, but not involving Snape:

#+begin_quote
  The key is not that Lily died, but that she died after Voldemort gave her the choice to live, to which she said "take me instead". She made the active and free choice to offer her life to Voldemort in exchange for Harry, and Voldemort implicitly accepted it by killing her.

  This is why it was so crucial for Harry not to fight Voldemort in the forest in DH. If he had resisted Voldemort in any way, it would not have been Harry freely accepting the deal Voldemort offered to Hogwarts: give me Harry and none of you will be harmed. Harry took Voldemort up on the offer, sacrificed his life freely in exchange for the inhabitants of Hogwarts, and therefore the people at Hogwarts were protected from Voldemort's magic (even though Harry didn't stay dead).

  So... it wasn't love, it was contract law XD

I see what you're saying but really, how many people do you think are running around trying to kill babies while leaving their family members unharmed/offering to spare them? The wizarding population is pretty small in the first place, therefore the percentage that are murderers is going to be even smaller, and murderers who are willing to leave witnesses has got to be minuscule.

Can you think of many real-life occurrences where people have occasion to heroically die for one another? I'm sure a lot of us would be willing, but the opportunity just doesn't come up that often. Even in a war-time situation where a parent might perfectly well jump in front of a child and say "Kill me instead!" a normal soldier would be planning to kill the whole family anyway if they were killing the kids, so that wouldn't activate this protection.

So I'm willing to believe it's an extremely rare protection like in the books. Canon also doesn't state that it's unique to a mother, I imagine it would activate for anyone willing to step up and die for a loved one.

I've also always thought that when JKR had Dumbledore speak of Lily's sacrifice as "an ancient magic" she was referencing the Narnia books- specifically when Aslan speaks of "Deeper Magic from Before the Dawn of Time". That is also sacrificial magic. And of course Narnia is an allegory for Christian myth, and look how the series ended up with Harry's sacrifice. So it's always made sense to me that willing sacrifice equals protection.

*** Are magical oaths a thing in canon besides unbreakable vows? The only canon binding magical contract I can remember is the GoF one, and that takes a powerful artifact to create. The unbreakable vow takes a specific spell. It doesn't seem like these can just happen by accident.

** Specific to the first book, it's hinted that Voldemort possessing other creatures tended to burn them out. The animals near his haunting spot in Albania knew to stay far away as so many would succumb to a dark creature if they ventured too close. Even as a passenger, you get the sense that Voldemort was a burden upon Quirrel.

Their quest together at Hogwarts was to retrieve the Philosopher's Stone and thereby enable Voldemort's re-embodiment, so the periodic drinking of unicorn blood was probably a stopgap to keep Quirrel alive. Thus, when Harry's protection forced Voldemort out of him, the half-life Quirrel had been living came to an abrupt, ashen end.

Of note, Voldemort continued to use Unicorn blood as I believe it was a key ingredient along with Nagini's venom in sustaining his Volde-baby body. There's some weird alchemy going on with that which probably was something he invented himself (out of necessity, as many great inventions are inspired).

Aside from that, I'd assume that using Unicorn blood as a curative would leave you dependent on it until you ran out or found a different cure for what would have otherwise destroyed you. Great for fanatics; not good for those with their eyes on living a long life.

** I always wanted it to be something more than "power of love" - that Lily was such an awesome Charms mistress that she found a way.

I never liked the "light"=good and " dark"=bad view of HP. I don't doubt that Dumbledore knows a good deal of Dark magic, especially after all his time with Grindelwald.

I can understand that. I simply decided not to dispute that theme in this post, mostly because I don't think unicorns are creatures of actual White magic, but it's hard to call them anything else.

** My understanding is that Harry survived the second killing curse because the Elder Wand couldn't be used against it's true master. The killing curse hit Harry but it only destroyed the bit of Voldemort in him.

I do agree with what you mean by a half-life being only able to live in the darkness, but I think that had nearly no effect on Voldemort at all as he was barely human with a shredded soul already.
