He has Professor Dumbledore, but as much as I love his character and hate the bashing that's done to him, I can understand some of it. He knows about the Prophecy, could tell Harry or train him at any time and doesn't, and other similar issues with him. Plus he's the Headmaster, after all.

He has Arthur, but they don't seem that close, to be honest. Would love stories where they have a father/son bond.

He has Remus in third year, and got pretty close to him, but not enough to even warrant any letters from Remus afterwards. Which was really disappointing. Wouldn't mind a father/son type of bond or mentorship bond from them.

He has Sirius, but he was on the run, and could hardly spend time with him, he tried to be there when he could, and admittedly did better then even Remus (Which I love Remus' character, but hated how he didn't even write to Harry).

A lot of stories tend to have women be the supportive/positive role models, which I love when they do it, but not as many have supportive/positive male role models. (Unless they end up being Snape raising Harry stories).

Can be focused on any of the characters that I mentioned, or even other ones.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can have any warnings.

NO OP Harry, No Lord Potter, No Harem Harry. Harry slightly more powerful or slightly smarter is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing).

No Weasley bashings.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) is a long story with 4 sequels (book 5 is ongoing and updates regularly). Sirius escapes Azkaban and takes and raises an 8-year-old Harry.

** Yes he could tell him the prophecy, but what psychological effect would that have?

Could you imagine telling an 11 year old that he's the only one who can defeat and kill Osama Bin Laden or the head of IRA ? Kill the head of an organized terrorist group that is well funded, because its most important members have access to a huge amount of money and political power within the country he lives in? And that he has to do all of that with minimal support and his death is practically guaranteed even if he can somehow accomplish the task?

He would either become obsessive in his studies or get so depressed that he wouldn't even try to survive. It's a book about a magical society and Harry's victory is seen as a given, because he is the protagonist and the hero of the story, but if there is one thing JK Rowling hasn't effed up it's realistic character development and a lot of people seem to ignore Harry's actual age throughout the series.

*** Yea dropping that on an unprepared 11 year old wouldn't work. But raising him to grow up confident and with a sense of purpose could've made a lot of difference.\\
Look at what the marauders and Snape or even the Weasley twins got up to in school compared to Harry and consider that they probably didn't have the raw power to cast a patronus at 13. So I imagine that a Harry Potter without 10 years of ingrained inferiority, who ous raised to be curious, confident and responsible, with heart teachers/ mentors/ resources would be a very different person. Plus, while Dumbledore is busy making good decisions he might as well work in delaying voldemorts return and making it harder for him to win the war (cuz honestly 1 year of silence, 1 year of ramping up attacks without much opposition and an effortless takeover of the ministry was pretty bad compared to the first war. I think that generally messing with prophesies is a bad idea and the best thing to do, would be to just prepare and try to improve your odds instead of trying to force destiny (even if it somehow worked in canon)

**** I agree that leaving Harry in an abusive household was the worst thing he could have done development wise, for Harry. The thing is, the family who agreed to raise him would probably have to live constantly under fidelius from the night Voldemort fell onward or risk the same fate of Neville's parents. Even if Molly and Arthur had agreed, how long could they go interacting with someone only Dumbledore approved of, while endangering their seven children daily? Assuming Dumbledore was the secret keeper in this alternative timeline.

The best thing for Harry would have been to be raised by Sirius and Remus, with the occasional help of others like Molly or Andromeda or Dumbledore himself.

But I mainly meant that wherever he was raised, it could have been done in a way to help prepare him for his burden and the expectations of the wizarding public.\\
(I do think the Weasleys would've been a bad option though and not just because of security. There's finances, socially they seem to not be doing to well in the magical community, Ron already felt neglected without having to compete with the boy who lived as an extra brother..)

****** That would be feasible except that it does present the same risks of giving him to the weasley plus the fact that they could be agreeing to raise Harry just because it would give them the option of influencing the boy who lived. The Flamels could have been a good choice if it came to it and Sirius was still imprisoned for something he was innocent of. They would be independently famous and wealthy and predisposed to take care of Harry for the greater good, but it would still be a problem to socialize him. Children need to interact with other children to develop and that would be even more difficult considering the Flamels' famous reclusive nature.

** My primary reason for disliking Dumbledore is his failure to take any steps to prevent Harry's entire childhood being defined by abuse and neglect. You can disagree with how he handled the prophecy or whatnot but the failure to protect Harry from the Dursleys was definitely unacceptable.

On a more meta level the theme of love being powerful and Petunia still having the power to protect Harry has an extremely bad Aesop of "Your family loves you even when they actively abuse you and under no circumstances are you to get yourself away from them no matter how toxic they are"
