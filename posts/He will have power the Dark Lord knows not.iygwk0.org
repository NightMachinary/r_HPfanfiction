:FlairText: Anti-Magic Prompt
:END:
*Harry Potter* was a special boy, with a special ability. Anti-Magic.

Whenever he experienced intense emotions, his parents discovered at a young age that it triggered an Anti-Magic Pulse from his body, redirecting or completely preventing any and all magicks to be cast in a 50m radius.

Which emotions? They discovered from intense fear, when the boy would cry in terror, or when spooked, his powers would naturally show itself - but it had a catch. While everyone else was left essentially, magicless, he himself would still retain his own magic, and anti-magic.

Why - one Halloween night, when Voldemort raised his wand at a crying Harry, the boy let out a shriek, and the A-MP redirected the killing curse back at the Dark Lord, destroying his body (the fragmented magical soul of the Dark Lord was removed from his body) and destroyed the Fidelius Wards around the home at Godrics Hollow.

If it were not for the destruction of the Fidelius Wards, then potentially Albus Dumbledore and the like would not have remember.

.

.

.

And then one day, when the boy turned 10, a letter arrived, and the Wizarding World was never the same.

** Nortrom the Silencer from Dota 2 then. I'd say call Harry's ability "the gift of silence".

** Spoilers for linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent):

The Power He Knows Not in this is anti-magic, but not in the sense of reflecting magic back. Instead, Harry can negate spells, making them disappear without their effects happening. I've always loved this concept, because 1. It doesn't require a Deus Ex Machina to bring Harry on par with Voldemort magically - there's no believable way to do this in the canon time frame if they're both competing in traditional magic and 2. It's something that would legitimately terrify Voldemort. He's based his entire identity on magic and his skill in it - anyone who can invalidate that and turn him into a regular person would be his worst nightmare. I'm still bummed no one else has taken this concept and ran with it separately - Blindness by AngelaStarCat had something similar, with Harry being able to unravel spells, but it was just a side effect of his greater understanding of magic, as opposed to the main focus
