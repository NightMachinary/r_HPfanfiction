:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi I am trying to find a fic i read recently where both Harry and Draco time travel back to year 1. They are not aware of the fact that both of them have gone back, but they realise as they have their duel at night in the trophy room. I believe Draco is concerned about altering the timeline whilst Harry doesn't care about it. It should be said that there is no romance between the two of them as far as I remember.

Likely not it, but there's a chance its what you're after

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
