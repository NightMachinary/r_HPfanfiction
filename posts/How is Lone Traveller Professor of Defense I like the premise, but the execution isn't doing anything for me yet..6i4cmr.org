I'm about a fourth of the way through the story. I've only read one other Lone Traveler story before and considered it to be pretty average as far as fanfiction goes, but this one is disappointing me at every turn.

I really like the premise of Harry as a Professor at Hogwarts and want this to be good but everything is grating. Nothing has happened at all in the story yet, just HP doing a lot of preparations for the school year, and all his conversations with every other character really make me want to cringe and skip ahead. I'm constantly skipping over paragraphs and dialogue because it keeps looking so tedious and extremely verbose for no reason I can imagine, I can't even see what the plot is yet really.

I'm not trying to shit all over it, but I want to know if it gets better before the end? It seems like it's decently popular, but do any of my grievances get addressed or toned down after a while? Thanks in advance.


** I personally never liked all the Lone Traveler stuff. It just seemed, disappointing? It's tedious, everything is too simple and there's no tension of any kind. The lack of tension is okay with something like linkffn(Dimension Hopping for Beginners by nonjon), where the point is to poke fun at how unimaginative and unoriginal most fanfiction is. But the Lone Traveler takes itself seriously and falls short.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

** is not that great.. the only long story of the lone traveler that I remember being somewhat OK was the one about the best minister. Still, there are some details that I liked like the designs of the potions classroom and the library, and the petunia/peter was ehh... refreshing.
