I'll read anything but rape or harem, but feel free to rec them anyway for those that don't mind reading that kind of stuff. Thanks!


** Can't believe linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) hasn't been mentioned yet. One of the best humour fics out there in my opinion. I don't even like first person or crack fics but this one is just perfect.

** This isn't me recommending my fic but asking for feedback. I always hated 1st person too, so my partner set me the challenge of writing a one shot in 1st person. I borrowed from the diary of Adrian mile by Sue townsend and wrote linkffn(The Secret Diary of Hugo Granger-Weasley)

It made me feel a bit better about 1st person but I'm still not sure I'd use it for a full length fic.

** linkffn(8175132), which features gender bender harry, time travel, and Harry/Tonks. The rape is backstory, rather than taking place in the story proper

linkffn(8501689), a Star Wars crossover, beginning in the middle of Episode 1. Major events from the Star Wars verse are usually mentioned by other characters, rather than Harry being involved directly. While not harem per se, Harry sleeps around, with no real indication of an actual pairing any time soon

** Someone already mentioned Seventh Horcrux, and that's about the only first person Harry Potter fic I've found that is tolerable. Because it was originally in third person limited, I don't believe that the series lends itself well to first person.

My personal favorite first-person fanfic would be a Dresden Files one. The writer manages a passable imitation of Butcher's style, and I found it rather good.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling]]

First person story told from Ginny Weasley POV. One of my favorite stories too!

*** I'm fairly sure 'The Changeling' is not first-person but rather third-person limited (compared to third-person omniscient). Limited third-person can be implemented in a very similar way to first person (and is essentially the same as the original text) . First person however uses pronouns such as I and we rather than: he/she and they.

** One of the very first fics I read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4260581/1/Lessons-Learned][Lessons Learned]] was first-person. I wouldn't consider it one of my favourites (nor is it particularly high quality), but I did enjoy it.

There is also [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?chapterid=301596&i=1][Delicate]] and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?chapterid=448372&i=1][Off the Rails]] both of which are entirely romance fics (and certainly not for everyone).

  My shrink says I repress feelings and emotions. She told me once that I have trouble “admitting reality” to myself. Now, I don't know if that's true. After all, I don't have the fancy Psychological Healing degree, do I?
