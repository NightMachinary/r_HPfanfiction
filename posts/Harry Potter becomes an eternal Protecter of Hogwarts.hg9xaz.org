Hundreds upon hundreds of years have passed and yet, he seems to still reside at Hogwarts. He only seemingly appears when a fellow student is in danger and will disappear immediately after. The theories made up of him varied from people believing him to be some sort of inferi while others reckoning that he had somehow possibly created a philosopher stone which would explain why he resembled that of a teenager. There are of course some who simply think him to be just a myth. But the ones who truly believe in his existance will always find comfort in Hogwarts as they know that if they were ever in any danger there, Harry Potter will always be there to serve his duty as Protecter.

This idea just came randomly, but I thought it would be cool if Harry Potter somehow becomes a part of Hogwarts like the ghosts or the paintings. It would also be interesting if It remains a mystery on how he somehow remained at his youth for centuries. He will just be this cryptid of Hogwarts that comes and goes before anyone can question him.


** "What's wrong?" a voice startled Aylin Scamander from her tears, she looked up to see a boy, around 17 or so, crouching down to eye level with her with a frown marring his handsome features.

"N...nothing.." she mumbled drying her eyes with a sleeved arm.

The young man tilted his head, his green eyes filled with curiosity, but also doubt "Well now that's not true, if it was nothing you would be back in your common room, not out here, crying your eyes out."

The first year let out a shuddering sigh and studied him once more, he reminded her of Uncle Sirius, though his hair was much shorter than his and his eyes a bright green instead of brown, she decided to trust him. "Some other first years...they took my great gramama's necklace..."

the moment she said that she could have sworn the warmth that filled the room fled as the young mans eyes hardened, but it returned moments later when his frown turned into a smile.

"Well now, that was very rude of them, but lucky for you I happen to know a spell that can bring it back to you." his words filled her with hope, she didn't know any magic that could do that, but he was a seventh year so he must know plenty of magic and her face brightened at the idea.

the young man smile got bigger as he reached behind her ear and spoke the words "mumbly dumbly doo!" and then yanked, a tinkling sound reached her ear and before she could point out that what he had said was just gibberish and not a real spell, her great grandmothers bottlecap necklace was in his hands, dangling before her eyes.

her eyes widened at the sight and her tears threatened to return, she was so caught up in her happiness at having her belongings returned to her that she didn't catch the melancholy look the young man was giving both her and the necklace.

the look dissapeared though as the young man slide the necklace over her head and returning it to her with a smile, "head on back to your common room little one," He helped her up before turning to leave, not before stopping to tell her one more thing "As long as you are here at Hogwarts, you will never lose anything, or have anything stolen from you, I swear it." with that the young man walked down the hall, leaving a smiling and mystified young girl behind. One with light blond hair and grey eyes, much like someone he had known long ago.

** It is well known that a new Dark Lord would pop up once every generation. Most times they were rather silly Dark Lords, all things considered. Some wanted more money, others more restrictions on magic, one was quite famously insane, wanting his own harem of loyal witches for some reason or another.

But not all Dark Lords are so humorous. You may have heard of the three generations of terror. First came Grindelwald; The-Terror-Of-The-East, then Voldemort; He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and then Asagede; The-Black-Monster.

You may have also heard of another wizard from this time. Harry Potter; The-Hogwarts-Hero. Known for defeating Voldemort three times; once as an infant, again as a child, a third time as a teen, and then later defeating Asagede as an adult.

But this is not all Harry Potter is famous for. In certain circles one may hear of Harry Potter; The-Immortal-Protector. This moniker stems from the uncertainty surrounding the entirety of his life. Harry Potter is well known for surviving the killing curse multiple times, as well as reportedly being killed in multiple other ways during his life, including decapitation, immolation, and disintegration. After living an unusually long one hundred and eighty-seven years, Harry Potter gave all of his possessions to his children, and then supposedly died peacefully in his sleep the next night. But as many believers will point out, no body was ever reported to be seen afterwards, and a few years later Harry Potter was sighted once more, as a teenager inside the hallowed halls of Hogwarts. Here Harry Potter has been known to protect particularly vulnerable students from bullying, and to rescue abused children from their homes. No low level Dark Lords have appeared for the past nine generations. Only one high level one, who was prophesied to be defeated shortly after her arrival.

It should also be noted that those whose parents taught them of the Deathly Hallows and their history will point out that after the Death Stick was taken by Dumbledore from Grindelwald, it is unknown what happened to it. Some claim that Harry Potter acquired the wand from Dumbledore, the stone from Voldemort (whose moniker means â€˜flight of death', perhaps based on the fleeing ghosts), and the cloak from his own deceased father, and now serves as master over Death. The veracity of the last statement is a matter of debate, since if his father had possession of the cloak, why was it not used to hide from Voldemort?

** This reminds me a bit of a one shot I read that had a bit more of a disturbing ending. Like it was almost the opposite but similar? If that makes sense? It's called The Truth About Harry

***** It reminded me of an idea I had where Harry Potter was actually created by the beliefs of every wizard in the wizarding world, so when people stop believing in him, he grows weaker.

****** Yea I've read this too. This falls into the category of magic creating people. I've also read a fic where Hermione was created by Magic to be Harry's best friend, but a best friend only. So when he started loving her more, she too disappeared.
