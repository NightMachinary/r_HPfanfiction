So my friend's been writing this fanfiction about a mute character living in a family of witches, and it had me thinking about what kinds of services would be provided for the deaf, blind, physically disabled, etc. Additionally, would there be different types of communication (like sign language) or maybe spells to help people navigate? Just curious as to what everyone else thinks, because I've never thought about this before.


** I think Rowling's "magic can heal all muggle illnesses/injuries" rule would cover most physical disabilities. If wizarding parents noticed their baby was mute or blind or deaf, it would probably be a matter of going to the Healer one afternoon.

/Mental/ disability might be trickier.

*** Wizards and witches are still human though, so I would assume that even Healers as of now are unable to repair certain things. I'm thinking of Mad-Eye in this case.

Mental disability is definitely trickier! They're usually sent to St. Mungo's, but I'm wondering what kind of treatments their stay would involve.

**** All of Mad-Eye's non-healed scars and injuries come from Dark Curses. All mundane damage is easily repaired.

I don't know whether non-magical mental patients would also be sent to St.Mungo's. I mean, /probably/, but all those we see were there from mind-magic-related damage, not normal disabilities/illnesses.

***** It's confusing to me that characters like Harry wear glasses, indicating a deterioration of eyesight + that being in his genetics, most likely. I'm not sure if that kind of disability, which is present in both muggle and wizarding kind (just like being born blind/deaf), can be cured/repaired magically. Harry surely would've had the option to do so but still has glasses into adulthood.

****** My best explanation is that while fixing myopia with magic is possible, it's very precise and advanced work, as myopia is a genetic, advancing illness rather than just a static malformation to fix. So it would take a /very/ skilled Healer to heal near-sightedness. That sort of service doesn't come cheap, and since there are much chaper charms for making glasses comfortable, nigh-unbreakable, and prevent them from falling accidentally, all but the vainest people just don't bother. (Bagman or Lockhart, for instance, strike me as people who just might have coughed up a full demyopisation, though that's just speculation.)

******* Kinda related but not really.

Do Wizards, or at least purebloods have any concept of genetics/hereditary conditions? I've seen many fanfic where characters like Draco claim to be better than muggleborns because "it's simple genetics".

******** I'm wondering that too, because if wizards and witches were able to manipulate even genetic/hereditary conditions, wouldn't that make them completely infallible as living beings?

******** Even the least scientifically advanced societies knew about heredity empirically. Sons resembling grandfathers will do that. The entire idea of racism/"blood-purism" is rooted in the idea that people are inherently better than others and others are worse, and they pass down these characteristics to descendants.

Now, do they know the word "genetics", or the science behind it? I don't know. Probably not as such.

**** I dont really think mental disability would be much of a problem for a trained healer. I mean what stops them from casting some healing charm on the brain, or outright transfiguring it into a healthy brain. Or just remove memories that caused the damage, or use charms that affects their emotions like the cheering charm.

***** The thing is, people are never truly "cured" of mental illness; they find ways to cope and accommodation at work/in school. In any case, I don't think healers are advanced enough to deal with chemical imbalances and the like, and to tamper with someone's memories is to tamper with their character.

****** Why wouldnt healers be advanced enoug. Wizards can regroe limbs and can create new mids and conjure animals from nothinh. Its not like they would need to know how the brains work. And you cant treat mental illnes without tampering with someones character to some degree. It also jelps that wizards define themselves by theor souls, not ny their minds.

** The fic "Blindness" deals with this question in the early chapters. I think the assumption in that fic that the Magical Society is absolutely unprepared to deal with something like this makes most sense. They usually can heal most of these problems. In the Muggle world it took a long long time of societal progress to try to accommodate such a tiny percentage of the population and Magical Britain already doesn't seem very accommodating to much larger minorities.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I would think a mute or deaf person would learn nonverbal magic way earlier than the usual (Hogwarts sixth year, age sixteen). Or else you could use signing to cast spells, since the words and the wands are just focuses for the mages themselves, so it would be just the same thing. :) Blind people could cast verbal and nonverbal magic just fine, but I think combat stuff would be totally out of the question.

In my story I have a paralyzed witch who gets around in a wheelchair that can be used normally, but also can hover, so she can get up stairs and tough terrain no problem. :)

** Being mute would almost be as bad as being a squib, considering that a lot of magic other than potions and accidental and the occasional wandless magic requires speaking. Perhaps magic can still be done by mouthing the spell, if one practices enough? Communication could probably be done using a slate that is able to read your thoughts and turn them into words. Being deaf would also affect one's ability to cast magic as well, since it would screw with the ability to properly say spells. However, if being deaf isn't a problem with the brain, magic can probably fix that, or if it is, a spell or item could be made that transmits the words straight to the mind. Being blind could be dealt with using a spell or item that reads words and facial expressions, and creates sounds in such a way that the landscape can be mapped in sound and be easily understandable.

However, you have to realise that magic is able to cure or prevent in the first place almost all Muggle maladies. You're pretty much guaranteed to have no such problems if you have magic. Which is why the biggest disability is being a squib. Basically there would be no such services because no one else has such problems, unless they were caused by magic.

*** Someone mentioned learning nonverbal magic, which is advanced but not impossible, so at least for those who can't speak, I don't think their disability would shame them to the level of a squib. Also, I feel like blindness and deafness shouldn't be limited to Muggles, because wizards and witches are still human, if not amplified versions. I remember in an interview, Rowling was actually going to include a blind person in the first book, but took him out for characterization reasons. I definitely think that broken bones and other physical problems could be better solved via magic though. As for the communicative slate/transmitting words from the mind, it makes me think of Legilimency almost.

**** Wizards and witches are not really human, but rather superhuman. There's a lot of evidence that whether unconsciously or just because of the nature of magic, they are able to withstand many things that normal humans can't. They regularly fly on brooms going hundreds of miles an hour, at many more Gs than a normal human can withstand. Harry has his arm bones vanished. Human transfiguration of any kind involves some level of distorting the body. All these show that magicals are well beyond humans.

All injuries in HP can be healed, be they Muggle or magical, unless they are inflicted by dark magic. Moody's injuries are permanent. George's ear cannot be reattached because it was cut off by Sectumsempra.

** As a special education teacher, your post had me thinking about learning disabilities. Does the wizarding world acknowledge learning disabilities? Does Hogwarts have special education teachers? We know there are squibs and courses they can take. So what about students who struggle with reading and writing? Or other disabilities that affect school performance?

** If your friend wants to do a story about a disabled person, it would be best to do it centered on some sort of incurable genetic or mental defect. There's some stories out there where Harry has cancer, but I think it'd be more unusual with Cystic Fibrosis or something like that.
