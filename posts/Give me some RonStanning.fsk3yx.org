I was reading linkffn(The Legacy Preservation Act). *MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD* It was good. Premise was slightly far-fetched, but it was written believably. All was going well. People seemed mostly in-character. There was nothing extreme on any side. There was abuse by the Dursleys, but only minor. Harry was powerful, but not even close to OP. Romance was decently built-up. And little over half-way through the fic, BAM! Ron!bashing out of nowhere. Argh!

So please, give me some good Ron fics. If people can turn son of a bitch Draco into some misunderstood charming knight in a shining armour. There must be some great Ron out there. There has to be.


** It's both funny and annoying at the same time how so many writers bash Ron. I once started reading a time travel fic set in 70s/80s and the writer still wrote a whole paragraph of Ron bashing even though he doesn't even appear and it has literally no impact on the plot.

Unfortunately, I've yet to read a particularly good Ron-centric fic.

Hopefully as the fandom grows older, this childish hate towards Ron (and characters like Molly Weasley and James Potter) will decrease.

I wouldn't bet on it. You can't even ask for Hermione-critical fics without downvotes. I suggested once that /maybe/ Lily wasn't the saint that canon paints her to be and people were pissed.

***** Lol where? My 'Enough of the Ron-Bashing Rant'? 'Insane Fanfic Authors'? A request for a previously mentioned fic where Hermione couldn't keep up with practical magic in 4th year?

The rest was sarcastic jibes over Hermione's Mary-Sue status in the fandom. Remember, Ron-bashing came first.

** I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

(SELF-PROMO) I have my fic Broken, where Ron tells Hermione to take a hike. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]); linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]).

Strange Vistors is another one that has Ron equal to Hermione and Harry. He's also learning Healing from Hufflepuff. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8550820/1/Strange-Visitors-From-Another-Century]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]) is a classic.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13128275/1/]]) is good too.

The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Good-Ron/77651/][Good Ron Community]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Fanfiction-Starring-Ron/130651/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/][Fanfiction, Starring Ron]] has some good ones. Check out Pinky Brown, s/he has a lot of detailed Ron fics.

And, for a Champion Chef!Ron with Wizard!Gordon Ramsay, check out linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12805206]]). Defies pretty much all the usual tropes. Well-written OCs. Has a happy ending.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** Okay I know I'm super late, but here are my fave picks! There's a lot.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24897403]]) is also a time travel fix it, Ron-centric.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341]]) is just fucking good. It's where Hermione gets consequences for attacking Ron in HBP. I can't say any more cause it's just good.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12365883]]) is also quite good...Dark! Trio with OP characters and time travel to Lord Voldemort's time.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18561046]]) is also really good, follows Slytherin Ron. Oneshot

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16199003]]) is another Ron time travel fic. It's so good though. Like astounding.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16288199]]) is a time traveling Percy Weasley fic where he fucks himself up and tries to protect everyone.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23425024]]) is a hilarious Draco/Ron rom com.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1992918]]) is a oneshot where Ron comes back from summer after something terrible has happened to him.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13139083/1/]]) This one is simply incredible. The tale is spun so well. The anticipation. It's amazing. Follows Ron on his last case as an Auror, finding out Harry's family's darkest secret...

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1216035/1/]]) Chess game and Ron and Snape centric. Not a slash! Just good ol Death Eaters and a chess championship.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6905950/1/]]) Incredible Ron time travel fic where the tropes are thoroughly explored and discussed in a very realistic way.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/]]) The Red Knight. It's very well known, very well done. An all around great read.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5288841/1/]]) Ron centric, also dealing with Ron's insecurities!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2954815/1/]]) and linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2929256/1/]]) Extreme Ron whump. What happens when Ron decides to take Harry's detention with Umbridge in his place?

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2333917/1/]]) Ron and Harry have more in common than they'd thought.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10199030/1/]]) Ron gets in over his head and is faced with terrible consequences.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7523798/1/]]) Stay Standing. The original Ron whump fic that if you don't know you need to.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/]]) I'm sure you have this recommended already, but a very jaded Ron and Harry go back in time!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11491514/1/]]) Another time travelling Ron fic.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12742123/1/]]) Ron love to get away from all the bashing! An exploration of his many achievements.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12870741/1/]]) Ron-centric and major whump. The Boogeyman is real and Ron knows this all too well...

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11595257/1/]]) How Ron and Snape become bros!

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10024932/1/]]) What happens when Ron leaves on the Horcrux Hunt? To what lengths will he go to make it right?

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13601689/1/Maroon-Eagle]]) New fic. Ravenclaw!Ron. (Obviously) Ron-centric.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866134/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Weasley-Seer]]) Ron's Divination predictions come true somehow. Becomes crackish in later chapters.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3637489/1/Six-Foot-Of-Ginger-Idiot]]). Ron's 6th year journal. Semi-canon compliant.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). 4th year, PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry, for that matter).

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21722194][Ron Weasley: Accident Match Maker by Phoenix_Waves]]

It's a Drarry pairing but it's short, sweet, fluffy, features George, Angelina, and Lee's postwar friendship/mischief (which I feel is hard to come by) and Ron is not an idiot.
