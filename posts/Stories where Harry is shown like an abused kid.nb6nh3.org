I don't remember how Rowling wrote Dursleys abusing Harry, but I think it at least contained verbal assault and bullying. In which case Harry should have been shown at least a little differently in canon. Maybe trust issues or panic attacks?

Ex: Because of Harry Hunting, Harry felt distressed in loud and crowded situations, like his introduction into the wizarding world. Instead of somehow holding his place and shaking everyone's hands, he had a panic attack and tried to flee the Leaky Cauldron.


** Linkffn(soul scars) definitely exacerbates the abuse, but it's a dominant part of the plot to where it was abandoned

  What's a girl to do when somewhere out there, there's a boy and every scar he gets appears on her body? When he's being abused? Hermione Granger, for one, is determined to find him and save him. Fourth Year. There's a big event at Hogwarts this year. The DOM is interested in the bonded. Darkness looms, old enemies return to haunt them and new foes make life more difficult.
