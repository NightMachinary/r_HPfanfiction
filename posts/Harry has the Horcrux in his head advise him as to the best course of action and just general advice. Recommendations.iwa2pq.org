** You might enjoy Accidental Horcrux.

Personally I was not a great fan by the end, as I felt like it squandered the premise and ended up giving us a rather dull, vanilla Harry. But it's relatively well-written.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** It's unfinished, but linkffn(4003405) has what you're looking for.

The horcrux "Tom" shows Harry Voldemort's memories of combat, and has him review those memories as well as Harry's own and gives him advice about how he could do better.

** I would really want to read fics Where Maybe the horucrux posses Harry's body (to help or protect Harry) in fights or maybe when Vernon is about to attack Harry or the troll. All of these already posted seem really interesting
