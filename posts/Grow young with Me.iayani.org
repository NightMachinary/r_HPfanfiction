:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all,

I wanted to know if theres a part 2 to this story sort of like a sequel especially as the story was left in a cliff hanger and there were only 28 chapters and the story was published in 2015? If not then are there any other similar fan fiction stories like it?


** If you're talking about this one... linkffn(11111990)

That was last updated in June /this year/. It's still ongoing, just has a slow update schedule.

**** Published, yes. Updated, no. It's still updating now, and there's no sequel or part 2 because the story is still going and isn't finished yet.

***** ah I see well thanks but like there's only 28 chapters for such a long time I simply cannot wait for more chapters to be released. Is it updated as per chapter or a bunch of chapters grouped together and how will ik when those new chapters are released?

****** Per chapter - they update as each chapter is completed, I believe. And if you check the author's page on FFNet, they apparently have a Tumblr that they post updates on.

And well, yeah. I know that feeling, wanting more chapters when you find a good unfinished fic. It sucks when stories update slowly, but sometimes the authors have lives that demand a lot of them - too much for them to spend a lot of time writing. Sad, but it is how it is. :)

******** Not really anything terribly similar. It's kind of a 'unique gem' of a fic. I know there's been stuff where single and occasionally two elements are similar (fics where Harry is a parent, fics where Harry is a sad widower, fics where Harry falls for a muggle, fics with sappy 'getting to know you' romance, etc etc.), but not fics with a lot of similarities. Too many to adequately list, really, and I've only been here a few months so I wouldn't know that many by name myself anyway.

If you want to find some, I'd recommend doing a sub search. If you check around your screen (I'm not sure what device you're on or whether you're on old or new reddit, but you're looking for the same thing regardless), you should find a search bar (it helpfully says 'search' in it). If you type what you're looking for in there, then click the tickbox to limit your search to this sub, you'll find a lot of the posts other people have made on whatever you're looking for. That'll get you a whole bunch of posts with, quite likely, a whole bunch of fics.

Otherwise, just make another post yourself and ask for fics similar to this Grow Young With Me. :)

**** I understand fully, you want to know if there's a sequel or something - which I just said, the fic is still ongoing.

Yes, it was /published/ back in 2015 - that means the /first chapter/ went up then. The latest chapter went up on the 15th of June, 2020 - as seen by "Updated".

It's at chapter 28 and leaves a lot open, which means if it's going to continue it'll be in the same story.

TL;DR there's no sequel, but Chapter 29 is coming at some point (though I have no idea when).
