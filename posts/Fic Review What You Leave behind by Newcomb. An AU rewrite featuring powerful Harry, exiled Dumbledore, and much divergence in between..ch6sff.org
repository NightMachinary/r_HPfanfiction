*The Premise*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind]] is an AU rewrite which, aside from a prologue, begins at Kings Cross Station on September 1st when Harry is 11 years old. Rather than a singular premise for the AU, the author's purpose is fourfold. From their profile:

1. An exploration and expansion of Hogwarts as a truly /magical/ place.
2. A different trio of main characters.
3. A believable, slow burning, in-depth love story.
4. A believably powerful, proactive Harry Potter.

There are also several points of divergence from the canon, such as:

- Ariana Dumbledore is alive

- The Order of the Phoenix is treated as a terrorist organisation by the Ministry

- Albus Dumbledore has been banished from England

- Sirius Black escaped Azkaban much sooner

- Harry was born in 1979 instead of 1980, so he starts Hogwarts one year earlier

It was this last divergence which most interested me, because rather than becoming fast friends with Ron and Hermione, Harry becomes close to Cho and Cedric. Full disclosure -- I love Cho Chang, so there is a huge bias for me in favour of this story. Like the author, I feel like both Cho and Cedric got the short end of the stick in canon, so a story which was going to make them much more central, fleshed out characters was a big draw card for me.

The sad part is that this fic was abandoned after 11 chapters back in 2015, so whilst I feel it was intended to be a full 7-year story, it cuts off in Harry's third year.

​

*The Plot*

There's a sort of self-contained mystery plot for Harry's first year, but it isn't as complicated as the ones in canon, and once it is solved it comprises most of the set up for the subsequent years. Aside from the noted parts of divergence, most canon lynchpins are carefully observed and kept in place, showing that the author put a lot of detail into keeping it realistic. The blood protection is kept but cleverly worked around with the use of a vanishing cabinet, for example.

There was one scene fairly early on which I found genuinely galling, and was somewhat horrified at how glazed over it was. Harry accidentally performs a spell too advanced for a first year, and immediately an Auror (who was already stationed at the school on another assignment) comes out from under the disillusionment charm she'd been using to spy on him and takes him up to the headmaster's office. Once there she floo-calls the ministry, and within minutes 11-year-old Harry is surrounded by the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and the Minister for Magic.

Under a /suspicion/ that Harry might have been in contact with Dumbledore -- not Voldemort: Dumbledore -- they cast /legilimens/ on Harry's mind and proceed to probe through his entire life. There is no legal preamble, no rights that Harry might have, literally no adult in Harry's corner saying “don't raid this child's mind”, and no one asks him for permission or even tells him what they're going to do. Afterwards, Harry is collapsed on the floor and thinks to himself that he feels violated, but no one really shows any concern and then that's kind of the end of it. It made me Umbridge-level mad to read that, and I couldn't believe that even the headmaster, who was in the room at the time, made no protest about it whatsoever. I'm still not sure if the author intended to revisit how incredibly invasive, dangerous, and damning of the ministry that scene was, but I hope so.

After first year there are a few other miniature mysteries which drive the plot forward, most of which revolve around DADA professor Elphias Doge. The characters make note of the oddity of Doge returning after Harry's first year, since the DADA curse is a thing remarked upon and even bet on by the students. But Elphias sticks around as the enigma, setting Harry & co on a mission to discover the Founders' Rooms of Hogwarts. Whilst a sort of Founders' treasure hunt is not the most original of ideas, it has a certain shine to it in the YA/Fantasy/Adventure genre. I myself love a good “find all four and unlock the secret power” narrative, and I like it when there is a canon basis being used as a springboard for a deeper story. In this case, of course the Chamber of Secrets is Slytherin's room, the Room of Requirement is Ravenclaw's, but there are two original ones being looked for too. The author seemed like they knew what they were doing and exactly where they were going with the plot, but the story cuts off so early that we only get as far as seeing Hufflepuff's room, and even then not all of it.

There's sort of a neat tie in where the hunt for the rooms coincides with the Chamber of Secrets being opened, leading Harry to believe that someone else is looking for the rooms too. What is also interesting here is that the set up for Ginny being given Tom Riddle's diary still occurs just as it did in canon, but there are some pretty strong indications nonetheless that she isn't the one who opened the Chamber this time, and I was looking forward to seeing who did.

Harry also gets an idea for being on the front foot in the fight against Voldemort, but whatever it was, it seems to be a long game idea which is heavily hinted at involving bringing the philosopher's stone to Hogwarts. Effectively Harry's first two years are not overly eventful affairs, but his third year (which would have been his second year in the original timeline) appears to be combining the plot of PS and CoS.

Overall I'd say it was an engaging if not overly cohesive plot, and since the story was never finished it's unclear how good the payoff would have been.

Premise point 4 -- the powerful Harry -- is featured quite heavily as well. Without giving too much away, Harry receives special and consistent training, not just on his general spellwork, but also on the philosophy of magic. I've noticed that in many of the fics which are recommended to me for review there is a solid effort put into explaining the mechanics of magic, into pinning down the rules of what will and won't work, and why. Here, Douglas Adams is quoted directly to provide a metaphor for the use of magic as an exercise in a duality of mind, an embraced contradiction to free oneself from the constraints of logic and make the best use of magic (“aim for the ground and miss”). Given how very /not logical/ wizarding society in general is, and how difficult it is to wrap logical laws around the abilities of magic in J.K's canon, this philosophy is a pretty satisfying one, though I wish it had only retained a similarity to Douglas Adams and not broken the fourth wall in explaining it.

There is also an explanation given as to how very subjective magic is in its application. A conversation around the term /Ēthos Anthrōpōi Daimōn/ occurs between Harry and another character (redacted for spoilers), which was striking enough that I'll quote it directly.

/"It means 'character is destiny'....In the magical world, it's a simple truth. Your character informs your Patronus, colours your spellcasting, even chooses your House at that school of yours. But it's more than that - it's a way of looking at things. It means that you create the reality you know. You are what you seek to know about yourself."/

I really enjoy this kind of deep-dive into the wizarding world of magic.

Lastly, the various plots are spaced out between good doses of slice-of-life writing. I love good character development, where not everything is about Voldemort all the time and sometimes it's just about kids growing up and finding their feet. Harry, Cho and Cedric are all seekers on their respective teams, just like in canon, and quidditch games take a pretty central spot in Harry's social life. Props to the author -- they made me really enjoy reading about quidditch again. The matches played out differently to the canon ones but were still really gripping, and of course the outcome of every match has a bearing on the relationships between the members of the trio.

I find that this kind of detail gets left out of many plot heavy stories, but it makes the story elements balance nicely, allowing for a more immersive experience because we get to know our characters as people, not just as adventurers.

​

*The Writing*

Writing quality was extremely good, reminiscent in many passages of J.K herself, which gives a warm, familiar feel to it. A few spelling errors scattered around, but few and far between. Aside from one indirect reference to masturbation, it's all pretty PG. It's written in 3rd person limited from Harry's POV, but a chapter each is also told respectively from Cedric and Cho's POV.

On the downside, it may be a nitpick, but way too many characters are comfortable calling Dumbledore by his first name. Technically Dumbledore is no longer a professor in this story, but English conventions would dictate that you would still at least afford him the respect of calling him by his last name, especially when you're not even an adult yet. It's one of those details which takes me out of the story a bit, since Dumbledore himself often takes careful pains to afford due respect to others when he refers to them. Remember when Harry was ranting about ‘Snape' in HBP, and Dumbledore kept chiding Harry to call him ‘Professor Snape'?

The kids also felt way too linguistically advanced for their age . The fact that a twelve-year-old Cedric uses the word ‘pontificated' sort of crystallises the overall problem, but you see it scattered throughout the chapters.

However, there were more good sides to the writing than bad sides. The author will occasionally drop a line here or there that really stood out to me as a good metaphor or clever phrase, and something that fits very well with the genre. Here is one of the lines which caught me:

/Cedric was just putting the finishing touches on a decent-sized ball of anxiety over Quidditch Tryouts when Harry got his attention./

Lastly, I want to briefly draw attention to the humour. The author's flavour of humour really tastes like the Potterverse and gave me some literal laugh out loud moments in public, which fic doesn't often do. From accidentally *engorgio-*ing Hedwig to Fred and George building a 15-foot snow monstrosity there are some pretty great pranks and funny moments peppered throughout the story.

*Characterisation*

Needless to say, Fred and George were spot on. Their only downside is that I wish they had been around more often.

Cho and Cedric are completely believable given the templates of their canon characters. Cedric is an all-round competent good guy who is uncomfortable with his overbearing father and in need of some genuine adventure in his life. Cho is the vibrant girl that canon Harry got a crush on in Prisoner of Azkaban, rather than the sobbing wreck she was in Order of the Phoenix. She's cheerful, kind, intelligent, and more than a bit fanatical about quidditch. It doesn't feel like she's supposed to represent a substitute for Hermione, because her nerd-babble is largely restricted to quidditch. She also has a very different attitude to Hermione and makes friends outside of Harry and Cedric easily.

However, that lack of an exposition side character means that Harry picks up a lot of the slack. I am not sold on Harry's characterisation. Although he's still sorted into Gryffindor in this story, he reads very much like a Ravenclaw. He's very cerebral, knowledgeable, intellectually curious and emotionally muted. The author said that they wanted to feature the magic of Hogwarts with an element of the wonder you experience in the magic of it, but when Harry enters the castle that really doesn't come across. By and large, he plays hardball when it comes to being impressed, which means we can't go on any journeys of unabashed wonder -- Harry isn't there to take us on that ride. He loves flying but plays it cool and is somewhat indifferent to quidditch; rather than nervous he's critical of the sorting system upon first hearing of it, and of his friends he shows the least emotional investment in anything. He is also far older than his tender eleven years, not only with the very advanced language he uses but with the deeply abstract principals he applies very easily to his magical education. I've read that by 11 years old, children are only just beginning to comprehend things in abstract ways, and Harry feels as though he's already at university level before he hits puberty.

I don't inherently dislike the idea of a Harry who is more disciplined, proactive and curious about magic, especially in an AU where there are some pretty decent justifications for leveling Harry up (and there are some good justifications, but they're spoilery so I won't say them outright). However, unless you're incorporating the use of a time turner or dimensional shift, then I still expect an eleven-year-old to act like an eleven-year-old, even an intelligent one. Moreover, most of the groundwork for Harry becoming as good as he is happens off screen, which gives a feeling of it not being earned, and detracts from the believability of his development.

This is not to say that Harry's characterisation is all bad either. He has moments of being embarrassed, being funny, making mistakes and doing general awkward growing up. There is a budding Harry/Fleur happening in the background, which was slotted in pretty seamlessly for an endgame pairing. Harry meets Fleur at a kind of international quidditch boot camp over his first summer holiday. To begin with Fleur on a broom felt very jarring and out of character to me, but there's no real canon reason for me to have assumed this, aside from a vague, prejudicial feeling of her. I reminded myself that you can absolutely be snooty and arrogant and posh and still love sports, and once I accepted that aspect Fleur felt like a very natural fit.

Aside from our main cast, there are a smattering of background characters written with varying degrees of skill. Zacharias Smith takes over Draco Malfoy's role of all-round git but doesn't feel like a Slytherin, which is awesome; Katie Bell has more personality than she does in the books and it's a refreshing addition; Cormac McLaggen is perfect, if largely absent, and Tracey Davis is a great addition of this dour, cynical Slytherin with not one whit of pureblood fanaticism. Mike Vaisey and Daphne Greengrass are meant to be two more examples of relatable, non-evil Slytherins, but both come across somewhat generically. Daphne's attractiveness is mentioned more than once, indicating some possible Harry/Daphne before the Harry/Fleur happens, but despite attempts at giving her an interesting back story the girl herself has an unremarkable personality. It's possible that this would have improved as the fic went on, but it was abandoned too early for there to be any shipping payoffs.

*The TL;DR*

Despite being an abandoned WIP, it's all round an enjoyable read. It's impossible to know if the author would have been able to fulfill all of their goals for this fic, but I suspect a four-point premise may have been too ambitious to keep everything tied together. Perhaps that even contributed to the discontinuation. However, if you're into powerful!Harry or you ship Harry/Fleur this will ring all your bells. I myself don't find Harry overly believable or likable, but that's my only real beef with the fic. It's lovingly detailed with a sound knowledge of canon and its characters, and it's set up with a plot that I was genuinely keen to follow to its mysterious unravelling. Seeing Harry befriend people who weren't Ron, Hermione or Draco was also a welcomingly original and refreshing idea. Not that I've ever incorporated a rating system on these reviews up until this point, but I'd likely give this one a solid 8/10.

​

As a reminder, if you liked what you read here and have a fic that you'd like to nominate for a review, please tell me in a comment or message me. Any genre, pairing or rating is fine, though I prefer multi-chaptered, completed fics. Thanks for sticking with me this far!

** Concise, reasoned reviews really help me think about my own work.

Personally I enjoy hyper-competent characters as I feel the pursuit of the inverse is ultimately realism for realism's own sake. Why should realism be what we strive for? Why place it on some pedestal were we value it above everything else.

Perhaps Oliver Wood provides a happy medium; a character who is very good/excellent/passionate about Quidditch and the tactics there in, but probably isn't a very good captain because he can't read the room like he can the field. The narrative places him where he is both competent and incompetent.

Another example is Book 1 Ron. Here we have a character who is clearly childish, in his naivety, his jealousies and his work ethic, yet at the same time proves to be knowledgeable about obscure historical facts, is the only one to keep his head during the devils snare and is willing to make the sacrifice play without any chosen-one shenanigans.

Sadly we loose this Ron all too soon. I think I need to try and work this same balance into my own work. Otherwise you end up with Movie Hermione-sue or Death Eater Ron.

*** I re-read WYLB today due to this review and there's a section where Cedric's character resonates so strongly with canon Ron that I was unhappy we never got to hear him say it.

To be specific, Cedric is talking to Cho about how he's succeeding at everything he ever wanted before he came to Hogwarts (Quidditch captain, popular, etc), but nonetheless getting thrown into the sidekick role just because Harry's problems are so much bigger than your normal school kid's issues. Ron has this same exact trajectory, except that he's sidekicked years before he gets what he wants (Prefect, Quidditch star, popular, etc). I just imagine canon Ron having this realization somewhere in the middle of 5th or 6th year and silently strangling that part of himself as he dives back into dealing with Harry's issues and it's so goddamn sad.

This sums up how I feel perfectly. I love powerful!Harry fics (or anything character), but what I would say is that sometimes I don't need the build up to believe and enjoy. I've read so many /Harry gets X and becomes powerful/ I find it quite freshing when we dive into the end of his development and get on with the fic.

*** Firstly, thank you for your comment. It gave me pause, and I've been trying to break down my opinions on powerful characters before I responded to you. Honestly the hardest part is keeping it concise, because there's probably an essay to be had on this.

Realism vs hyper-competency. I don't think one necessarily vetos the other, and you can have stories which heavily feature one or both of them. Lord of the Rings features many larger than life, hyper-competent characters, and it's a well-loved story. But you don't read Lord of the Rings for the characterisation - you read it for the plot, the epic battles, beautiful exposition, etc. It's a story about legendary people, not real ones.

The whole superhero genre these days I feel tries to strike a balance between the epic feeling of Lord of the Rings and the realism which makes the characters relatable (with varying levels of success).

Harry Potter canon leans more on the side of realism - we follow the story of an ordinary boy who becomes something extraordinary, but ultimately and always is still very human.

As readers, realism isn't something we're going to strive for, but if we're going to relate, then a certain level of realism has to be there or we won't live vicariously through those characters. That's why for writers, especially in the Harry Potter fandom, any story which wants to take an audience on a journey through Harry's eyes does need to strive for enough realism to hook its readers in. Harry doesn't always have to be the underdog, but he should still be human. I do actually like to see characters level up, increase their potential, become something great and stomp out the bad guys, I just want to be able to cheer for them whilst they do.

Your comments around Oliver Wood and Ron Weasley are spot on about this (and I would have loved to have seen better development of Ron's strategic skills in the books too). Fleur Delacour as well - she is the most beautiful girl in the Harry Potter series, and extremely competent with a want to boot - but she is disliked by many canon characters for her arrogance and disdain.

Something that made me really curious whilst I was reading this fic is - why does this trope always apply to Harry? Why not have epics like this written about Tom Riddle or Dumbledore or Grindelwald, who canonically already are these hyper-competent wizards who did go through a complicated reasoning of how to apply morality to society and had a huge influence in their day? I'm surprised there aren't more stories about Dumbledore going dark and taking over Europe with Grindelwald.

#+end_quote

It probably comes from GoF, and how the other Triwizard contestants were all established on-screen to be good to excellent Quidditch players, before the Goblet picked their names. Harry, the youngest seeker in a century, Cedric who beat Harry in the Dementor match, and Krum who appeared in the World Cup final. And then Fleur... whose only talent we were told about was her veela magic in attracting guys and singing to a dragon.

In actuality, Fleur polyjuices as Harry in the Flight of the Seven Potters, which indicates that she's good on a broom. However, we never see this established /on-screen/ like Cedric or Viktor's flying skills are, and information we're told, rather than shown - or meant to infer - never makes as much of a lasting impact.

Overall, a thorough review. I like the way you pointed out the pros and cons of pro-active Harry, and hit on the exact issue I have with this type of characterization - pro-active, precocious child protagonists rarely feel like genuine children. And the appeal of the HP universe to me has always been one that grows and matures with the protagonists. There's not much room to grow when your MC starts out already grown.

If you're looking for fics to review, how do you feel like doing one of Starfox's fics? They're the most recc'd author in this sub, based on how often I see (the same couple of) people post them. I'd like to see what you make of them, since they're somewhat divisive, but generally agreed to be competently written.

Ugh. Flight of the Seven Potters is one of the worst, most non-sensical parts of the DH so I skim over it each time I re-read. Looks like you're right - Fleur rides a thestral, and doesn't like brooms.

"Marriage Law Revolution" and "Divided and Entwined" are both complete and commonly recc'd in this sub.

People like this author's fics because it focuses on hypercompetent MCs, "logical" worldbuilding, action setpieces and cool duels, and righting the wrongs of canon, AKA "X-Treme karmic justice delivery", where good triumphs and villains get their punishment, extreme prejudice style. It appeals to many posters here who think hated the way Snape was treated like hero post-mortem, and the Malfoys scraped off with minimal punishment after the war.

However, these fics also have a prominent minority who don't like them because the "karmic corrections" ruin the magic of the original HP universe, by introducing elements of Mugglewankery and modern 21st Century sensibilities to a society where they don't necessarily make sense. If you've seen people pull out the Geneva Convention rulings on war crimes in debates in this sub, you'll know what I mean by that.

The author is also pretty liberal with their characterizations, resulting in Hermione being a same-y iteration of Super!Hermione in every fic they write. It makes Hermione more enjoyable to readers who hated her naggy pedantry in canon, but other readers hate it because Super!Hermione can do everything on her own, when the whole point of the books was the Trio working together to get stuff done.

TLDR - Loved by some, hated by others, with reasonable justifications on both sides.

Kinda hard to do that in an AU. Which is actually one of my problems with these fics: they take place in an AU in which many elements of canon are distorted, exaggerated, etc but at the same time the meta narrative of the fics is one of "correcting" canon.

You can't have it both ways, however. If you've changed the world in which your characters operate, their actions can no longer function as commentary on canon.

****** I wasn't going to get into that, because OP was only going to (possibly) read and review one SF5 fic, not the whole catalogue, and reading the catalogue is where things become apparent that all the fics take place in a very strange shared universe off-shoot AU of canon.

All I can say about the worldbuilding is that the author seems to have prioritized karma and catharsis over other story concerns, like consistency in their critique of canon. How much that matters to the reader's enjoyment is up to the individual reader, and I didn't want to bias the OP's potential rating if they decided to write a review of one of the fics. Inconsistency is not uncommon for the "Fix it Fic" genre, and people still enjoy them regardless - like HPMOR having a Rational!Harry, Smart!Hermione, and Smart!Draco, but McGonagall is left as her regular canon self so Harry can dunk on her.

******* My basic point is that there's no catharsis to a "fix-it fic" if the thing being fixed was invented purely to be fixed, rather than being a pre-existing problem in need of repair.

  I had a look through the list - quite a few look really interesting. Petunia Evans - Tomb Raider is a super original idea which I might do later.

  I ended up deciding to go with the Marriage Law Revolution, as a nice medium between popularity of the fic and overall length, since a quick glance at Divided and Entwined shows it to be a monster all on its own. I have to say I'm impressed at how prolific they are. One question though - does it require a background knowledge of marriage law fics? Because I haven't read any other fics featuring that.

  Thank you for the rec! That's on my reading list now.

#+end_quote

You just need to know the basic tropes of marriage law fics. IE, after the war, the population of wizards is running low, so the Ministry sets up a breeding program to match couples together based on how likely they are to produce viable magical offspring. Most fics are based some version of this, sometimes with a MegaDragonPox disease to lower the population further, sometimes with a harem aspect so Harry can legally have 5 young and fertile wives.

The story does explain what's going on with the premise, but it takes on the subtext of being a conscious satire of fandom tropes if you /do/ know the background. However, fandom knowledge isn't necessary to read and understand the fic.

******* Just for your info, Starfox5 contacted me directly and asked me to review The Dark Lord Never Died instead of Marriage Law, so I'll be switching to that one for the next review.

** This was a great review! Really in-depth and thoughtful. :)

​

I actually just recently tried to read this fic! I loved the premise and found it exceptionally interesting but I couldn't make it past the kids meeting on the Hogwarts Express, the personalities felt too stilted and the way the children were speaking took me out of it too much. That's just me though, I work with children that age so when an author doesn't capture their voice very well or age appropriately for more experience, I struggle with it.

*** Thank you very much!

And largely I agree, though I know I myself would have a hard time capturing kids voices too. Still, Fred and George kind of made everything better to me, and Cho is more believable in later scenes.

** Really enjoyed the review. One comment that I have is that while I agree with you about the kids not acting their age, I'm not sure if I would prefer if they actually were. I think I would miss the snappy dialogue and character interaction too much.

I would like to nominate linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë by enembee) it starts as Harry Potter version of Hatchet before taking quite the turn halfway through. It's both compete and we'll written, I believe enembee was working on the sequel on the DLP WBA though I not sure if he still is.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

*** To be fair, the scene wasn't written in a way that excused the Ministry's actions, it just didn't pay due respect at the time to how horrifying it was. The author may well have intended to revisit what happened there. Since it wasn't a completed story, I'm not willing to level any accusations at the author for sweeping that sort of thing under the rug, so don't let it be a deciding factor for whether or not you read it.
