In particular, I'm looking for the outtakes or the uncensored version of LavenderBrown's The Book of Morgan Le Fey and The Final Reckoning.

I'm hoping someone might have these saved somewhere, I cannot locate them anywhere on the net anymore. They used to be saved in the "adult" section on checkmated as well as a few other places that no longer exist.
