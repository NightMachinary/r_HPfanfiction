All of the fics in progress that I was reading have ended and I'm looking for some new stories to add to my alerts. I can do any pairing as long as it's a good story but I prefer Harry centric fics. Any help is much appreciated.

^{¤} ^{---} ^{probably} ^{abandoned}

- 01 --- Dark!MainCharacter is BWL's twin sister who gets dumped at Dursleys' never to be checked on again.

  - *PROS*: Author's writing style and the general plot are pretty good, as is Voldemort's characterisation (not too much cartoonish villain idiocy so far).
  - *CONS*: Dumdledore /is/ depicted as someone not overly clever, main character is OPed, story has an overall unnecessary sexual contamination, story has a pantheon of gods.

- 02 --- Noteworthy praise: “Realistic” power levels for Harry. NOTES: (spoilers) ◆Harry's decision about destroying the Diary results in Ginny's death and positively changes him. ◆Ginny's death positively changes Ron. ◆Harry uses wandless uncontrolled magic to persuade his uncle to give him extra freedom. Later he learns to use it better as a completely different branch of magic-practice. ◆Harry's uncontrolled magic becomes trigger-happy. ◆Neville warns the trio that they are getting separated from the rest of their classmates because of their attention on various research projects and training. ◆Harry convinces the other two to look for magical means of boosting intellect. They eventually pinpoint the Diadem and find it by using Clairvoyance and gathering information from the House ghosts. ◆Hermione introduces them to Occlumency. ◆The story gets even better after Chapter 10 or so.
- 03 --- Yet another [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeggySue][PeggySue]] story. The first 2 books don't have anything unique when compared to other re-do stories, but the third book starts to get pretty interesting. Unfortunately, that's where the WiP marker currently is.
- 04 --- A well written HP and D&D crossover. I agree with Bulwersator's [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/27cle3/wip_recommendations/chzkbee][comment]].
- 05 --- This story features a rational!Voldemort and is from his perspective. Author uses the story to toy with some fun ideas, but overall I wouldn't consider this story to be a work of its own---more like an interesting “sandbox” to go and have a look at.
- 06 --- Hermione gets sorted into Slytherin, pisses off the Malfoys and receives the Notebook instead of Ginny. Nice paralleling to the original story line, portrayal of the trio (though with Neville instead of Hermione) from an outsider's perspective, Slytherin in-house games.
- 07 --- I've read only the first several chapters on this one (decided to wait before it's finished), but what I've read was rather good. Especially the mind-sharing magic and its descriptions. Slightly reminded me of George Martin's /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_for_Lya_%28novella%29][“A Song For Lya”]]/.
- 08 --- see some reviews on it [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/22wrc0/good_triwizard_fics/cgr630e?context=3][here]] and [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1ptycq/timetravel_fics_unafraid_of_altering_the_timeline/][here]].
- 09 --- Another story with a rational!Voldemort, and a rather original and well-written one at that. Unfortunately, it's on a 14-month long hiatus by now.

#+begin_quote
  */A Song For Lya/* is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novella][novella]] by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R.R._Martin][George R.R. Martin]]. It was published in /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Magazine][Analog Magazine]]/ in 1974 and won the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award][Hugo Award]] for Best Novella in 1975. It deals with two [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepathy][telepaths]] named Robb and Lyanna who visit a planet to find out why the inhabitants worship a mold-like organism and in doing so commit [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_suicide][mass suicide]]. In his essay "The Light of Distant Stars," Martin has said it was inspired by the first serious romance he was involved in.

  In his later book series /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire][A Song of Ice and Fire]]/, the names Robb and Lyanna are used for two members of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Stark][House Stark]], Robb being the son of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddard_Stark][Eddard Stark]] and Lyanna being Eddard's younger sister.

  /A Song for Lya/ is set in the same fictional universe as several of Martin's other works, including "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_Morning_Comes_Mistfall][With Morning Comes Mistfall]]", /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying_of_the_Light][Dying of the Light]]/, and the stories collected in /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuf_Voyaging][Tuf Voyaging]]/.

  Opinion is kind of 50/50 on it
#+end_quote

IMO, that's because the story itself was often a 50/50 deal.

On one hand, it has really well-developed characters, a generally interesting and thought-out plot and magical system.

On the other, /(spoilers)/ its logic often degrades to that of a crudely composed hentai story. Examples to this include Luna abusing Hermione and everyone being ok with it (which was an [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment][OoC]] for all parties involved), the ridiculous description of Luna's own “recovery” ritual (I am talking about the oversized “dildo wand” scene), the fact that wizards are rendered literally helpless when put against naked witches (Bones even mentions once managing to defeat three stronger wizards at once by merely discarding her clothes and sending them into stupor, which sounds like a reverse-rape ryona hentai game scenario), the way Astoria\Tori is being portrayed as a spoilt child\nymphomaniac just after her rescue when she should've been deeply traumatized and so on.

/(book-2 ending spoiler)/ Also, it's very frustrating when characters act and die like idiots without any good explanation just because the author doesn't know how to make them do what (s)he wants them to. In the original books, Dumbledore “allowed” Snape to kill him so that Draco will not have to complete his mission and become a murderer (IIRC) and also because he was already guaranteed to die soon because of the ring's curse. Here, however, he has the means to prevent his own death, doesn't have any good reason to succumb to it, but still allows the prediction to unfold itself (even though it is established that these predictions of the future are mere possibilities).
