After chatting, they decide that considering a third partner isn't a terrible idea.

Back in the day, when it had its own forum and the authors and readers hung out, it was an active place. Full Pensieve, in particular, was an enjoyable and astute debate partner.

Then the forum closed down and the Bobmins decided to veto any new authors under consideration. (Jeconais, who ran the site, had a unanimity rule for new members). And it slowly withered on the vine.

** linkffn(It Could Only Happen to Harry) I believe has a threesome at one point.

linkaff([[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=544207001]]) is the start of the Harry's Seventh Year fic by Metafrantic. There is an eventual threesome there of [[/spoiler][Harry/Ginny/Luna]] and a one-off of [[/spoiler][Fred/George/Luna]]. It will take a while to get to the recurring threesome, but worth the journey.

Edit: Whoops, first time I've linked to AFF.org before, didn't realize you needed the URL.
