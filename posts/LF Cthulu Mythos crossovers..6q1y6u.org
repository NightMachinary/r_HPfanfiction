I really liked linkffn(The Eyes by Shadenight123) Also looking for lovecraftian style fics like linkffn(Quo Vadis?) Why aren't there more of these fics, I mean I hardly see these and usually they suck. Thanks in advance!


** linkffn(4323036) Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod. I kind of remember liking it but it was a while ago that I read it.

** "Lovegood's Guide to Lovecraftian Horrors" It's on spacebattles forum, just google the name.

The summary: Once upon a time, there was a Boy with an imaginary friend that lived in his head. A voice of quiet confidence and encouragement, His friend was ever so clever, and would teach Him things and whisper stories into His ear, pushing Him ahead of the other children in class, and giving the Boy the most beautiful dreams of the-world-that-could-be. The Boy lived in a tower with his father and mother and younger sister, and he was ever so happy, watching his mother experiment, his father write fascinating stories, and his sister play, and he couldn't possibly have been more content.

Then a thing happened, and the Boy shattered into a million tiny little jagged pieces and ate the imaginary friend.â€‹

*** It's too bad that there aren't more HP fanfics on spacebattles. The feedback and discussion tends to lead to better stories.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

  It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way.
