:END:
So I read a story a while back and I miss it so much! Here's what I can remember: -it's after the war, and the light side won - Ron & Hermione and Ginny & Harry are together - after a while, Ron & Harry want to run away, but Ginny & Hermione want to finish schooling/get situated - during the night, Ron & Harry take off (to America?), leaving Hermione & Ginny behind with a note saying why they couldn't wait - a few years go by, and out of nowhere the boys come back.. and they're not alone. Their girlfriends are pregnant.\\
- everyone's really mad, but the girls move on... Hermione starts dating Draco & Ginny hooks up with.. someone. I don't remember. - Ron & Harry are pissed off! They don't approve of who the girls are dating.

I don't remember which site it was on, but I'm on Ao3 & Fan Fiction a lot.

Can anyone please help?


** Hmmm, I've read a lot of Dramione, but this isn't familiar. You may want to ask over in [[/r/Dramione][r/Dramione]] as this sub hates Dramione and will probably get downvoted and lost.
