:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Here's what I remember: Harry isn't a Potter, but Bellatrix's and Voldemort son, who was kidnapped by the Potters (apparently w/o The Order knowing), and his blood adoption potion BS fades (or something) revealing his true appearance; The Order picks him up and takes him to Grimmauld, where Dumbledore casts Paternity Revealing Spell*, discovering he's Voldemort's son. Everybody except Hermione and maybe twins* abandon him, so he leaves and stays at Leaky Cauldron. Order fakes Harry's death, Voldemort finds *Harry* and recorgnizes him, takes him to Malfoy manor to meet The Family (including Bella), and from then on is learning about them, I think.

And I think it was posted on AO3.

** So full disclosure, I haven't read this fic yet, it was just in my bookmarks to read later. That being said, it might fit the bill? linkffn(The Indecipherable Riddle by savya398)
