any fics. where they start off antagonistic to each other but grow closer?


** I've never seen it to be honest. You've got to do some open heart surgery on the characters for that, though. About the one thing we know about Lily and Snape is it's the other way around.

mm, i think you can justify them being antagonistic to each other if they met in a different social context, given their opposing allegiances and interests. they were close, so i also think you can plausibly give them some kind of chemistry regardless. unlike in canon where they miscommunicated, they'd start off clashing. so trust can be gained, not broken
