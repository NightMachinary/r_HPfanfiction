** What, no hints about it at all? Pairing at least? Genre? Rating?

**** Believe me when I say we've seen it all. Most of us have been in the fandom for years, some upwards of a decade. You see some shit and eventually nothing shocks you.

****** In light of your specification I would look into Tumblr to be honest. There are several blogs who do "imagine" stories where you find and replace a keyword with your name.

Good luck!

******** Fair enough, Tumblr can definitely go a little overboard some times!

** Why not try writing it yourself? I realize you may not be confident in your ability to write it, or maybe you would feel overwhelmed, but no one but you will be able to truly create the story exactly the way it may be seen in your head.

If you do not care as much about the exact plot and whatnot, or feel someone else could and would capture what you want, and you want someone else to write it, then apart from posting here or on [[/r/fanfiction]] and hoping for a PM from someone willing...

... may I also suggest posting on [[/r/hungryartists]]

Its a subreddit designed to help find people for commissions, and while it mostly deals in visual art, I have seen a few writing requests and offers pop up now and then.

Oh and as for payment being illegal... no idea why that would be. Maybe they meant certain subreddits dont allow commission requests or payment discussions or something.

*Edit:*\\
/One more thing. There are a few sites out there that allow people to advertise their time and skills to create things for others. Usually the quality level is not great, but there are some hidden gems in terms of people who create quality things. A site like Fiverr.com for example. Just search Fan Fiction and there are some folks who offer to write at $5 per a certain number of words or similar pay structures. Just be wary that some might be crap quality like i said./
