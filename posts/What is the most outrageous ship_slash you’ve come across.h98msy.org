I'm curious to know cuz there are some revolting ones out there. Mine is Lucius/Harry and Molly/Hermione. Like WTH. Why is there a demand for this shit?


** Molly/Voldemort

Strangest pairing I've ever read, although it is very well-written. linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7248062/1/Come-Slowly-Eden]])

  Three encounters between Lord Voldemort and Molly Weasley. LV/MW romance. Because my muse is demented, that's why.

** The two that make me the most uncomfortable are Snape/Hagrid and Umbridge/McGonagall. And anything with Dobby, Buckbeak, or Hedwig, of course.

There's a nsfw Snape/devil's snare fic out there that iirc is actually like..... a fascinating relationship dynamic

** I saw a Dumbledore/Ginny one once, where it wasn't just disgusting because he's 120 and she's 14, but doubly disgusting because in that AU Ron and Ginny were actually the product of an affair between Molly and Dumbledore.

I only read the description and still wanted to be sick.

** Theres so many hermione/voldemort out there its worries me. But it each their own I guess. There was one I read part if where umbridge abused her power worse than in canon and basically turned harry into her own little cuckboy and forced harry and ginny into their first sexual encounter as a punishment. I didnt make it much further than that
