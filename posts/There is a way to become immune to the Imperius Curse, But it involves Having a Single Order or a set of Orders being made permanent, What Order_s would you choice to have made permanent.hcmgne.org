As for the Reason Voldemort and the Death eaters haven't had it done to them, Its because you have to Trust the person that is Giving you the Ordersand Not Fight the Curse at all. Which Voldemort would never be able to do.

As for were the Piece of magic was Found lets someone asked the Room of requirement and that is the peice of magic that the Room gave in response.


** "Move well! Learn well! Play well, eat well, and rest well! Enjoy your life, merrily and to the fullest!"

or the Dub version "Work hard, study well, and eat and sleep plenty.Master the art of peace in addition to the art of war!."

**** Dragon ball, its something Master Roshi Tells Goku and Krillin.

Although I did change it a little, lives to life and removed "That is the turtle hermit way!"

What he actaully says in the show is : "My students: Move well! Learn well! Play well! Eat well! and Rest well! Enjoy your lives merrily, and to the fullest! The Kame Style is with you." - Master Roshi

Dub:"Work hard, study well, and eat and sleep plenty. That is the turtle hermit way! We must master the art of peace in addition to the art of war!"Master Roshi

** You know, if this had been a real thing, I could imagine many if not most of the purebloods and the Wizardraised halfbloods would already be immune from early on.

Children often trust their parents inexplicably, if not then that parent has most likely done something to deserve the lack of trust. But parents with that trust would want the best for their child, and would therefore make sure that their child would be safe from the Imperius Curse. So I can totally see it being a thing to command children an innocent enough command to keep them safe.

So commands like "you are to at least try to have a good life", "please try to take care of yourself, both in body and in mind", "make an effort in school", "never jump into lava", "don't try to drown yourself", "remember that I love you".

*** True it was more about what order you would have yourself given.

I think this would be horrible abused if it actually existed.
