What? But you only requested something yesterday.

About that, I like to read multiple different stories at once. I'm reading a squib Harry story, a Harry looks like Lily story, and I want to add this to my list of stories.

*I'm looking for an Avatar/Harry potter crossover where:*

- The MC is special. Everyone else has spell magic, but the MC is the only one who has Avatar magic but no spell magic.

- I don't want the MC to be one of those "I wish I was normal" type homies. The MC isn't really fussed that their magic is different. But they're also not arrogant about it. They use it when they want/need to, but never to show off.

- The MC doesn't feel shame in their weaknesses. Yes MC has less variety in their magic than witches and wizards but they can do their avatar magic better than wizards and witches can. MC knows that they can do elemental magic better than wizards and witches casting spells to use elemental magic.

- Because MC doesn't have variety magic, I fully expect them to NEED help at times.

- I don't care if the author copies avatar choreography in their writing. That is to be expected.

*Example of what I mean by sure wizards and witches technically have elemental magic but MC can do it better:* if Hermione only used wand elemental magic, she isn't allowed to use any other magic, and she versed Azula before she went insane. I don't see Hermione winning. If Hermione was able to use water magic? Possible but unlikely. Hermione is intelligent, but so is Azula. She doesn't know martial arts, she's not particularly acrobatic, wizard waterbending has less utility and flexibility than Avatar waterbending, and she ain't Katara vs a near breaking point Azula.

Avatars can use their elements better than most wizards/witches can via wand spellcasting. Not sure about Dumbledore though. Dumbledore's aguamenti was pretty top notch in the movies, ngl. But he's Dumbledore.

*Realism:* They fail stuff like any class that involves wizard/witch magic that has nothing to do with the four elements. This includes potions, because apparently it's the magic + ingredients that make the potion, otherwise muggles in the wizarding world could also make those potions.

They use martial arts to use their elements.

They are acrobatic, because avatars usually are. Even Korra is acrobatic. She's just more rough about it vs Ty Lee and Aang's softer and more fluid acrobatics. But still acrobatics is acrobatics.

I'm not to fussed about HOW the author makes the MC find out about their avatar magic and how to use it.


** Yo I just saw this and I have a series for you. It starts off as HP/Naruto but then converges into Avatar and like I would never normally read anything like this but give it a shot. Highlyyyy recommend it, even if it is a beast to get through entirely but so worth it.
