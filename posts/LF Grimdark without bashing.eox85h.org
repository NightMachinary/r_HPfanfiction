Hey everyone, I'm looking for a grimdark harry potter setting where everything seems to be going wrong, but doesn't contain bashing. Specifically a lack of bashing of Ron, Harry, Ginny, Molly, or Minerva, Albus. I'd prefer a lack of bashing of any characters, but I know how likely that is to not happen.

- Where the government has turned against them.
- Where Albus has been thrown out of all his offices and Death Eater sympathisers are moving in.
- Where friendly families have been killed, maimed, tortured, or kidnapped.
- Where you look and think; this world needs *hope*.

That's the kind of story I'm after.

There's /Black Ink, Red Rose/ on ffn. Features a Dark!Ginny.

The same author also wrote linkffn(Echoes in the Fog) which also qualifies (it's a work where Canon!Harry and Grey!Harry, plus friends, end up transported in a world where Voldemort won and Evil!Harry is his number 2), but you'd probably want to read the short linkffn(Lack of a Bezoar) first.

**** No problem! :) By the way, if you have trouble finding them, I edited in the direct links of /For Lack of a Bezoar/ and /Echoes in the Fog/ into my original post. Bot seems to be down.

  Our choices define us. When Harry and his closest friends are transported to an alternate dimension, thirty years after the war's end, and forced to face the results of what would have been if only they had chosen differently, he will discover just how true this is. Features H/G, H/Hr, H/DG. Not multi.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
