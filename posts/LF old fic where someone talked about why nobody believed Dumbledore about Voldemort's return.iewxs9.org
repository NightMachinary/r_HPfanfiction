:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember anything about this fic except for one part where somebody told either Dumbledore or Harry that nobody believed Dumbledore about Voldemort's return because over the year's he had been telling everybody that he trust's Snape or that Snape has "reformed" only for him to keep acting like a asshole or bullying their children so their trust in Dumbledore had broken


** That... is a really nice explanation actually.

Sorry, but I don't know that fic.
