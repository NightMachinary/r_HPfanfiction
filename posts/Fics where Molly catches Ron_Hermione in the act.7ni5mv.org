** I actually wrote that into my own story, but Molly doesn't exactly flip her lid.

*** I'll be honest: I came looking for an awkward Ron/Hermione moment, but when I got to the part about Luna dressing up the chickens, I knew I'd found something even better. Now I'm going to go back and read the rest of your story to see what other delights I've been missing out on.

And I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who remembers /Between The Lions/.

**** Let's be honest. Luna putting poultry in funny outfits and dressing up a dragon like a pimp is way more in character for her than joining Harry Harem #452.

** What I immediately think of is /GoF/ where Molly instantly believes the worst about Hermione re: Krum/Harry and treats Hermione rather poorly (even after her own children tell her that what Rita wrote was all lies) when it's none of her business at all who Hermione songs.

She'd believe Hermione to be a loose woman and Ron a naive boy led astray.

*** I'm not sure what she'd think of Hermione, but the woman's raised five boys before Ron. She knows what boys are like.
