But not Lestrange. (all right I'm done now.)

I'm looking for a Dudley and Harry meet again post DH, specificly because Dudley has a kid who's magical. Harry and Dudley make up and become friends (kind of) and all the hijinks involved. Bonus points for length, humour, and/or great characterization. If there are sequels--even better!!

Thank you so much, if I'm barking up through wrong tree just let me know.


** Not strange all, because lots of people wrote about Dudley having a magical child. One such fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11994595/1/Perfectly-Normal-Thank-You-Very-Much][Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much]], linkffn(11994595).

** The one I'm recommending, Dudley's Memories doesn't have a lot of humor in it; it's quite dark, actually. However, this story and its two sequels do have some heartwarming moments, and a really realistic repentant Dudley, although the focus on Harry and Dudley's relationship lessens as the story as it goes on.

So while it is darker than what you're asking for, they meet because of Dudley's magical kid, it's long with two sequels and complete, and I do like the characterizations a lot.

Let's see if I can do the link right.
