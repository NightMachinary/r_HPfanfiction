Don't get me wrong Canon isn't stupid but he only gets A's and stuff like that... I love when Harry not is only good in practical magic but also theoretical, he han either found a study group earlier, maybe he's just curious about magic, Or maybe he hides his real good work for fear of being rejected. If possible i like a Harry that even if he goes to hogwarts still learning muggle subjects like Math, science, literature, English, Physical Education. Etc... And please don't let him go to divination classes (Already read Motivations)


** Was Lily ever mentioned to be particularly intelligent or smart? James and Sirius were the best students in their year iirc

*** IIRC Slughorn compared Harry to her when he was top of the class thanks to HPB book. Also that books shows that Snape seemed to be some sort of young potions/dark arts prodgidy. Given that despite everything happening at Hogwarts, it took until fifth year for Snape and Lily's relationship to deteriorate beyond repair, it is likely that they genuinely shared interests, quite possibly in academics, so I head canon her has having a similiarly inquisative and inventive mind, even if more focussed on different subjects.

*** The fact that the Marauders were the best students in their year says a lot more about them than their year. They literally created Marauders Map while in Hogwarts, map which is a brilliant piece of magic. They were very intelligent and one thing I don't like about fanon Marauder bashing is making them dumb bullies. They were smart bullies. Lily was Slughorns favorite student, she was top of his class, Hermione was compared to her afaik, eg. Lily was also exceptional, at least in potions.

*** I'm almost sure Lily was Head Girl and Hermione was compared to her a lot, and snape said something like the cleverest witch ever

**** Well James was also Head Boy. I don't think being Head boy or girl is a particular indication for intelligence

I also don't think anyone compared Hermione to Lily and Snape never referred to Lily as the cleverest witch ever

***** I agree that being Head Boy/Girl doesn't really indicate intelligence - you don't have to be particularly clever to patrol a few corridors for mischievous first-years - but I disagree with the idea that James somehow proves this fact. He's consistently described as talented and intelligent:

"Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school . . ."

****** I was not using James to prove the point. OP mentioned Lily being a Head girl, so I just mentioned James was also Head Boy.

** honestly it would be cool to see him like James and Sirius. Not an arrogant brat obviously, but like him being good at everything without even trying, like it was described in the books

#+begin_quote
  A re-imagining of Harry's life where he applies himself a little bit more, works a little harder, and gets closer to more people than just Ron and Hermione.
