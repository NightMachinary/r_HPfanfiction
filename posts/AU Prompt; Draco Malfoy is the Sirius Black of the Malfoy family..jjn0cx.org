"And I'm Malfoy. Draco Malfoy." Draco said haughtily. There was a cough from Ron's corner. "You think my name is funny, do you?" Draco said stiffly. There was a half beat of silence, then, "Yeah, so do I. Merlin, I can't wait until I come of age so I can change it." Draco huffed.

** I've had this one shot idea in my head for a while now where Draco is secretly a HUGE muggle nerd, has been secretly studying muggle textbooks, sneaking out to take his muggle exams, is enamored with muggle technology, and wants to be a computer technician when he grows up.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione sneak out one night and follow him because they think he's doing Sneaky Evil Slytherin Things (tm) but end up finding him in a closet hunched over a computer he's been building from scratch.

He very frantically begs them to not tell anyone and general hijinks ensue from here.

*** I love that while he has likable traits, the author doesn't make him mary-sue-ish. Draco still insults and looks down upon the weasleys and actually has proper character growth (which is applicable for almost all of the characters in that fic). I also love the way the author gives all of the characters proper motivations. And that fic has the only redeemed Snape I've seen in fanfiction. What I mean to say( if it wasn't already clear) is that IMO the innocent series is the holy grail of harry potter fanfiction.

*********** Without over hyping it (though I'm probably about to do just that), it is the most complete fanfic I've read, with the author using the same base story elements, and making something beautiful. Characters like Lupin, Tonks and Sirius (for starters) who weren't given enough screen time (in my opinion) are explored extremely well. That's not counting the little bits of lore the author adds into the story to just let us connect better with the universe and it's different elements. Another aspect is that the characters grow and form bonds with each other (unlike some fics where they just pair off at 11) as the story progresses

One thing that does throw people (that I've recc'd it to) off is the length of the story (which for me is a huge plus point, but YMMV) However, I feel like if you give the first few chapters a go, you don't even feel the chapters zipping past.

***** Its a series of 5 if you start at innocent (like I did), if you look through the author page though you'll realise that the author started with Lily and James's final year at Hogwarts and a few marauders one shots; these are set in the same universe as the innocent storyline. These were the first stories they did, but the quality of writing has kept improving as the series progressed.

So if you want to start reading, my suggestion would be to start at innocent and if you like that, finish the series, then go back to the marauders stories as the writing is not as amazing(still more so than most other fanfics I've read, but I digress) due to the author still adapting their style.

As for the second question, no they are not complete, it's still updating around fortnightly. Innocent deals with harry before Hogwarts (the point where the story differs from canon is that Sirius breaks out of Askaban when Harry's 9, so innocent is from 9 year old harry to 11 year old harry), initiate( the first sequel) covers his first year, identity the second year and so on.

  As the sole Malfoy heir, Draco understood that his path was set long before his birth; who to be, how to act and what his choices should be. What he had not counted on was the power of outside influences. Letters from his deceased cousin caused him to realize that he did have choices, starting with the choice to be someone else, to be who he wanted to be. The road to self-discovery was difficult and navigating that path in the shadow of Harry Potter was its own challenge but maybe, just maybe, his friends would help him along the way. And he would owe it all to Regulus Black.

** Leyrann wrote a fem!Harry/fem!Draco oneshot with a similar premise. She and Iris befriend each other in Madame Malkin's and spend a lot of time together away from the view of other students. The two of them are antagonistic in public but rely on each other a lot.
