** The "Lily was really a pureblood" nonsense.

I don't mind the idea that muggleborns are the result of squibs wandering off into the muggle gene pool for a few generations. But part of Lily's shtick (at least in my head) is that she was a muggleborn who refused to bow down to anything as stupid as "it's impossible" and won her fight with the Dark Lord. (Using Capt Pike's definition at least)

Ditto for Hermione, but I make an exception for her being related to Professor Mcgonagall for reasons I don't fully understand myself.

It just feels like the author is buying into pureblood propaganda.

--------------

Though, I DO like the explanation in A Necessary Gift where pureblood magic isn't /better/ just more specialized. AKA James was good at transfiguration because Potters are just better at tranfiguration... and worse at something else. Muggleborn have no specialty that comes easy to them, but nothing that holds them back either. (Mage vs Spec. Wizard in D&D)

I feel this is true of any story that Harry ends up being a Lord Potter/Black. He maintains the status quo 90% of the time because of "duty to his family" or some bollocks and the author can't see why that sounds Malfoyesk...

**** Yeah... and not even in a good way. I could easily see Harry buying into some aspects of the pureblood nonsense. Given that he was raised by the Dursleys it's actually shocking that he doesn't develop a low opinion of muggles... Thank Merlin for Draco managing to make such a bad impression that Harry avoided that entire segment of the population.

I should clarify that by 'good way' I mean that I have no issue with the idea of family being important, which seemed to be a big part of the Malfoy way of thinking... To a rather Hufflepuffish degree really.

But hey, at least Lord Potter-Black makes sense in terms of inheritance... unlike say Lord Potter Black Gryfindor Slytherin Ravenclaw Hufflepuff yadda yadda...

I can see that. They do seem to have quite a bit in common, even if we don't see much interaction between them in canon. One can probably spin the securing the Time-Turner and a few other things into McGonagall being Hermione's mentor of sorts, and it might be interesting to see a fic expanding on that, blood relation or not.

That said, canon-wise, the mentoring, if it occurred, was probably not magical instruction of any sort. (If it had, there might have been signs, like, say, Hermione in HBP being busy working on an animagus form; and/or her fighting style being closer to one of a Transfiguration master: animating things to obstruct or attack the opponent.)

** I really dislike the fanfictions that go like "Harry get adopted / is really the son of someone else / whatever and then inexplicably changes his name and is never referenced as Harry ever again". I don't have a problem with alternative names, but when I read a Harry Potter fanfiction about Harry, I don't want to read about Alexander Snape or whatever some of the crazier names are... It's just not my cup of tea. (Although there was an exception once in a fic where he was known as James Evans, that was alright, but that name at least has some connection to him)

The only think I can tolerate are fics where his name is like... Harrison or Harold, even though I'm pretty sure that Harry is... just Harry. Just like "Draco" probably doesn't stand for Draconis or something like that. Because I don't think the Malfoys would call their son by a Nickname instead of his full one.

** The trope of "taking the magic hinted at in canon and expanding on it" is a real double-edged sword for me.

On the one hand, some authors can make it fun and interesting and well-integrated with an actual story, like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/][C'est La Vie's]] take on Ancient Runes, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle's]] take on ward schemes, or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared's]] take on magical theory/application in general.

However, for every fic like those three, there are three thousand that take the invigorating, slightly cheeky, fairy-tale-based magic of the Harry Potter books and turn it into something overly complicated and boring. I've seen way too many fics get caught up in their own "rules of magic" and go into multi-paragraph author tracts about Arithmancy that have zero to do with the actual plot.

It's a shame, really. The magic in canon has a certain looseness, a certain flexibility, a certain charm that's a big part of why I like the books in general, and many authors take that and try, for some reason, to take all the fun out of it.

No, you're thinking of the /Wheel of Time/ series by Robert Jordan, which Sanderson only wrote the last three books of after the original author's death.

Sanderson is generally thought to have added very little to the well-established series, and is primarily said to have simply wrapped up hanging plot threads, some say too quickly.

Sanderson's current longest single series is Mistborn, at five books. He is also an internationally famous fantasy writer who teaches the craft at the college level. One of his strongest writing points when world building is, don't use magic without explaining it in a way equal to the importance of the problems in plot it solves.

But otherwise, even by a strict reading of his advice, one would be perfectly justified in making magic texture and setting without explanation. A skilled writer might even be able to make mechanics a central feature without writing essays in the novel. Someone like Brandon Sanderson, for example.

#+end_quote

There are two cases of actions relating directly to souls leaving the body in canon. Otherwise, they are not directly discussed. But the canon references and other logical inferences are quite clear. Dementors kill people.

I would be most interested in any examples of soulless /people/ in canon, as I can't recall a single one.

--------------

The first case is simple. If you die, your soul passes on towards an afterlife (as happens with the second killing curse Harry Potter receives). It is assumed Voldemort would have had something similar happen when he died attacking Harry the first time, if he hadn't made his Horcruxes. This is assumed cultural context. That's what happens when you die in an afterlife-based, mind-body dualist world. There is a body and a soul, and you are the soul. Nothing remains after the body dies, as it has moved on to the next great adventure.

Harry returns to life because he has a pseudo-Horcrux in the form of Voldemort's new body, and because (unlike Voldemort's accident when Harry was a baby) Harry's body was not destroyed. But Harry was dead while he was talking to Dumbledore, and he had a choice to stay dead and for his soul to move on.

One could make a strong case that, had Harry's body been destroyed at the same time, Harry would have ended up like Voldemort if Harry had, for some reason, still chosen to return. Hopefully, in that case, Dumbledore would have just told Harry to shuffle along.

--------------

The other case relating to souls is Dementors. As Fudge uses one to "kiss" Barty Crouch Jr., because he was an escaped criminal as was Sirius Black, and this was treated as a summary execution in canon, we can assume being kissed is treated as one being killed in Wizarding culture.

We never see or hear about anyone post-kiss, even though we are shown people driven to the point of irreversible catatonia (Neville's parents) being cared for. They are just never talked about again, unlike Neville's parents.

So it can again be assumed from that and other context that they aren't cared for (or not for long) after that, and that the /body/ is left to "die" "naturally" by simply not feeding it through artificial means. This is consistent with modern methods of removing life support for brain dead patients. They are not said in canon to be returned to Azkaban, for example, which would be consistent with them being treated as still alive, nor are they said to be cared for in a hospital after or even guarded at all.

Any stories with that taking place are pure fanon.

This is morally consistent with people's actions if they assume the person is dead -- because it is understood that nothing of the person remains, according to canon. People in unresponsive states, like Neville's parents, are not considered dead or soulless, so this has to be a different category of injury.

The case of what happens when someone is kissed is very complicated. Do they continue on to the afterlife? If not, it seems something of them that makes them a person has been destroyed. Everyone treats them like they are dead, but they don't act like the victim has been denied an afterlife. That's a sort of "super-dead" that would make waves. Not merely "worse" than death, but a huge moral issue with the death penalty in the wizarding world.

Can you imagine if the death penalty in the US involved denying the convicted any afterlife at all? Yeah, that wouldn't fly. But that isn't the worst of the thorny ontological issues.

If the victim's soul does pass on, are there now two "people"? One body, still breathing, with no memory or personality left (which is canon for the physical body) and one joining the next great adventure (also canon for the soul)?

In final analysis, in both cases the soul is the person and is gone, and the body's loss of it is treated (in canon and in religious studies) as the person being dead. From a functional and ontological standpoint, losing your soul from your body in the Harry Potter world is death. Everything else is dead bodies raised as zombies by another name, and Voldemort and his soul fragment games.

Even /if/ the body not being dead is the argument, it is still murder when someone dies a week later from a gunshot to the head. In this case, a completely unsupported argument, the Dementors are /still/ responsible for the death of the person they kissed. But I am not making this argument here, because it is not the best one to be made, and is overly reductionist in nature.

--------------

A review of soul-like things in Harry Potter is interesting. JKR avoids religious references such as the human soul for the most part, but seems to have screwed-up in PoA by introducing the Dementor's special soul-sucking ability. Only Voldemort and Dementors are related to souls in canon.

Perhaps that was simply something she pulled away from later, as both books one and two also strongly featured possessed things that were part of continuing and containing parts of Voldemort's soul outside of a traditional body. PoA is the last story with this sort of thing happening, as even Harry's "near death" experience didn't mention souls or religious features. When Voldemort is resurrected in the next book, his soul doesn't fly around anywhere, for example. It is shown as being /possibly/ a purely physical ritual.

PoA is the last plot to feature this free-flying souls thing, as none of the other Horcruxes attempt to become a person and everyone's souls stay mostly in their bodies. So what souls are in Harry Potter is fuzzy, but they certainly are related to who a person is, and a person can pass on to an afterlife. It is telling that at no point does Dumbledore suggest that Voldemort is without a soul, just that he has damaged himself in ways even Voldemort himself might not understand.

Then we have the minor cases. /Priori Incantatem/, for example, returns a "reverse echo", a shadow and not a soul. The Resurrection Stone might call back the dead truly, but it is never well explored and souls are never explicitly mentioned. The fairy-tale nature of those items could be interpreted as either a cruel trick and not the real person, or literally the person's soul dragged back from the afterlife in a torturous, or at least most uncomfortable way.

But most importantly, none of these relate to souls, even those passed on, as being anything but the person they were in life. Voldemort's Horcruxes are the strongest case for this, but nothing in canon contradicts this or suggests that the normal definition of souls or the wishy-washy afterlife are anything but as we know them to be from popular cultural understanding.

And in that tradition, if your soul leaves your body, you are dead.

--------------

*TL;DR, quotes and citations*

Best of all, our main character understands what Dementors do:

#+begin_quote
  Harry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor McGonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened. He did not need her to finish her sentence. He knew what the dementor must have done. It had administered *its fatal kiss* to Barty Crouch. It had sucked his soul out through his mouth. He was *worse than dead*.
#+end_quote

Worse because, of course, it is more horrible to imagine. It kills you and leaves a still-breathing husk. Nothing further is suggested. Also note, Dementors did not eat or consume Barty Crouch Jr's soul, nor does anyone suggest such a thing. The soul is "lost", as is everyone moving on to the next great adventure.

And we see even Fudge uses the past tense:

#+begin_quote
  "But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius," said Dumbledore. He was staring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time. "He cannot give evidence about why he killed those people."

  "Why he killed them? Well, that's no mystery, is it?" blustered Fudge. "He *was* a raving lunatic!
#+end_quote

Past tense, because Barty Crouch Jr. is dead, killed by Dementors.

Finally, a word from Hermione, the story's authorial mouthpiece:

#+begin_quote
  “But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, “*why can't the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else*?”

  “Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.”

  Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on. “Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, *I wouldn't damage your soul at all*.”

  ”Which would be a real comfort to me, I'm sure,” said Ron. Harry laughed.

  “*It should be, actually*! But my point is that */whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched/*,” said Hermione. “But it's the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can't exist without it.”
#+end_quote

Meaning that regular people have souls, things done to the body doesn't matter, and it moves on when the body fails. That's what Dementors do: suck out the soul, causing the person to pass on without destroying the body. People in the land of the living are left with a thing that still lives, like a shrubbery lives, but it isn't the person anymore because their soul has passed on.

******* As we've discussed before, you're conflating two things here.

Is a Dementor's Kiss equally as bad as death? Yes.

Is a Dementor's Kiss metaphysically the same as killing someone? No.

If a Dementor's Kiss was the same as killing you, it would have the same effect as the Killing Curse.

What you're really arguing is that a Dementor's Kiss /as good as/ kills you, or /effectively/ kills you, or /might as well/ kill you. These are not the same things as killing you. A person who is brain dead is /as good as/ dead, but they are not dead.

******** You are conflating dying with the total cessation of bodily functions. There are other ways to die when souls exist.

You are your soul. That's how souls work.

If your soul leaves your body, you die. You are dead, regardless of what happens to your former body after that. You go on to the next great adventure. You are lost to the world.

Metaphysically, it is death to have yourself, your soul, removed from your body, as Dementors do. Physically, it is death as you are not physically attached to your body any longer and can never, ever return to it.

Also, brain death is the loss of autonomic functions as well as higher brain functions. So the Dementor's kiss doesn't cause brain death, according to canon, as your heart and brain continue to function, your body still functioning but only as an empty shell. Because you, your soul, is gone.

This is a stupid argument. That does not in fact logically follow. There are plenty of ways to die that don't involve the killing curse, and the killing curse is in no way related to the Dementor's abilities.

We have disagreed on points of opinion in the past but I expect better from you. It doesn't get much simpler than this. It shouldn't be hard to understand.

*** I feel like the aristocratic stuff could work if done right. I think Americans probably feel it's more absurd than Brits, because of course Britain /still has an aristocracy/. We have dukes and earls and "my lords" and manor houses and so on. It stands to reason that /some/ families in magical Britain would be of that class, given that the Statute of Secrecy didn't come into power until 1692. Up until that time wizards mixed with Muggles and inevitably some of them will have been given titles by the Monarch.

(Pottermore suggests that this is the case with the Malfoys)

The problem comes in how it's executed in the fandom.

1. There are far too many of them. The entire Wizengamot being made up of nobles just doesn't work. That's far too many noble families for a population somewhere between 9000-15,000 people. I'd expect maybe 3 or 4 families to have a noble title.

2. Titles carry considerable political power. The Ministry of Magic is a modern, professional, meritocratic civil service, in the sense that was developed by the East India Trading Company in the mid 1800s and then further developed by the British government. This rather clashes with the idea of aristocratic titles carrying power. Many people think that the magical world is medieval, but this is clearly not the case. It has more in common with the Victorian age, if anything. Like in the Muggle world, titles should linger but should be largely absent of any direct power.

3. It also completely ignores realpolitik. I always cringe at the fics in which Harry is capable of crippling Dumbledore just by flashing his title at him. If canon showed us anything it's that Dumbledore is quite happy to operate outside the law if he feels that it is necessary to do so.

4. Titles are flaunted. In a post-Statute of Secrecy world in which the Muggle world is viewed with suspicion, titles derived from the Muggle monarch should be shameful secrets to Purebloods, not points of pride.

I'll agree with most of that, but I'm curious just what you mean by this one. I feel like I've heard the term before but not in this context.

I ask because I find one of my favorite ideas is that of Draco as Peggy Sue.

**** Well, usually it takes the form of "blood supremacy isn't so bad, we just want to preserve our culture", basically "I'm not anti-black, I'm just pro-white" but in a Potterverse context. It's often accompanied with muggleborns (usually Hermione) being "uncultured" or "brutish" by wizarding standards, which of course makes hurling racial slurs her way completely justifiable, and the only objection anyone has to that is that doing so publicly is bad form.

As for the Malfoys, I'm talking more about their behavior being excused in various ways, as I also enjoy a good catharsis story involving Draco (but in those stories he rarely tries to excuse his actions, quite the opposite)

**** In the beginning Malfoy is a child parroting the same hate and ignorance that his parents speak, Draco is redeemable in the beginning and if they do it properly I have no problem with it. Lucius is a slytherin and I'm willing to bet he's actually a slytherin not just a metaphor for racism so it is conceivable that he doesn't actually care at all about whether or not muggleborns have rights, and while this makes him an entirely different kind of douche-canoe, he is at least useful for the right person willing to move the right pieces. The only sin we see Narcissa commit is loving her son deeply enough to risk her own life to save him. She doesn't ever show love towards Lucius and was probably a marriage of politics. In short, the Malfoy family is redeemable, don't brush off all attempts to show this.

***** You mentioned it was a marriage of politics. I don't know, I just find that a bit hard to believe. I mean Narcissa's sister married a muggle born and her cousin was Sirius. I always assumed that her family began falling from grace in the pure blood circles and Lucius married her because he loved her. I can't see there being a huge amount of benefit in marrying a girl from a family that others were probably whispering about. Lucius Malfoy could have married a woman from a family with a squeaky clean record, but he didn't he married Narcissa. I think he married her and then insured that no one in the pure blood community said anything else about her family.

** I don't like evil Dumbledore stories. First of all because many authors just use evil!Dumbledore to make Voldemort look better and give Harry a reason to join the dark side; second because it just doesn't make much sense to me. If Dumbledore was an evil overlord bent on world domination or something, then why wouldn't he have done so already? Dumbledore was already a powerful, well-respected wizard before Voldemort became an issue. If Dumbledore wanted to he could be Minister, could have taken the world with Grindelwald a long time ago etc. So yeah, unless there is a /very/ good explanation (I have yet to see one), evil!Dumbledore is a concept I really can't stomach.

** My least favourite trope: Hermione's only or main effect on the story being to help Harry be a greater, more powerful wizard. For example, she researches useful spells but doesn't actually use them herself, only helps Harry learn them, so that he could save the day. Some fics, like /Coach Granger/ actually make it explicit, but myriad others do it implicitly.

An interesting expression of this trope was in reviews to /The Arithmancer/, whose AU divergence is that Hermione is a maths prodigy with the fanon where Arithmancy is about spell crafting in effect. At least two reviews to the early chapters were basically saying "Great! Hermione can invent some spells for Harry to use, that could take advantage of how powerful he is!"
