I found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11196963/1/The-Uprising][The Uprising]] today and I was hoping for some other quality fanfics where Harry works on cases as an Auror. Especially fics that are mystery centered, though I would also enjoy character driven stories as well.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/Unatoned][Unatoned]] is an HP/DG fic written in the first-person Noir style. It's rather different, but I thought it was great.

*** i read that back when I was obsessed with Harry/Daphne pairings and I remember it being interesting. The way she was written bothered me at the time but I'll reread and see what I think this time.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9537818/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nameless-Man][HP and the Nameless Man]] is a HP/GW fic. I can't remember if there was much detective work etc, but he is an Auror, as is Ginny.

**** Yep, that's it. If Harry/Ginny isn't your thing you should go look in another castle.

***** I tend to prefer it nowadays, though I am okay with most pairings if they are developed well enough, but if the whole point of the story is just that two characters belong together, I'm usually not interested.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6479080/1/Soul-Thief][Soul Thief]] is very good, although Harry is a private contractor rather than an auror.
