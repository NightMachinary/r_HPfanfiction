:END:
Is there a fan fiction where Harry kind apologises to Snape for what his father done or like says how did my mother marry him after that?


** Nah, Harry should've said Snape deserved it and his mom was right to break ties with him.

*** Have you read the chapter recently? He didn't know there were any ties to break. All he saw was James and Sirius bullying Snape

***** Yeah, but he still wouldn't know that they had any ties to break.

To Harry, Lily stepped in, Snape called her a mudblood, and Lily got upset. But he doesn't know that there was anything more to their relationship.

Therefore, he wouldn't be questioning Snape about that part afterwards.

He already knows that Snape used to be a Death Eater and is a spy now. So it's not like it'd be weird for a young Snape to use that word. What is weird, and what he should be questioning and Did question Sirius and Remus, is what was going on with James, because that Doesn't add up with what he had known of his father
