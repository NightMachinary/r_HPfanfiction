I'm about to start a 40-hour trip to face a difficult situation and I would really need something engaging to get me through this hard time.

Preferably something complete and well-crafted. Be it adventure, romance, SF, mystery, I'm open to anything. It can be set in the past, the future, have OCs, slash, ...

*** Thanks! I don't mind these pairings, even though I'm skeptic about the "set after CC" part haha. But if the writing is good I'll give it a shot :)

** Just broke 25,000 words on my fic, if you're interested. It's LavenderxRon, and is based off a prompt where Lavender's name gets pulled from the Goblet of Fire instead of Harry.
