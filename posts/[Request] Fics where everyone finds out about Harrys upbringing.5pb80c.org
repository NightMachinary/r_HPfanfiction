** Happens in linkffn(11762850), Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux, towards the end. Some results from it are mentioned in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12278649/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Chrysalis][Harry Potter and the Chrysalis]], the sequel, but that's still in its beginning stages right now.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** White Squirrel's A Dramatic Reading, linkffn(12324284), has it. So far, most adults are quite cross with the Dursleys, and I believe Kingley's made a note to arrest Vernon at some point during chapter four or five. Umbridge, of course, is just gleeful.

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

*** Can you, or someone else, tell me why these types of stories are so popular? I read something similar to it, then tried another and found it pretty much the exact same formula. I found that they were kinda boring since it was just reactions to the books with no other substance.

**** I'm afraid not. This is the first story of its genre I've read, and I started because I like the author. Plus, I'm not very good at analysing people and why we read certain things. I suppose I'm enjoying this because it reads almost like a critical review of the books that is quite funny. And really, it's just funny. It's basically crack, so I don't take it seriously. I doubt I could read another unless it was seriously originally different.

To quote the author as to why they started:

#+begin_quote
  The backstory here is that I believe that any trope, even the most absurd or hackneyed, can be made to work in the right hands, and this is how I think the read-the-books trope ought to be done. Read-the-books fics are universally terrible, in my experience, but by writing with an actual plot in mind, only quoting 5% of the source material, and only having people interrupt when it would be natural to do so, I hope that I've solved 90% of the problems that come with these fics.
#+end_quote

And one of the top replies:

#+begin_quote
  You know, I've searched for these stories, and they really are a guilty pleasure. I think it's due to a number of reasons, such as the fact that there are so many out there that never go beyond a few chapters, or because while the vast majority are garbage, you can sometimes find a diamond in the rough...and so you keep searching through the garbage for that diamond.
#+end_quote

And a partial quote from someone else: (the rest wasn't relevant to this)

#+begin_quote
  ...I used to like these but always ended reading them in diagonal, skipping entire paragraph at a time and finishing a chapter in a minute or less. Yours is captivating, and the change from canon are immediate and not promised later as a reward like is usually done because 'mysterious author trapped everyone in the great hall thanks to the DOM and Umbridge'. ...

**** As someone who was abused, the idea that the abuse would come out starkly and force those witnesses or compliant into either action or realization is a bit of a dream because stuff like that almost never happens. People get an inkling something is wrong and write it off and the abuse continues until you're far enough into adulthood to realize that it WAS abuse and that it could have been stopped by those around you. It's self soothing in this way for me. Of course, this is just me.

****** nah, dude, it's chill. I think fanfiction is a type of art and like all art, is in a sense motivated by a felt void or imperfection in the world in an attempt to convey and correct that. It's a type of self-reflection.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193499/1/Mistakes]]

Summary:The Trio have gone back to finish thier last year of school after defeating Voldemort. Unfortunatly for Harry, Draco Malfoy is still alive and angry. His life is turned upsidedown after a "mistake" in potions class. De-aging fic. Takes place after HBP.

Shameless self promotion. This starts as a deaging fic, but when he becomes 17again, Harry has to deal with what everyone discovered.

  As part of the Triwizard Tournament, the Goblet of Fire may re-ignite after choosing the champions. This is a rare part of the choosing ceremony during which the goblet justifies its choices by showing something about each champion that influenced its decision.

** linkffn(6452481) does have a scene with Harry's treatment being revealed, with an extra twist a chapter or two after that, but it's not the main plot. Still a great read either, would recommend.

*** I don't think very many people knew about the cupboard under the stairs, and even the Weasley's, who knew the most, didn't talk that much about it. I mean, I'm sure Lee Jordan and Hermione heard about the flying car pulling bars off Harry's window, but how many people would have heard that story? Not many, because the entire story was very illegal. And it's entirely possible that a Muggleborn, which both were, would have just assumed that silly wizards had never heard of barred windows as a security system to keep thieves out. Or that they were exaggerating, like the pre-flying lesson boasts.
