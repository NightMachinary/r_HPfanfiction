** I'm not a fanfic writer, but I really like this idea! This is a cool picture, and I don't think it matters whether it has HP characters/settings or not - I'm sure there are plenty of fanfic writers who could come up with a great story inspired by an image! I'm here to read those experiments for sure!

** I do feel like we have a lot of prompts here, and encouraging image prompts could tip that over into too many (since finding images, I think, might be "less effort" than writing out an idea), but I also think it's something we won't know unless we try.

Could we have a trial run and let the people decide if they want to keep it? (Would it be worth it to make a new subreddit just for prompts if it gets too big?)

Also, there would need some specific rules for it since we'd be bringing outside content, like giving proper credit, no image reposts, and idk what else

Overall, I like the idea! It sounds fun :)

..........and here I am thinking about the logistics of this, to distract myself from writing something for that image because it's super inspiring /but it's only giving me 40k+ plot ideas, not snippets, and I Do Not Have The Brains For A New Project Right Now/

** IMO I don't like this idea mostly because there's just so much fantasy artwork online that it could easily overtake any sort of normal prompt, and it's much lower effort to just submit a picture. An occasional one would be fine, but I don't want it to open the floodgates.

**** u/StarOfTheSouth:
#+begin_quote
  Perhaps a weekly pinned Image Prompt thread would be a good field test for it?
#+end_quote

That could work. Just a pinned post every week where everyone can share pics they find. Maybe link back to previous posts, so that people don't have to fight Reddit's search engine.

** Yes! I have a whole Pinterest board for this. But I like my fantasy with a bit of realism and horror. Here are some that might translate to HP:

**** Yeah, it's mostly for inspiring DM/GM tabletop roleplaying but I like hitting it up for some visual inspiration. It's very difficult to convey what a scene "looks like" to your tabletop games without a map, or what an enemy looks like without tokens or some art to aid.

*** Not always. Pictures of strange creatures, or fantasy landscapes can be used to inspire. A sort of "how does this image play into a HP story" thing.
