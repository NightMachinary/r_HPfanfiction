So I love time travel stories, they're sort of a guilty pleasure of mine. I've read quite a few of them, but I want some requirements meant if you give me any.

No Manipulative/Evil/Dark ect extra Dumbledore. I want him as in canon as possible.

No Weasley bashing, I love the Weasley family and don't like to see them bashed by authors. Now if it's Percy Weasley that's fine since he was a bit of jerk.

If sent to Harry's first year then do something with Quirrell. It's a small one, but I never understood why the author never had anything done with Quirrell got rid of him earlier or whatever.

If set in the Marauder's Era I want Peter to be in the story, Peter was the Marauder's friend, I don't want him in the corner doing nothing I want him doing something.

The person being sent forward or backward in time can be anyone, it can be Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Ron, someone else entirely. Doesn't matter to me.

If the story has the Horcruxes I want something done with the Horcruxes.

I don't want one of the pairings to be Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, I just don't like those pairings, sorry. But anyone else is fair game.

These aren't requirements, these are completely optional here:

If set in the Golden Trio Era I would like Neville and Luna to get more development, maybe along with some Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs and Slytherins. Again not a requirement, just something I'd like to see.

Harry using his parseltongue ability more often, again not a requirement just something I'd like to see.

Using the Room of Requirements or Chamber of Secrets more, once again not a requirement just something I'd like to see.

And note the list doesn't have to have everything on the list. But I would like NO Dumbledore bashing and NO Weasley bashing at the least. Everything else is optional, but even so I'd still like to see what I put down.


** Here are my fav time travel fics. Some are slash, some are het, but all are within the romance genre (although time travel lends itself to good plotting and adventure too imo) and all are ones I would recommend. I've read so many more than this but these are my very favorites. None have the problems you listed like Dumbledore and Weasley bashing.

*** I haven't read all of the stories you listed, but I give my nomination to '/One Hundred and Sixty Nine/'. It was a perfect story in every way. And that's really saying something - I don't usually go for Hermione-centric stories, let alone Hermione/Sirius.

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

  Just because Draco's somehow gotten himself involved in Potter's suicide mission to defeat the Dark Lord doesn't mean he has to go quietly and actually act like a Gryffindor fool. And sure, he and Potter have some sort of relationship going on, but Draco's still a Slytherin, and he's going to bring his own brand of cunning to this cockamamy fool camping trip Potter's gone and got himself stuck in trying to save the world from evil lockets, gingers, and badly cooked food.

However, when things tumble out of Draco's grasp, he finds himself losing his memories of the life he's already led as everything takes a startling turn away from what he'd always assumed to be his destiny.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.

** My favorite time travel fic is Linkffn(Sands of Destiny by amidtheflowers)

It's Hermione in the Marauders era.

Peter is friends with them and isn't shoved in a corner.

Something is being done with the Horcruxes.

Room of Requirement is used.

No Dumbledore or Weasley bashing. Dumledore is only in the first chapter and the Weasleys make a cameo appearence.

Also I would second Debt of Time and One Hundred and Sixty Nine.
