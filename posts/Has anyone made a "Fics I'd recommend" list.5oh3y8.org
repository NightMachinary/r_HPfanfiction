I've seen a few over at [[/r/NarutoFanfiction]]


** [[/u/Taure]] has made a list [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NkGVr2UUmX3AkexY8P9GZkQFMVfLsxVHckcwW2FzDSA/edit?pli=1#heading=h.hq1iyxtkem45][here]]

** Yeah I have one! It is [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/katelawyer86/bookmarks][here]] and if you filter by "recs only" at the bottom you'll see only the things I liked. My comments are below each fic too. It's probably about 80% slash, but I do read some het and gen too. Not a lot of the OP!Harry or Harem stuff that gets a lot of love on this sub though.

** [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/y2c2ms6qx3txz1k/Fanfiction%20Rec%20List.docx?dl=0][Here's mine]]. It's mostly slash, only about a third of it is harry potter, and some of it's actually pretty bad (as is most fanfiction) but some of it's pretty good.

** [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DjOZthnO_ILQZ68l99rZTij8iDnQAHILUN5BV9HpY_o/edit?usp=sharing]] I made this sheet of fics I read a while ago. It hasn't been updated in a while (but I have been reading less hp fanfics recently, been doing more programming). Has the title, link, author, character list (so you can see pairings), word count (note that this is not auto-updated so the written down number could be old), rating, Categories, and my rating. I made this a while ago because I was bored, and I reread fics so it's nice to have a list of them. Please note that the ratings are my ratings of them, lots of other people might like them, but I might not have/may have enjoyed them greatly.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/daisyq424242/bookmarks][Here]] are the 653 fics I have bookmarked on AO3. 32 of those are Harry Potter, the rest being a mixed bag of fandoms, and I read everything - gen, het, slash, femslash... there's not a lot of what I see recced here, though, like harems, age difference pairings, and Harry Sue, so YMMV.
