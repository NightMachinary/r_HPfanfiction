I've done all sorts of searches for this, and maybe it's been taken down (or maybe I'm misremembering it!). Maybe someone else here will recognize it, though.

Here are the characteristics I remember from it:

- It took place after the book series
- I'm pretty sure it was Harry/Hermione, but I'm not positive
- I'm pretty sure Harry decided to hide in Australia to escape his fame, warding a property so he couldn't be found
- I seem to remember the property on a cliff overlooking the ocean
- I believe there were multiple houses on the property over time.
- I think the Grangers lived there, which is part of why I think it's Harry/Hermione (and Australia)
- I think Viktor Krum and his wife eventually joined them, in part due to him wanting to avoid fans
- Harry and Viktor might have developed a new line of brooms? Or something?

Does anyone else recognize any of this?

Something else that I've been remembering is Andromeda Tonks joining them in this self-imposed exile, and I remember something about her eventually joining the Granger parents in their bed. No smut, but it was clearly a three-way relationship that developed as Andromeda healed from the war. This might have been an entirely different fic, though. Does anyone remember that?

Weird that I can remember some of these little details, but nothing about the overall plot.


** Pretty sure you're looking for this one linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9364319/1/Escape]])

At the end, Harry buys a property in Austrailia on the ocean and a whole bunch of his friends and family end up there with him, including the Grangers, Andromeda Tonks, Luna, Gabriel Delacour. It is HHR despite the rocky start.

*** Yes, that's it!

Mostly, at least. It doesn't have the part with Krum, which means I either imagined it or I'm thinking about a different fic entirely. That's going to bug me, I know it.

I feel bad that I didn't figure this out sooner. I'm very familiar with Escape, in part because I wrote (and published on FFN) a first chapter of a possible fic inspired by Runaways, which in turn inspired Escape (and I always think of those two fics in conjunction with each other). Everything I was looking for was right at the end, though, which is probably why I forgot about it. That, and the fact that it had zero relevant information in the description, so if it had come up in my searches, I might have just passed it by.

Thanks for helping me, I really appreciate it.

  A little something that has been bouncing around in my head. Has the whole range of emotions and starts after Final Battle and changes the whole Epilogue. Definitely Harry/Hermione
