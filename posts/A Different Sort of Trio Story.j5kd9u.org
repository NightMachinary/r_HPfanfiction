If you want a new HP fanfic that goes well with the story line this is a good story. Here are a few of the obvious changes of what you might be looking for:

1. Instead of Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, Harry befriends Freya Weasley and Will Granger.
2. Percy Weasley has a love interest.
3. You get too see a good Draco, at least you see actual reasons why Draco does all the git-like things he does.
4. You get to see POV's of Snape and Lupin and the others
5. Just read it dudes, it's good.
