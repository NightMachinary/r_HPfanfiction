Are there any good story where one of the main characters gets bitten and has to deal with the repercussions? I'm sure there a lot of Remus Lupin stories but I'm more interested in stories where Harry, Ron or Hermione get bitten.


** The only one I can think of right now is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8106168/1/][Weres Harry]] which is currently a wip and features harry being turned into not quite your regular werewolf. It is quite funny at times and the story gets more involved towards the (current) end.

** The Secret's In The Telling by Sakuri on ff.net is a werewolf story. Draco is the main character who gets bitten. It is slash (Drarry is my favorite pairing to read).
