As the title says I'm looking for a fic in which Harry actually has to face some repercussions from dying in The Forbidden Forest and doesn't just walk away fine for years to come. Either emotional trauma or just some magic problems. Maybe time travel or just a continuation after Hogwarts, I'm fine with everything. No slash please, it isn't my cup of tea. Thanks

** If you don't mind crossovers, there's this Marvel one - tried to look for around half an hour and can't find it, so I will put in description instead:

Set before Avengers. Banner sees Harry trying to pay for a broken thing in muggle India (?) with galleons and looking really confused. Basically, Harry's soul was demaged and Luna recommended to go around and colect broken things. So Banner and Harry end up travelling together.

  Complete. Sick!Harry. Voldemort was defeated in Harry's 6th year. Now in his 7th year, Harry struggles with PTSD. However, surviving the killing curse resulted in more damage to Harry's body than anyone could have suspected. He develops an incurable, unknown form of cancer that only very dark magic can cause. How will everyone deal with it? Deathfic. Trio-centric.
