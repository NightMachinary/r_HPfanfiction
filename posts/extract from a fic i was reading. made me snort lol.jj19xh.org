linkao3(stunning shifts) chapter 2

"I swear Harry. You're becoming worse than Dumbledore."

"What!" He sputtered out. He was not!

"Merlin, let's hope not," Ron said.

"And for once I agree with Weasley," Malfoy said, shuttering.

Harry rolled his eyes despite his previous indignation. "For once? You say that /every/ time you agree with Ron---oh get over it," he added when both Ron and Malfoy gave him horrified looks. "You two agree all of the time."

"I have no idea what you're talking about, Potter."

"Nor do I," Ron added, his nose wrinkled in disgust.

"So you both agree that you have no idea what I'm talking about?" Harry asked innocently.

Ron and Malfoy glared at him. "I'm not falling for that one again," Ron grumbled.

"Shame."


** That's pretty funny, need more snarky rivalry of Ron and Draco. It's normally always Harry and Draco, with the snarky rivalry.

*** honestly i think that we just need more snarky rivalry in general- fics that focus on friendships and enemies to grudging allies to snarky playful rivarly to frienship are superior.

**** As a non funny person, myself, trying to write humor, is incredibly difficult, and I salute anyone, who can do it, even half decently, so I can understand, why humor or snarky comments, aren't as used, as often.

***** i love how you just identify as a non funny person LOL. though tbh i wouldnt mind the humour aspect being omitted- the focus being on friendship and grudging sentimentality is honestly more than enough for me as a reader

#+begin_quote
  During a publicity stunt, Harry and five others are sent to another world where a well timed Stupefy made all the difference. As Harry looks for his peers and a way home, another Harry investigates the odd arrival of his doppelganger.

******* so i just checked shockingly, there are currently [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=word_count&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Draco+Malfoy%2FRon+Weasley&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=Harry+Potter+-+J*d*+K*d*+Rowling][1257]] works on [[https://ao3.org][ao3.org]] for ron/draco :O

which isnt a massive amount when you consider that theres little over around 250k harry potter fanfctions on ao3 alone.

however if you were indeed hinting at writing a snarky one shot between the pair, please go right ahead because i would literally love to read it ;)
