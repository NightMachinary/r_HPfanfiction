I theoretically love stories with a very powerful Harry, but a lot of them are terribly written trash. Good heroes need adversity and obstacles to overcome (duh)! If Harry can just breeze through everything it's not interesting (duh)!

I want a super Harry story were Harry grows magically extremely powerful from a very early age, but that creates many problems for him. Examples:

Every wand he tries to use burns out after just a few days and he constantly has to get a new one. This could lead to all sorts of interesting developments. He could try staffs (since they can handle more power) but finds them too limited. He could try to make his own wands, but he learns that making good wands is a skill that will take him at least years of dedicated work to master. He could temporarily solve it by scrounging old wands from the room of requirements, but they don't work well for him and (of course) burn out fast.

Every time Harry casts a spell or tries transfiguration etc. the power is like a horrifically powerful firehose of streaming magic. Whatever spell he is trying to cast gets turned to 11 and Harry has to concentrate very hard to limit his magical output so that the spells he uses are even remotely useful.

When Harry daydreams or actually dreams, magic just leaks out of him and causes unexpected magical phenomenons around him causing him to have a room all to himself but leads to social isolations.

People fear him because sometimes his accidental magic is dangerous and his social isolation makes him lonely and a little bit resentful of all the fun and joy of other people being casually friendly with each other around him. His social interactions consist mostly of scholars and teachers and Dumbledore who becomes his reluctant mentor because there's nobody else who can understand powerful magic in the same way. Maybe Harry still goes to classes, but while he's the most powerful he is outshined by some scholarly types who understand magic much better in a theoretical way, including Hermoine who can even do magic better because she doesn't have to strain against her own magic to not explode the whole room. Maybe an adversarial relationship could be created based on that that later develops into a friendship. Or some other character. Whatever.

My whole fucking point is that a powerful super Harry could be written in an interesting way. It's like trying to write interesting stories about Superman. Writing interesting stories which have great power is difficult, but possible and I desperate want to read them. Alas, they are few and far between.


** Probably far too obvious of an answer, but considering that many people probably stopped reading it during year one thinking that it would just be another OP Harry fic, I'll say it anyway.

Saving Connor has one of the only OP Harry's that I actually like. First year and most of second year have him overpowered only in terms of intelligence (which is justified by his, um, less than stellar upbringing), but near the end of second year he becomes magically overpowered as well and almost dies as a side effect. It takes him several months to learn to control it, and you would think that at that point the author would then start shamelessly writing Indie!Harry-Ruins-Dumbledore-Goes-Into-Politics-Gets-Eight-Girlfriends-And-Erases-Voldemort-From-Existence, but by that point the plot has transformed such that most of the conflicts are familial or social drama, so there aren't many chances for his ridiculous power level to annoy the reader. The primary case where his power is relevant is when Voldemort is in town, and the author did a good job making sure that Voldemort is moderately stronger while providing natural and believable reasons for Harry to survive. The second major case (spoiling up to and partially into year three, Harry converting to xeno-libertarianism) also avoids being a power trip due to having nothing to do with Harry's own personal experience of being powerful but instead other people's experience of said power.

That said, you won't get any subversion; Harry genuinely is one of the three most powerful wizards in Britain in this AU, and the only real downside he faces for being overpowered is how the rest of wizarding society treats him for it. I guess you could consider it a subversion that an OP Harry would be in a universe where his power is only directly useful in two of the several overarching plotlines, but you seem more interested in direct weaknesses than contextual issues. In any case, here's the link in the off chance you haven't already read it or find this description to be sufficient reason to try it again:

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

** Harry would undoubtedly be studied intensly by scholars, making him feel less like a person and more like an experiment to be oggled at.

On a side note, this kinda reminds me of how in One Punch Man Saitama (is that his name?) Is so OP he actually suffers more.

** I did something similar once, but it was one of my early fics and the execution was not all there. Nor is it completed. :(

I would love to see recs in this vein, it's a great concept!
