All I remember about this story is that it was a rewrite of at least the last (and maybe book 6 as well) book, where the Trio is searching for horcruxes. It's H/G, R/Hr, and the most specific thing I can remember is upon discovering one of them in a chest, the backlash of a curse burns off all of Hermione's hair. Later, Ginny donates her hair to make a hair piece for Hermione, which causes some grief back at Hogwarts.

I remember this being quite an excellent tale, but my bad habit of not favoriting things on accident is hurting me in this case. Thanks for the help if you can!
