If you read time travel fics, do you care about the temporal mechanics (method of travel, type of paradox) or is "magic" a sufficient explanation? If not, what amount of explanation and temporal physics do you want to see included? Do you differentiate between accidental time travel and intentional trips to the past?


** I only care about the mechanics of time travel as far as they influence the actions of the time-travelling characters.

I don't care if they use a hyper-temporal-quantum-beamshuttle or a transdimensional ultrawarp platform to travel to the past and what ridiculous pseudo-physics powers the thing.

But what's important is whether we're in a "universe" setting in which the characters have to care about not messing up the future they came from, or a "multiverse" setting in which the timeline they arrive in is separate from the original one and they don't have to worry about accidentially removing anyone out of history.

When writing time-travel stories, I bend the rules of time-travel to suit the story I want to tell.

It might even go completely unnoticed except for that one change 1941 where a man died, never getting children, that had children on their own, - and suddenly a Hogwarts child is missing and nobody ever heard of that family.

Does it have an impact on the story? It might - if one is willing to write 'deep' enough into the butterfly-changes.

**** Basically it boils down to whether they can change what they remember. Time turners are canonically the universe option, they can't change what they saw, bad stuff happens if you meet yourself, everything they do already happened.\\
Multiverse is like most timetravel fics, they get to go back in time, either physically or mentally, armed with knowledge of the future and can freely change most things and they'll never return to the future they departed from.

You show it by having the characters either super careful to not mess things up ("We can't be seen" etc.), or deliberately trying to avert problems with no care for the effects on time (immediately stealing the diary from Ginny in diagon alley and destroying it then heading to the chamber with a couple of roosters) or with the only concern being that changing too much invalidates future knowledge (letting Wormtail escape so they know when and how Riddle will return)

** As long as its consistent.

Come up with your rules, and don't break them (or, if you really want to do sci-fi, break them in an interesting way and then explore the ramifications of that)

The important thing is consistency. One of the reasons people got annoyed at Cursed Child is because the time travel is so radically different from PoA.

(Also because it's poorly written and has a hackneyed premise)

*** I tend to agree with this.

When I read time travel fics I usually just skim through the intro portion until the travel event occurs. The chapter-length exposition on why the time travel happened, how it happened and how the time traveler prepared (if at all) tends to get repetitive. I'll go back and reread that section later if the story turns out to be extremely good or if it actually becomes relevant to the plot.

It's a breath of fresh air when authors skip writing that chapter completely to just begin "/in medias res/." It's more interesting if the backstory is a mystery that is gradually explained through flashbacks or conversations with other characters.

** I do. Absolutely.

I don't have a problem when a fic allows for different kinds of time travel than canon does, but the author should at least have a basic understanding of the different types of time travel that exist and how they work. If there's a single timeline where you can make changes that affect the future you absolutely can not have people sitting in the 'future' waiting for something to happen in the past. It makes my brain hurt (cursed child is such bad fanfiction).

I just expect the barest amount of logical sense - unless it's a comedy or crack!fic: Nonsensical time travel can be funny.

IMHO authors who don't really care about this kind of stuff should just stick to "time travel sends you to alternate universes" explanation. It gives them the most leeway, without having to worry about paradoxes.

I read a story where harry timetraveled during the DoM battle, and he was angsting every chapter over having to hurry back to the future because sirius/his friends were in danger.. and at no point did Harry realise that the future didnt continue while he was in the past.. the lack of logic hurt my brain!

I also like something like linkffn(10016768) where they just don't bother to explain it at all, its just an event that happened before the story started. Focus on the story rather than what led to it happening, we'll figure out the rest as we go.

**** I like it. Simple, quick way to show a "magical accident" time travel.

The only reason to delve deeper into it is if you plan to have Harry attempt travel "back home" (either some reasearch, trying and failing, or succeeding).

Don't get bogged down in the minutia, the reason I love time travel fics are to see the traveler interact with a new peer group and to try to fix things with future knowledge.

The specific methods of the travel are secondary, beyond how they impact the plot (prepared or suprised, what's brought back with them or left behind, can it be reused, return trip or one way, etc). You don't /need/ an exposition of in depth research to share these answers, and doing so when it's unnessesary is more likely to annoy the me as a reader than leaving it to the bare-bones would.

One "best of both worlds" options could be to have your resident researcher share the summary of their findings in your fic, and write a companion oneshot of a research paper they "published" on the topic (perhaps referenced in a discrete author's note).

Harry's story started in the Underworld, a kilometer below the upper levels of Coruscant, where you never walk the streets alone, especially if you don't have a blaster hanging by your side. He left for a little while, but now it's called him back, whether he realizes it or not.

** I think very few people actually want detailed "pseudophysics" information about how time travel literally works, they just want to know how it narratively works. If it's a one-time accidental thing meant to create a plausible past setting, make it clear they can't use it willy-nilly. If it can be used more freely but within limits, describe what those limits are.

The reason why this explanation is wanted in the first place is because time travel can easily be a setting-breaking power, and if time travel is used to do X in one situation, there should be a reason why it wasn't used to do X in all these other situations where it would have been extremely helpful. Otherwise your readers will think "well why didn't they use this convenient time machine to solve this problem" which makes your characters seem dumb, and your story unsatisfying, since you introduced a universal plot solver into your story and arbitrarily stopped using it.

** I think that for time-travel you need to define which kind of paradox is caused by travel, and that needs to remain consistent across the story. In canon I actually think JKR got it right here (I'm excluding Cursed Child here, because it seems to play by its own rules). In PoA, JKR establishes that the HP- verse operates on a fixed timeline. Harry sees who he thought was his father casting the Patronus charm when it was always him the whole time; the trio thought that Macnair killed Buckbeak, but it was actually a future Harry and Hermione who saved him. The thwack they heard was the axe going into Hagrid's fence in anger. Things like that. When Harry and Hermione used the time turner to go back in time, they were in effect going to do things that they had already done. I think this is a neat and tidy way to handle time travel because you don't need to keep track of the paradox in and of itself; I feel that it doesn't distract from the story.

*** One plot point I've seen in regards to time travel in HP, when people want to change things without breaking PoA consistency, is that the timeline changes in such a way that a paradox can't happen -- if you change the past, things "realign" themselves so that things /did/ happen that way, even if it's very implausible (this also explains the nonsensical McNair behaviour in PoA).

Thus, you "can" change the past, but the universe will always clean up your mess. Save James and Lily? Well, clearly they were just polyjuiced doppelgangers that night. Or similar.

** The only thing I really need to know about time travel is whether it's open ended (the future the traveller comes from has no impact on the past and the traveller, like alternate timelines) or closed loop (the way the future changes influences the traveller).

Even then, it's mostly so I can avoid the second type (because unless your idea of time travel is a normal time turner you're just not going to manage the story without massive plot holes).

Anything else, well I don't really care. If you can write it down in an interesting manner (and without writing in obvious logical holes) and/or is plot relevant, I'll happily read it, but it's of no importance to me.

** Only of it's relevant to the story, like if there's a return component lined up or it happens during the plot. If time travel's meant to be a part of the plot rather than, say, the entire plot, then you need to put thought into how it's supposed to work.

Time turners are useful in that regard, coming pre-packaged with strict limitations on what can and absolutely cannot be done.

Incidentally, the super time turners are one of the reasons why I treat HP & the cursed child as a non-canon event happening in fanfiction-land. That and the fact that Delphini is the dumbest villain I've ever heard about. If step 1 of your plan involves fucking with causality, then it's a dumb-ass plan and you need a better one.

However, if your plot is to plonk a random character in some distant corner of space-time with no way of reversing the original process, then you can get away with not explaining sweet bugger all. You can have them do anything from waking up in the new time with no warning to going into a walk-in wardrobe and coming out during the apex of spaceborne human civilisation, Narnia-style.

It all depends on what you want to do with the time travelling.

It eliminates the need to explain the hows of time travel and skips the boring chapter(s) where the main character is in the "present." Time travel fics usually have at least one boring/extraneous chapter where it explains what is different from canon universe and why the character is traveling back in time or how the accident occurred that threw the character back in time or a scene where the character interacts with a deity when it usually doesn't matter to the overall plot.

** I would be much more accepting of time travel in a fanfiction if people would stop their attempts at explaining how it works. - Time Travel is illogical and is believed to be impossible in real world physics. Your faulty attempts to explain it using "the magic of sacrifice" or "his dying wish was so powerful" or "he cleverly set up the time turners to turn at nearly the same time, a second difference between each, - allowing him to enter the cascadea field of endless time where the gods reside". Now we suddenly have gods and some weird pseudo-scientific method of entering a plane of said gods, wut?

The only time travel fanfictions I have found to be an acceptable read were those in which Harry fused with his younger alternate-self. It just made more sense to me than him going back to his younger body, being as powerful as a 1000 year old merlin, remembering ANY detail of his life and then not changing anything of importance, except for the fact that HE gets the GIRL!

The main question I think someone should ask themselves before starting a time travel show is if your story is ABOUT time travel or merely USING time travel.

**** Then no, you don't really need to explain it. Extrenuous detail shouldn't be there in the first place unless it advances either story theme, plot, or character.

** In time travel the important part is the rules not the mechanic.

Is your time travel operation on multiverse theory, branching time lines, one mutable time line or an immutable time line?

Pick one and stick to it otherwise you are going to have a bunch of plot holes.

** When it comes to time travel, there is only one thing I care about.

Is it /The Terminator/ time travel? Or is it /Terminator 2: Judgement Day/ time travel?
