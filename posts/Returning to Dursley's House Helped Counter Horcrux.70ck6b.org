I have a theory.

Perhaps, as Dumbledore has expected Harry to be a Horcrux, that made returning to the Dursley's protection important to protect Harry from being possessed by Voldemort's splintered soul because of the blood protection? So, the threats he was running from wasn't so much external as internal.


** Dumbledore says he didn't know about the horcruxes until CoS. He definitely didn't know Harry was a horcrux -- and only started putting the pieces together in books 4 and 5.

**** And that wasn't a LIE. He started to search only after he got confirmation. If he knew Voldemort created Horcrux before CoS, he would have searched when Voldemort was weak.

***** I know it wasn't, but the OP's theory can be interpreted as a cliche "manipulative!Dumbledore up to no good", in which case he could have lied about his Horcrux knowledge.

** I believe that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7505602/1/The-Horcrux-Within][The Horcrux Within]] plays with this concept a bit; after the horcrux in Harry's head is woken up after his encounter with Quirrell, the effects of the blood wards on the Dursley's house silence it.

I'm not all that happy with Dumbledore's solution to keep it from bothering Harry at Hogwarts, in this fic, though.

*** Dang, of course someone has thought of it before. Oh well.

What's Dumbledore's solution to keep it from bothering Harry at Hogs?

***** Huh. Never seen that before. Certainly unique. Not quite my cup of tea, though.
