Student again after his name is cleared, This would be such a cute story to read.


** Arguably he actually deserved to be expelled. I mean he didn't cause the death of a person, but he had a man-eating spider.

You'd be better off requesting this as a prompt.

*** Ok, yes, but he was already expelled, not allowed to use the magic he was born with for 50-ish years, and then spent some actual time in Azkaban during the Chamber of Secrets fiasco. Any wrongdoing by owning the spider --- which, at the time, didn't actually kill or hurt anyone as far as we know --- could be blamed as childish ignorance. How many 13 year olds, especially ones with a skewed sense of danger like a half-giant, would make similar mistakes? Probably a lot. And even if it was something that deserved more than a handful of detentions, his subsequent punishments have already more than made up for it.

**** I could see it as a settlement of sorts by the ministry as an exchange to keep quiet about being thrown summarily in Azkaban.

*** Well then, you must certainly expel Harry and co for concealing the baby dragon, liberating Buckbeak, and possibly for tackling the basilisk (they did make one attempt to inform a teacher, but when he turned out to be a total fraud, it really would have been sensible for them to try someone they knew to be more reliable).

**** Hagrid kept the man-eating spider in the school, who had no compunctions about killing a student indirectly. It is not the same thing.

1. Harry and Co. got rid of the Dragon, with the blessings of a staff member. Hagrid again is to blame here.
2. Equating liberating Buckbeak with keeping Aragog in a school is laughable at best. Not only was Dumbledore sanctioning it, but Malfoy Sr. threatened the committee to kill them.
3. Harry again reported it to an authority figure, and they actually dealt with the problem. Harry was not the cause.

Hagrid might be lovable in the series, but he is also a reckless fool.

***** 1. What staff member would that be? Charlie certainly doesn't count. Sure, Hagrid is to blame, but "accessory after the fact" is a thing.

2. Legally speaking, having been classed as dangerous and slated for execution, Buckbeak was in pretty much the same category as Aragog.

3. Lockhart never dealt with any problem. He attacked them in his office, they were lucky enough to subdue him, and then instead of approaching someone whom they knew to be more reliable, like /pretty much any other teacher, even Snape/, they frog-marched Lockhart to the Chamber and all jumped in. I'm calling this one more dubious because they made /some/ effort, but it still fell far short of what students should reasonably do in a dangerous situation.

Harry might be the hero of the series, and both brave and loyal to his friends, but he is also a reckless fool.

** Oh, it'd be so cute to have him in class! He was expelled as third-year or something, right? So he'd have to join a bunch of thirteen-year-olds. Can you imagine trying to cut tiny ingredients in potions class, bent over a tiny cauldron? It's adorable. I hope this exists!

** It is a cute image, but I am with linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) on this: he would probably got some individual teaching plan with getting one-to-one training by professors at Hogwarts.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.
