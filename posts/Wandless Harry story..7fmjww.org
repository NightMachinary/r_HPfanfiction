I'm looking for a wandless Harry story where when he got 'his' wand, it hurt him, because it was trying to direct, and connect with his magic in a forceful way, and he could feel it, and detested it. Sadly that's all I remember.

Thanks,

Warryn.


** Not exactly, but linkffn(No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim) Harry becomes adept with wandless magic because the wand he had burned out in his hands, repeatedly.

He does have that sort of reaction to the Elder Wand, though.

  In a world where Neville Longbottom was marked as Voldemorts equal, Harry Potter is determined not to be his Inferior, and that leaves only one option... Not Slash.

** Linkffn(11188292)? Its a crossover with Dresden Files. The Olivander wand didn't so much hurt him as would make all his other magical tools useless, IIRC.

  The blood wards around Privet Drive have a disastrous effect on Harry Potter's magical development, leaving him unable to use a wand. But there are other kinds of magic, and other paths to power. Harry/many witches. No horcruxes.

*** Sadly no. In this story he can, and does use a wand for cover, but the first time he held it he didn't expect that the wand would try to change how he does magic by how it connects to a wizards/witches core(I know cores are fanon, but eh...), and that hurt him.

Thanks,

Warryn.
