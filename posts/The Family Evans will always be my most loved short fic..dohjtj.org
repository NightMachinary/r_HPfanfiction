I'm currently collating a list of all my favourite docs after a decade of reading hp FanFiction, and this will always be the one that makes me cry. I'm not sure if it hits home because I'm adopted myself, or because there's just something so incredibly pure about it.

*“This was hatred. This was love; it was something else entirely. This was a girl who was told she was not pretty, not brilliant, not magic; a girl who listened and decided that, alright then, that would have to be enough. That would have to be more than enough. That would have to be better, to be normal, to be plain and horse-toothed and to have too much neck. Her sister had left her for brighter shores and, fine then, Petunia didn't want to follow anyway. That lived like a canker under her tongue all her life.”*

Anyway, I'm going to leave it here. Hopefully it reaches someone the same way it reached me.

And once you're done reading that, if you liked it, this one is in a similar vein, by the same author.

I'll be posting my list later this week, but having gotten tears in my eyes rereading this for some ridiculous umpteenth time, I figured I'd post this first. Have a great day!


** I love this one too. My beloved quotation:

#+begin_quote
  When Petunia was frustrated with Lupin's moping or Molly's frenetic energy, or the way Dudley tagged along behind the twins, Petunia would go tug the covering down off the portrait of Sirius's mother and they would scream at each other until Petunia felt her stomach settle.

** Agreed!!! Dirgewithoutmusic is a wonderful, poetic writer, and I return to all their stories time and time again. I've recently been quite fond of /the last son/, linkao3(8158447), if Ron was the Chosen One; and /a life of smoke and silvered glass/, linkao3(11457669), if Snape was a better friend.

  Harry did not know this and would not know this until Mrs. Granger mentioned it casually over a Christmas dinner years and years later-- but she and Mr. Granger reported the Dursleys for child abuse and neglect, over and over.The reports got lost-- minds scrubbed down, papers vanished-- but they kept calling in reports. They considered kidnapping. They couldn't imagine why the wizarding world might want to keep their chosen one somewhere so toxic, why they might want to keep this underfed child and his messy hair with those people."My mother left me a blood protection spell," said Harry, whose scar had not ached in years. He poked at his mashed potatoes under the focused attention of Mrs. Granger's stern little forehead wrinkle. "I had to live with family, blood family.""Then they should have made them treat you right," Mrs. Granger said, as though it was that simple.Mr. Granger gave Harry another helping of peas.

#+begin_quote
  On the train platform, Harry suffered a hug from Remus, a hair ruffle from Sirius, and a "don't do anything I wouldn't do" from his mother, and then he ran for the brick wall, cart rattling before him. The snowy owl they'd gotten him hooted softly in protest. Harry had named her Ororo after the Muggle comic books his mother had introduced him to. Lily took Harry to the comic store every time he sat through a whole visit with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and didn't kick anybody unless they kicked him first. Bill tried to wipe some dirt off a dodging Ron's nose. Ginny complained loudly about being left behind. Fred and George ran off to see Lee Jordan's spider. People watched the Weasleys from all directions--they were hard to miss--and Ron's shoulders slowly rose up and up to his reddening ears. He missed the big empty orchards behind the Burrow already. Ron was one of the last people on the train. He slid past staring eyes and finally stepped himself into an almost unoccupied compartment-- there was just one small boy tucked in there. He had messy dark hair, slightly askew round glasses, and a comic book held up in front of his nose. "Is it okay if I sit here?" said Ron. "Everywhere else is full."

  Albus Dumbledore rose to his feet, smiling at them in that way of his, like he knew something you didn't and he was proud of you for it. "Friends," he began.The door thudded open and the Marauders burst in, late and pink-cheeked with cold. The headmaster smiled at them, too, and Sirius gave a cheery little salute back.Severus sunk lower in his chair, staring witheringly over his butterbeer. "You told Potter about it, too?""He might as well put all that energy to good use," said Lily. "And, to be accurate, I told Remus.""But Potter, really?" said Severus."He and Black cooked up a jinx that gives you a boil every time you say a slur to a Muggleborn," said Lily. "It was either invite them to Alice's war club or bake them cookies, and I know where my skills lie."Severus sniffed. "Don't come crying to me if he tugs your pigtails.""Come crying to me if he pulls yours, and I'll deck him," said Lily.(Slight AU in which Severus apologizes, tries harder, and stays friends with Lily)

** I don't agree at all. I think it's remarkably bad. We are informed of people's attributes and aren't allowed to judge them ourselves.

It represents a low opinion of the reader. It is not for the writer to tell anyone what anything is. Show the situation and let the reader judge.

*** I think it's the opposite. It's not an opinion piece, just a short story about characters we know so well by now we could read lines in their voices. And one small change, and some happiness and some sadness. After all, in the end, the more things change, the more they stay the same.

Petunia being a better person can't stop Tonks dying, or Remus, or Fred.

But we can hear about a loving home, a protective brother, a different version of a woman who was written to be hateable. And there's some wonderful lines in a lot of the ficus that have been posted in this thread.

Ultimately, writing hateable, stupid characters is easy. Writing about flawed, vicious, suspicious aunts and getting the reader to love them anyway?

Well, that'll always be a yes in my book.

**** I think this kind of thing is bad literature.

I don't have a problem with the story or the events, but the author chooses to make judgements that are up to the reader and that is not proper. If you want a character to be judged to have behaved well, then show it with objective writing and let the reader come to that conclusion.

***** I have never read a single book in which the main character isn´t portrayed in a positive light, and in this piece the main character is Petunia. Imagine paragraph read:

/“She thought: This was hatred. This was love; it was something else entirely. She was told she was not pretty, not brilliant, not magic; she listened and decided that, alright then, that would have to be enough. That would have to be more than enough. That would have to be better, to be normal, to be plain and horse-toothed and to have too much neck. Her sister had left her for brighter shores and, fine then, Petunia didn't want to follow anyway. That lived like a canker under her tongue all her life.”/

It is merely the feelings and perspective of the character as in any other book. Just because the author chose to write in an observational style, more like a character study, doesn´t change the fact that this is the main character and the work is meant to show the world through the eyes of the main character(s). I have never met a person who thinks objectively of themself.

****** The Harry Potter books didn't tell you what you were supposed to think of the protagonist. Worm didn't tell you what to think of the protagonist, A House for Mr Biswas didn't tell you either.

But I don't see the problem as a positive or negative portrayal. I see the problem as the lack of a portrayal, which is instead replaced with claims.

Petunia isn't the narrator. If Petunia were the narrator it would be less problematic. Then we could question the rightness of Petunia's claims.
