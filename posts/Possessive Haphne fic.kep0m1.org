Hi!

I'm looking for fics where specifically Daphne is possessive of Harry.

Thank you! :)


** Unfortunately, having gone through quite a few Haphne fics I don't think there is any stories like this at all. But I wish you luck in finding any.

** There are a few One i remember takes place during 4th year where James is still alive (but not Lily) and Harry is a bit of an ass and a womanizer at times and too scared to admit he loves Daphne while Daphne feels the same but is loyal to Harry. Harry gets a blowjob from some girl at the yule ball but feels bad about it afterwards and Daphne forgives him
