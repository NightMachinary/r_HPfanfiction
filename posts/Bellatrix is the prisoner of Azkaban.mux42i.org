I'd love to see a “Bellatrix escapes Azkaban completely on her own” fic. Like she has some hidden power with dark magic. Maybe she could replace Sirius in PoA? Or at least if Sirius is in it then his relevance to the plot has nothing to do with escaping Azkaban.


** In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19770283/chapters/46800730][The Changeling]] Bellatrix and Sirius escape Azkaban together, but it is not really all that important, it is there just so Harry could get more people on her side. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6614155/chapters/15133504][Full Circle]] Bellatrix takes Sirius' place as the escaped convict and wants to kill Harry.

** Linkao3(That Universe Over There)

Bellatrix breaks out I'm pretty sure. But I haven't read the fic in a while

  Finding himself in another universe, Harry makes the perfectly logical choice and adopts his younger self, destroys this world's leftover Voldie pieces, and tries his best to avoid happy goblins.
