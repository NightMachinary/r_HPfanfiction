***** Well I'm sure murkybluematter would be glad to hear that, but writing takes time, especially when its a hobby and has to be managed alongside real life stuff. I'm sure that once she finds the time and inspiration she will definitely update.

** I check multiple times a day. I have a Problem. In the meanwhile, recent reviews pointed me to the rigelslittlelab Tumblr blog. Very nice fanart there, if you want to see related content to keep you until the next update.

(But seriously, the one with Harriet and Rosier is absolutely flawless.)
