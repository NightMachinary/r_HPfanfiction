I reckon that it would be the HP version of a nuclear winter.


** What do you think happened 70,000 years ago to nearly wipe out humans? It was no supervolcano, dementors multiplied until the earth practically froze over!\\
It was really touch-and-go for a few years there with the last surviving pockets of sapient creatures, but eventually the dementors faded without enough victims to feed on and the climate went back to normal.

** It makes no sense Dementors are unkillable. I mean, they'd have to overwhelm eventually.

My headcanon is as an apex predator, dragons used to keep Dementors in check with Dragonfire. Then wizards came around with their Statute of Secrecy and created dragon reserves screwing up the ecosystem.

** I think there's a HP/walking dead crossover where dementors are a big problem along side walkers.

** Matt Silver has one. Incorruptible: the Dementor's Stigma. It's exactly as I would imagine it happening.
