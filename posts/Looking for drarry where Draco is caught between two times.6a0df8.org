Harry is a auror in the investigation unit three years after the war. Harry and Ginny are married but not doing well. Draco is a missing person, Harry gets memories about him from Astoria and Narcissa. Turns out Draco was caught between two times because of a time turner accident and Hermione and the unspeakables figure out how to get him back. Harry and Draco drive around a lot in Draco's Renault. Written beautifully. Never got to finish it and don't know the name.
