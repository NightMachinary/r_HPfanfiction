I Have no idea how to search this in Ao3 or FFN, and google only shows old posts about it, so idk.


** What is the smut fic? Is it well done?

I've looked through the thing the too comment posted, sadly I didn't find anything, let me know if you do - I'm also interested in this

Edit: there's this,

#+begin_quote
  Across the Mirror by Jeconais2

  Harry is alone in the world. In his Sixth Year, waking from nightmares, he finds comfort in the only person he could ever trust...his female counterpart from another universe Jamie Potter. Harry/Fem!Harry. Evil!Harry
#+end_quote

But it's been removed from FF.net, and it's not on [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/]] either.

*** The smut is extremely well done, but its a Harem setting, with a different as fuck universe (Sirius is evil, Voldemort is a lady, there are few men in this world percent-wise, Bellatrix, Lily and James were in a three-way relationship, etc... ) Its called Rose Paradox. And I've read and enjoyed the little there was in this fic by Jeconais, thanks.
