There was this pretty good one-shot (which was a part of a one-shot collection IIRC) which had Molly in a debt or blackmailed by Dumbledore. For what, I don't remember; teen pregnancy or giving Arthur love potion are my two guesses.

Ron liked neither Harry nor Hermione, but was coerced into becoming friends with them and spying on them from the start, which makes for a shitty seven (?) years. He wasn't even paid; I distinctly remember him complaining about unpaid labor.

In the end, he decided that he has enough of a shitty life of pretending with his family constantly being blackmailed by Dumbledore (even from beyond the grave, IIRC?). And that he therefore deserved a bit of a reward just for himself: a portion of Harry's fortune. Harry caught him, though.

If anyone has the link to that fic that'd be great! It was on FFN.


** I know this one, it's part of a one-shot collection. The Other Side of the Coin, I think its chapter was titled, in the Random Craziness File by Darklooshkin.
