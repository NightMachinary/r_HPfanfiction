#+TITLE: You know how hermione was supposed to have a sister? What if instead of marrying his male best friend's little sister, he ended up marrying his female friend's little sister? How do you think she'd change the camping trip? Would she negate hermione obliviating their parents?

*** When I heard of Hermione having a little sister in the earlier drafts, I always thought that she and her sister would resemble that of Lily and Petunia - with Hermione being accepted to Hogwarts, but her little sister wouldn't be magical and thus, not accepted. However, I think that Hermione and her sister would be closer than that of Lily and Petunia but that's just my thought.

Doubtful, Dumbledore has worked in politics long enough to be able to stop most parents from taking their kids out of Hogwarts, especially the brightest witch of her age, who is vital towards his plans for Harry.

** If Hermione had a witch sister, it would have SIGNIFICANT impact on the overall plot. I highly doubt a similar camping trip could have still taken place.

Even if everything went roughly the same until that point, Hermione would have asked them evacuate Britain anyway. Perhaps she didn't even need to memory charm her parents.

** Ginny didn't go on the trip, this hypothetical sister probably wouldn't either

*** I never said ginny did but hermione having a little sister would potentially affect it from potentially pointing out logistics issues. And do you really think hermione would let her little sister go to hogwarts if her parents were a potential lynchpin to harry in her mind? "Oh, sure, Calliope, you can go to hogwarts for sixth year, it's not like the death eaters will try to bother you to get to me to get to harry."

**** And I never said she'd go to Hogwarts, but equally so this sister wouldn't go on the trip either because of the Trace. she'd not be able to do Magic and be essentially useless and a liability . Most likely Scenario would be she'd go to Beaubaxtons or leave the country with her parents

** It depends on her personality. If she's like Hermione, she probably would have seen the logic in not saying anything. But Harry didn't fall in love with Hermione, he fell in love with Ginny and earlier had a crush on Cho Chang. His type seems to be tough-ish athletic girls with a bit of sass. So if Hermione's sister would be something along the lines of that, if he fell in love with her instead. And if that were the case, I think she would either tell the parents or get talked into helping by Hermione and feel extremely guilty about it.

As for the camping trip, she would probably be some extra help they needed. More people to carry the horcruxes, more people to fight against the snatchers, etc. I'm sure it would be a little awkward at time with two couples around each other like that. Would probably lead to some comedic scenes, like Hermione being irritated with her sister for trying to make her hair look nice but then getting caught doing it herself or something. This all depends on whether or not she's a witch. If she wasn't a witch, but knew enough about the wizarding world and the stuff the group has been through to fall in love with Harry, I think she would be obliviated too, and Harry probably would feel she was safer that way.

** I sort of wish someone would write this, it sounds interesting. Would she be muggle? Or a witch? Both would change the story.

If she were a witch and did go on the camping trip, Harry would certainly feel less isolated from Ron and Hermione. I suspect Ron wouldn't have left if there was someone else on the trip that could potentially defuse the situation.

If she were a muggle, I think Hermione would still memory charm her parents (as well as her sister in this case). I'd be curious what their relationship would be like, it could potentially devolve into a Petunia-Lily relationship.
