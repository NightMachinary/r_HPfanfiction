Tonks is the only metamorphmagus we see in canon. It's described as a very rare natural gift but what makes her develop that ability? Does she have an ancestor that was particularly gifted at transfiguration or is it just a random gift that manifests in someone, although rarely?

Parseltongue is also something that's puzzling to me. Are all parselmouths descended from Salazar Slytherin or Herpo the Foul? Or like in Harry's case, have some sort of soul infusion going on in there? If all parselmouths have a common ancestor, then that just begs the question of where does the ability generate from. Is it some sort of curse like a malediction but it wasn't that harmful or some side effects of a magical experiment? If some people could talk to snakes, why aren't there other tongues that a witch or wizard can develop, such as speaking with crows or conversing with owls? If the entire Slytherin line dies off, then would that mean that there would be no longer any parselmouths in existence?

Seers are honestly the oddest ability because if prophecies are something that's not trustworthy or 'legit' a good amount of the time, then how is their ability useful exactly? If divination is a subject then that implies it can be learned but Trelawney was the only one who could make an actual prophecy that did come to fruition. Is it simply that people are afraid of seers and would rather avoid avoid in fear of the unknown or are seers actually gifted with an ability to see into the far future? Trelawney made a prophecy that looked almost 18 years into the future, after all. Again, is it a curse passed on or the aftereffects of a spell? Or is it just an ability that generates itself?

Same for Queenie's ability, legilimency/self-transfiguration/divination all seem to be hard in their respective ways. They are also abilities that could create fear in others. A talented enough metamorphmagus could easily masquerade as a person you know, or can be a dark witch of wizard in disguise. A seer could start reading into your future and predict some awful stuff while someone like Queenie has your entire thoughts laid out to them by just glancing at you, unless you are very talented at occlumency.

Could that mean that there are other abilities out there, just as rare and convenient but also scary for others ?


** I don't think there's a singular origin for all the various magical gifts. /Some/, I think, are definitely the result of ancient wizards who cast enchantments on themselves and found a way to make them carry over to their descendants; Parseltongue, for example. Every Parselmouth is definitely descended from a singular warlock who somehow managed to create hereditary, innate knowledge and implant it into himself. That mage is not necessarily Herpo the Foul, however, let alone Salazar Slytherin; it could go way, /way/ back.

Then, there are others which I would account for as natural magical mutations, of the same sort that caused Veelas and Goblins and so on to split from mankind, but too minor for the people who exhibit them to yet be considered a separate species. I think it fits the evidence very nicely to suppose that magical evolution works along Lamarckian principles, unlike Muggle evolution --- such that a sorcerer's magic, placed in specific circumstances, will change them a bit, and that transformation will carry over to their children's magic.

(The Gift of true Prophecy may be either of those two. Maybe someone once pushed their magic very desperately to know the future, and "broke out" into True Sight; or maybe a very clever ancient prophet invented Prophecy and actively implanted the ability into themselves and their bloodline.)

There are other powers which I like to think are the result of interbreeding --- Metamorphmagi, in my mind, have a very distant Boggart ancestor. Merlin, preferably; in the old legends, one of Merlin's main powers was his shapeshifting, so his being a Metamorphmagus would fit very nicely, and he is also often said to be the son of a demon and a mortal woman --- now, I don't know about you, but a Boggart does sound like the kind of creature that Muggle writings would call a demon.

All that being said, I think people who are talented at Legilimency are just that --- talented at Legilimency --- in a way no different from the fact that Professor Snape is really good at Potions or Lord Voldemort really good at Unforgivables. It's a matter of aptitudes, which doesn't require a more fantastical explanation that Muggles who happen to be unusually good at playing the piano or adding up big numbers.

Why definitely? It's a valid theory, but maybe Parselmouths just have some snake-related magical creatures in their ancestry, like Gorgons or Nagas.

I mean, I suppose it is in /some/ fashion --- magical transmission of linguistic knowledge from one mind to another does seem like it's probably in the same ballpark as a direct mind-to-mind link --- but I don't really see what you mean.

She could have stood to explain Parseltongue a bit more, yes (and the other instances in the books of supernatural multilingualism: Barty Crouch Snr.'s knowledge of 200 languages, for example). But if anything, being artificially granted knowledge of a language seems like it would be more related to /Pensieves/ than to regular Legilimency.

*********** Harry can read his dad's doodles on his OWLs paper when he's in Snape's memory, an impossible detail when Snape isn't even looking up at the room, so whatever the pensieve does, it's way more than just recreating a memory. Why couldn't its magic goo also somehow help translate parseltongue except shitty, like Google.

BUT the Pottermore article kinda proves that paseltongue would theoretically probably be an offshoot of legilimency, because snakes. Do. Not. Speak. They barely vocalise at all. Hissing and spitting can't even produce enough variation to hold a complex conversation in it, and yet both snakes and humans chat away with evolved language skills perfectly similar to English.

So, therefore there should be some kind of telepathy going on to compensate for lack of proper vocalisations, and hence, why parselmouths are able to control snakes as well as understand/speak to them. Paseltongue being so amazing and rare should be precisely BECAUSE it is impossible to learn and is solely a hereditary gift. Same as metamorphmagi and true Seers. Same as magic in witches and wizards. It's all innate - that's an established law of the HP world and it makes more sense that parseltongue follows those rules.

If Dumbledore can understand paseltongue but not speak it, it would instead make complete sense that it's due to his legilimens skills, which requires eye contact and thereby make understanding a basilisk impossible. But if Rowling's intent was that Dumbledore can plain old understand paseltongue then HOW did he not hear the basilisk same as Harry in CoS? Or when Riddle was attacking and killing students the first time? The added "canon" just makes Dumbledore retroactively look like a negligent asshole.

That's what /Muggles/ think, duh. No telepathy is ever hinted at in canon; by all appearances it's just that snakes /can/ modulate their hisses in enough ways to create language. How could a Parseltongue word be used as a password for inanimate objects otherwise? How could Ron speak said word just by repeating the noises he heard Harry make, without any knowledge of Legilimency?

Note that the Brazilian Boa Constrictor is also seen blinking (not to mention being way smarter than a real-life snake would be; that blighter can /read/, or if not read, then at least understand the concept of writing). And, of course, Hedwig does plenty of stuff that real owls couldn't.

But then, Dodo Birds can't become invisible at will, either, and yet: Diricawls.

The Statute of Secrecy hides more than just wizards, it hides /all/ magic. That includes all sorts of animals who are /known/ to Muggles, but possess anomalous, magical capabilities (such as being smarter and more talkative than their anatomy should allow) that Obliviators suppress knowledge of in the Muggle population.

#+end_quote

It is not impossible that Dumbledore learned Parseltongue in the process of researching the Horcruxes, which would mean post-/CoS/. Even then, though, if he understands the language but doesn't speak it, this would presumably mean he has a very beginner's grasp understanding of it; enough to work out the meaning when focusing on it, but not to just randomly pick up that a background hissing noise /is/ Parseltongue. Compare the fact that someone can more or less know Morse code if they concentrate, but wouldn't necessarily notice that a faint ticking noise in a corridor was Morse if their mind was on something else and they had no reason to suspect someone was sending Morse messages.

#+begin_quote
  Or when Riddle was attacking and killing students the first time?

That is /certainly/ too early for him to have learned it; while it /might/ be plausible that he learned it just as part of general magical scholarship, it's infinitely more likely that he learned it later in life so that Voldemort wouldn't have the advantage over him.

** That honestly comes down to the nature of magic I think. Let's look at we know from canon:

1. Magic most commonly occurs in bloodlines, but this is not a constant (squibs and such). Some testimony from Rowling also suggests that muggleborns are descended from squibs or untrained wizards, but that is less confirmed.
2. Magic does not have one form per se - house-elves, goblins, fairies, etc. all have different forms of magic to that exhibited by wizards and witches, but it is still magic nonetheless.
3. Interspecies breeding is possible between both magicals and non-magicals, and further with non-human species as well (though only magical ones). Hagrid's magic resistance and the Delacours beauty also suggests these traits are heritable to at least a few generations.
4. Magical gifts like parseltongue and seers are exceedingly rare, but they also seem to some degree a heritable trait (Trelawney and Teddy Lupin).
5. Additionally, magical curses like the blood malediction (Astoria Greengrass) appear to be heritable through lineage as well (though selectively), but traits like lycanthropy are not (Teddy Lupin, Bill's children).

There are more, but I think this gives a good summation of the evidence.

From the above, we can conclude that the concept of /species/ does not really apply to magical creatures, as that is a muggle definition (perhaps being or beast is more appropriate). Rather, magical talents or disabilities appear to be strongly linked to lineage. However, there appears to be some evidence that the original gifts simply 'appeared' in a few cases, and that many are descended from those initial cases. The question seems to have 1-3 answers (none of which are exclusive)

1. Magical gifts were always present in Wizard/Witches, and the unique trait was simply drawn out due to the qualities of the wizard/witch that gained it. These traits would then be passed down to the descendents, until their magical affinity became so different as to no longer be retained (see Fleur vs. Appolline Delacour).
2. Magical gifts are the result of direct acts of will - this can be either experimentation and modification or through magical interaction from an enemy (its not all Killing Curses for example). The ones that survive would be the ones that do not hamper breeding or even advance likelihood (ex. Metamorphmagi would be kind of tempting).
3. Magical gifts result from the mixing of different beings magics. In ASOIAF for instance, the Starks are said to also be descended from the Children of the Forest, and is the reason they possess such an affinity for warging. Such similar examples could exist in HP as well - or even the reverse (see centaurs or manticores for instance). Take Legilimency for instance - Wampus Cats have a natural legilimency ability as well (like Queenie). Does this mean she is descended from them? Not likely, but it does imply that all magical beings stemmed from a singular source, and thus magic seems to make what would otherwise not work as a relationship possible (see Hagrid's parents for instance).

Just my thoughts.
