You know what I want? I want a more "forgiving" Black family. I want a Black family that are still pureblood supremacists, and that raise Sirius to be one as well. Yes, he's too forward, and reckless, and loud, and not quiet and dignified at all but that's fine, he has his head on straight. And even when Sirius gets sorted into Gryffindor, well, no one is that worried. It even makes sense, once they think about it, and so long as Sirius is upholding the family name it should be fine.

​

Except...Sirius starts to make friends. Sure, making a joke or two with Potter was fine, and he shouldn't look too anti-social in general with his housemates. But at the best, the purebloods can be distant, sometimes polite acquaintances. Someone he can have polite small talk with, as opposed to his family and their friends. But he starts to become friends with them, these blood traitors and halfbloods and mudbloods. And that's when the letters, and the yelling, and the howlers begin to start. And it all culminates on that last day when he sneaks out the front door and decides he's never coming back.

​

Yeah, if you could find something like that for me it would be great.


** It's probably a bad sign that I'm just thinking 'is this not more or less what happened in canon' aside from the yay gryffindor part, isn't it?

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
