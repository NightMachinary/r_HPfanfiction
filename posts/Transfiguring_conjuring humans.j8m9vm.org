** Yes, humans are animals. However, we are the most intelligent living creature on Earth. We are able to reason and all that. Other animals cannot. If it were possible to conjure a human, I'd believe they would be some empty shell because no matter how powerful a wizard could be, I don't think it would be possible for them to recreate a fully functioning human brain. There's no way. It's such a complicated organ and even now, with all the amazing science there is, the scientist hardly have reached the surface of what the brain can fully do. That's the main reason I think conjuring a human being would result in failure.

** Scientifically yes, humans are animals, but magic runs on different rules. For example, food is just a particular kind of organic matter, not substantially different from wood, but the latter can be conjured and not the former. The differences lie in how people /perceive/ things, either due to individual cognitive limitations, collective consensual reality, or magic having a mind of its own.

** Conjured humans or humans transfigured from other things scream unceasingly. The department of mysteries is tasked with finding out why.

For everyone else, it's more than taboo. It's a worrying existential crisis. After all, it's well known that boggarts cannot have conversations, they are entirely unintelligent. Yet, when they form humans, they're known to frequently say things like, "kill me before I draw His attention," or "I've seen Him tearing His way through space and time to devour my soul" despite the fact that boggarts have been proven to not have souls.

One day, Harry decides to heal his parents with transfiguration. Afterwards, he begins noticing their highly unusual behavior patterns.

Oh this could be why necromancy is considered a dark art, not just a creepy branch is animation charms.

*** Who said anything about souls? It doesn't have to /be/ a person, just /seem/ like a person. The Sorting Hat has plenty of personality for being a soulless enchanted hat.

** /Conjuration is OP pls nerf/, now transfiguring a human should be theorically posible but extremely harder as a human brain alone is a complicated affair and there should be a ban based on Ethical issues as well.
