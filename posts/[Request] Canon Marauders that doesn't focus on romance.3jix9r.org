Looking for a canon Marauders fic with a similar feel to the original series. More focus on mystery than on romance or cute friendship stuff. Also, no Snape-bashing. (OK if characters hate Snape in-universe, but not OK with authors who blatantly hate the character). Can be Hogwarts or post-Hogwarts. Maturity rating doesn't matter.

I haven't read a lot of fanfic, so feel free to rec stuff that is generally well-known, because I probably haven't heard of it. Thanks!


** I finally got to read linkffn(Against the Moon by Stoplight Delight) today. It's much better then other Marauders fics I came across, and very well written, but has slight problems with characterization and lots of filler.

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to realize there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.

*** Can't recommend this one enough. I don't know if I would agree about the characterization but it's definitely a long fic. I think it's roughly as long as the first 5 HP books, and the characters are still in 3rd year.

*** Agreed. My biggest complaint is the detail for each transformation. I know it hurts, but I think it can be said with less words after a few months have passed. However, it seems like the author suffers from some chronic condition, so he/she may be speaking from the heart. Dunno, still one of my favorite stories.

Have you gotten to chapter 49 yet? I think that chapter alone is the reason to read the story. Still get chills thinking about it.

** life and times is hands down the best marauders fic, it's got a bit of romance to it, but i can't emphasize how much it's worth reading

unfinished but i have faith that it eventually will be

** I rarely read canon Marauders because.. well we all know how it ends, D: But this was one of those most recc'ed fics (I read this months ago, so I don't really remember where I found the rec), and I decided to give it a try.

Be All My Secrets Remembered by La Reine Noir [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/la_reine_noire/BAMSR.html]]

Hands down one of the most beautifully written fics I've ever read. The setting starts in May 1976, and counts down to November 1, 1981. It's not 'Mystery', but more of the author filling in what happened between those dates.

I love it because all the characters are portrayed very realistically to me. A lot of fics show people as either really good or really evil, but this one just shows them as... humans.

TL;DR I don't think I can say enough about this fic. In fact, I'm kind of hoping someone who's read this (or you OP) will start a sub-thread from this comment so I'll finally have someone to gush over this fic with.

** Against the Moon should keep you occupied for a few days, but here are some more Marauder stories. I haven't read all of them, but these seem to be the most recommended. I have read TLAT, and it is another absolute favorite of mine. It does focus a lot on the developing relationship between James/Lily (they haven't actually gotten together yet in 36 chapters), but it switches POV and there are a lot of Marauder shenanigans. Enjoy!

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

  This is the story of four boys. This is the story of how these four boys came to know each other, of how they became friends. This is the story of their unbreakable bond that could survive any test. This is a story that will ultimately end in tragedy.

  Match. by mental Ze Meridian has a serious problem: despite the skirt, everyone seems to think she's a boy. Desperate to prove that having short hair, a bloke for a best friend, and a serious obsession with sport does not mean she's *full summary inside*
