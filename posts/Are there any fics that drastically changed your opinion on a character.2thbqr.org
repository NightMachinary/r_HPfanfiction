Maybe drastically is too strong a word. But sometimes you read a fic where the characterization is so well done that it changes your opinion on a character.

I didn't dislike canon Ron, but I didn't really "get" him until I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1316097/Pinky-Brown][Pinky Brown]]'s stuff.


** I have a strange relationship with Ginny. I didn't mind her when I read the series - she seemed strong in a way that matched up well with Harry - but I didn't think she was an amazing character or anything.

Then I started reading fanfiction, specifically stories featuring Love Potion Ginny - basically, the fanon version of her that's somehow developed the attributes she specifically /didn't/ have in canon: whiny, clingy, obsessed with Harry (past the age of 13 or so), and manipulative to the point of actively (magically) subverting/destroying people's relationships to get what she wants.

A bit of that fanon bias seeped into my conception of her. Thankfully, as I've read more and more fanfiction, I've come all the way back around to where I started: wanting to find fics that can nail the style, tone, and characters of canon.

These four fics were instrumental in developing (redeveloping, actually), my idea of Ginny:

** This one isn't necessarily a fic. Maybe like a one shot but it was posted on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] I think. It was about Petunia and what if she had taken Harry in. I'm listening to Harry Potter on audio books at work and that drastically made me reconsider Petunia, even though it was not canon. I'm on mobile or I'd post the link.

** After reading most of the Prince of the Dark Kingdom, I liked Voldemort a lot more. He seems like a far smarter, and as others have said, three-dimensional character in that fic. It was great.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][*Prince of the Dark Kingdom*]] - /Ten years ago, Voldemort created his kingdom. Now a confused young wizard stumbles into it, and carves out a destiny. AU. Nondark Harry. MentorVoldemort./

 

Reading other fics - particularly Santi's Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, along with many other fics on DLP, have made me realize how completely clueless, unintelligent, and unambitious Harry was in canon. Santi's TBWL is a great fic, and so are others on the DLP forums.

*Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][(Ch 1-12 FFN)]] [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021&page=2][(Ch 13-17 DLP)]]* - /Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story./

 

And lastly, all the fics on my [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L42j8DtQjwikqv0ggbwA-W25Ccl77V1E2nO96fThTyI/edit?usp=sharing][*review list*]] have formed a lasting impression on me, as well as all the fics in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5409855/xvector][*my favorites*]], which I plan to do a comprehensive review of in my review list.

***** I agree up to Hogwarts, then there isn't any James Potter or Marauders and literally everything Snape does is with the best of intentions, his fight with Lily is a misunderstanding and he even has a truce with the marauders by the end of school. Even his Death Eater stuff is totally innocuous and he's just this poor misunderstood person with no hint of badness in him.

****** I do remember disliking the end of the fic and my memories of it that I think of are more his childhood and post-light side transition so I might be blocking it out. It's been a couple of years and hundreds of pics.

** I've got two that really changed my view of a character.

So [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince Of The Dark Kingdom]] has to go down as the best Voldemort in fanfiction, and for a reason. The character is three dimensional, interesting, and yet very true to form. He's a much more /real/ character than what JKR managed to put onto paper. At the very least, he isn't certifiably fucking insane like every other fic makes him out to be.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833][Meaning Of One]] really changed my view of Ginny as well. Now, I fucking /hated/ that character before this fic. I still don't really like her all that much. And even though this is very AU (it's a soul bond story for fucks sake), it feels like Sovran got Ginny down pat, in a way that actually made her likable.
