** That's totally my jam. Have you read linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12323580/1/Intended]]), linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12315670/1/Healing-Hermione]]) or linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307886/1/Strange-Reflections]])? They have somewhat similar themes.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10536445/1/The-Lily-Potter-Foundation]]) has a little bit of it - I think. Especially getting along with her parents if I remember right.

There's really not that many fics that I can think of right now, even though I probably like Ron and Hermione breaking up even more than Harry and Hermione getting together (I think most authors prefer to focus on the positivity, probably rightfully so, and just don't have Ron/Hermione in the first place). Most of this can probably found in Ron bashing fics
