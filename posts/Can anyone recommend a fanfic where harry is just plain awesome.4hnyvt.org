First fanfic that got me into this stuff was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies]], which was a very fun read for me. But I don't see it mentioned much here, I wonder why. I also really enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][a Black comedy]].

I've been reading a bunch of fanfics that come recommended here, but a lot of them are very dark and grim, and while they're certainly very good, I could do with something a little less dark and a little more awesome/funny/cool.

Got any ideas?

Completed Awesome Harry fics:

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11580650/1/Abraxas][Abraxas]]*, linkffn(11580650): that Harry and Ginny were just super awesome, but the ending was very dark with only a glimmer of hope.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5251301/1/A-Second-Chance][A Second Chance]]*, linkffn(5251301): time travel by ALL Ministry Six, needless to say, they were quite overpowered.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]]*, linkffn(6989327): postwar dimensional travel story, powerful Trio and Ginny.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]*, linkffn(5511855): cunning, powerful, smart Harry and Bellatrix, more so in the 2nd half.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5648259/1/Elemental-Harry][Elemental Harry]]*, linkffn(5648259): another super Harry/Ginny story, well written, but in first person mode.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die][Gryffindors Never Die]]*, linkffn(6452481): Harry/Ron time travel back to year 4. They acted out quite a bit.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8286141/1/Harry-Potter-Death-s-Ultimatum][Harry Potter & Death's Ultimatum]]*, linkffn(8286141): abandoned by both Ron and Hermione in the tent, Harry went on a lone crusade, with vastly better outcomes.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10132530/1/His-Mother-s-Love][His Mother's Love]]*, linkffn(10132530): Harry bullied all the answers from Dumbledore during his first 'private lesson' in year 6. He and his friends planned accordingly, for another vastly better outcomes.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]]*, linkffn(4655545): as the result of a very brutal war, Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan all became very disturbed. When Hermione found a way to send their memories and powers back 20 years, they unleashed hell upon their enemies. Dark humors.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]*, linkffn(10493620): Harrymort was just too awesome and hilarious.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]]*, linkffn(5604382): Harry and his girls were both smart and powerful, and their worst 'enemy' turned out to be Molly.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]]*, linkffn(11858167): Why Harry decided to become a dark lord after Voldemort's fall. A little bit dark, but not overly so.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]]*, linkffn(7405516): another time travel to 1991, but with the whole Trio. Needless to say, they were awesome.

***** Delenda est is well written, good dialogue and decent characterisation. Seventh horcrux is good as a crack-fic.

Anything that reads poorly does not pass well with me- Take 'we are the golden trio', and almost every re-do fic. Harry's response to going back in time is so underplayed, he acts completely irrationally, and in the aforementioned fic, you get poor dialogue like

"Please tell me you remember the next 15 years"

"I do Hermione Weasley!" said Harry smiling in relief.

Read it out out. Who the fuck talks like that.

'Harry couldn't believe it, baby Rose was here, and her Mummy and Daddy were 11-year-old virgins.'

What kind of rubbish writing is this?

You also get contrived plots- "Emit ni ogl lah su oyer ehw tube rau oye rehw ton woshi", as a 'Mirror of Emit'.

I don't even think a comment is necessary on that.

However, in the end, a lot of people do enjoy really poorly written fics, and the standard of fics is incredibly low. They're often written by teenagers, and I am not saying teenagers are incapable of writing, but often it is so. But really, if you do enjoy it, read it, nothings stopping you. But I am also going to give my opinion on recommendation of horrible fics as I feel like many readers agree with me, and someone commenting on this post would have saved me many a cringe.

** linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) has this in spades. However, more than just plain combat, which can be nice at times, this also has manipulation, tactics, strategies, and moments of triumph delivered with a single word, rather than a fight.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** I guess "awesome" is relative but i really liked these two:

linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool)

It is pretty dark i guess. I depends on what other fics you've read and what you personally consider dark. It has some very fluffly moments but also some incredibly sad ones. Harry is definitely awesome though.

Then there's linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero). It's pretty well known by now. It sounds like a crack fic at first but it's really not. It's one of the best Drama's i've read in recent memory.

It's certainly not the usual awesome badass Harry but he does some really, really cool things with Divination. I guess this story really doesn't fit your requirements but i thought a different perspective on what the definition of "awesome" can be couldn't hurt.

(As you can probably tell i have a thing for dimension travel and Honks but i just can't help it. I just think Tonks deserves better than Remus Lupin :D)

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Immortality is a hell of a lot less fun than it sounds, especially when all you want is to be left alone but your conscience won't let you. Harry Potter and his usual bipolar luck live on into the 22nd century, his saving-people-thing meshing nicely with the galaxy's pressing need for a hero. Rated M for unrepentant coarse language, innuendo, and eventual sexy shenanigans
