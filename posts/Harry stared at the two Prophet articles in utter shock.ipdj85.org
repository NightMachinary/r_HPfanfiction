He blinked unable to believe eyes; HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY ALBUS DUMBLEDORE RETIRES! AUGUSTUS OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE NAMES MUGGLEBORN AS HEIR! The second dated to November 2nd 1981 was even more impossible to wrap his brain around “IMPERIAL HEIR LILY EVANS POTTER MURDERED DAYS BEFORE CORONATION!”

Harry put the papers down staring at the old man in front of him.

“Harry” Professor Dumbledore smiled kindly, “you've passed every test I've set before you. Would you like to take the next step?”

**** Now that's an interesting prompt: Harry Potter and the Ides of March

Harry uses his post-war fame and influence to start reforming the Ministry but the seniors who prefer the pre-Voldemort status quo assassinate him. Ron and Hermione hold an "evil that men do" sort of speech to incite the population and thus the trio ends up on the chocolate frog cards as having reformed the Ministry.

** My plot will be somewhat different and not cracky at all:

The trio Octavian/Agrippa/Maecenas was probably the only instance in world history in which a group of teenagers overthrew an existing government and proceeded to build a lasting order of their own.

Even more interesting, Octavian lost his birthfather at age 4, and his stepfather basically didn't want to have anything to do with him, so he became effectively orphaned. After he began attending a private school, he made life long friends with Marcus Agrippa and Gaius Maecenas. Later, his wife Livia Drusilla would rise in prominence and gain in influence.

In my version, things will of course not be completely analogous to Roman history, but knowledgable readers can definitely identify the patterns. I expect characters to be mapped in following ways:

Harry - Octavian

Hermione - Marcus Agrippa

Ron - Gaius Maecenas

Ginny - Livia Drusilla

Dumbledore - Caesar

Voldemort - Pompey Magnus

Kingsley - Mark Anthony

Snape - Brutus

Dora Tonks - Octavia

In this version of AU, the line between good and evil was far more murky. The real Voldemort was nothing like described in the Books. He neither looked like a snake nor did he mutilate his own soul (although he did perform several dark rituals to increase his magical power).

Although he fought for a cause that might appear archaic to the modern Muggle world, it nevertheless made some sense in the Magical World (one major point of the conflict was the governing structure of Magical Britain. Voldemort favored the traditional oligarchy in which 'Old Families' called the shots, while Dumbledore wanted to turn MoM into a centralized modern government. The boiling point was reached when Dumbledore tried to pass a law that slapped enormous inheritance tax as a mean to weaken the 'Old Families'.)

Tom Riddle had been teaching DADA from 1957 to 1968 when he resigned the post in protest. The war began in earnest when MoM tried to arrest him for his almost militant opposition to the Inheritance Tax in 1971. From then on, he adopted the mantle 'Lord Voldemort' as he completed a very important power boosting ritual.

Voldemort inspired loyalty not through wantonly torturing his followers, as the Books fondly depicted, but through persuasion, protection, and true leadership. He was also very protective of his loyal members, and went to great length to extract retributions for their sufferings.

His tactics were brutal and ruthless, but so were his enemies that were supposed to be on the 'right side on history'. Both sides did commit their shares of atrocities, as was generally the case in a civil war.

But in the end, despite defeating his arch rival Albus Dumbledore in a decisive engagement, Voldemort underestimated the cunning and ruthlessness of the young Trio, walked into their traps, and was killed.

After his death, the winners instituted systematic purges in Magical Britain, and silenced most critics. I've not decided yet whether to have Harry and Kingsley fight each other out, but given how ambitious and ruthless this Trio is, I'm inclined to have a repeat of ancient Roman history. Ginny would then play a very important role during this second stage of power struggle.

*** Augustus became the title of western emperors towards the middle-end period of the western Roman Empire. If you look at their names you'll find they all end with Augustus.

Edit: so he'd be Albus Percival Wulfic Brian (last name/cog nomen) Augustus
