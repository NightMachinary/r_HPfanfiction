  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

*** Pretty much. I don't remember much of him from actual cannon. And he is always like this in ff. Just curious if he didn't get the short end of the stick ever.

**** Well in Canon he was not a death eater, however he did serve the new regime and escorted mugglebirns to Azkaban.

He did get all outstandings on his newts so he is at least academically smart.

However besides that he's pretty incompetent. He's noted to be highly susceptible to the confundus. He attempted to go for to toe with Dumbledore twice, got knocked out by hagrid, got the tables turned on him by an unarmed muggle born while escorting him to prison, and got his butt handed to him by a grandma (Augusta longbottom)

So...

***** Devils advocate here. What if he was a double agent and his acting incompetent was Alla charade.

****** That could be an interesting fic idea: Dawlish and Percy rescuing muggleborns through bureaucratic shenanigans and fake incompetence.
