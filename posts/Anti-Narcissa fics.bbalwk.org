I really hate the whole " she loved her son so she's a saint " bullshit. I doubt she cared about all the Muggle women whose children were Kissed or even about her own niece's death and it affects her sister. She's a complete hypocrite in my eyes .


** Personally I find her best characterizations being where she is unrepentantly prejudiced but loves her son and so is not without redeeming characteristics. Alternatively, theres also the occasional stories where shes just follows the political norms.

****** Which are? Unless she went and murdered baby in their sleep, Canon shows more of a passive compliance than active involvement.

Of course she is a blood purist and would not cry any dead mudblood, but apart from letting the Damn Lord living in her house with his escaped followers, not transmiting informations to Auror and later taking part in the battle, she did not do much.

In a normal case, it would be more than enough for a trial and maybe some prison sentence, but in a situation like Harry Potter where 95% of the society showed passive compliance, the government itself organized muggleborn arrest and the Dementor (the only magical deterent other than fines) switched to Voldemort, I can understand her leaving free or with just something like a house arrest.

******** I'm not sure why you are downvoted. It is a conspiracy for the premeditated killing of a human, aka "conspiracy to murder".

In my country being a knowing and willing participant in a conspiracy to commit a crime is almost equal to commit the crime. And in this case Narcissa wasn't only knowing, she was seemingly instrumental in convincing Snape to kill someone.

If this ever came out, she would be guilty of murder.

No matter how you look at this: Starfox is right, she is far from innocent.

**** I mean, there is the whole Snape debacle as well; the series is not exactly known for its fair and accountable justice system.

Actually, now that I think about it, their situations are fairly similar. Both seem to be perfectly happy with Voldemort's goals and methods until it appears that he will kill somebody they love. Then they turn traitor to try and protect that person and are spared from jail time based on the word of the hero of the day. Narcissa probably gets more of a pass because her love for Draco is less creepy and obsessive than Snape's love for Lily, and because fanon has turned her into the ultimate MILF.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
