As the title suggests, this would have a similar storyline to the Injustice Among Us where the Golden Trio along with the other heroes of the Wizarding War are summoned to another world by Neville Longbottom to seek their help in defeating their world's version of Harry Potter who has become dictator-like Injustice Superman. Bonus points if it is Dumbledore instead who has gone off the rails due a massive tragedy.

** Why have canon timeline travel to another one? You can tell the story entirely in AU.

A Slytherin kills Lily Luna and Harry goes "Let's use the Ministry to control Slytherin and these pureblood fuckers once and for all!" And Ron says no mate, chill.

The Order and the very Weasleys break...

Harry, Ginny, James Sirius, Hermione, George, Charlie, Kingsley, Slughorn... On one side

Ron, Rose, Hugo, Albus, Scorpius, Draco, Bill, McGonagall, Percy... On the other

(Hermione could end on the other side/switch places.. but kind of need her to help Harry take immediate control of the Ministry)

*** Canon traveling to the injustice universe is kind of the entire plot of Injustice. So i was basing it off that. Your idea is however awesome too!

** Will this even work?

Part of why Injustice works is because Superman is the most powerful being on his earth. And his army consists of people as powerful as him who can destroy the world on their own. While the rest of population don't have any powers, so they fear him.

Harry's situation on the other hand is very different. He can use magic, so can any other wizard. He's good at dueling, so is every other auror. He doesn't have some special power that puts him above the other wizards.

Also unlike the DC universe population, all of the wizarding world uses the same power as him, magic. So why would they listen to him/fear him.
