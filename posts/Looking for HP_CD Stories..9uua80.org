* Looking for good Harry Potter/Cedric Diggory Fanfiction? Can be slash or Fem! Harry. I would prefer complete stories or current updated ones.

** Ooh, my favorite! My favorites are Paranoia and Puns ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14016627]]) and Two Can Play For Hogwarts ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4593252]]) Paranoia isn't finished, but I'm still crossing my fingers for the last chapter. The Love So Green series ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/36714]]) is popular, although I never finished it myself. Pretty sure I have another fic link somewhere, but I can't find it right now. Have fun!

Edit: Found the missing one! because he strayed across the path ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8517286]]). Her other Cedric/Harry is more of a Cedric character study, but is also really good. Most of her stuff is really good, she should get more popularity here.

** I initially misread this as DM/CD stories, and now I'm very intrigued. So--- anyone read any Draco/Cedric romance? I would love to see it!
