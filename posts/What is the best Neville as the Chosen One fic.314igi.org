** Idk if this technically counts as a fic, but it was posted on here from tumblr the other day and I thought it was the most realistic take on Neville as the boy who lived I've seen. It was pretty cool to see the author's take on both Neville and Harry in that world. [[http://ink-splotch.tumblr.com/post/112332424299/have-you-ever-thought-about-writing-a-fic-in-which]]

** u/__Pers:
#+begin_quote
  so no slash H/Hr, etc
#+end_quote

H/HR is slash? That's taking the Herman thing a bit far.

I'd say the best out there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/980211/enembee][enembee]]'s WIP Conlaodh's Song trilogy (two complete books so far). It also has the best mentor Dumbledore I know of in fanfiction.

Edit: drag and drop fix

**** Fair point.

For some reason, most non-slash Neville-as-BWL stories (e.g., Kwan Li's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]], bobsaqqara's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2477819/1/Lily-Potter-and-the-Worst-Holiday][Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday]]) seem to be H/Hr.

***** To be fair - Neville as BWL removes the obstacle of Harry unable to be with Hermione as it would splinter the trio. For whatever reason, most Neville OBWL replaces Harry with Neville in the trio. With that in mind, it is acceptable for Hermione to be with Harry since he is outside of the trio.

Those are my thoughts, anyway.

***** Is the first one any good? I like /Hogwarts Battle School/, but the H/Hr here makes me wary. Does it include Hermione glorification/Harry pussification, Weasley bashing or glorification of muggle govt/Wizard bashing in any form?

****** None of those tropes are used. If anything, the Muggles get crushed pretty handily and would be completely overrun without a few plucky Wizards to save their bacon.

On balance, I'd say it's pretty darned good ([[/u/KwanLi]] being too modest to say otherwise) and is one of the stories I go back and reread when I have an afternoon to kill. There's a reason I promote it as often as I do.

My only (minor) issue is that it veers into grimdark territory in the second half of the tale. With the shift in tone and concomitant time-skip, it probably would have been better written as two novels, not one large one.

****** It doesn't have any of those tropes.

But I wouldn't go so far as to say it's good.

******* Ah, thanks. I'll probably give it a shot anyway -- I'm out of decent fanfics to read and have a few hours to kill.

That said, could you please point me to a few good H/Hr stories without any of the above tropes? I have read a couple of H/Hr that were decent (/The Golden age/, /A Boy and his Cloak/), but none truly /good/.

I would prefer non-Romance stories. Also, no Lorien. I am not a fan of his/her writing style.

******** Hmm. An H/Hr fic without /any/ of the tropes that also doesn't have a heavy romantic overlay. Unfortunately, most H/Hr writers tend to pour the H/Hr part heavily.

Most of my favorites are actually not H/Hr stories but I'll stop by later when I get home and drop some fics hopefully.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5866937/1/Control][Control]] is probably the best example of this. Its Dark!Harry and Slytherin!Harry with absolutely no H/Hr (there have been hints of H/Tonks). Harry is utterly OOC, but the opening sequence is the best I've ever read, and drags you into the fic in no time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10511318/1/Just-Another-Orphan][Just Another Orphan]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10724650/1/Death-Before-Dishonour][Death Before Dishonor]] are two recent fics of this type, but neither have progressed much beyond interesting starts.
