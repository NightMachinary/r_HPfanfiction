Tonks? I'm just curious if we know many people that was the 'pre' HP generation. The age of some of the canon characters are pretty confusing. I know I've seen Tonks/Charlie a lot, so I assume they are close in age. Who else was in their year or close to it?


** Definitely Tonks. I imagine there's some Order members in their mid twenties in the books, but it's not clear who. You could definitely make a case for various people if you wanted to write it in a fan fic, though. I'm sure there's a couple of aurors who could be said to be in their mid-twenties.

** Charlie Weasley went to Hogwarts between 1983 and 1991, graduating the year before Harry entered. Therefore, everyone above Harry (Cedric, Cho etc.) would have been in the at Hogwarts at the right time. For the purposes of this, I am only including people within three years of Charlie, as those are the only people he could have reasonably interacted with.

- Most of the members of the Weird Sisters (Myron Wagtail, Kirley Durke, Heathcote Barbary, Herman Wintringham and Gideon Crumb)
- Bill Weasley
- Nymphadora Tonks
- Stan Shunpike
- Percy Weasley
- Gwenog Jones (?)

Charlie was also on the Quidditch Team with Oliver Wood, Angelina Johnson, Alicia Spinnet, and Fred and George Weasley.

*** Thank you! :D most of the ones Harry knew, however, would have been 1st or 2nd years, I think.

** Well iirc Charlie graduated just before Harry entered. So anyone that attended Hogwarts and born between 1867 and 1879 or something like that.

** Quirrell would have been teaching muggle studies during Charlie and Bill's time at Hogwarts. But there's also a possibility he may have been a student before that, but also during their years there.

Edward Worple was class of 88 Gwenog Jones was class of 86

There are tons of Weird Sisters members, seriously it's a big group, and most of them went to school with Charlie and Bill. I've always though Bill must've been friends with them and gotten his fashion sense hanging around the future band members.

** OC's. There really aren't very many characters in HP canon.
