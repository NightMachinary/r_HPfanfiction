I see this mentioned as a cliche on every almost every thread that mentions animagi, but as of now I have found a grand total of /zero/ good stories that have a character with a dragon animagus. Now, funnily enough, I /do/ know three fics where a /dragon/ becomes a /human/ animagus, but that's not what everyone's talking about, is it?

List of dragons with human forms:

** There's Harry is a dragon and that's okay. Harry isn't a dragon animagus he actually is a dragon but it's a pretty funny fic. Never finished it though, so I don't know what happens in the story.

In Friend Since Birth by GwynGriffin has a dragon animagus OC. WIP and so far it has had Molly/Albus bashing (not Ron though) so it might not be your cup of tea. linkao3(friend since birth)

  [Development Hell] Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi

  Harry finds a dying ashen haired girl in his backyard being attacked by men in skeleton armor. He obviously swoops in and kills them saving the girl before taking her to his home to heal her. He didn't know the far reaching consequences this would have on him personally. This will start in Harry Potter world but ultimately take place in the Witcher for the most part.

** If You Can Help Her: linkffn(2788096)

Decent, if kind of cliché Harry/Ginny soulbond fic. They each have a big-cat animagus form (panther and lion IIRC), and can combine into a dragon because soulbonds.

Warning for kinda cringey poetry as well.

PS. I think half the time someone mentions "Dragon animagus" it's in the context of "Indications that you're reading a badfic". It /can/ be done well, but it rarely is.

** Well the first part is that "good" is always in the eye of the beholder. So obviously what i consider "good" you may hate.

Now as the previous commenter mentioned you have Dragon Child by Kirkmenistan

linkffn(527)

You also have the WIP called Harry Potter: Unexpected Animagus by DWDuck. Now it looked abandoned but thanks to the quarantine the author made an update to it. After the first task Harry becomes an animagus whose form is a red Elder Dragon.

linkffa(527) linkffa(834)

Now while the description is pretty poor at this point in 67K words there has been no sex in the story. There's been some innuendo and a little flashing but nothing explicit (eg no intercourse or even petting). Which is definitely not what the description lends you to think.

I don't immediately discount a story because it Bashes a character. The question is how extreme does it get, and does it actually flow within the premise of the story. If it flows within the story it doesn't bother me, but I realize that others feel differently.

Which of course, makes offering recommendations chancey.

***** I don't actually care if there's mature content, although it doesn't interest me. The thing that makes that description icky is the sexism. Like, that's a whole character, yeah? But she gets reduced down to a ‘good woman' ... like, just naming her would be sufficient. Bashing, on the other hand, I don't really have an opinion about on its own. However, it is usually a clue as to what the story's quality is, and sexism plus bashing is not a good combination.
