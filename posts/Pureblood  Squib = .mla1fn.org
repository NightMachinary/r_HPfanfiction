I created a character called Jane Heavens, but I don´t know her blood status. Her parents are Eveni and Ethan Heavens

Her mother is from the Filliester family, a family member of the sacred 28 (sacred 30 in my AU) so Eveni is a pureblood

Ethan is a member of another family os the sacred 30, but he is a squib.

Jane is a pureblood because both Eveni and Ethan are purebloods, but she may be a half-blood bacause only Eveni is magic.

So, what´s her blood status?


** Eveni might likely be considered a blood traitor, but as long as Jane can do magic and all four of her grandparents could do magic I reckon she would be counted as a pureblood. This is helped by the fact that she's not the daughter of some new halfblood or muggle born family, she's still a part of the sacred 28 (/30) pureblood families. If another pureblood wanted to insult her they might call her ‘daughter of a squib' or ‘daughter of a blood traitor' or 'half squib' or something.

*** Eveni is a blood traitor. The Filliesters and Heavens respect muggles and muggleborns.

** half-blood.

- Whatever has four magical grandparents ... pureblood
- Whatever doesn't have any magical parents ... Muggle-born or Muggle
- Whatever has magical parents but no magic of their own ... Squib
- Everything else ... half-blood.

*** Huh, I didn't know one could have four biological parents. But more seriously, since the OC would have four magical grandparents (four pure-blood grandparents at that) she would be considered pure-blood by pretty much everyone.

** pureblood but a blood traitor. Regardless of her father being a squib, he still comes from a pureblood family and all 4 of her grandparents are pureblood.
