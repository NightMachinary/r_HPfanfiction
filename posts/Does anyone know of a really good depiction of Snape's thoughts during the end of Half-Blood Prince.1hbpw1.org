Spoilers, obviously.

I'd like to see Dumbledore's death from Snape's perspective, and was wondering if anyone knows of a well written fic around that. I'd like to see how people have written his thoughts, but I haven't been able to find much. Got any recommendations?


** Have you read A Difference In the Family? It covers all of Snape's life in extremely good detail.

*** I just wanted to say, thanks for this recommendation. I've barely started (as the chapters are quite long), and I'm really enjoying it. It's well written, and the characters all feel so alive. Thank you very much.

**** You're very welcome. It's a lovely fic, isn't it? Warning though, there are teary parts.

***** I'm sure there will be, I can just see them coming. I've only gotten as far as Lilly and Snape seeing the letter Petunia sent to Dumbledore, but I already love it.

As someone with a fondness for space, I love Snape's interest in the Apollo program.
