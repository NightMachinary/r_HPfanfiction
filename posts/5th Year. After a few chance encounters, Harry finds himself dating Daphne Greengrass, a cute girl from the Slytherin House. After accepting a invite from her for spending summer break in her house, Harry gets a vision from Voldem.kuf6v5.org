** "He sent me a vision of Daphne torturing some poor bugger downstairs in the dining room." He blinked. "What?"

Ha arched an eyebrow at Astoria, who was sitting cross-legged on Daphne's bed, a quirky smile on her lips. "Uh-huh."

"Well, unless she's doing more than putting together our roast beef sandwiches, and unless she has a time turner, and unless she's done something to damper sound--"

"I get it, Harry." Astoria was doing the best she could to not crack up in laughter.

Moments later, the visage of an angel walked through her own bedroom's threshold: on seeing Astoria with tears of mirth in her eyes and Harry smiling at her with that damn smile of his (her heart did not skip a beat, thank you very much!), she tilted her head to the side. "What did I miss?"

Astoria lost it.

**** Nope. Just like with the canonical Sirius vision, it's all bull on Voldemort's part. Thing is, he had no idea that Harry was chilling with Astoria and Daphne in their home, while the latter was supposedly torturing some poor schmuck downstairs in said home, lol.

** I like it. Though, I think it'll be more interesting if he was at Greengrass manor when he gets the vision. Then, it can be some sort of horror show (like Coraline) where he is playing a game with the family while trying to escape. They ask if he is hungry, Harry says he already ate. Harry asks for some floo powder to let Sirius know he is ok. They say they ran out. Etcetera, etcetera...

Pretty soon Harry climbs out the bathroom window and makes a break for the manor gates. The Greengrass house elves find out and form a human barricade at the gates while the Greengrass family chases behind him.

****** I thought it was insinuating that it was her parents but as voldemort only called them by "greengrass" so it was unknown which greengrass it was

******* Completely reasonable, besides prompts are meant to be taken in as the reader interprets them. So I suppose there is no right or wrong interpretation.
