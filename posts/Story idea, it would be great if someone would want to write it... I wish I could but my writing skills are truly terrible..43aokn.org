Snape turns out to be Harrys father

Snape still hates him

Harry lashes out at snape early on and snape comes down on him >hard<.

Snape ignores dumbledoors pleas to be nice to harry (snape sees harry as a direct result of a betrayal from lily. Dumbledore can do nothing because snape over rules him)

Snape removes harry from dumbledores maipulations (by threatening him with pulling harry from Hogwarts) (on going arguments between snape and doubledore throughout)

Harry resents Snape (harry is still loyal to dumbledore at this point) and is scared of him but like many children who dont have parents he wants one and he will keep trying, hoping one day he will be happy.

Snape is strict and punishes harry for the smallest thing (snape wants to make him as miserable as possible).

Harry strives to get better grades because hes afraid of snape and he feels like the only way to calm snape down is to do what he wants

In the beginning he fails horribly -- Snape punishes him

He tries harder, Hermione helps him improve.

Snape takes great pleasure in explaining to harry how Dumbledore manipulated him.

Harry now feels he has nowhere at all to turn (snape hates him and Dumbledore was planning for him to die)

Snape is very formal and despises how casual and naÃ¯ve harry his.

He starts teaching him manners and traditions, all the time sneering at how useless Harry is.

Harry learns the traditions and little by little snape starts to be less mean when he sees harry is making an effort

Snape very slowly starts seeing that harry is applying himself in his studies and starts to revaluate him slowly

Dumbledore starts being more of a pest, snape has to take legal action against him to make him back off

I'm not sure how to end it really and how to go about defeating Voldemort. I'm sure someone more creative than me has some ideas. I just hate how every Snape is Harry's father fic gets mushy within 1 chapter. I want realism! Hate is not something that disappears easily and Snape hates Harry with a passion.

*** Do you mean in cannon?

All the usual reasons, but I think the actual hate comes from Harry being the reason Lily died (prophecy).

**** i don't think that's why hates harry in canon. it's bc he projects his hatred of james onto him. he'd likely dote on his own kid in this premise, since he's all about repping his own team. (slytherin)

***** I definitely disagree. Snaps hated James yes, but he hated loosing Lily's friendship more. Also concider that lily died because of his actions which left him less then a shell of a man. He dident really believe in the lights cause, he turned to dumbledore because he believed that dumbledore could give him what he wanted (Lily's safety). Shape is a very selfish man (not caring if Harry and James survived) and only cared about his own interests. Lily was the only one who showed him kindness. When she ended their friendship he turned dark, when she died he turned empty, bitter and hateful towards the reason she died (Himself and Harry).

** Firstly, as others have said, if you feel passionately for an idea, give it a go at writing it yourself. If you really just want something to read, next time try it as a request, not as a story prompt. Your prompt is also rather poorly worded. Check out any of the many sites with have idea prompts for FF and look at those prompts which get answered. The best prompts are either short (a single sentence) which gives the author lots of room to put their own ideas in, or much more detailed, exploring a /unique/ idea.

The main problem is that nothing in your prompt seems terribly original and different, Snape being Harry's father is a common story type, often called [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Severitus_%28trope%29][Severitus]]. These stories tend to have a few common tropes... one is Snape using corporal punishment as a disciplining action (which is what I think you mean when you say "comes down on him hard"). Sometimes, Snape treats all his students in Slytherin like this, sometimes just Harry and Draco, and sometimes just Harry. Most of the stories that /don't/ use this will still deal with it, often with Snape stating he will never become like his own father and hit a child.

You say your problem is that you find Snape too easily loves Harry, when he should hate him. As others have mentioned, removing James as Harry's father removes one of, if not the, greatest reasons as to why Snape treats Harry poorly. If you don't think this is the case, you need to develop a reason why Snape hates Harry yourself. For example, many stories make Lily seeking out Snape in other to have sex as James is infertile and either obliviating Snape after, or making it clear the sex meant nothing. In this situation, Snape /would/ feel angry at first after finding out Harry is his, and it would be in character for him to take this out on Harry. The trick is to have the characters changing and evolving. But if don't work at it, Snape will come across as not worth Harry's regard at all, and as the audience of Severitus is reading for the express purpose to see Snape as Harry's father, having Harry logically reject this will simply put off your readers.

*** sneep himself is a niche interest, severitus is a niche interest within that. harry also seems pretty broken down in this premise, which doesn't align with his canon personality and wouldn't be greeted warmly by this sub, which seems to have a preference for self-insert male power fantasy-harry

**** To be honest, as much as I enjoy super-power Harry its just all so unrealistic (I guess most fanfiction is tho). When I sit around on a rainy day and think about it I can never imagine the story turning out as it actually did in cannon. Someone who has a tough home life does not suddenly act all fine when moved to a different location. Kids would have bullied him about his clothes regardless of his fame, since kids are cruel. Also, to someone who was told magic dosent exist, that he was a worthless freak etc then one would have thought that magic would be the greatest thing ever, and he would have made an effort to learn it.

*** Ignore them. It's your story, it's something you want to see, there WILL be other people out there who like it too.

You say your writing skills aren't great, but isn't this the perfect opportunity to improve them? Isn't this your chance to develop a new skill through something that you'll enjoy and care about? No one is born a perfect writer, and that doesn't matter. You should write because you enjoy doing so.

if you're nervous about your writing skills, perhaps trying looking for a beta who can help guide you not only on grammar and spelling, but flow, style and characterisation. You've already identified that you want realism and you've recognised the bitter aspects of Snape's personality that would mean fluff would be wildly OOC for him. You're miles ahead of many fanfic authors already.
