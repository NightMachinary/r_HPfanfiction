I see a lot of Luna teaching Hermione to be more open-minded, so I'm hoping for the opposite. Hermione teaches Luna all about the scientific method and why it might be so useful Luna's endeavors.

Bonus: they find one of Luna's creatures this way.


** The Crumple Horned Snorckack, Wrackspurts or Nargles as those are her more iconic creatures
