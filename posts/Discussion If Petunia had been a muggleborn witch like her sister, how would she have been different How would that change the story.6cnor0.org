If Petunia had been a muggleborn witch like her sister, how would she have been different? How would that change her story?

I supposed the obvious outcome would be that she would have been killed by death eaters along with her sister. She definitely would have never married Vernon.

*** Interesting, Snape was always weird, it was said he knew more dark magic in his first year than most seventh years. I can't imagine the neighbour watching supremely judgemental Petunia would be okay with Lily being friends with such a odd person. Which way that would push the friendship I don't know but I severely doubt Snape and Petunia would ever like each other.

**** Snape was a prodigy of a kind: he'd managed to make his own spells before he got out of Hogwarts, and was also quite good at potioneering. People like that often get rumours about them of just this kind as time passes even if it is fairly obvious that they can't really be true, and the fact that he joined Tom's sparking band of comedians did not help Snape with the rumours. If he managed to be friends with Lily as a kid, surely he couldn't have been a miniature dark lord.

***** Yeah I sort of agree. Snape was probably a loner and over the years cracked under the pressure. I see the very real possibility that a Snape who had a different kind of adolescence might have turned out to be a good guy.

I have to object to this though:

Sounds to me like apologism. If at any point in your life you not only consider but actually decide to join an "organization" such as Voldemort's you're seriously fucked in the head. At this point we're probably not talking about mere rumours anymore (and lets face it, the guy didn't just decide to join from one day to the next). At some point during his Hogwarts years (after a steady decline towards whatever the likes of Lucius Malfoy enjoy doing in their free time) there were good reasons to want to have nothing to do with the guy (and I bet in Lily's case the "mudblood" comment was merely the final straw).

I won't debate his head-fuckness or lack of it because for me the fact that he cannot get over himself and act like an actual adult when it comes to dealing with Harry is evidence enough that he is petty and an arse, that much is enough for people to have a low opinion about him because seriously, the fuck Snape, grow up.

That said, I do not feel it to be apologism to say that joining an organisation like Death Eaters, heck, even just associating with them in any capacity that people would know about, is bad for his reputation and obviously will not help him with any bad rumours circulating about him. I mean, seriously, how can it be apologism when I am not looking for an excuse but instead pretty much saying “well, bad rumour have more fuel when you do fucked-up shit”? The rumours are that /as a first-year student/ he knew more dark magic than some seventh years, or something like that; /that stuff/ is obviously not true and just rumours, fuelled by all the stupid crap Snape did and his fairly negative reputation amongst people. Now, during his higher years, he obviously was a fairly bad egg in that regard, whatever the reason for him going there, and if the rumours were that as a /fourth/ or so year he was oh-so-dark you wouldn't be able to reject them outright, but when talking about a firstie such rumours are nothing more than rumours.

Oh, sorry, I think I just misunderstood your intention. I was thinking you're trying to downplay his nastyness in a 'just rumours' fashion, or something along those lines. I think the word rumours just messed me up.

***** In my opinion we don't know enough about the mechanics of spell creation to declare him a prodigy of some kind. The Weasley twins were doing something similar and while creative they weren't meant to be absolutely brilliant. Sure he was uncommonly gifted with potions but its the nature of the dark magic he knew. He was the sort of kid who pulled the wings off flies and dissected pets. Being friends with Lily wouldn't be hard when you think they met at what, 8? He realised she was magical and it something that only he shared with her in the whole town. He knew more than her and she was inquisitive.

Why do you think that would happen? There's no guarantee she'd be at Godric's Hollow that night or that she'd die in the first war.

**** I suppose it could be written like that. But it could also be written a hundred different ways as well.

- Petunia escapes the war by moving to wizarding Majorca

- Petunia goes underground using the Fidelius Charm or other means

- Petunia marries a Voldemort sympathizer and joins the cause

- The Death Eaters don't know she exists/they're related- both have married and changed names and they don't think to keep track of Muggleborns

*** As a muggleborn witch whose sister is also a muggleborn witch that just happens to have married a pureblood, Petunia would be high on the list of people to kill as far as the Death Eaters would be concerned.

Especially if she showed a knack for magic Voldemort's followers would have deemed to be dangerous in a muggleborn's hands.

If she did survive, then that piece of fanart would be applicable, but odds are that the Death Eaters would have designated her a priority target due to her sister's marriage into the Potter family.

She would most likely not have survived for very long afterwards.

** Lily wouldn't be friends with Snape for long because Petunia would see him for what he is and what kinds of friends he has. Lily wouldn't latch onto him because her she already had her sister to tell her about the magical world and not just the kid with poor hygiene and a bunch of racially motivated terrorists as friends. Because she is not defending Snape she has less fights with the marauders.

Assuming that Petunia survives the war and Dumbledore doesn't meddle like he usually does Harry is raised by a loving Petunia who does not like the magical world (it costed her her sister, she is discriminated against and murderers walk free).

And now I want Harry raised by a bitter but caring Petunia.

linkffn(12479244) This story might be right up your alley. It's fem!Harry, Petunia's still a muggle, and it's just started out, but it's off to a good start so far and looks to worth following. The author seems to be juggling a lot of in-progress stories so expect slow updates, but his work tends to be fairly good in my opinion.

  Violet Evans was a quiet introverted girl who just wanted to be left alone. She liked reading, talking to snakes, helping out her mum, and didn't really care much for the world at large. When Petunia told her she wasn't actually her daughter, that she was born Harriet Potter, she wasn't impressed in the slightest. No, she knew who she was, and the magical world could just sod off.

** I think it could have possibly changed the outcome of the entire series. I think Petunia and Lily would have remained very close. I also think it could be possible that Lily might have wanted Petunia as secret keeper, in which case maybe Lily and James would never have been killed?

Alternatively, they might have all been killed and Harry may have been placed with magical guardians (like the Weasleys) and have had a far nicer upbringing.

Had Lily had Petunia, she might never have become friends with Snape (seeing as her older sibling could tell her about the wizarding world), so I guess Snape might have succumbed to the darkness a lot sooner. And without his redeeming qualities of love and loyalty, Snape probs would have grown to become Voldy's most dangerous supporter with nothing to turn him over to the light.

The main reason why he befriend them in canon is because of a lack of friend in his childhood and a need to keep them happy. He never felt the need to befriend other people or to get to know them. Example with his trial (5th book) where he didn't recognise that Amelia Bones was the aunt of his classmate Susan. When I was in school, I knew at least the lat name from the people my age.

** Well now. I'd like to think that no one had any idea she also caused weird things to happen, so she treats Snape exactly the same, until her letter shows up.

At that point, everything changes. Petunia is ecstatic at not being overlooked for her special, pretty younger sister, and the animosity between her and Snape lessons ever so slightly.

At that point, it depends where she goes. Slytherin is possibly the best fit....but I think it likely she wouldn't survive the seven years. She'd either die, or drop out. She's no Griff or Ravenclaw, so I'd like to think the Hat has /some/ intelligence and puts her in Hufflepuff.

She'd be happy there. Probably get some good friends. Chances of dying would still be high, especially once Voldemort heard the prophecy.

I'd see petunia either getting a kick out of seeing snape bullied, or disliking the Mauraders and playing interference for both Snape and Lily.

I could see Petunia and Snape marrying, tbh. They'd have a Ron and Hermione relationship, with vinegar instead of ginger.
