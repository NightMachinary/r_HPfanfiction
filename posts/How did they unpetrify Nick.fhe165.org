This has bugged me for a while. In the book, it's just glossed over, but does anyone actually know? And if there's nothing, what's your headcanon?

Just put the restorative into a bottle and spray it?

Fill a tub with it and levitate it through him?


** Kill a mandrake with unfinished business and have whichever ghost is the best brewer make the restorative from the ghost mandrake.

Actually reading the title I thought of a spray bottle too, so headcanon I think spray bottle, but if I were to write something addressing it it'd be ghostdrake.

*** I didn't even think about the possibility of ghost drake.

Damn.

Actually, if ghosts can brew potions that work on other ghosts, do you think a ghost like Nick could get his head cut off in its entirety by a ghost like the bloody baron, who still has his sword?

**** Ooh, and perhaps the Baron has refused, finding it amusing when Nick is left out of the headless hunt, which has fueled the house rivalry for a few centuries.

It would be interesting if they can interact like that, there could be epic ghost battles happening where living things are just getting on with their lives, able to see it all without it touching them at all, though I'm inclined to say that they could only do magic to each other, like a ghost potion could work because it is magic which makes it do the thing and they still exist as magical beings, but a sword has a physical effect so it wouldn't work since they don't exist as physical beings. So magical coma and magical solution yes, something which would be a physical cause and effect no... I think that's where I stand on this

** I read a fic once where they had to sortof just let the magic out of him naturally.

One of the moments that got left out of the film is that they had to use a fan to waft him into the hospital wing in the first place

** Maybe Peeves helps, remember Peeves has the unique ability to react with material objects, despite himself being intangible. Perhaps he has some sort of ability due to his poltergeist status that allows him to make material objects affect those on a different plane of reality?

** At his death day party they had real food (rotted for taste) and +I don't believe there were mentions of "casper the friendly ghost"-ing the food all over the floor, so ghosts may actually be able to ingest things+. It's established that they can have limited interaction with the physical world, though if it's intent based that could pose a problem with him being unconscious.

***** I wonder how they moved him, since ghosts obviously can't touch physical matter according to this passage.

Or maybe the petrification made him more solid?
