This is something that always bugged me in canon, that NO Slytherins were in the DA. I mean, I get that maybe they didn't want to be the odd one out at their House, or maybe one or two even tried to join but were scared off by the already members, or something. But is there any fic out there where there are Slytherins in the DA? Doesn't have to be the center of the story, it can be just a passing event.

Thanks~

Pretty sure J.K. Rowling came out on more than a few occasions and said that this isn't the case. There are interviews, Pottermore articles, and other sources that all cite her as directly saying "not all Slytherins are bad [people]".

The sample size isn't nearly large enough to make that conclusion, and there are plenty of awful people from other houses. Pettigrew was a Gryffindor, Lockhart was a Ravenclaw, etc.

** It keeps with canon, so they don't join the DA but it's all about Slytherins and a lot of them are fighting back against Voldemort (creating their own groups-but it's a series so it's a bit later on). My favourite aspect is actually the implication that one of the members of the Slytherin Quidditch team is actually really good friends with Ginny.

**** Harry/Tracey (not Harry/Tonks). Its less common by far than the Harry/Daphne pairing, which I suspect is almost entirely due to the name "Daphne" being more appealing than the name "Tracey" (stereotypes am I right?). If you want some examples, try James Spookie and his various fics with Daphne. Any fic where Harry dates or becomes more tolerant of Slytherins will probably involve them joining the DA (this an old axiom too, fics as old as Taking Control have touched on this as well.).

***** Partly the name, but it's also canon that Daphne has a younger sister who ends up marrying Draco. It's a detail that makes her slightly more interesting. A couple early H/D fics also created fanon's Ice Queen Daphne, which really popularized her as a character and the pairing by extension imo. A few small factors can really snowball.

Anyway, that was not really the point. Most of the time when Slytherins join the DA, its as an attempt to either a) make Harry more tolerant or the Slytherins more nuanced (reasonable) or breakup the trio or b) as part of a "proof" of the commitment of some girl (Daphne, Tracey, Pansy occasionally) to being on his side.

It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
