I've been craving some really good time travel fics and fics where Harry, Ron, and Hermione are shipped together, and I've especially been craving some fics where they travel back to their *first year* (or their Hogwarts years, it doesn't /have/ to be first year) /and/ they're also romantically involved (at the start or eventually, it doesn't matter). The only fics I've managed to find are incomplete, and while I don't care if they're complete or not, I would prefer fics that have at least some substance to them.

Thank you for any recs!

These are the fics I've managed to find:

#+begin_quote
  It's been five years since Harry, Ron, and Hermione elected not to return to Hogwarts and hunt for Horcruxes. The Horcruxes allude them and their enemy grows stronger each day. When Hermione is gravely injured in battle and nearing death they bind their magic in order to save her. During her recovery, the wizarding world is lost in the war. Seeing only one possible end Harry, Ron and Hermione come up with a solution; reset time and return to their first year at Hogwarts in order to buy themselves more time to come up with a solution. The only issue with their plan is using highly theoretically spells tends to have consequences and they will soon learn that awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.

  This story in seven parts explores the trio's relationship with one another and the lengths they will go to in order to save the wizarding world.

  The golden trio are back in the past. They have one objective: to save the wizarding world.

  However, there is one difference in them they are not the naive little pawns. They will take no shit from anyone, especially from dumbledore. watch out as the trio becomes a legend.

  Luna. The reason is Luna. (Though in all technicality Draco shouldn't have left her alone with the Veil and a ridiculous amount of Time Turners and the rest of his turkey sandwich, because now they're all back in their fourth year at Hogwarts (minus Ginny and Luna who are third years) and they can't get back to the future (or possibly other dimension according to Luna because of how time travel works (Draco's head is starting to hurt)) and they can't tell anyone about what happened and even Hermione can't figure out why not, and Luna ate his sandwich. (It was a damned good sandwich.)) Draco, of course, is handling everything wonderfully.

** Do you mean all three of them romantically involved with each other? I haven't read any of those, so can't help if that's what you wanted.

Backward With Purpose has Harry, Ron, and Ginny go back, with Harry and Ginny romantically involved (which alarms and alienates her family when they find out), but Hermione wasn't part of it (she died before they went back).

*** Yes. But if you have fics where just the three of them go back in time then that's fine. I've already read "Backward With Purpose" and more or less anything that ships Harry and Ginny together.

** I didn't even realize these types of fics existed! Am currently reading these and will suggest any that I find here. Thanks for introducing these to me!

*** I don't think it's a very popular trope. Not many people have written non-smutty, plot-centered fics that feature Harry/Ron/Hermione, so I doubt there are very many that have shipped them together and have them travelling back in time together. There are plenty of fics where Harry or Draco gets sent back in time (to first year), but there aren't many where the three of them are sent back together. I plan to write one (in the very far future) and I'm afraid that my recs aren't very plentiful. :/

*** If that means them having sex then no, I'm not looking for smut. If sex is involved, that's fine, but I don't require sex scenes.

**** It literally means “household of three”, so no, sex is not a necessity. OK, I think I understand what you mean.

***** For future reference, “literal” translations are called literal translations because they purposefully don't account for context and/general usage.

In practice, ménage à trois absolutely means a sexual relationship between three people.
