•••

When he got back outside, Bearing and Lattimer were hovering by the door, hands too close to their hips for his liking. He eyed them. Now that he was really looking, it was fascinating. He couldn't help himself, stepping closer to Lattimer, until they were far too close for polite situations.

"Uh . . . Agent Potter?" Harry tilted his head slowly, not looking at him but sensing the swirling magic cocooning him like a shroud and drifting around, touching everything in the area with time energy, much like a seer's magic. Oddly enough, it wasn't attached to his soul like most magical abilities, but rather to the body, though the magic wasn't IN Lattimer but around him. Lattimer glanced helplessly at the other three, which drew Harry's attention to the woman. Unlike Lattimer, the magic around her WAS linked to the soul. It curled through her head and attached it to the world via billions of tiny threads, some meeting him, others the area and others still stretched so far off into the distance he couldn't track them.

"Okay, seriously, Agent Potter, back up!" Bearing snapped. Harry blinked out of his observations to find he had backed her against the wall and had been staring rather intently at her face.

"I'm sorry," he said with a sheepish smile. "It's just, the gifts you all have . . ."

"Gifts?" Artie asked with deceptive casualness. Did he not know? Harry frowned.

"Hey, humor me. Do you guys know how the Finches are doing this season?"

"Well," Lattimer began slowly, with a clear air of thinking he was insane. "It's spring, so they're probably being birds." Shite. These were muggles. So how did they have so much magic around them? Hell, there was so much magic everywhere. He had been to America before, he'd never felt the air so saturated as it was now. And now that he was really focused, it WAS the air. Not bleed-off from the most heavily enchanted house he'd ever been in.


** Here's a bit from "California Dreamin'", my massive 39-chapter AU fic that I finally finished this year. Harry is teaching and here is a sample of his first day. If you're interested in reading more, I post at AO3 under the pseudonym [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/jenorama/pseuds/jenorama][jenorama]] and I always appreciate reader feedback.

The bell rang, signaling the start of the last class of the day and Harry breathed a sigh of relief. /One more class. I can do it./ His last class, Juniors, sat arrayed in front of him, watching him expectantly. “Good afternoon, class. Welcome to Practical Defensive Magic and Theory, level five. I am your teacher, Harry Potter.” As in the previous classes, this introduction caused a susurration of whispers to move through the class.

Immediately, a hand went up in the middle of the students. “I know you all have questions, but we need to get through roll call first. When I call your name, you may ask me one question, all right?” More whispers greeted this announcement and Harry gave them a moment to get their questions ready.

“Okay. Mia Adams?” Harry called, reading from his class list. A dark-haired girl in the second row raised her hand.

“Are you married?” she asked, sounding genuinely curious.

“I am not.” /Why is that always the first question?/ he thought. It was about the fourth time he'd been asked today. She opened her mouth again and Harry raised a finger. “One question,” he said and she subsided with a look of disappointment. “Carrie Borregas?”

Raising her hand, Carrie asked the question Mia had obviously wanted to. “Do you have a girlfriend?”

“I do have a girlfriend. Her name is Ginny.” /And that's always the second one./ “Malcolm Davis?”

“Do you still have the scar?” Malcolm asked after raising his hand.

“I do,” Harry said, pushing his hair out of the way so the students could see it, smiling inwardly as the boys all muttered variations of “cool”.

Michael Flores, a cheeky-looking boy with a mop of curly hair asked, “Hermione Granger was a total babe. How come you didn't date her?”

/This is a new one,/ Harry thought, momentarily taken aback. “Oh, wow. I never saw her that way. She was more like my sister, yeah? Besides, Ron would have beaten me senseless.” /I'll have to tell Ron about this one./

Finally, Harry called the last name, a boy called Robert Torres. “Do you still talk to your cousin?” he asked. /What is in that history book? I'll have to get a copy from Juanita./

“Well, I'm not ringing him up every Sunday, but I keep an eye on him. Christmas cards, that sort of thing.” Everyone present and accounted for, Harry set the class list on his desk and picked up the syllabus he'd created for them.

“All right, here is what we'll be learning this year. Please take a moment to review it and then I'll answer questions about it.” So far he'd been impressed that most of his classes had actually reviewed the syllabi he'd passed out and asked relevant questions.

Mia raised her hand again. “Yes, Mia?”

“Mr Potter, are you really going to be teaching the Patronus Charm?” she asked, sounding skeptical.

“I am.”

** Here's the first chapter of [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w2xjBfQam1elmNAyB5uUwtZCU9pc0N2mPKVfv-J1omQ][/We, Harry Potter./]] In all likelihood, I'm never going to finish it, but the idea was funny, so I put down a first chapter. It came to me after binge reading Dragon!Harry fics. And yes, for the curious, it's a nod to Hiram McDaniels of /Welcome to Nightvale./

Summary: The basalisk venom woke the creature in Harry's blood. The dying horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical nads. Now, join Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry Potter as they deal with being a literal five-headed dragon.

***** Just one think, though --- is Green speaking Parseltongue, or just speaking English in a really hissy voice? If it's the latter, you might want not to format the text in the way that is usually used for Parseltongue (italics, tripled 'S's).

****** No, he is not speaking parseltongue, but parseltongue is why he's hissing; the magic is bleeding through into Green's voice. You could call it a snakelike accent.

I am fully aware that that italics with tripple-S's is shorthand for parseltongue. I chose that style deliberately.

** Here's a snippet from Chapter Twenty-Seven of Untitled Tome, I guess! I suppose this is a better time than any other, lest anyone think I'm dead, being lazy, or both. (Actually, all three are true.)

#+begin_quote
  Plinny and her lesson would continue in the background for some time, but the mark of the Trishula would probe Harry's skull until the bell for lunch: the little respite that his status as a pariah could afford.

  At first, it was a difficult prize for him to accept, given that Ron and Neville's ever-increasing Quidditch chatter and Seamus' pestering of Dean for leaks of his father's comic strips provided a welcome distraction from his own predicaments. That he was suspended from the Duelling Squad alleviated the pressure somewhat, but his Wandsong tutorials assumed a more rigorous nature, and with Auror Shacklebolt's absences becoming even more frequent, only one other instructor was fit to play the reserve.

  Dumbledore, rather unsurprisingly, refrained from verbally admonishing Harry and Ron for their actions that night (though he probably caught an earful of McGonagall's rant all the way from his office, too), nor had he mentioned Peeves' obnoxiously evident presence throughout their lessons.

  It was exactly that, however, and the plaintive smile he was graced with from the High Table which irked Harry's suspicions.

  "Well hello there, Potter."

  The smarmy drawl made Harry tense at the shoulders. He briefly toyed with the idea of slapping a Trip Jinx onto his bangers and mash, but he was neither full nor practised enough to confidently pull it off.

  "Smith," he said plainly, swivelling on the bench to face the haughty Hufflepuff. He was accompanied by his typical circle, though Susan was notably absent.

  Harry's brow lifted. "Haven't had guests in a while. I should pour some more pumpkin juice- "

  "Don't get snide with us, Speccy," said Smith, his upper lip curling. "You might think you're hot shit with a wand, but your maths can't be good if you think you've got a chance here."

  "You don't think I'd... ?" Harry shot a look to his left. The other Gryffindors, even Percy Weasley, tended to their meals as if there wasn't a herd of Hufflepuffs crowning the table's end. "We're in the Great Hall, Smith - you must have better things to do."

  Smith stepped back, squaring his shoulders.

  "Easy, Potter," he said, eyes flitting to the High Table. "I was just here to offer my regrets."

  Harry made a face. "You what?"

  "You don't read the papers?" he replied with a chortle. A curly-haired boy behind him - Justin, he remembered - shook his head before stalking off. "It's all about you, after all - Hannah?"

  The pig-tailed girl brushed past Smith, thrusting a copy of the Daily Prophet into Harry's lap with an impassive look. She fixed Smith with a far more steely stare, though, before jogging out of the Hall, likely in search of Justin. Harry peered down at the headline, and his stomach churned.

  *A CASTLE OF TWO TIERS: HOGWARTS TO SEGREGATE BY BLOOD STATUS?*

  *by Rita SKEETER*

  "What... "

  "Not 'what', Potter," said Smith, lowering his voice as he leaned forward. "But 'who', and why. Your little stunt ruined it for all of them. And to think, my granddad's been trying to get rid of these Mudbloods for years- "

  "Don't, Smith," said Harry, feeling the Prophet crumple as he clenched his fists.

  "Truth hurts, doesn't it? Because they think you're one," whispered Smith, jerking a thumb to the High Table. "Muggle-born, Muggle-raised - it's all the same at the end of the day. That's why I can't stand you, Potter. You're not just Dark - you're filth."

  In times yet to come, Harry would forget the precise order of the events culminating in Smith's ear-splitting flight from the Hall. He would, nonetheless, remember the ripping sensation that sprung from his chest, the maniacal laughter which seemed to reverberate off of every piece of cutlery that dug into the Hufflepuff's flesh, and, most damning of all, the transfixed stares from the entire student body.

  "So are you sure we're not possessed, idiot?"

** Current eight chapter of my first draft, titled "On a Twig, Looking up the Sky". A Harry Potter/Tokyo Ghoul crossover

“There is blood on your hands,” Voldemort said, “have you been trying to eat yourself again?”\\
“No, my Lord. I swear, I did not.” Akane had tried to eat herself once, to stall the pain from her empty stomach. To make it stop hurting. Lord Voldemort would never feed her until she slipped into hunger-driven madness. He would then drag her to the pit. A large hole in a magical room walled by stones and where a human, muggle or wizard, would await in the center. With weapons or a wand. He would let Akane free, then. Free to unleash all her pent up violence and kill the men, or women, or children. She could kill them, but not eat them. To eat she had to prostrate and beg. Lord Voldemort loved begging.\\
There were little pain worse than hunger for ghouls, and Lord Voldemort had started playing with that card very quickly. Akane had learned the rules, but that one time she had forgotten. She had tried to eat herself, to satiate herself and end the pain. The Dark Lord had been very displeased.\\
“I painted the walls,” she mumbled.\\
“You painted the walls?” His voice betrayed surprise and Akane risked a glance upward. Voldemort's eyes glittered like fiery rubies, looking at the bloodied stone behind her. He then looked back at her, and Akane quickly lowered her face again.\\
She didn't miss the perversity in those eyes, or the pleased glint.\\
“I do remember specifically telling you not to hurt yourself without my permission. Did you forget?”\\
Akane shook her head, frantically. She remembered now. Another rule. “No, my Lord, you are right. I was not to hurt myself.”\\
“And yet you disobeyed?”\\
Akane said nothing. She did not know what would appease Lord Voldemort. One wrong word could cost her terribly. She had already been skinned, flayed and even separated from all kinds of her organs. Her limbs had been cut and then regrown, her eyes had exploded like overripe melons and she had to gouge them out with her fingers. Sometimes Voldemort would tell her that he was making her anew. A new body for a new purpose. A rebirth.

It's a first draft, so the grammar mistakes and flow sucks, but it's there.

** Description for a story i'm never going to finish called "Harry Potter and the Millennium Puzzle" :When it comes to the life of the young Harry Potter destiny is blessing and a curse. He is destined by prophecy to defeat the dark lord Voldemort, he is destined to go to Hogwarts when he is Eleven, he is destined to meet Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger and become close friends with both of them. What he isn't destined to do is become the King of Games, and the living vessel for a 5,000 year old Pharaoh..

What I have down for the story so far Harry Potter was a young lad, barely older than 9 years old, He lives in 4 Privet Drive, Surrery with his Aunt Petunia and his uncle Vernon, along with his cousin Dudley. If you looked upon the homey little abode you'd see an ideal home that any member of the community would be envious of. Trimmed hedgerows along a perfect lawn, not a weed to be seen along the driveway, and a cheery disposition make the home really stand out as one of the nicest in the neighborhood. Looks can be deceiving though, if anyone actually bothered to look, to really look, they'd see the home for what it was...a clever little lie, at least, that's what Harry calls it.

Harry Potter doesn't like living with his extended family, even at his young age he could tell you that his aunt and uncle were awful to him. Oh you wouldn't believe him, who would trust a child's word over that of an adult, especially a child who shows no real signs of physical or mental abuse? Harry has gone through the routine, tell someone his family is awful to him, be told he's a lying delinquent, get punished by the teacher or taken home by the bobby who caught him fleeing from home, and then be forced to watch his Aunt lie through her horse like teeth until said bobby or other form of adult leaves. After that it's straight to the cupboard under the stairs. After all, freaks don't get food, especially lying ones like Harry Potter.

His routine is the is the only thing he could find sanctuary in while living in the hell that was Privet Drive. He wakes up an hour before dawn, uses the loo since his family is still asleep, starts on breakfast, and then waits patiently for his family to come downstairs and occupy themselves with their breakfast. After that it was out the back door to weed the garden and hopefully stay away from Dudley's “Harry Hunting' game until the school day starts.

One saturday though things were different. When Harry woke up Saturday morning to begin his early morning ritual he felt the tell tale thumping of his whale of an uncle walking down the narrow stairway, shaking dust and cobwebs down upon the young boy, who was holding his breath trying to not let his uncle know that he was awake so early.

Once the noise passed her heard the front door open and he could hear his aunt and uncle whispering quietly.

“Are you sure you're okay to watch Dudley while I'm gone?” His uncle's voice was the softest he had ever heard it,

** *Fic where Ron is the main character. (Trying to make a workable Ron is Dumbledore fic, but at this point in the fic Ron doesn't have access to Dumbledore's powers or memories right now.):*

--------------

Ron uncorked the bottle and gulped down the potion, feeling the liquid ice flow down his throat. The sense of unease that had been building in the background the entire evening, was near unbearable at this point. There was something that just didn't make sense.

/Why would Harry go after Snape without me?/

But that didn't make sense. Harry wouldn't go without waking up his best friend.

/Was he kidnapped?/

But that didn't make sense. Ron would've been woken up during the struggle?

It wasn't until Ron had made it through the flames that things made sense.

Because the person standing at the end of the flames, with his back to the mirror wasn't Snape. It wasn't Voldemort. It wasn't even Quirrel.

It was Harry.

--------------

“Hello Ron,” said Harry. His voice sounded deeper, and colder even, with a tone Ron had never heard before.

“Hi Harry,” said Ron, eyes sweeping frantically across the room, trying to take in as much as possible at once. “Fancy seeing you here.”

Harry kept his arm out, wand pointed firmly at Ron's chest.

“You seem surprised to see me here.”

“Not entirely,” replied Ron, his even voice masking his brain's panicking efforts to figure a way out of this situation. “Someone's been killing unicorns. Someone opened the Chamber of Secrets. Someone almost killed Dumbledore. And someone kidnapped Harry tonight. This is the only explanation that fits. Isn't that right Harry? Or should I say, Voldemort?”

Harry's eyes widened a bit, then he smiled in a way that somehow didn't fit his face. “Very good. I'm amazed you managed to piece it all together, especially when the Ministry arrested Snape.”

“Who you must have framed since he couldn't have broken his vows to Dumbledore. I just don't understand why you waited until now to steal the stone"

"Well, indulge me in the Socratic method for a moment. From what I've heard, you should be familiar with the concept of possession, Ronald. Or did I hear wrong?"

Ron gritted his teeth at the jab towards Ginny, but swallowed down his anger. "I know you're trying to get me worked up, and it's not working."

"Just as I know you're trying to stall for time. But time isn't even on your side. No one knows you're down here, and the charms I cast over your dormmates will ensure no one ever will." Harry sneered. "Just like your sister, no one is coming to save you."

/He doesn't know about Neville/, Ron realized. /Since Neville never left the common room, whatever Voldemort did couldn't have affected him. I just need to keep him talking./ "So you're possessing Harry," Ron conjectured, "Somehow. Which means you probably didn't have full control until recently."

"Very good, Ronald. If I was still Head Boy I'd award 10 points to Gryffindor. Instead, I'll have to give you the second best reward - getting a chance to serve me, Lord Voldemort. For you see, there's a puzzle here in this room I need your help to overcome."

Possibilities flew threw Ron's head. Refuse, and let Voldemort force Harry to kill himself. Attack back, and let Voldemort force Harry to kill himself. Say something heroic, anger Voldemort, and still be stuck in the same situation and be forced to help Voldemort.

Ron chose the 3rd option.

--------------

That's all for now.

** This is from my WIP [[https://www.fanfiction.net/story/story_preview.php?storyid=11511581&chapter=1][/Rebuilding Ourselves/]] which is a a cannon fic following the final battle at Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  It wasn't until nearly 5 that Ginerva Weasley, known to most as Ginny or '[blank]'s little sister' as she had grown up with 6 older brothers, came in through the floo. She jumped with all three of the Trio jumped up and pointed their wands at her.

  "What did Fred say to us before Fluer and Bill's wedding?" Harry asked, his voice strained and angry. As if he knew it wasn't Ginny and was angry that someone would impersonate her. He looked a force to be reckoned with, as did the others, and it was clear that if someone was in fact impersonating Ginny Weasley they would regret it soon.

  "What?" Ginny asked, her hands up to show she was not a threat. No matter how many times she came over to this response, she would never get used to it. When she looked at the trio she saw her funny older brother, her lovable and kind bookworm friend, and the modest and loyal man she'd cared for her entire life. She didn't see this, broken down witches and wizards terrified in the aftermath of a lifetime of war.

  "ANSWER HIS QUESTION!" Ron demanded, yelling and making her jump. His eyes were not those of the brother who had taught her to make her stuffed dolls dance when they were kids but those of a cold and determined man. A man ready and able to fight to the death with an instant of warning.

  "Um, 'Morning?" She asked, not sure. She thought back, painfully remembering the brother she had lost. "Yes, he walked in and said 'Morning' before sipping his tea."

  Ron and Hermione both looked to Harry before he nodded and they all lowered their wands. Ginny let out a sigh of relief before walking into the room. She looked around and frowned, walking to the glass door in front of the porch and opening the blinds to let the remaining light of day in. They groaned and glared, none of them wanting to face the day.
