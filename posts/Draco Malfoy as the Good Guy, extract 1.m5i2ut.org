"/Hah/", thought Draco as he hovered above the Quidditch Grounds. "/Longbottom's remembrall. Silly fellow. But, blast it, he needs toughening up, he's too much of a bumbler, he's embarrassing himself. They wouldn't understand, but... I feel like I'm the Man for that job. I do feel sad about what happened to His Parents, but what can I do? What can I do? Realistically, he still needs to go through some hazing. Better me than the others, savage imbeciles that they are/".

Draco was distracted by a whooshing sound, as he saw Harry Potter fly up in his peripheral vision, and then in front of him.

"Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!", shouted Harry.

Draco's face contorted.

"/What?!/", he thought to Himself. /"Knock me off my broom? He can't possibly be serious? He would knock me off at this height, killing me instantly?! This is... Oh my word. The rumours must be true, then. There must be something of the Dark Lord dormant within Him"./

Draco pondered in that moment.

/"Well"/, he thought to himself, /"I/ */was/* /considering capitulating at the next feast. I suppose that idea goes out the bloody window... To think I was considering inviting Potter and his friends over to the Manor for a get together. This won't do. This won't do at all... I suppose I'll have to maintain my position. But I hate this! I bloody well hate this! Narcissistic, vicious Parents who want death and destruction, talk of that maniac they worship returning, and now it seems even Potter might be his replacement?! What sort of Chess match am I involved in?!... God, this Place has gone to the dumps"./

*** Did that redditor ([[/u/Esarathon][u/Esarathon]]) ever publish those posts as a fic on one of the fan fiction platforms? If not, then they should. What a great one-shot. Ripe for expanding, too.

I can picture Harry using a pensieve to revisit his prior conversations with Draco with the new context in mind.

**** Ummm... They didn't. Did they forget about this one even though they intended to write it? Maybe....

Send me a message if you like and I'll keep you posted if/when it happens. I'm not going to make promises as life still happens but it is my intention to write this as a longer one-shot with scenes of them meeting Astoria, wedding prep and the wedding itself.

****** Cheers, mate. Same username as Reddit for all platforms. I'll publish on AO3 and FFN when I do so wherever is easiest. I've been mainly working on my major WIP when I have time but won't be publishing any of that until I'm sure I have all my foreshadowing put in.

** I can almost see Draco think so in Canon. Seriously, eleven-year-old Harry threatened someone every now and then. Maybe he didn't mean it, but Harry had said many times that a world without Malfoy and his gang would be so much better.

** Also the words for "Weasley is our king" were meant to encourage Ron get over his stage fright and it was the in fact the Ravenclaws who hijacked the song to taunt him.

And when he came up with the "Potter stinks" badges he was genuinely upset about Harry's lack of fair-play and how he even excluded his best friend from the ploy to get his name in the goblet.

** You jest, but I once had a Dramione fan argue completely seriously that when Draco was taunting the Harry and others during the Death Eater attack on the Quiddich championship, he was just warning them to get to safety.
