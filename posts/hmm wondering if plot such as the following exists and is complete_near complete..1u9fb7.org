namely HP "vanguishes" mr. riddle by fact that he is mr. riddles nephew. enslaves by clan law ALL of voldies minions and goes after AD. ;-)


** How would being Riddle's nephew (which isn't canon) allow him to vanquish anyone? This is about as random as having the Power he Knows Not be plaid.

As for enslavement of Riddle's minions in a story with an antagonistic Dumbledore... I don't know. Maybe Teufel1987's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7254667/1/Black-Vengeance][Black Vengeance]]?
