Not the place to debate this or the morality of cheating but that's generally considered the main reason why people cheat in real life.

** I greatly enjoyed linkffn(Heart and Soul)

While it has Harry with Fleur /and/ Hermione, I think it's absolutely fantastic, if a bit bloated ar times. It is well over 700k words long, and could honestly be a little shorter, but the plot is fine, and the characters fantastic and fleshed out.

** Someone should really get around to writing one of those. Maybe set it like fourth year and present it as a bildungsroman that attempts to show Harry coming into his own with an evolving cast of characters around him as his life and relationships change as he grows up.

Probably need some type of an ice breaker to set up the characters meeting otherwise there's not really any logical reason for an adult witch to have much interested in a barely teenage boy at that point. Maybe something like pen pals or some other mostly anonymous interactive point.

Hmm there's a kernel of an idea there. Maybe I should write it.

*** The pen pals thing is inspired. You could call it Letters. I bet it would be incredibly popular. 9k favorites at least.

*** You could play around with the timeline. Philosopher's Stone in 1st year. COS in 5th year along with the prophecy. POA in 6th and GOF in 7th so that they are the same age. Post Graduate Harry fights Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  In the aftermath of a peaceful summer comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually. And now, a free remastered version is coming to my website!
