  Darkness dwells within the Ministry once again. Newly-divorced, Harry Potter struggles to juggle the demands of leading the Auror Office with maintaining a sorry excuse for a life in his shabby London flat. Initially investigating reports of a crime wave sweeping the nation, Harry and his deputy, Ron, stumble across a plot to undo everything they have worked for since Voldemort's defeat eight years ago. Together with Hermione, deposed as Minister for Magic, they take matters into their own hands to discover and defeat this new threat and restore order once more. Along the way, an old friend reintroduces Harry to life outside marriage. Maybe Oliver Wood can convince him to slow down and take a good look - it's remarkable what one can miss when they never stop running long enough to see their true self.
