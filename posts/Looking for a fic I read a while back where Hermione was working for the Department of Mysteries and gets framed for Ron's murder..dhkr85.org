:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Does that ring a bell to anyone? I can't even remember if it was slash or not, it's been so long since I read it.

Thank you for the help.


** Is this the one where she murders Ron because he was abusing her but it turns out one of the brains that attacked Ron in OOTP was taking over him so basically it was not really him abusing her? And then somehow Ginny ends up getting murdered, too coz she floo'ed in at the wrong time. The whole thing later turns into a H/Hr story.

(I also don't know the title but if it rings bells in anyone's mind...)

** Just read the other day a fic where Hermione gets framed for other murders but Ron was only in a coma. Hermione does work for the department of Mysteries. Could it be [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7525/1][*/The Cardinal Curses/*]] By BB Ruth?
