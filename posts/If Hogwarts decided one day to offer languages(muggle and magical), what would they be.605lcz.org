** Latin would be a must. JK has a background in Classics and it shows - almost all the spells have Latin roots. Just knowing the meaning and intent behind spells would make them easier to identify and use, I suspect. If a wizard decided to cast an unknown spell during a duel, someone proficient in Latin would possibly be able to work out its function and plan around it. Tbh, I don't know how spell-crafting works or whatnot but I presume that Latin would probably be helpful.

Even though this wouldn't be particularly relevant to a Hogwarts student, a healthy portion of the characters in the books have names from a Roman origin or Latin background also (e.g. Severus = strict, Dolores = pain).

So yeah, definitely Latin.

** You might check out linkffn(11762909) and linkffn(11862560) by inwardtransience. Both have additional language classes because Wizarding Britain held on to Celtic traditions much more than in canon. The author really puts a lot of work into that, far more than I can understand, really. It's impressive, and the stories are fantastic as well.

As for canon, Hogwarts could potentially offer Classical Latin, Ancient Greek, Ancient Egyptian (Phoenician too?), French, and whatever the /lingua franca/ of Durmstrang is (Russian? German? Old Norse?). Any of the Celtic languages could be fair game depending on the larger history of Wizarding Britain. You might also throw in others depending on what the larger international magical scene is like; maybe Arabic, Mandarin, Swahili, and Hindi to start, and possibly even Mesoamerican languages if the Aztecs and Mayans left a decent magical heritage.

For magical languages, the obvious ones are Mermish and Gobbledegook. Not sure what else there is (Troll?).

I think you could make a good argument for anything between none and several dozen additional language classes, depending on how easy it is for wizards become fluent and how dominant various cultures are in the magical world.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)

** It seems like there are ways to learn languages quickly using magic (Crouch knew 150 languages) so assuming it's not too difficult, it's pretty reasonable to have students be proficient in two or three languages.

French and German due to the schools. Latin, Greek, old English, Egyptian...

Definitely Latin though, that should be a requirement.

I'm more interested in the magical languages like talking to mermaids.

** *Classical Languages* (Latin, Ancient Runes languages, Sanskrit, etc.)

Basically these are languages that directly improve someone's facility with magic. Sanskrit is included because I assume it takes the place of Latin in South and South-East Asia (with Classical Chinese and Koranic Arabic doing the same in East Asia and the Middle-East/North Africa respectively).

*Modern Languages* (French, German, Spanish, etc.)

These are languages that let speakers communicate with other major wizarding powers. French and German because of other schools, and Spanish because I assume it covers Latin America.

*Magical Languages* Parsletongue, Mermish, Gobledygook, etc.

These are included because they let speakers talk to other magical races or creatures.
