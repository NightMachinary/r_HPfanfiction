A discussion to help get things off our chests and maybe help potential authors out, but what is the one thing you've read in a fanfic that you wish authors would just stop doing? Or maybe a piece of advice you've always wanted to give? Here's the place!

--------------

I'll start with my own. This:

Person A says, "blah blah blah."

Person B says, "blah? Blah blah."

"Blah blah."

"Blah, blah blah blah. Blah!"

For 200,000 words. Seen it so many times. No description, no action, just /dialogue/.


** Here's mine: coal black eyes

Do this google search:

site:fanfiction.net snape "coal black eyes"

In return you'll be offered 73,200 search results and free nightmares.

Some choice samples:

#+begin_quote
  "Snape's coal-black eyes slid slowly to the left, wordlessly taking..."

  "Snape snapped. His coal black eyes bore into the headmaster's"

  "Snape's coal black eyes looked into Harry's bright green eyes and he saw her"

  "Snape's coal black eyes hit me"

  "A salty tear leaked out of Snape's coal black eyes"

  "Snape's coal-black eyes began to glimmer"

  "Panting, Harry stared up into the coal black eyes"
#+end_quote

What was that again?

Coal black eyes. 73,200 instances of COAL BLACK EYES silently swiveling as they are snugly set against their milky white backdrop

In case it isn't clear, [[https://scienceeasylearning.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/eye-pupil.jpg][irises]] are usually brown, blue, or piercing green (if your name is Harry Potter). Black eyes would be irises the same color as the pupil. A coal black eye would be a featureless black circle against the white of the sclera.

No wonder the students hate Snape. I think you could write a compelling/horrifying story just by stringing together quotes about Snape's coal black eyes. . . . . . Bonus round!

#+begin_quote
  "Coal black eyes, surprisingly soft, looked down at me as Snape reached into..."

  "His coal black eyes bore a serious message. "You will"..."

  "As her teacher stared at her, his coal black eyes daring her to continue..."

  "His coal-black eyes reflected the pale light of the nearly full moon above them. "I promise, I won't hurt you"

  "meeting the coal black eyes unwillingly, scared that Snape would delve..." (Delving, is that what it's called these days?)

  "Snape looked at the centaur with his coal black eyes, "Stay...""
#+end_quote

I'm not sure what was going on in the last quote with the centaur. I wasn't brave enough to follow the link.

**** /The only tears that coal black eyes shed are the ones they've stolen from their prey./

I'm glad you enjoyed that. But, seriously, I did some further research, and it appears that JKR *did* actually characterize Snape as having black eyes. Specifically, /cold/ black eyes (as in emotionless, frigid). At least that was the description in quote I could find^{Philosopher's} ^{Stone,} ^{ch.} ^{8.}

I'm guessing 'black eyes' is a exaggeration, and actually means eyes that are dark brown, to the extent that they appear black-ish in certain lighting.

Further revelatory research says that Alan Rickman's eyes are actually *hazel*. Now please share an anecdote if you have one, but I doubt you've ever been riveted, menaced, or been inexorably drawn into depths of a pair of /hazel/ eyes (warm, fuzzy depths).

The most menace I've gotten someone with hazel eyes was a dairy goat that was peeved because I brought dinner late.

And is the whole 'shining orb' colored an emerald hue? No, only the iris is. So are the calling the iris an orb in of itself? the iris for the most part looks pretty flat.

** Pet Peeves:

It's been a long time since the last update, and/or a million and one things happened in the last chapter. Please post quick recaps every so often. Fanfic is published serially, so you need to account for the possibility that people won't remember what happened last time. In general, you want to stop and ask, if I had to wait over a month before I started reading the next chapter, would I be confused, or is there something that helps me remember what's going on? I remember one time, in a LoK fic, a new chapter started with a flashback - but nothing to indicate that it was a flashback, just boom, straight into the memory. Talk about confusing. If multiple people tell you that a character is unlikable, and they're not supposed to be, then you should be concerned.

Your characters need to grow, because people change in real life. The only time you should have a character that consistently makes the same mistakes is when they serve as a point for another character, i.e., they should drop this person who isn't willing to change.

People don't have frequent several paragraph monologues on random topics in real life.

Spelling and grammar are important, as is overall organizational structure. If you need a beta, get one. Get one even if you don't think you need one. The occasional mistake is fine, it's when it becomes rampant that there's a problem.

Don't make silly spelling mistakes of things included in the books. Saying "Privat Drive" doesn't inspire a lot of confidence - if you can't even be bothered to get that right, then there's not that much hope for the rest of the fic. It is perfectly fine to keep referring to someone by their name. It's not repetitive to say "Harry said..." over and over. It's best actually, since most readers won't notice it - they'll gloss over that and focus on the actual dialogue.

On a related note, don't continually refer to a character using a phrase or nickname that you would never actually say to that character. You wouldn't actually call Harry The Chosen One in real life, would you? "Hey The Chosen One, how was your weekend, hey The Chosen One, pass the potatoes." So don't replace Harry with that phrase in non-dialogue portions. That goes with any character. It's just fucking weird to keep reading about the bushy haired beauty instead of Hermione.

Don't say "bad summary" or "I suck at summaries." Don't have spelling or grammar mistakes in your summary. These are other confidence killers. A summary is literally 2-4 sentences. If you can't get that right, or adequately describe your story, I'm not very inspired to read your fic.

While HP is a fantasy series, it's still rooted in real life. I need to have a suspension of belief to get through the magic part, but not to understand the larger issues of bigotry. Similarly, your fic needs to be somewhat realistic. Yes, sometimes people have a lucky week, or it seems like everything bad that could possibly happen happens in one day. But when that always happens, or one group always wins with little effort or minimal losses, or everything is solved by a deus ex machina out handwaving - it becomes unrealistic or unreadable.

** Oh boy, this thread is like for kid in a candy store gone bad. So many things that annoy the hell out of me:

- Bad summaries. List of relationship acronyms and "suck at summaries" or "more details inside" and begging for reviews in a summary.
- "shocked". I swear I get urges to punch my screen every time someone is bloody "shocked" in fan fictions. Shocked I tell you!
- Constantly switching POV. It is annoying where some writers constantly switch from one person to another, often revisiting same scene over and over, some even jump randomly through time. I think these writers imagine writing story like a TV show ... except it doesn't work. Annoying as hell and often kills any suspense.
- Author notes in the middle of the chapter
- Bad style. I mean basic things everyone should have learned in school. Paragraphs, line breaks, use of quotation marks. I'm not even mentioning spelling here. Simple structuring. Gosh how many people get this so so wrong.
- Basic grammar - I fully understand many fans are not native English speakers, but basics can be caught by spell checkers, thesaurus, simple Google search (names, spells, places, ...) why can't people get these basics right?
- "Golden Trio" - I might be wrong, but where the hell does this come from? It bloody irritates me.
- Manipulative Dumbledore. I can understand rebellious angst some teen writers feel and wish to think they know better, but so many "dumb" dumbles around it makes me cringe.
- Clearly out of character, acting way beyond one's age. 11 yo Harry suddenly all mature, investing in stock markets, having intense romances or Dumbledore saying "Hey guys" and "wassup" ...
- Legends... So many writers feel necessary to specially annotate their stories. Special formatting for parseltongue, thoughts, some uber elemental mind screaming, or even languages
- stories trying to cover every imaginable and unimaginable pairing and character in a single story. They often have summary consisting of little else than acronyms for their pairings.

***** Dead Poets Society. Not using 'very' is the best thing I ever did for my writing quality.

** I'm annoyed as hell whenever I read stories that are afraid to use the word "said" and instead use a ridiculous amount of words to replace it. He murmured, she muttered, he responded, she explained. Do I, as the reader, /need/ to be told that a character "responded harshly" to know that? Does the dialogue not speak for itself?

To anyone who supports this type of writing, I urge you to read the later Harry Potter books. Find a long chunk of dialogue and I guarantee that 90% of every word used to describe dialogue will be "said."

** "Alibi-Dialogue" as I like to call it.

When an author doesn't know how to explain something and does it in a dialouge with some sort of mentor-figure. Its ok if you do it once, maybe for the big thing that makes your character. But doing it every damn time is just lazy writing.
