I can't be the only one who would love to see what house-elves raised with Dobby's interpretation of freedom would be like. It would be so wholesome to see a little family of house-elves who all understand that freedom is not bad thing, but rather an acknowledgement and encouragement of an elf's desire to refuse an order that displeases them, and to otherwise serve faithfully- with decisions of their own thrown in here and there.

Please take me up on this! I don't mind what you do with it really, but somebody make a fic that has Dobby's children and house-elf politics and changing opinions in it. Please?


** That's in the outline for one of my WIPs, but I haven't posted that part yet, sorry.

** He has a secret child with Bellatrix Lestrange who used him for her depraved sexual needs while he was still working for the Malfoys. As the child stays there forgotten in the Lestrange house all those years while his mom in prison, he develops a hatred for how house elves and half-breeds like him are treated so he starts to plan a violent overthrow of the Blood supremacy based society. Later we learn that Voldemort tried to use Dobby initially for his experiments with Horcrux protections but he always managed to talk his way out of it. Also Bellatrix at first was reluctant to join Voldemort, refusing him three times before changing her mind. In an AU where Voldemort has won, years down the line he starts a war against Voldemort rallying to his cause House Elves, Hags, Squibs, Goblins, Centaurs and eventually he becomes the child of the prophecy.

  Now AU, 6th Year, following OoTP. Tired of the way Dumbledore and the Order treat him, and ready to face his destiny, Harry dedicates long hours to muggle and magical training to take the fight to Voldemort for a change. Slight HPGW, not shippy though.

*** It wasn't Winky, it was Sonja, who's an original character. Sonja asked Professor McGonagall for freedom (but continued working for the school on a contract basis) after realising that being bound to Hogwarts meant that people like Umbridge could order her to do things that were wrong.
