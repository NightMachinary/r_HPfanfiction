** Agreed. I think it's an overused thing in fics. Often there's many chapters spend on the process of becoming an animagi which is then used maybe a handful of times with questionable usefulness. The other end of that spectrum is of course the multiple magical animagus with an assortment of magical powers.

I'd actually like to see a fic that is more about the trio trying to become animagi for the purpose of becoming animagi. Not as a tournament thing (which is probably the most ridiculous reason) or a war thing. Just them being inspired by the marauders or having a reason similar to them. Because it is one of the coolest and most interesting pieces of canon magic, but like you say the usefulness in war or a tournament setting is very limited.

** It depends on the animal tbh. If it's an animal that can fly like an owl or a hawk or even a pigeon, you can bet your ass I'd be using it all the time.

Of course, I feel the need to mention this but everybody in fanfiction who uses the overpowered Animagus trope always has Harry turn into a huge badass stag/wolf/etc.

But straight up, you know who the people who used their animagus the most effectively were? Pettigrew and Skeeter. Say what you will about transforming a rat or a beetle, they can get into places that a stag or a panther or a badass lion can't. Nobody notices the Beetle as they're flitting about and the Rat can sneak through small tunnels. Sure your pride takes a hit but that seems a relatively small price to pay.

After that, Sirius' and McGonagall's form is the most useful - they both take the form of animals that are beloved by humans, can relatively go places in human society with McGonagall's form being slightly more useful as people tend to notice a big black dog while cats are more often ignored.

But you know who has by far the most useless animagus in all the series? James fucking Potter and his goddamn stag which everybody treats as being so amazing. If I found out that my animagus was a stag, I would never bother with it. Ever. A stag was only useful for helping with Lupin and being shot by muggle hunters. I'd much rather be a rat animagus than a stag animagus.

TL;DR Animagi with smaller animals seemed to get infinitely more use than the "big cool" animaguses.

*** A cat always sounded like the perfect animagus form to me. You can walk around freely in muggle areas (unlike a dog that'd likely be caught because its off leash with no owner in sight), you can easily climb stuff, you still get better hearing and sniffing, you can go anywhere in Hogwarts without raising suspicion (except maybe the Owlery, I doubt they'd like that), you can easily hide in small spaces, and you get to be rather fast. Plus people will likely tolerate you sleeping on a chair or bed without disturbing you. What else could you possibly want? No worries about someone wanting to squish you (like with the beetle) or freak out (like with rats, mice, etc), and you're not a novelty like with foxes, hedgehogs, or other common wild animals.

**** Yes, agreed - a cat is one of the best possible animaguses. I'll extend, however, that in the hands (or paws) of a clever witch or wizard, a rat is still better than a cat.

There are at this moment millions of rats living in New York City. I live in Boston and have seen rats literally walk down the streets. But one of the big advantages rats have over cats is just their size - they can go into places and crooks and crannies that even the cleverest cat will have problems getting too.

You do run the danger of being eaten but a clever enough human can cut down their chances of this happening. So I suppose it is a tradeoff.

A squirrel might also make a nice animagus.

Rats or birds would probably be my second choice for an animagus form, though, but I rarely see rats, too.

A bird sure would be useful, especially a common one. However, I think I'd generally get more use out of the animagus form as a small mammal rather than a bird. If we consider magic, there are more efficient methods to get to one's destination so I don't think I'd make much use of it. And I'm perfectly fine being a ground dweller anyways, lol.

Who is seen in the original heptalogy who is both an animagus and depicted producing a patronus? Only McGonagall; just because her patronus is the same as her animagus form doesn't mean everyone's is.

It's explicitly stated and depicted in the series that a person's patronus form is subject to change, whereas their animagus form is set for life. Following that logic, they couldn't possibly /always/ be the same, because one is static while the other isn't necessarily.

**** Animagi don't need have the same form as their Patronus. They can, and usually do, but they don't need to. Hermione would be an otter because her Patronus already takes after her personality or whatever. Harry's Patronus is a stag not because his personality but because his father was a stag animagus.

So it's likely Harry wouldn't be a stag, especially if stags represent pride like it probably did for James, just as Snape wouldn't become a doe just because his Patronus is one.

I've never read a fic in which Harry's animagus form is a stag, but I'd argue that Harry sharing that form with his father would have great emotional significance for him.

I can imagine a fic containing moments when Harry just transformed into the stag to roam secluded woods, enjoying the feeling of connection to the same things his father experienced. He might get a sense of peace from inhabiting the simpler animal mind for a while to get away from the stresses of the wizarding world.

Depending on what kind of fic it is, the animagus form doesn't need to be tactically useful in order to be important to the story.

*** To add on to your point, I believe that Harry's patronus being a stag is a symbol that is SPECIFIC to the nature of the Patronus charm---namely, a protector. It's a manifestation of James's protection/sacrifice for Harry. Symbolically speaking, the stag patronus is essentially the counterpart to Lily's blood protection---both of his dead parents are protecting him in their own way. The animagus form doesn't have the same protector meaning as the patronus form, and we already know that Harry and James had quite distinct personalities, so it really doesn't make sense for Harry to have a stag form.

** I think half the problem with Animagi is that most people always assume that Harry must be some kind of skillful predator or animal that's high up the food chain food be effective in combat or reconnaissance for the war. Which whilst true in some aspects it's not always the best plan, a wolf or any other predator is still a large target and unless he's moving when he transforms he's got to get into melee range to be effective. Now imagine Harry as a bluebird or sparrow somthing like Qrow from Rwby it's a small target much harder to hit than a wolf or other large animals and he could use to open up a multitude of flanking routes in combat of just doge spells.

I don't think changing form involves automatic communication skills, as you keep your consciousness when you change. You'd have to learn how to interact with them, or it'd be another version of a "human meowing at cat".

For example, I know crows have two different, but to a human ear, very similar sounding social sounds, that inspire very different actions in a group. None are aggressive, mind - it would just take effort in my opinion to get them right, as the difference is so nuanced.

Also, I don't think snake animagi automatically become Parseltongue. Based on that, I'd think that'd be true for other species.

**** A bit of both. It was an alt-universe where Voldemort died but the death eaters were still active I think. It was a dramione and 46 chapters in had barely touched on the relationship.

She used it to avoid talking to people and also listen in on what they were saying about her.

** There's a fic called "The Theif of Hogwarts" by bluminous8. Great fic but completely abandoned. A subplot is that he wanted to be some super cool jaguar or whatever, but became an adorable house cat and just slept everywhere. It's a nice subversion of the trope and gets him into some entertaining situations.

It's been years but I think it's rated M (though I don't remember any M-rated scenes, then again it's been years).

Few people learn how to do it, and only a few of them have forms they can or would want to use often.

What I would actually do with it depends entirely on what I become. If it's a bird, I imagine I'd fly a lot. Unless I was afraid of being eaten by something, in which case.. maybe not. If I was something aquatic, it would be similar but with less frequency.

Most four legged animals would be a lot of fun to run around in, I imagine. Particularly something agile like the different types of cats.

Experiencing the world with far greater, or even entirely new senses would be incredible.

Yes, using an animagus form in combat is almost always going to be a horrendously awful idea. Why the flying fuck monkeys would you turn into a muggle animal to fight a wizard? That reminds me of A Marauder's Plan where Harry uses his lion form to chase down a fleeing Death Eater. When the Death Eater realizes what's chasing him, he basically laughs and turns to attack Harry, who had to be rescued.

The most realistic one I've found so far is from Harry McGonagall. He is inspired by Minerva to do it, and it takes him like 3 years to master, and he's a cat. He uses it to spy on the Slytherins (so far).

** If one does a Pokemon crossover, I would become one certain Pokemon (Mew in it's shiny forme). Sadly it's already been done, but I have yet to see it properly done the way both canons allow. linkffn(Harry Mewter) is the closest I could find. Problem is, Harry doesn't appear to be a metamorphagus, which seems fishy given that Mew is a shapeshifting Pokemon. Nor does the prophecy or any house ancestry factor in to Harry gaining the abilities of a literal Olympus Mon containing the DNA of everything possible as Pokemon Canon says. Neither does the fic bother to explore much psychic powers usage or move/spell similarity. It doesn't really even cover how broken this can get. Seriously, this needs to be more cracklike than it already is. We don't even have references to some things and implications based on canon and fanon from both series.

** It'd be pretty neat to actually experience the world as something fundamentally different than a human. Snakes have pseudo-heat vision, the crazy angles of vision from things like chameleons or bees, intuitive magnetic sensitivity from birds... the list goes on. Whichever one you got would be pretty great unless you lucked out with something like an orangutan lol.

Besides that, sneaking into places you normally couldn't get into depending on the form would probably be all I'd practically use it for.

** I think the biggest problem with the animagus concept is that J.K. Rowling kind of ruined it.

It's introduced as a complex and advanced Transfiguration given McGonagall using it to showcase to her First-Year students the capabilities and usefulness of Transfiguration. It's also supposed to be pretty rare, though it's common enough that the Ministry has a registry for it.**

Despite that, both its difficulty and usefulness are undermined when we discover in PoA that 3 students still in school could accomplish it, one of whom, Pettigrew, is supposed to be fairly unremarkable and in GoF when Krum performs a (albeit, faulty) Human Transfiguration on himself which, had he done properly, would have been indistinguishable from an animagus transformation. After all, Krum keeps his mind despite having transfigured his head into that of a shark's.

So, those two points: If the animagus transformation is so difficult, what are the chances that 3 people accomplished it on a whim? At around the same time? Secondly, if you can effectively replace the animagus transformation with human transfiguration with as many forms as you want, is there a real purpose to becoming an animagus?

**: I just wanna ask, how completely useless would that Animagus Registry at the ministry be? Literally every example of Animagus transformations that we have, minus James, are animals so inconspicuous that if you decided to check every species of them for actually being wizards you'd become the most paranoid person on the planet.

McGonagall can transform into a Cat. Pettigrew into a Rat. Sirius into a Dog. Now if a Stag is walking around in the Ministry fine, check that fucker as an Animagus. Fair enough. But the other three? Jesus, that registry would be completely pointless.

I /suppose/ it would be useful for imprisoning them? Maybe they have defenses against it which, had Sirius registered, they would have been able to keep him in prison? That's the only real example I can think of.

** The most useful forms would be those that allow you a vast change in your abilities to move in some way. So aquatic or avian animals would open up a new terrain for you to move in unassisted. Small forms would allow you to sneak around undetected. Some, like maybe a squirrel, would also allow for some great climbing capabilities. And of course, in the end you're just an animal to the people around you. If you want to go unnoticed as a human, the form alllows for that as well.

But overall the uses are very limited, given that you have magic to compensate for all of them. I guess that would also be why so few actually bother with the ritual.

I personally like to see it in fics, because I think its just a cool ability to imagine. But I see where you're coming from.

A crested gibbon would be another nice forum to play around with. Or maybe a Nile monitor, which would make me the greatest judoka of times.\\

We have scuba gear. We have tunnelling machines. We have vehicles which can traverse almost any terrain. But we have yet to develop something which allows you to fly properly. Because renting the passenger seat in a Russian MiG every time you want to fly is way too expensive unless you are in the top 0.1% (1 flight = 18000€).
