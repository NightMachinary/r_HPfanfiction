** There was an excellent and pretty long one where Neville and Augusta are both transported to LOTR middle earth, each in a different place. Neville went on purpose to go a-heroing (with Dumbledore's help I think) but Augusta is sent there too by mistake because of some blunder of Neville's.

I think I recall Augusta threatening an orc to act as her guide (after ordering him to take a thorough bath in the river because he stank), because she supposed that Neville was also in middle earth and wanted to find him. Neville was either in Rohan or Gondor.

I think it was removed from fanfiction.net, but if anyone has a link to it in some other site I'd love to read it again! It was one of the best crossovers out there, and Neville and Augusta are never used in most fics.

**** The name was Not Quite a Maia, and the author was Naebody's Aunty, but the story has been removed from fanfiction.net and I can't find it anywhere else :( Hopefully you'll have better luck than me!

Edit: wait, got it! Here's the link: [[http://www.lotrgfic.com/viewstory.php?sid=2231&textsize=0&chapter=1]] I think fanfiction.net had a couple more chapters, but I might be mistaken though.

** There is the fanfic where Harry is raised by Deadpool and an accident with a wand caused Neville to be transported to Asgard where he is trained by the gods. ffnet(Thinking in Little Green Boxes) This is mostly a side gag though. Not sure if that is what you´ve been looking for. There is also The Long Game by inwardtransience, where he´s also quite badass but again he is a side character ffnet(The Long Game)

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)
