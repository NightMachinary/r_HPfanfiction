In canon the female characters are not as strongly written as the male characters in my opinion, we know things about them but they come off a little more flat and less dynamic. But I know the fandom can create whole interesting personas with literal crumbs, so wondering if there are any fics with really interesting, dynamic characterizations of female characters?

In particular, I'm looking for complicated and dynamic relationships between well written female characters. It could romantic, platonic, I don't care.

I find myself thinking about the complicatedness of male characters like Sirius, Remus, James, regulus and their complicated relationships with one another (I been in a marauders binge) but want to read about some more women too.

Doesn't matter which women or which era. Though I prefer not to read Hermione centric fics if I can help it but I know she's very popular to write about.


** Yeah! Totally get what you mean. We don't have a lot of good fics compared to fics with the male characters.

I loved [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29158347/chapters/71584359][Hold the Line]]'s Minerva McGonagall. The fic is Minerva-centric...complicated and brilliant characterization of her as a woman surrounded by men. Not really a female-female dynamic but I liked the friendship between Aurora Sinistra and Minerva in this one.

** Linkao3(The Never-Ending Road by Laventadorn) does a really great job of Fem!Harry & Hermione, and Fem!Harry & Astoria Greengrass, though it's /supposedly/ going to have a Harry/Snape romance eventually and that's gonna be a turn-off for some people (I say “supposedly” because we're 600,000+ words in and there's still nada, basically, which is good if you don't care about that aspect but probably torment for the shippers lol).

Linkao3(Victoria Potter by Taure) has a great Fem!Harry & Susan friendship, and Pansy and Daphne get some interesting characterization as well. I'm not terribly keen on Hermione's portrayal in this one, but luckily that's not a huge part of the story, just a recurring thing.

Linkao3(Welcome to Slytherin) is also nice.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Goblet of Fire. Future Snape/Harriet. (OotP - DH will continue in a separate story.)

** linkao3(coven by naidhe) it's kind of Hermione centric but it's split between her and Pansy Parkinson, other girls are bought in later. The synopsis sounds really cliché and tropey but it's not like that, it's an honestly brilliant read where Hermione and Pansy accidentally create a coven bond between them, temporarily boosting their power. Their dynamic is twisted and they become addicted to the thrill of the dark magic they perform together. We get a look into their psyches as they justify worse and worse acts.

There's a great fic centred around Tracey Davis, based on the premise that she's actually a Muggleborn called Tracey /Davies/ but Daphne misheard her when she said her last name and so the Slytherins think she's a pureblood. I'll try and find the title in my history. Edit: found it! 17 pages down in my history lol. linkao3(I rose from marsh mud)

  “The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen.” Hermione looked at him then, and smiled softly, “And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore.”

** linkffn(2407704) is mostly a Hermione/Theodor Nott romance fic but the premise is the Hermione, Katie Bell and Tracey Davis are captured by Death Eaters and given as spoils of war to whoever claims them. The three girls collaborate on escaping having a pretty good and realistic dynamic, behaving as you'd expect someone of their age to behave in a situation like that. Hermione and Katie Bell are well fleshed out and to a lesser extent Pansy Parkinson and Tracey. It has some disturbing scenes that hint at off-page rape and torture though.
