** I have compiled a list of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5wfnql/lf_fics_like_stages_of_hope/dea6lds/][Dimensional Travels similar to "Stages of Hope"]]. None of the fics in this list is included in that "More Frequently Recommended" one. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), is my current favorite one from this list.

--------------

IMO, the last 2 years have been the best time for HP fanfics. Many great stories have been completed since 1/1/2015, here are some of my favorites, and none of them is on that "Most Recommended List":

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), is by far the most popular fic on [[/r/HPFanfiction]]. I won't spoil too much, just read it and enjoy!

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is an excellent rewrite of the canon story in a very different AU. I like it so much that I wrote a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5bf1gs/lf_complete_stories_where_hermione_isnt_a/d9oc0z1/][quite detailed description]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is a superb dark!Harry story. It depicted a dystopian post Voldemort magical Britain in which the old regime thought they could betray the Vanquisher of Voldemort and get away with it. They were wrong, because the Dark Trio was coming after ALL of them. There would be no "All Was Well".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is another extreme AU where a very cunning Lucius Malfoy outmaneuvered Dumbledore in 1981 and had ruled magical Britain for the next 20 years. But Dumbledore would strike back with a vengeance after the next generation graduated from Beauxbaton. One of his agents sent to Britain, Ron Weasley, met a loyal Malfoy enforcer, Wand Leader Hermione. This fic has my favorite Ron/Hermione romance.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]], linkffn(11419408), is IMO the best canon-compliant, Year 7 Hogwarts story. Ginny and Snape are especially well written.

--------------

Several very interesting fics were first published during past two years and are still in progress:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871), dives deep into magical theory and social issues in magical world. Voldemort is not the biggest challenge here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), has the Ministry selling out Muggleborns to appease Voldemort after Year 4. One Year later, Hermione formed a Muggleborn guerrilla group and dished out massive losses to Death Eaters and their sympathizers. But Voldemort would strike back with a vengeance. This fic is approaching 500k words long, and didn't stop at Voldemort's defeat. Combat scenes and political intrigues are very well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10991501/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Serpent-s-Renaissance][Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance]], linkffn(10991501), has canon Hermione replaced by an OC, who had her outer appearance and memories, but was in truth a reincarnated Salazar Slytherin. Needless to say, he/she was not pleased with current affairs in magical Britain, and set out to fix things. The story is entertaining enough.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight][The Red Knight]], linkffn(12141684), has canon Ron reborn in a different universe. He faced great challenges because almost all key female characters were taking on very different, if not inverted, roles.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/Like-a-Red-Headed-Stepchild][Like a Red Headed Stepchild]], linkffn(12382425), is an idea originated from this sub. It's so far only in Year 2, but I think it's holding great premises.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]], linkffn(12212363), is written by the same author as the above story. Don't be turned off by its sympathetic reference to Margaret Thatcher, because the story is good, and getting better. The bad guys are quite competent and dangerous.

--------------

Finally, I'd like to recommend a new author on the scene: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/White-Squirrel][White Squirrel]]. Her medium length fics are ALL great reads:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12324284/1/A-Dramatic-Reading][A Dramatic Reading]], linkffn(12324284), is hilarious take on 'read the books' trope.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795), has Hermione sending her memories and powers back to her 2 years self, or 42 days before Halloween 1981. Hilarity ensued, but also several heart-breaking moments.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10132530/1/His-Mother-s-Love][HIs Mother's Love]], linkffn(10132530), is AU Year 6. A more assertive Harry bullied the Answers from Dumbledore in one 'private lesson' instead of the entire year. Things went much better afterwards.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978), has the UK government taking a more concerned approach to what went on in magical Britain. Chapters 5 and 6 are especially good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467), has Dumbledore taking the aftermath of CoS a little more seriously. Enjoy the subsequent fallout!

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again.

** Other than than what has been previously mentioned, I would recommend:

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613][Ignite]]

#+begin_quote
  A mysterious illness leaving a handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot.
#+end_quote

It has all the elements I wanted from a potential sequel to Harry Potter. It has an enticing, original plot. Interesting and well-developed original characters and accurate portrayals of important canon characters (Harry, Ron, Hermione etc). Ignite and its sequels ([[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327625][Starfall]], [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=332775][Oblivion]]) also have some very well thought out mysteries and moral dilemmas.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=335638][Not Fade Away]]

#+begin_quote
  She fights for a world she hates as much as it hates her. It never stops; not until the world of magic burns to ashes to be reborn, or destroys Lily Evans and all caught in her wake. From Hogwarts to the defeat of Voldemort, the rise of the bright young friends, allies, and enemies of the Order of the Phoenix - and how each and every one of them fell.
#+end_quote

Written by the same author as Ignite. It's sadly still incomplete, but is regularly updated. Similar to Ignite the characters are well-written and interesting. The plot is moving a little slowly, but is very entertaining.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=247000][Latet Anguis in Herba]]

#+begin_quote
  Slytherin House is a hard place to be in the run-up to the Second War. Any student has to worry about classes, careers, juggling the wishes of teachers and parents; a Slytherin gets the rest of the school's judgement, the internal politics of prejudice and choosing sides. How do the decent but cunning, the moral but ambitious, walk the thin green line?
#+end_quote

Written by the same author as Ignite and Not Fade Away. The author is very good at crafting likeable, realistic characters and interesting plots. This is 'technically' a prequel to Ignite. Sequels ([[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=259003][Shade to Shade]], [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293286][Falls to Shadow]], [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=318952][Beyond this Place]])

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]]

#+begin_quote
  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.
#+end_quote

Well-written, companion book to the Half Blood Prince. The characterisation of Ginny is spot on and despite following HBP closely it maintains originality.

  Milo, a genre-savvy D&D Wizard and Adventurer Extraordinaire is forced to attend Hogwarts, and soon finds himself plunged into a new adventure of magic, mad old Wizards, metagaming, misunderstandings, and munchkinry. Updates Fridays.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.
#+end_quote

Post Cursed-Child and stays true to canon personalities well. It is a nice family oriented story. Has a sequel: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12121323/1/Put-Your-Curse-in-Reverse][Put Your Curse in Reverse]].

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

Entirely humour centred and very, very funny. The series as a whole is incomplete. Sequels: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7330591/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff-2][Harry the Hufflepuff 2]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10843543/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff-3-Harry-s-Year-off][Harry the Hufflepuff 3]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]]

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

It's incomplete but is a well-written AU with an interesting plot.

  In the village of Godric's Hollow, the Dumbledore family is falling apart. Kendra Dumbledore is dead, and Albus is the unwilling guardian to his wayward brother Aberforth, and Ariana, their mad sister in the attic. But everything changes with the arrival of Gellert Grindelwald, violently charming juvenile delinquent with an obsession for the fabled Deathly Hallows.

An original take of the events in Godric's Hollow. The characterisation of Grindelwald and Dumbledore is well done.
