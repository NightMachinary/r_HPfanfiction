We've all read lovely fics where character development, romance, intrigue and plot come together to create something marvelous. You spend hours, days, weeks reading them, you come to the end-and you find something amiss. That, my duckies, is the lack of a proper fight scene. Not a duel, but a battle or even a series of battles where our characters struggle to stay alive in the force of overwhelming odds through brains, guile and/or power. So then, fellow fanficcers, which are the greatest fics featuring decent/awesome/epic fight scenes where everything's on the line and you're struggling with scrolling down because your nails are too busy digging into the seat! Fics like, for example, Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool which features kaiju and a goddamn battleship.


** Epic fight scenes are a staple of Shezza's Denarian Trilogy. linkffn(Denarian Renegade)

** linkffn(Ectomancer by RustyRed) is sometimes described as a bunch of amazing fight scenes, and just enough plot to attach them to each other. Sadly it's discontinued, but there's a bunch of amazing duels and fights in the already written part.

** Patron has a decent fleshed out story, and alot of fight scenes. It gets sorta graphic, but it's realistic fighting, not just stunner slinging.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.
