I know on the Reddit we primarily focus on the stuff that's posted on FFnet and Ao3 respectively, but to those of you who read on write on the smaller or more dedicated sites, have you noticed especially marked differences in the communities?

I recently crossposted a long fic to [[http://adult-fanfiction.org/][Adult Fanfiction]] and to [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org][Potions & Snitches]] respectively, and I've been super surprised by how big the response has been on both sites. On P&S, the first long fic has jumped up to 4k hits since it finished publishing a few days ago, and on AFF the hits have been great, but what's really surprised me has been how pleasant the reviews are. Proportionally, there's just so many more reviews, too - it's absolutely great!

I didn't realize there was such a capacity for non-smutty fics on AFF, but the response has genuinely really surprised me, like. I never knew before how much I liked the idea of a site without anybody under the age of 18 posting to it or leaving comments, you know?

Have you guys been surprised by the stats or response you've received in response to posts on smaller sites? Or maybe you've noticed some communities being particularly helpful or charitable with reviews?


** I would love to have found a site that was Sirius-centric to post my own stories on. They might have been more popular (also I might be deluded); but I don't think there is one. I'm surprised to hear AFF isn't just smut, perhaps I'll look there again.

I did have an unpleasant experience with DLP soon after I started writing so I wouldn't suggest going there unless you write a very particular type of story (the clue is in the name I suppose).

*** I'd really love a Sirius-centric site too, actually!

The main thing I've noticed about Potions & Snitches is that like, they actually have tags for the different "kinds" of Snape characterisation - most of those kinds I would consider to be completely OOC, but it's actually a really great way for people to enjoy different fanfics without having to comb through characterisations they disagree with, like, and that's most certainly a problem I have with a lot of Sirius fics.

And surely he has a big enough fandom that it'd be sustainable, you know?

** [[https://www.siye.co.uk][Sink Into Your Eyes]], a site dedicated to the Harry/Ginny pairing, has been around since /OotP/ was released in 2003 (if not earlier), so it's one of the oldest fansites that is still around (and yes, the main page still looks rather similar to [[http://web.archive.org/web/20030806010908/http://www.hgnetwork.co.uk:80/siye/][how it was back then]]). Its activity may have reduced somewhat, but compared to quite a few other sites that have been dropping like flies, it's still going strong.

**** Yeah, the early/mid 2000s feel of SIYE is partly why I love it (besides the H/G of course), probably because I wasn't in the internet fandom at the time. Especially the cursors that look like plus signs.

** That's good to hear about AFF. When I was looking into posting, AFF was one of the places I looked at and to be honest, I can't remember why I decided not to post there. I'll have to look into it again. I'm definitely interested in a place that's more populated by adults.

Lack of meaningful reviews is one thing that frustrates me a bit on AO3. Sometimes I feel like I'm putting stuff out into a black hole and as a writer, I'm always looking to improve. I'd much rather have someone say they think a story is crap and indicate why they think it's crap rather just say nothing. This is a thing I need to work on myself when I read, so I suppose I'm in a bit of a glass house situation!

** The smaller sites have been very welcoming, mostly (there are always some black sheep among the users). Since they're more tight knit communities, they end up being either extremely off-put by something they don't like, or incredibly happy to get more of the stuff they dig.

The most helpful community is definitely Dark Lord Potter, simply because you can expect to get somewhat thought out criticism and not just "OMG so great xD". But then again, DLP is a pretty harsh environment and some people misunderstand the "bring thick skin" disclaimer as a free-pass to be dicks.

Eh, for all their complaints about cliches DLP is quite narrow minded. I can almost predict which kind of fic will be praised by DLP (bleak outlook, cynical protagonist, some kind of twist or mind-fuck - it reminds me a lot of the kind of stories that have been heavily upvoted on [[/r/WritingPrompts]] ... as if the whole point of any story is to undermine expectations somehow [*]). It feels to me purposely contrarian in a way and is just as boring as a cliche if I can expect the opposite. It's like a TV show where every episode ends on a cliffhanger... it kinda ruins the effect.

[*] Seriously, I just looked at the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/75lr85/wp_youve_accidentally_drowned_your_genie_after/do7faoy/][top comment]] in the top submission right now on that subreddit and it's exactly as I described... I promise I didn't cheat.

**** Yeah, I definitely don't really read the majority of the stuff that has the DLP approval stamp on it, honestly. I appreciate that a lot of the people enjoy the stuff that I'd describe as "edgy", but I just find it very eye-roll worthy much of the time.

But hey, different strokes for different folks - I don't like the most popular fics on Wattpad, either.

***** DLP never stood as a guarantee that you'll actually like the story (except if you share the hivemind's taste). Its just a guarantee that the English used in it is on a certain level of quality.

**** Yeah, I know. Writingprompts is, as a friend of mine once said, the "crime-series" of reddit. You have a pretty similar formula in almost every top-submission.

And DLP, yeah... They have a real good grasp on technical stuff. If you want to hone the /craft/ of writing, you're right there. But the moment it comes to the creative part, the /Art/ of writing, you may want to be careful what you give them. No forum is immune to the circlejerk and the bubble, and DLP is no exception.

Yeah, I'm not mad about it. It's great when like-minded people come together and foster the kind of stories that they like to read. And there's some awesome stuff from that community (like Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived).

It's just important that it is understood that - as you said - a high technical standard doesn't automatically mean the writing is going to be always great.

*** Yeah, DLP is harsh enough, but I think that's easy enough to deal with once you settle in with the lads. The only reason I don't post there is because I write a lot of gay characters, and DLP just isn't the place to publish if you write that sort of stuff, to be honest.

I definitely think the idea of DLP as like, a scary evil cave on the internet where everybody is gonna rip you apart is just... Bonkers.

Rrriiiight. Because no teen has ever clicked the "Yeah I'm totally older than 18"-button before.

*** Well, yeah, sure they do, but AFF also will ask that people verify their ages with a picture of their ID if they suspect they're under 18.

They actively delete the accounts of anyone who doesn't then verify their age, like.

Oh, really? I didn't know that. Not sure how they qualify who to "suspect", but if they actually do it in a way that works my objection is moot.
