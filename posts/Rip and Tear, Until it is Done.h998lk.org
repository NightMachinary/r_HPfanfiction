I would very much like to see a “Harry becomes the Doom Slayer” crossover - maybe Voldemort becomes one of the Hell Priests.

I want to see a badass Harry taking on hordes of demons led by Death Eaters, ripping through them with steel and magic and lead.


** Maybe the Unspeakables are using the Veil of Death to siphon Argent Energy to power the protections that keep magical London separate from normal London and something destabilizes it during the battle at the Ministry.

Maybe Draco finishes repairing the vanishing cabinet thinking that it will let Death Eaters into the castle only to realize too late that Voldemort doesn't give a fuck and the other end of the cabinet isn't where he was told it was.

Either way Harry gets drawn into events that are beyond his understanding and he ends up having to do what he does best. Survive.

I like it.
