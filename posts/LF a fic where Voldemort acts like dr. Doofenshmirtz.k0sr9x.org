** Harry saw a small hole that there was no way he could fit through. But whatever Voldemort has planned was just on the other side according to Dumbledore. He needed to get through!

He needed to enact his last resort.

He transformed himself into a Platypus, his secret Animagus form that he had worked on with Sirius. Crawling through the hole led him into the room. /No extra wards, or anything,/ thought Harry. He bumped into a shelf, and something fell onto his head. Some sort of hat. A fedora? But that wasn't on his mind. Because not 5 feet in front of him was Lord Voldemort himself, whirling around to see what caused the disturbance. He looked confused to see a platypus for a moment. Then he spotted the white zigzag on the platypus's forehead.

‚ÄúAhh, Harry the Platypus. Your arrival is completely unexpected. And by that, I mean COMPLETELY EXPECTED!‚Äù

The dark lord casted a quick incarcerous, and Harry was quickly entangled in ropes. The first thing he tried was to transform back, but it was no use. As he struggled, Voldemort let out a maniacal laugh. ‚ÄúNow, Harry the Platypus, why don't you sit tight for a moment as I tell you my tragic backstory.‚Äù

Voldemort took a deep breath, then launched into said tragic backstory.

‚ÄúIt all started when I was just a little boy living in Wools orphanage. I was lonely, because none of the other kids liked me. Nonetheless, I was happy, because I did have one friend. Me and my pet garter snake, Snakey, were constant companions. I gave him my morning sausage, and he gave me his company.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúHe also she's his skin all over my bed, which was really annoying, but beggars can't be choosers, am I right?‚Äù He waved a hand. ‚ÄúAnyway, he and I were constant companions, and I was happy. But one day, this big mean kid named Billy Stubbs saw I was ignoring him while telling me to give him his lunch, because I was talking to Snakey. So he grabbed Snakey, and ran up to the top of the building. I pleaded with him, saying he could have whatever he wanted from me if only he would give Snakey back. But, that idiot child refused my offer, and threw him right out the window, on to the pavement. It seemed like Snakey was doomed.‚Äù A smile suddenly broke out on his face. ‚ÄúBUT HE LIVED!‚Äù And he went back to frowning. ‚ÄúAnd then he got hit by a car.‚Äù

Harry knew that the dark lord was not the greatest person, but that kind of sucked. He tried to tell him as much, but the only thing that came out of his mouth was a strange noise, like the clattering of teeth against each other many times in a short period of time.

‚ÄúBut today, I will enact my GLORIOUS REVENGE. /BEHOLD!/‚Äù

He pulled back a curtain, where some sort of mechanism rested behind. There were many spinning baubles and lights, and a single broomstick pointing straight out the front.

‚Äú/THE SNAKE-CALLANINATOR/‚Äù

Harry sighed internally. This was going to be a long morning.

/Meanwhile/

The twins were sitting in the common room, thinking up their next practical joke to pull on the Malfoy crew, when Hermione, Ron, Seamus, Dean, Ginny, and Neville walked in. But Fred noticed someone was missing.

Healthy characters and relationships for the most part, fun gadgets/activities of the day, a formula so tried and true that they managed to make an episode in cavespeak that completely makes sense despite the madeup language, and the music. The show is famous for the many (I think at least one per episode) [[https://youtu.be/0yM3Zh9TwtE][songs]] and how darn [[https://youtu.be/g6J_gyxtYIQ][catchy]] many of them are.
