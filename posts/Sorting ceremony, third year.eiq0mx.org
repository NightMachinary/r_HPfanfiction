"Hermione, did you notice we've got a lot of firsties this year?"

"I did. Hey, did you turn eleven this August?"

Half the new first years raise their hands.

"I think it's because of you, Harry."

"Me? How?"

"When you caused, well, you know what eleven years and ten months ago, a lot of people /celebrated/."

"..oh."


** Harry eyed the group warily then nudged Hermione, "Why did half of them turn when you said my name?"

Hermione sighed, why did boys have to be so dense. She handed the paper she'd been reviewing back to the tiny little first year, "Here you go Harriet."

** Still, it is better than naming your kid Albus. It is my headcanon that when Molly Weasley gave birth to her third son, she and Arthur wanted to honor Dumbledore and hence she named him Percival Weasley after Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, and just like Dumbledore, Percival Weasley became a perfect prefect and a big head boy.

Ugh and Snape regardless of how you feel about his moral compass still bullied Harry, like Albus Severus Potter reads like some of the worst fanfiction from 2004 era

***** Literally trash. A hundred reasons why that doesn't fit with Ginny and Harry. Of all people, Harry knows how difficult it is to grow up with expectations about you. He might as well have named his kid Merlin. Also, Lily Luna and James Sirius get to named after people they whole-heartedly love, but Albus Severus is ready for the biggest of all middle child syndromes. UGH. It sounds like something a pre-teen would pick to be edgy.

*** Thank you for this. I now headcanon that almost half the kids at Hogwarts younger than Harry were named Harry, James, or Lily.

Although what a mindfuck that would have been for him.

** That's why in the fic that I'm planning that'll probably never get written because I'm doing too much planning my main character starts school as a first year in book 3 and has 80 students rather than 40.

I would think the year after would be even larger because not everyone would have had accidental pregnancies conceived on november 1st. assuming the cutoff is august 31st to go to hogwarts, since that only really leaves a month of buffer to get kids to school (if conceived on Nov 1st then most would be born around august 1st)

There is some evidence to suggest that 3rd year wasn't very large though because hermione and harry miss the soring completely while waiting for mcgonnagall and it's not described as them waiting a very long time.
