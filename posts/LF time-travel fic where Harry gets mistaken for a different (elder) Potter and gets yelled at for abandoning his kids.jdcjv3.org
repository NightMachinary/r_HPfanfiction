:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember bugger all of this fic, except for one sequence of Harry being in Diagon/Knockturn Alley for some reason (I presume shopping, but I don't remember for sure) and hiding under a glamour or potion to make himself look older, only to be recognised by someone as 'Pureblood-Name Potter', who'd disappeared years ago and was presumed dead. The person proceeds to yell at him for disappearing and abandoning his children/grandchildren and he gives some 'twas the war' type excuse in response.

I have no idea about anything else for this fic. There could be a second Harry whom the elder raises, he could raise James, or he could be the only Harry about just masquerading and then has to pretend to be two people at all times in public from that moment of recognition onward. I also have no idea what the name was, but it was something Pureblood-sounding, hence the filler I chose there. :D

*** Ao3 or FFNet, I don't read on anything else.

No idea about relationships.

It's definitely either Marauders or Book-era though - the kid he was accused of abandoning was definitely either Harry or James.

I know it's not much to go on. Apologies for that. :)

** It's The Wizard Who Meddled With Time by Team Ozone but it's been removed from fanfiction.net and I think it's only available on [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/]]

*** i mean, does he really look like a carbon copy? i always just assumed it was due to the fact that he has a decent amount of his fathers features, alongside the fact they both wear glasses makes them look more alike than they are.

*** I think you might've responded to the wrong thread here, just to letcha know. The fic I was looking for had him look like an older Potter than James. :)
