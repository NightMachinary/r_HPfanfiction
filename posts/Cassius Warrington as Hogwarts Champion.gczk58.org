Based off[[https://www.instagram.com/p/B_eqmeCgbju/?igshid=blsckt9un99f][this link]] I just read on ig, what if a slytherin was the Hogwarts champion? Does anyone know any well-written stories where this happens, or is willing to write it?


** I don't know any, but here's my speculation:

*What would happen in canonverse?* Slytherins---and Warrington first and foremost---would use this as an opportunity to lord it over all other Houses. Snape would take every opportunity to award House points. Warrington would probably do reasonably well, since GoF wouldn't pick someone weak. (Well, there /was/ that time it picked a champion who panicked after being attacked by some creatures noted for their weakness and failed a task, and whom Barty Crouch Jr didn't even bother to Imperius during the Third Task; but maybe that was the best Beauxbatons had to offer.)

*What would happen in a typical fic with this premise?* The other three Houses (and Dumbledore) would take their frustration at yet another example of Slytherin superiority on the poor, misunderstood Slytherins. Warrington himself would turn out to be more friendly and supportive to Harry than Cedric, and introduce him to Ice Queen Daphne Greengrass, who happens to have all of Hermione's intellect and cunning but none of her flaws.

*Edit:* As pointed out by [[/u/The_Truthkeeper]], I had misremembered: Fleur wearing a skirt to the first task had nothing to do with said skirt getting set on fire by the dragon.

*** I don't disagree with your overall points, but:

Says who? There's absolutely nothing that absolutely says the Goblet picks candidates based on any kind of merit. The closest is Dumbledore saying the Goblet picks "which students are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup".

Or, as Seventh Horcrux puts it, "it's a lottery."

#+begin_quote
  Well, there was that time it picked a champion who wore unsuitable clothing to a challenge that involved dodging a dragon
#+end_quote

I'll give you her poor showing in the lake, but I'm not sure how a skirt is less suitable to wear while fighting dragons than the robes everybody else was wearing.

I'd expect that someone whom the Goblet judged as having no chance to have be considered unworthy.

I've just reread the scene. The dragon snorted and her skirt briefly caught fire. In my flawed memory, it created an association between Fleur wearing a skirt and losing points as a result of it, probably indicating some implicit sexism on my part. I apologise and will edit my post. Thank you for pointing the error out.

** linkffn(The Other Champion by Srikanth1808) did this well. It's complete through the end of GoF, not sure how far along the sequel is.

  Sequel to "The Other Champion": The events of the Triwizard Tournament have left the wizarding world in a lurch. New bonds will be made, old ones will be tested, and with the Ministry behaving like ostriches, the occupants of Hogwarts will face their biggest test yet this year. The time has come to choose between what is easy...and what is right.

** He's a champion in a pretty well-known fic. I don't remember exactly - I think it's /Pureblood Pretense,/ but I'm not sure.

There are plenty of Slytherin champions, most Slytherin!Harry fics will have him as the champion. I'd search either DLP or FFN for AU 4th year stories and you'll stumble across something eventually.
