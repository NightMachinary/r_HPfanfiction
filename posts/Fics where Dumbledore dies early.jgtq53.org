Hi everyone!

I'm looking for some recommendations for fics in which Dumbledore dies earlier than he does in canon. I would prefer it if the death took place at any point after his duel with Grindlewald (ie not a Gellert!Wins AU).

The House of Potter Rebuilt is the only fic I can think of that has this in the story.

Although I enjoy most portrayals of Dumbledore, whether good or bad, I'm interested in something that does not have chapter upon chapter of Dumbledore as a wizened mentor or mustache-twirling villain for Harry to overcome for a change. It would bring a huge AU element to the story, but I think the pay-off could be rewarding, regardless of Harry's character.

Extreme bonus points if he dies on Halloween of 1981. I have an idea for a fic with that premise percolating and want to see if it's been done before.

***** Yeah, that's the problem with most 'Harry returns to his eleven year old body' fics. It's just revenge porn for the most part.

It can scratch an itch, but it's not my preferred style of fanfiction.

  A change in Tom Marvolo Riddle's path to achieve his insidious plans meant that in 1970 Albus Dumbledore was happy to appoint him as the DADA Professor. 19 years thereafter, the legendary Albus Dumbledore was mourned by the entirety of Wizarding Britain. Now in 1991, Harry Potter enters his First Year in Hogwarts eager to meet the living legend - the enigmatic Professor Riddle. AU

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]]: This is a weird fic, a mixture of very interesting ideas and ridiculous moments.

** Argh I remember one where something Harry does causes Dumbledore to realize he is being lazy and suddenly we have competent Dumbledore who lures Voldemort to a spot and punishes him by trapping him in stone, in constant pain so its harder to escape so Harry has time to deal with Horcruxes. As he dies he hands a crown of power over to Harry that allows him to contact Merlin's council, so Harry has a bunch of wise advisors to help with his new role. There's more but that should be enough for someone to recognize it.
