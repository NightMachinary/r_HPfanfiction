Im looking for all kinds of fics (besides slash) where Harry gets contact lenses with interresting features. Im specifically interrested in fics where he can see through clothing on females! Other than that, as long as he gets some cool and interresting features then im happy :)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/12/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097): His new glasses were fitted with the special feature of seeing through clothes, but required activation. He peeped an attractive American girl even though he was together with Ginny.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED
