  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

  “Quiet,” Lexa whispers between kisses. “My soldiers are right outside.” Clarke pulls her lips away from Lexa hand and nips playfully at her fingers. “So dismiss them,” she says, humming another moan as Lexa's lips continue to trail down her neck. She wants to, gods, she wants to. But doing that is too suspicious. The logical thing to do is to stop. The logical thing to do is to escort Clarke back to the list so that she can watch Bellamy's joust with Lincoln before anyone notices that they're gone, that they're still inside Bellamy's pavilion. But Lexa isn't thinking logically, not when Clarke is pressed up against her, squirming and moaning and desperately clawing at her for more. “We should stop,” she says, more to herself than to Clarke, but Clarke isn't having it. She grabs Lexa's face and presses their lips together again. “Shut up,” she tells her and Lexa obliges. ORWhen Clarke is sent off to marry the King Bellamy Blake in a political marriage to unite the east and west, she accidently falls for his shield, Lexa, instead.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19444075][A Strong Connection]] a short Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint soulmate fic. The summary says it all *Summary:* “As you know, Mr. Wood, for a soulmark to appear a strong moment of connection must occur.” At that, Oliver blurted out laughing. “Sorry, I'm sorry, it's just, we bloody well did have a strong moment of connection! There was a moment where his elbow strongly connected with my head!" AKA, a Flintwood Soulmark Get-together fic

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334][chalk this one up as a win]] is another Flintwood soulmate fic and frankly, I like this one even better than the one above. Overall, you might want to check out the whole series as it features two other Soulmate fics in the same AU universe. One is a Drarry the other is Dean Thomas/Seamus Finnigan fic *Summary:* Oliver Wood wakes up in the Hospital Wing a week after his first Quidditch game ever with a head injury and his soulmate's thoughts wound around his left wrist. Frankly, he's more concerned about missing the Quidditch game.

Learning about Luna wasn't the point of the exercise, but Ginny's glad it happened anyway.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6454192]]) Wolfstar AU Post-Hogwarts, Sirius Black is searching for something, he's just not sure what. James has moved on-married and a newborn baby to content with. So deciding he is going to find out for himself what's out there in the world, he packs up and heads to a Muggle University in San Francisco. There he meets Remus Lupin, the mysterious Teacher's Assistant, who very clearly, has some hidden secrets. At first Sirius wants to sate his curiosity, but eventually finding out what Remus is hiding becomes a near obsession.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5328971]]) Another cute Wolfstar Au Auror Sirius Black is in love with a French Muggle. Forced to keep the fact that he's a wizard secret, he still wants to move things forward. Only things aren't as easy as they seem, which Sirius learns the hard way after taking Remus on a short holiday.

*Some Marvel Crossover fics*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17121188][The Best Avenger, According to Teddy Lupin]] is a short sweet Harry/Clint fic. Highly rec. *Summary:* The only thing Teddy wants for Christmas, besides the new Cleansweep, is to meet Hawkeye aka the best Avenger.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1272098][Your Soul is bound to mine]] is a brilliant series. Every work is Harry paired with a different Avenger (Soulmates) slash and het. Highly rec.

  Post-Hogwarts, Sirius Black is searching for something, he's just not sure what. James has moved on-married and a newborn baby to content with. So deciding he is going to find out for himself what's out there in the world, he packs up and heads to a Muggle University in San Francisco. There he meets Remus Lupin, the mysterious Teacher's Assistant, who very clearly, has some hidden secrets. At first Sirius wants to sate his curiosity, but eventually finding out what Remus is hiding becomes a near obsession.
