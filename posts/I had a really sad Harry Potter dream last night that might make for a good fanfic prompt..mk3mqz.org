Last night, I dreamed that for whatever reason, Tom Riddle was in Harry's year at Hogwarts and someone else, I don't know who, was the Dark Lord. Tom was close friends with Harry and Ron, and had Nagini as his familiar, while Harry ended up having his boa constrictor familiar from my fic, Hercules. They were fighting in the Battle Of Hogwarts, and Harry died saving Tom from a killing curse. Harry's snake Hercules died in the battle too, and Nagini was killed as well. After the battle, Tom and Ron were both grieving and comforted each other. Tom blamed himself for the deaths and devastated by the loss, thought about killing himself but Nagini reached out to him from the afterlife(I believe in a dream), and stopped him, saying she wanted him to live. Tom and Ron ended up living out their lives and when they died of old age, met Harry, Hercules, and Nagini in the afterlife.

Have you guys ever had a fanfic idea come to you in a dream like that?

Yes. It's currently in the planning stages, but I think it'll be a good story

**** Have you read the Hellblazer comics from DC? If so, then you're familiar with John Constantine and his infamous snark. Which, after a weird dream, spiraled into the idea of a wizard in the same year as the Golden Trio. Granted, I don't know if I'll have them interact or not, but essentially making him into the Anti-Hermione with regards to schoolwork and studying
