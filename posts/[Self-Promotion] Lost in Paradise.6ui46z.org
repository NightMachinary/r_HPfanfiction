I am currently writing a fic where James Potter survives while Lily does not.

Linkffn(12614809)

I am aware of the grammatical issues and I am currently working to fix them. Thanks for all of the feedback!

  James Potter survived the attack on Godric's Hollow by hanging out with Sirius. Facing depression at the death of the one he loves, he begins to fall into a deep depression. He tries to cope with Lily's death but it haunts him everywhere he looks and he feels himself turning into someone else. A story on the journey of coping with loss and depression.

** There's a number of grammatical errors and poor wording throughout. I like the idea of your plot, but your story failed to deliver.

If you are unsure about the spelling of a word, google it. Google will almost always provide you the correct spelling, whether it's a real word(in the dictionary), or a word from a fictional universe. When it comes to wording, read it aloud. Does it sound right coming off your tongue?

*** Thanks for the feedback. I know I need to improve. Reading Fanfiction has altered my views on canon.
