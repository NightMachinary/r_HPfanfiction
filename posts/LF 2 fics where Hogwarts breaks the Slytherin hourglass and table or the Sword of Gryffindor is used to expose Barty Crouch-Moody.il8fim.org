:END:
I remember two scenes but they may be from different fics, in one Harry discovers 3 slytherins were trying to assault somebody and Hogwarts throws all the slytherin luggage against the wall and breaks the hourglass and cracks the slytherin table. Harry has to tell Hogwarts to stop.

Another scene is that Harry summons the sword of gryffindor and plunges it into the floor of the Great Hall and everybody with a dark mark (Lucius, Snape, and 'Moody') grabs their arm and starts screaming.

Any help would be much appreciated!
