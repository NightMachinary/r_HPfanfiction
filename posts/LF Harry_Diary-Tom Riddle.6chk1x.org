** Can I Rec Harry Potter and the accidental horcrux?

It's not slash and only a part of the story includes diary Tom. However, it's a wonderfully written story about a Harry Potter who accepts the horcrux in his head as his mentor yet still retains his essentially kind, good natured self. There's no bashing. It's a really great story.

I also enjoyed lithium by grayclouds on ao3. Warning: it's a wip and possibly abandoned though still good

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** This isn't quite what you're looking for, but it's close. Instead of diary!Tom, it's Locket!Tom. The fic's very good, darkly funny, and quietly disturbing. Also, old by fandom standards since it was posted in 2006. Snape gets into the mix partway through, in case that's something you don't care for.
