the real Harry died 10 years ago. This Harry is just an illusion created by the collective belief of wizarding Britain. As Harry fails to save everyone due to not existing, people's beliefs begin to falter and Harry starts to seem weaker and weaker


** This kinda reminds me of American Gods. Maybe make it so magic itself is slowly dying off as fewer and fewer people believe in it.

** He would die in fifth year's smear campaign. Funnily enough, Voldemort would poof too, as Harry's blood was tethered by belief/faith/etc.

**** A HP fanfiction podcast - "Fanatical Fics and Where to Find Them". Recently there was an episode covering a fic involving a similar premise, though it was about canon!Harry rather than the type of Harry you refer to in your post. It just seemed like such an unusual request that I assumed you'd been listening to the podcast

** I'd honestly prefer if he was somewhat tangible, but heavily influenced by the belief that created him. It would be an interesting Horror scenario if some politician Lex Luthor'd it and as a result of smear campaign many people believed 'Harry' went Dark and EVUL.

Cue 'Harry' drinking in the new belief and changing to match... Of course, as 'he' was opposed, but won and won and won... The legend would grow, and so would he until all hope would be lost.

â€‹

If you needed to examine such 'Harry' up close, you could have the quality of faith matter too - so a little girl believing in her heart that despite everything Harry would not hurt her would be safe, if traumatized - because adults couldn't produce that pure a belief and after feeding him dread for years, the conventional methods wouldn't work.
