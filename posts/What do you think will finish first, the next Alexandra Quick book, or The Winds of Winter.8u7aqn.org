I am still optimistically assuming that both books will eventually be completed. Though I am skeptical about the book after both. Which do you think will finish being written first?

** I think of these things like an oasis in the desert:

Odds are, they are probably just a mirage while you die from thirst. But eventually you might stumble across one and what do you know, you've found water.

** is Alexandra Quick still being worked on at all? Might as well ask when the next chapter for HP&TBWL comes out. At least with Winds of Winter we know it's being worked on, and there's actual pressure and financial incentive to get it done sooner rather than later.

While still vague, the author's updates about them writing are more detailed than anything GRRM has said in years. She actually mentioned having finished a specific number of chapters over a specific time period in the Dec update.

**** Inverarity has a livejournal. Last update I read on AQ was at the end of May, where it was basically "there's no ETA and the writing is slow going but it is happening".

*** Alexandra Quick is. It's more of an original story set in the HP world though. However it's great so I highly recommend it even if you don't usually like OC stories.
