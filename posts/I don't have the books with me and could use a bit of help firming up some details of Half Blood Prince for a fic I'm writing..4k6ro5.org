I'm writing a story that takes place in Half Blood Prince. It's a very Harry Potter centric fic where he's suffering from delusions and breaks from reality exasperated by grief and the Horcrux. I had it up before but now I took it down for a good rewrite/actually finishing the darn thing how many years later.

Anyways, I'm trying to keep it (book) canon compliant but I'm struggling with what happened before he goes to Hogwarts and how to modify it accordingly:

- Since I'm not doing the whole Slughorn thing Dumbledore isn't picking him up. Would Lupin (or Lupin and other Order Members) be a reasonable alternative or would the security risk be too much? What way did Harry get from Privet Drive to Burrow/Grimmauld in previous books?

- Also is there any reason besides seeing Slughorn and getting Slughorn employed that Dumbledore picks up Harry?

- Also did Harry even go to Burrow/Grimmauld before his 6th year? I believe so but I can't for sure remember.

- If so, who was in Grimmauld at the time, was everybody there always or just for meetings?

- Was this the year Harry yelled at his friends about keeping secrets/not informing him of stuff or was that OFTP?

- What's mentioned about the aftereffects of the Department of Mystery Battle? Does Ron/Hermione have any visible or noted physical or psychological effects from it?

- Was Ginny actively flirting with Harry by this point or did it start later in the year? Can I just ignore her reasonably or does she actually do anything important before Hogwarts? It's not a romantic fic by any means but I don't want to ignore her completely if the book put emphasis on her at this point.

- Any really important social interactions between Order Members/Harry's friends that most people would remember and would notice if I didn't acknowledge?

I appreciate any answers you could give, I don't feel right searching the Internet for a pirated copy and getting the books from my sister's place isn't possible in the near future. Thanks!


** Nobody is using Grimmauld Place in this book bc Sirius is dead and they're afraid Bellatrix will be able to get in. Harry's picked up 'a mere fortnight' into the holidays, so in mid-July. They go to the Burrow, but there's not many Order members around - besides Tonks who's getting tea and sympathy from Molly. OotP is the yelling one - Harry knows all about the prophecy in HBP (and tells Hermione and Ron when he sees them in the summer) and the Order and everything.

Ginny is dating Dean Thomas right now and they'll be together until March or later (whenever Aragog dies) in canon, so no flirting, but she's pretty friendly with Harry. Ginny, Ron, and Hermione appear to be psychologically unscathed by the DoM ordeal - it's mostly Harry grieving for Sirius.

Dumbledore picked up Harry for security purposes; visiting Slughorn was the added bonus. It's still completely plausible for Dumbledore to get him via Side-Along. In DH the original plan was for Moody to Side-Along Harry, so that is also a feasible option. Really, any high up Order member could take him: Lupin, Shacklebolt, Tonks, etc.

Previously, hes travelled via broom (OotP-the Advance Guard), Floo (GoF with the weasleys), and Knight Bus (PoA). Side-Along is the most secure method, followed by Floo. Brooms are necessary if they need to avoid magic. Knight Bus is not a secure mode of transportation if they want to avoid DEs and people in general.

The kids spend the summer playing Quidditch and making fun of Bill and Fleur (who are also staying at the Burrow - actually I'm not 100% on if Bill is, but I know Ginny's got to share with Fleur). Fred and George have moved out already. Hope this helps!

** I strongly advice you to read the series again before you start writing. I'm sure you can get it second-hand for cheap. Your memory of canon is very faulty, which may lead to adoption of some very bad fanon. The current answers in this thread are faulty as well, btw.

Dumbledore picking Harry up was important for several reasons, mainly talking with the Dursleys and arranging things for the next summer, as well as discussing Sirius' will and summoning Kreacher, to check if it was safe to keep using Grimmauld. If you don't want to do this scene, just let some Order member side-along-apparate him.

Harry spent two summers in the Burrow and one summer in Grimmauld at this point. Dumbledore indicated that they will keep using Grimmauld as headquarters.

Christmas has some important interaction with Lupin.

Any particular reason you're not doing Slughorn?

*** Yeah, I don't want to adopt bad fanon, it's truly been a while since I've read canon. I would say that this is especially true for OFTP and HBP since I've only reread them twice compared to the dozens of times for all the others. I could really use a reread on all of them to get the Weasley dynamic right among other things, reading fanfics just doesn't always cut it. I'll see how soon my sister will be coming over next and see if I can convince them to bring them over then, it's too tedious for me to do a 3 hour bus ride in total just for books and I don't currently got money to buy my own copy.

The reason why I'm ditching the Slughorn scene is that Harry is in such a state in my fic that it would be impossible for him to do a convincing job with Slughorn. Maybe I should just have Dumbledore pick him up, see the mess that he's in and do the testing for Grimmauld/Kreacher and just bring him over there? I kind of wanted Lupin to see him first and start their character development (which is going to be slightly different then canon, both a bit stronger and a bit more tense if that makes any sense) so maybe he'll enter the room first then they'll enter the living room with Dumbledore for a slightly rewritten version of the Dursley scene.

Anyway, thank you very much, your information is enough for at least a rough draft until I get the books again.

** 1. Just portkey his ass, or side-along him. The Ministry is still operational, so magical transportation like a portkey is still viable.

2. None, really. Security reasons, but then again, whos gonna be a danger to Harry if he apparates?

3. Yes. Burrow the first time in the summer before second year. Grimmauld Place the first time before his fifth year.

4. Basically the entire Order when meetings were going on. If Harry saw them all, I don't know, but he got a plausible chance to have a good overlook over every member of the Order. I forgot who actually lived there besides the Weasley, Sirius, Harry and Hermione.

5. That was OotP.

6. Psychological effects for sure. Grief for Sirius, worry for Harry but not much more than that. Ron got these brain-scars thingies (how those looked, don't ask. That was a minor detail) and Hermione had to heal from a pretty bad cursing, but the books focus was completely on Harry's grief for Sirius.

7. Nope. She's together with Dean. Eternal love and everlasting bond between hearts kickstarts late in the schoolyear.

8. None that I remember to be overly important.

** Dumbledore comes to 4 Privet Drive to retrieve Harry for a number of reasons. He takes time to chastise the Dursleys for doing much less than he expected of Harry's family, while assuring that Harry will still have a chance to stay there the following summer.

Dumbledore gets Harry to take command of Kreacher, thereby proving the security of Grimmauld Place as headquarters. Up until then the Order had been avoiding it. Even if you skip the Slughorn stop, Albus brings Harry to the Burrow via Apparation as a first demonstration of the process. This helps him by appearing informed when others get anxious about Apparation classes during the year, and emphasizes Harry's allegiance to Dumbledore, since the Headmaster personally handled this relatively small task for Harry. Albus also tells Harry that he should trust his friends with the Prophecy.

Most of these things wouldn't be accomplished by Lupin picking him up. Regardless, the Order is quite careful about letting anyone in the Ministry know of Harry's movements, so they wouldn't go with Harry being ferried in a flying Ford [2nd year], taking the Knight bus [3rd year], going by Floo [4th year], flying a broom [5th year] or using Muggle transit [6th year movie, though Harry only went a-flirting].

*** Do you think that Lupin AND Dumbledore could work? I could use the extra character development with Lupin there but I wouldn't want to take away all the benefits of Dumbledore picking him up either. Does Lupin know how to Apparate or at least it is assumed that he does?

**** If you'd rather that Lupin and Harry bond ahead of time, I'd say have Harry contact him so that they can grieve together (and maybe not waste time at the Dursleys doing absolutely nothing). Lupin would be able to come visit Harry well ahead of Harry's Dumbledore-approved migration to the Burrow. They'd be able to work out the Grimmauld situation and Dumbeldore could still show up to side-along Harry to join his friends following a brief Dursley harassment.

I'm fairly certain Lupin can apparate with the best of them since he did come to fight in the Department of Mysteries battle. Whether Lupin side-apparates Harry a few times to prep him for the headmaster's visit is up to you.
