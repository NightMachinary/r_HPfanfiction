Hey guys i'm looking for some fics where Harry has a familiar or a least a pet that he is deeply connected.

I've already read some, but most of them just forget about the animal in some time (Like prince of the dark kingdom even if it's a very good, fic and one of my favorites, one of the things that i didn't like is that Nagini and Harry's cobra didn't have any role in the plot and by the 100 chapter both were forgotten)

What i want is a well written fic where Harry has some animal that is very close to him.

The animal can be anything.

-No slash pls

-No Dumbledore bashing.

-At least more than 15 chapters.

-If there's pairing, i would like some different girl to be with harry (Don't like H/G or H/Hr)\\
But i know that it can be difficult to find something like this so i just would like that, if Harry in the end ends up with Ginny or Hermione there's no problem.

That's it ! ^^

**** I really like unusual pairing.\\
And i've read some with Hedwig (Ones where she's an animagus or just a very smar owl that can assume human form)\\
And even if it's weid, i like it.\\
But It's not what i'm looking for.\\
I'm searching for some fic that shows Harry having a bond with some animal, just like Eragon and Saphira from Inheritance.\\
The Harry/Hedwig pairing is more of a romance focused fic.

  While searching the Black Library for something to destroy Riddle, Harry is led by his oldest, dearest friend to an ancient tome. After reading it, their lives are further linked and forever changed. Very unusual pairing.

** Hedwig Slightly Unhinged if you're in a mood for a bit of crack. This had me rolling, especially the second scene that Harry talks to the twins after the GoF spits out his name. Not much of a spiritual connection between the two, but Hedwig is smart and manipulates the fuck out of Harry's life.
