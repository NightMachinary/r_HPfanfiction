when James tries to take credit for Harry's quidditch skills, Lily scoffs, so they have a match where James is smug about beating her and then she utterly decimates him.


** Yes, because Lily already isn't portrayed as perfect enough in fanon.

**** James was an animagus at what, 15? Helped create the marauder's map? One of the best transfiguration students of his age group? He had plenty of things. This idea mostly came from just a random tangent when I was thinking of timetravel fics, and imagining James bragging to Harry about stuff, and Lily is responding to them all like, "Yes... I agree... Totally true... Wait hold up."

​

Wasn't meant to be a serious prompt about the possible inconsistency in portrayals of characters in fanon.

***** He was the /best/ transfiguration student his age at Hogwarts and probably like 3rd best at transfiguration in the country when he died, after Mcgonagall and Dumbledore

*** Not sure what you mean, the common fanons concerning her are that she was god-like at charms (which is also canon), that she was pretty good at potions (but snape was better, also canon), and that she found/developed and cast the sacrifical protection on Harry.

Meanwhile, James was a quidditch prodigy, a transfiguration prodigy, an animagus at 15, created a never-before seen piece of enchantment and duelled Voldemort to a standstill for at least a short time.

**** Yeah but she has no character flaws. She was a loyal person who stood up against bullies and cared about her friends. A self sacrificing parent and a top student. She also defied Voldemort three times. The only negative quality the fanon gives her is that she's occasionally a bit of a stuck in the mud and can be a bit of a shrew. But that's not even all that common.

***** Oh and absolutely oblivious to any interest Snape might have given and anyone other than James only due to James sticking it in her face that he likes her

*** Harry pulled off, what we've been lead to believe, an incredible catch his first time on a broom. In my head, Lily and James are 17-21 age, so she's ridden a broom a few times, possibly played pick-up games on the side. You are correct, it is incredibly improbable, but so is Harry doing what he does. Thus why its a prompt and not a serious conversation about the skill differential of the Potter Parents on broomsticks.
