He didn't survive Avada Kedavra in the forest or it happened earlier

I want to see how others cope with his death and the results of war without Harry being there

Also don't mind if he actually survived, but faked his death/was kidnapped or whatever

Please and thank you!!


** A very different scenario, but Harry's death and reactions of others to it are very well written in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1067936]] . WARNING: it is quite brutal description of a suicide, dead body, etc. Triggers for PTSD or something like that are overflowing from this story.

** I really like the series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1401373][Harry Potter without Harry Potter]]. The first two years are complete, but unfortunately the rest is still to be written. linkao3(19339288; 19345108)

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)Year 1: Ron Weasley is not as alone as you might expect.

  Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world ruled by the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James.
