Consider this premise; rather than being metaphor for depression, Dementors are death avatars, akin to typical portrayals of the Grim Reaper.\\
Being embodiments of death, their presence frequently triggers anxiety, grief and gloom (as people would feel when a loved one passes), but they aren't malicious and can even be compassionate and helpful towards humans.

The Dementor's Kiss, rather than being a fate-worse-than-death, does not destroy the soul; it extracts it, but the soul is safely kept inside the dementor's body and can be retrieved and restored to its former body unharmed. Thus, the Kiss can be used as a form of imprisonment for the most dangerous criminals, or as a reversible method of execution for the utterly evil or those who made a deal-with-the-devil (who might otherwise, depending on how religion works, be facing eternal damnation if not Kissed).

--------------

So...given that premise, how would parts of the plot change if the Dementors were good guys and their Kiss wasn't destructive?\\
Prisoner of Azkaban: The dementors successfully kiss Sirius and Harry at the lake, only to learn that a) Harry isn't a bad guy, quick, put his soul back! And b) wait, this Sirius Black guy isn't actually a bad guy either?\\
Goblet of Fire: Barty Crouch Jr. kissed, job done! Wait, shit, you need him to testify? Right, gimme a moment to sick him back up...\\
Order of the Phoenix: Hang on dude, that's not a Death Eater, that's that Harry guy! Remember? Why'd Umbridge go and send us after him?\\
Deathly Hallows: Dude, Potter! Glad I found you, that Umbridge git is forcing us to kiss Muggleborns, can you do something about her?

*** Well, the opposite of sucking the soul out would be blowing the soul in, so...now I'm thinking of that Black Magic scene from The Three Caballeros.\\

"All is not lost, miss Granger. While dementors are capable of taking souls, they are also able to return them, and they are not nearly as vile and terrible creatures as they seem...my apologies, Mr. Ukadangala."\\
The dementor just nodded at Dumbledore, before bending over the comatose Harry in his bed at the hospital wing. As a fretting Hermione and a calm Dumbledore watched, the cloaked figure carefully leaned down, lifting Harry's head and turning it to the side.\\
"I don't get it, isn't it going to kiss him again? To put his soul back?" Hermione whispered, but Dumbledore just lifted a finger for quiet.\\
The dementor moved its head in, pressing its mouth not to Harry's lips, but to the unconscious boy's ear, before taking a deep rattling breath and-\\

** Dementors aren't really well-explained in canon, because their description contradicts what they actually seem to do. It is CLAIMED that they suck the happiness out of people and steal their happy thoughts and emotions, but what we SEE happening is that they appear to draw all of your bad memories to the surface. Are they feeding on happy memories or bad ones? Are they feeding on the EMOTIONS, or the memories themselves?

If Dementors worked exactly the way we are told they do, then people being attacked by them would logically become euphoric, dazed and overwhelmed by all of the positive and happy memories that are being drawn up out of them. They would only become depressed and emotionally destroyed after being heavily preyed upon.

I suspect this is mostly Rowling not doing a good job of explaining things and also probably not fully thinking about the consequences of what a Dementor attack would actually look like. But the apparent problems with Dementors has caused some authors to speculate that what they're actually doing isn't really what we are TOLD they are doing, so the option is definitely there to tweak them. Presumably what they are actually doing to people is lost or distorted knowledge.

*** The way I take it is that there is no “drawing up” of memories. They feed on (and thus suppress, maybe flat out take for long term exposure) your happiness and happy memories. With those suppressed or missing, your bad memories are more prominent.

TLDR: I believe that their aura isn't one of sorrow, it's one of no happiness and thus it /seems/ sorrowful.

**** I cannot possibly imagine why you would believe their aura is merely a "no happiness" zone. Harry ACTIVELY hears his parents being murdered when a Dementor draws near. Other people also seem to be overcome with despair or experience various kinds of audible hallucinations. If a Dementor was merely a "no happiness" existence then somebody could sit next to one on a train doing a crossword and be perfectly fine. A no happiness creature wouldn't be water-boarding you with your worst memories.

***** I know that the logic isn't airtight. It doesn't have to be since, /magic/ and /headcanon/. I'll try to rephrase what reasoning I do have though.

I think that the reliving of horrible memories isn't caused by the dementors directly, it's more of a side effect. As the dementor feeds on happy memories and emotions, their opposites become relatively. For those people that have /really/ negative memories, that is overwhelming. So, with this headcanon. Harry doesn't hear his parents being murdered because the dementor draws up the memory, it's because he temporarily can't remember anything positive to take it's place.

*** Hmm...good question. If the rails of the canon were followed up to the point where a good!dementor acting changes things, then I'd assume no, it's not widely known.\\
The wizarding world is pretty racist after all, but even if they weren't, most people would assume that the grief-causing, scary black hooded figure that sucks people's souls out is an evil thing.\\
 \\
Maybe in this scenario, if Dumbledore is aware that dementors are actually fairly benign, perhaps that's why he would be tolerant of having them at Hogwarts in third year. Having soul-sucking monsters around to keep a mere murderer away doesn't make much sense otherwise...

**** I thought Dumbledore was furious at the notion of dementors around Hogwarts, and refused to let them enter the grounds? It was the ministry that kept forcing them on the school, so he agreed to let them guard the gates to the grounds as a compromise. He was really angry when they came onto the quidditch pitch though.
