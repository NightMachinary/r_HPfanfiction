Hello!

I would like to know if there are any time travel fics where Harry doesn't care about the timeline and actualy uses every advantage that he can. I don't care if he is with Dumbledore, Voldemore, or if he is loyal to himself alone, just that he uses his advantage to de best of his abilitys.

So no canon rewrite with some diferent lines like most time trave I have seen.

Thanks!


** *Reunion*, linkffn(4655545), has its second chapter named 'Screw History'.

Other time travels where Harry completely screwed the previous time line:

*Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855)

*Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw*, linkffn(11574569)

*Returning to the Start*, linkffn(10687059)

*Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is*, linkffn(10610076)

The war scenes are just priceless, and the way the author has managed to bring Grindelwald into the mix and not messed it up is really great as well. It's a really good book.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
