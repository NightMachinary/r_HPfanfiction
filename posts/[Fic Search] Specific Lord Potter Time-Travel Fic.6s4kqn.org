I remember reading this Harry Potter time- travel fic and I've been looking for it, but I can't for the life of me remember what it's called; but I do remember that it had an absolutely hilarious repetition of Harry's 5th year where he took the mantle of Lord Potter and completely and utterly destroyed Fudge and Umbridge during his Wizengamot trial (I think he even caused Fudge to inadvertently call his Undersecretary Umbitch). I also remember that he used his foreknowledge to show Amelia Bones the Dementors that Umbridge sent after him. Any ideas?


** linkffn(7674649)

Not bad but I've read better; that Fudge and Umbridge scene is funny though. Let me know if you want to explore this genre with Harry/GInny some more I have several I could recommend.

**** Backward with Purpose is a masterpiece and one of the best fanfics EVER written: linkffn(4101650).

Erasing the Future while not finished yet is still getting sporadic updates and if you can handle that then its also on the list of one of the best: linkffn(2833136).

Harry Potter and the Time Mage is about the same quality as Magical Time except older if that makes sense: linkffn(2114097).

Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past while not finished is worth the read because what is there is good: linkffn(2636963).

If you are looking for something VERY long there is the Amulet of Time series by Luna the Moonmonster that starts with The Age of the Founders. linkffn(844334).
