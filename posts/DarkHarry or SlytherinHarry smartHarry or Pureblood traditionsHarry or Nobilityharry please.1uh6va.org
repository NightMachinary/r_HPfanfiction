I am looking for things like "The Sacrifices Arc/Saving Connor" or "Poison quil."

Preferably either slash or no romance. If it's straight romance, please don't have the female characters be annoying. Things like "Amortenia" by excentrykemuse are fine, for heterosexualstories.

I don't really have any squicks.

*** I enjoyed this. The first couple books are way too close to canon in my opinion but once they diverge more they are quite good.

** Darklordpotter has a billion stories like this in their library, so you should check that out. It's fairly easy to find good stories on there, and most of them fall under the categories you describe.

Off the top of my head, I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]. Harry isn't Slytherin, and he isn't particularly dark (though possibly more than in canon), but he is most definitely smart. It's a time-travel fic, and the main pairing is Harry x young!Bellatrix. The pairing is not too "in-your-face" though. I really recommend this one.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

*** I'm not a fan of bellatrix's character, because it annoys me that people have her be either super good or super bad. She's simply an insane person. She had dementors around her for years- that's normal.

Thanks for the site. Found some good stuff there :3

**** Haha, she's mostly depicted rather ambiguously in her pre-insanity years. I know what you mean though.

Have fun reading!

I really didn't like this stuff, but it sounds like exactly what you are looking for.
