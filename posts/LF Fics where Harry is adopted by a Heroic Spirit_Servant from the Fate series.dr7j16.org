Exactly what it says. If there's a story where Harry is a Master in Fate/Grand Order, then that's good too.

No slash!


** Fates Gamble by Lupine Horror Harry is raised by Medusa's sisters and Zelretch. He becomes a master and quite godlike towards the very end, but it shows actual growth and not just boom godhood. Has a sequel that's still being written very slowly. Also is a harem tho no HP girls are apart of it just Fate Girls
