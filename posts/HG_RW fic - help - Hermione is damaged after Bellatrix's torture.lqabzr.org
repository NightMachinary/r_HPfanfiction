Hi there,

I'm hoping one of you can help. I can remember a fanfic where Hermione has been captured and tortured at Malfoy Manor. She becomes locked in, mute almost and loses control of her magic. The fic was RW/HG. Here are some key scenes (some may be misremembered red herrings)

- Ginny helping Hermione bathe and Hermione scratching her arm. She asks Ginny to read her scar (mudblood) but Ginny refuses. Then Hermione says 'not so clever now Mudblood' - a flashback to Bellatrix's torture.

- as she recovers, Hermione goes downstairs by herself one night/morning. Ron wakes up the morning and is upset that she did so and berates her. Mrs Weasley tells him off because Hermione is proud that she has managed something so independent.

- Ron Harry and maybe Ginny go to Gringotts with Ginny as Bellatrix. Hermione sees them leave from her window and loses control of her magic, blasting a hole in the side of Shell Cottage.

- Fleur is charged with looking after Hermione at the burrow (I think) when the final battle kicks off. She apparates to Hogwarts to fight and Hermione grabs her to side along, worried for Ron. Ron sees her and is worried (she's not capable of fighting)

- after the war is ended Hermione is taken to St. Mungo's where they try to treat her. Hermione becomes increasingly distressed as the treatments fail to work, culminating in Ron taking her home when he comes in to find her terrified and covered in vomit.

- finally they find a journal Snape left where he details what happened to her and a possible cure.

- they cure her! Yay! There is a sequel where Hermione and Ron get on with their lives. Hermione is still a little weaker and Ron is starting to become secretive. Seamus Finnegan and some others have started to hunt Death Eaters as a vigilante group. Ron secretly starts to join in.

I really hope this ring's a bell with someone! Seems I remember everything but the title! ðŸ˜‚
