  Harry went into the forbidden forest to let Voldemort kill him, but was taken prisoner, instead. He is believed to be dead, and Ginny, Ron, and Hermione struggle to find a way forward. Canon is followed up to Chapter 34 of Deathly Hallows. Please R&R.

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?

  Every wonder exactly how long Albus would have waited for Harry at King's Cross at the end of Deadly Hallows? A small bit of fluff asking the eternal question "If Death had an alias, what would it be?". Lunar Harmony H/Hr/L at the end

**** Oh, I definitely get that aspect of it.

It's just that The Forest Again is pretty much the emotional climax of the entire series, it's what it all builds up to in Harry's character arc. I just feel like if a story doesn't have that, or a variatiation of it, you don't feel the full impact.

Now, there's plenty of stories I love that don't feature this particular moment, but the deviation happens earlier, the core of that story changes, you don't lose that final punch in the gut.

Anyways, just like you said, it's all a matter of opinion and my first comment was quite rude, I'm really sorry OP :/
