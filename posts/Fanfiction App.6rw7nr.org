Does anyone else use it? Why is the search bar so fucking useless? Every time I search a story it doesn't cone up with a title of that story. What's the bloody point of having "search title" if you can't even search for a story?


** Just use google and open the link in the app like everyone else who uses the app.

**** [[http://i.imgur.com/ooCnFgk.jpg][This is what i see when i google a fanfiction.net story.]] The top circle opens the story straight into the app. The other circle opens the fic as a webpage.
