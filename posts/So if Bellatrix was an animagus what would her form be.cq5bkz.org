I'm thinking a bird of some kind or something because I'm making a grey Bellatrix fanfic and she escapes with Sirius in third year but to do that she would need an animagus form which I don't know my only thoughts so far have been a raven or falcon of some kind any ideas?

*** Hey! My patronus is a hyena (at least according to Pottermore). I don't want it besmirched by Bellatrix.

Though, yes, I realise now someone had an identical objection just down the page.

My only real problem with a hyena is that they're too pack orientated. Although Bellatrix adores Voldemort I'm not sure she really demonstrates that pack orientated mentality, always comes across a little too independent. Though saying that her behaviour towards Narcissa and her horror at Andromeda and Sirius' life choices does suggest you might be right.

** Shrike.

It's a bird of prey that impales its prey on thorns.

Their nickname is "the Butcher Bird".

Seems grim and macarbe enough to be her animagus form.

**** The patronus only mirrors the animagus form after the animagus transformation/ process has been completed.

That is to say before the process your patronus can be anything that is meaningful to the caster, but after animagus, it tends to change to the animagus form of the caster

** I think it would be funny if it was something entirely against her usual presence. A sparrow, or something small and fragile like that.

I often think of the Patronus as the quintessence of a person's being. Their very core personality brought into a naturalistic, fable form. And I figured that Bellatrix, beaten and broken and lashing out as that woman is, may have a very fragile personality to her that highly depends on a group and/or purpose to function at all.

So something that survives in a group and by itself is very threatened by everything would fit, if we follow that train of thought.

Sparrow, rabbit, deer, crow,...

****** Then just know that Corvus Corax is at most a pair, but almost never seen in a larger grouping. That would kinda defeat the “dependent on a group for stability“ thought as well as the “is fragile“ part, since Corvus Corax can go toe to toe with basically any bird of prey with the exception of /maybe/ an eagle.

What I'm saying is that it would definitely make a different statement about Bellatrix' character than smaller members of the Corvus family.

******* Maybe so but I do kinda like it the more I think about it, because going toe to toe with birds of prey seems to me a very Bellatrix thing and I think a pair actually makes more sense as she seems very independent to me so I think that a group kinda bird would bring her down just a bit and something bigger does match with the whole very powerful and proud dark witch thing but at the same time birds are quite fragile creatures as they have hollow bones for flight so I think that really works.

******** I would definitely disagree on the “independent“ part. Bellatrix, as I already wrote, seems to me like she entirely depends on belonging to a group (the Death Eaters) and builds her entire world around following Voldemort.

I would also disagree with your last point about the bones of birds, simply because animagus forms don't seem like they work on biological facts, but more mythological, fable characteristics of animals.

But thats just me brainstorming away. Whatever works for you.

** I have two thoughts:

1. Wolverine - though this isn't really native to Britain (not that it matters), the animals are notorious for their savagery and willingness to attack anything no matter the size. Also, bonus points for being a savage member of the same family as weasels and ferrets.
2. Dolphin - hear me out. Dolphins are often eponymous for laughter sounds and always thought of as cute because of how their mouths are shaped (pot, kettle, black). In reality though, dolphins are more like the Joker of the ocean, pulling off some nasty stuff. Think sharks but with higher intellect.
