Is there a list somewhere of expletives that are actually used in cannon? Having trouble remember whether people ever actually exclaim “Merlin!” Or “Circe!”, or if that is pure fanon.


** "Circe!" is fanon, that's never said in the books. "Merlin!" is, in a way, also fanon. I'm not saying that the characters don't invoke Merlin's name as an exclamation, but it's got to be /part/ of an expression --- Merlin's beard, Merlin's pants, Merlin's saggy left bollock, what in the name of Merlin, how in the name of Merlin.

In the books, the characters never say "Merlin!" on its own. Be aware, in the books, the characters also say oh my god, god!, good lord, thank god, etc. (even the Malfoys and the Weasleys).

Because it's a children's book, we never hear the characters swear (other than "bloody"). But I'm more than willing to bet, when JKR wrote "Ron swore" or "Harry swore under his breath," she more than likely imagined them saying "fuck," "shit," "bloody hell," "twats," "fucking hell," "shithead," "for fuck's sake," "piss off," "bollocks," "fucking bastard," "useless bastard," "fucking toe rag," etc. etc. etc. rather than invoking any sort of Greek goddess.

*** It still makes more sense for characters to invoke mythological figures belonging to Celts, Romans, Greeks or Norse than a Christian god (there are passages in both the old and the new testament which suggest executing any user of magic. And pretty much all miracles are doable with magic either way, most even at Hogwarts level.

**** The wizarding world only separated from the muggle world in the 17th century.

Swearing by god was common (God's blood, god's wounds, god's flesh etc etc).

I doubt wizards around the time of the statute of secrecy actually went into church or really knew who god was other than by cultural osmosis. But linguistic mirroring is a thing. If you spend time around other people, you will subconsciously pick up on and start using their vocabulary. And children learn from watching their parents, they may have no fucking clue what god is or why their parents are swearing by him but it sounds like a swearword so they'll use it.

**** I can see the Muggleborns continuing to invoke the names of God/Jesus, at the very least.

***** Muggleborns certainly. It's even a good linguistic distinction so that not everyone sounds the same.

**** Have to disagree considering when the statue actually become a thing. By the late 1600 Christianity had been the default religion of western Europe for nearly 1000 years.

Additionally witch burns and punishment for witchcraft really aren't as common as fan's like to pretend and was more a local mob/protestant thing.

Also what translation of the bible are you reading. Without context in ancient Greek or Hebrew does it really read like we think in english, are thowe original passages or where they added later?

They were not uncommon, but they started way later than people think. There's an imperial decree from ~1000 which states that any and all witchcraft charges are bullshit.

Malleus Maleficarum was written by a Dominican, authorised by the Pope in 1484 and therefore at least the first wave was purely Catholic.

Checked in both the common English and the German ones. The old testament is pretty clear (it refers to Potion use IIRC, which is obviously taught at Hogwarts) and the new one has a few passages as well (acts, revelations), referring to everything from magical scrolls to curses.

**** I'm just brainstorming here, but maybe that's all the more reason for them to take the Lord's name in vain, then? To spite his followers who persecuted them?

** I think Circe is fanon, but Merlin - or Merlin's Beard - is canon.

I did a quick google, and this link might be useful: [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/slang/]]
