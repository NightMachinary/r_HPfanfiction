For me it is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Debts to Destiny) . I really enjoyed linkffn(Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer) and the author got 3 chapters into the sequel and abandoned it. It's just disappointing.

*** Let's just say ... never involve Patreon in fanfiction. It breaks all sorts of ethics and copyright laws, even if you don't intend to. Author hasn't been seen since his Patreon went public, and they were allegedly holding out for donations before they would update chapters.

Regardless - accepting payment for your work with someone else's IP without their legal ok is a big no-no, even if you weren't holding a story hostage.

Not gonna lie though, I find the idea of fics or any written products as their selling point in patreon is weird, but to each their own. There's definitely a market for it if they're getting supporters there.

/Amends/ in particular was one of the most mature fics I've read (in every sense). It's a post-war story that combines broad worldbuilding with focused character development, and it really feels like the messy aftermath of a civil war.

  Heavily AU. Thanks to a cold, humanity never discovers the Prothean ruins on Mars, and barely develops Mass Effect technology. They step out onto the galactic stage after the Reapers have harvested every other species, and find the crumbs left behind by the turians, asari, and salarians. Now they must adapt to fight a foe who won't be seen for far longer than human history.

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
