The author being a moral subjectivist nutjob.

I.E.

Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past:

“If your spirit merges with your past self, you will be effectively eliminating your own awareness or that of your younger self. Is that not the same as murdering your younger self?”

Harry sat in thought for a moment. “If I knew that giving up my existence meant a chance to save them, I'd do it in a heartbeat. I'd do it when I was younger as well. I haven't changed that much, Albus.” He smiled faintly.

---

"Harry, you'll be killing an innocent 11 year old" said Dumbledore

"Yes that's fine with me" said Harry Potter, who kills innocent 11 year olds

---

How can I get behind a protagonist who's a complete psychopath?


** Whether Old-Harry and Young-Harry count as separate people is kind of a complicated moral point, though. Up until the moment where he is subsumed by his older self, 11-year-old-Harry's life has been /exactly/ identical to the first 11 years of older-Harry's life, so... to what extent are they even different people, one of whom could murder the other?

***** If you pull the lever you save people from dying at the cost of one person dying. If you travel back in time you kill an innocent 11 year old in order to save people who are already dead. That's kinda how time works.

And by all means an 11 year old is more deserving of life than hundreds of adolescents. Adolescents are morally obligated to be willing to give their life for a little kid.

******* I'm sorry, but if you were forced to pick between the life of a fucking baby and four adults, if you wouldn't pick the baby there's something seriously wrong with you.

​

Those who are older have the understanding that sometimes sacrifice is necessary, and so actually have the chance of comprehending what they might be asked to give their life for. That's the age old justification for conscription, which, in the past, was a necessity. A baby will never understand what you ask it to give its life for, and even if it could, there'd be a hundred people willing to give their life for it in turn if it ever wished to give up its life.

​

Those who are older also have had far more time to come to terms with their mortality, and could possibly understand that it is inevitable either way, and that they may as well die for something. A baby couldn't.

******** Dude, my 11 year old self would have been 100% okay with a future version of myself, who had done everything I had done exactly and who bore all of my memories and experiences and was just an adult version of myself, taking their place because they where, you know, the exact same person.

Maybe I can phrase this differently.

If, for example, some famous author revealed that there was another chapter to their book and published the new version? Would you not read the new chapter because the new book, which contained all the same content except an extra chapter, wasn't the same? Because it was a little more?

Time travel to replace your younger self... even if it results in their death, whatever that would mean in universe, is only immoral so far as you care about ruining the potential they have. Then, if you don't go back in time they would have done the same things you did, suffered through the same pain, and inevitably come to stand where you were about to make the same choice.

A life is a life. In the context of time travel none of the moral rules you once operated under have any real bearing.

If you could go back in time and kill a young and innocent, for example, Hitler or some such, would you not do it? They would, at the time, just be a child incapable of doing any harm, someone with their whole life ahead of them. Would you not sacrifice that one life to ensure the survival of all the adults they would one day be responsible for killing?

Your argument... it doesn't make a lot of sense to me. It seems like your angry about something else? Idk.

Your 11 year old self would most definitely not be happy with entering the eternal embrace of the void of death, otherwise known as non-existence. Your 11 year old self cherished their life.

Even if you think that the 11 year old self can never die for some reason or the other, the fanfiction still says that the 11 year old will die, so your personal beliefs on the matter frankly don't matter.

Well, regardless of the above point --- not necessarily. If you put Young-Harry and Old-Harry in the same room, physically, then they would in a sense be "the same person", and in another there would clearly be /two/ people there, thinking different things. Why should it be different with souls? There'd be two copies of the same soul, which doesn't mean that one of them is made expendable.

/Would/ they be written out of existence? That's a side-effect of time-travel prototypes in /Cursed Child/ and the Mintumble story, but I think they're part and parcel with the way the calendar went a bit bonkers in the Mintumble story --- not a normal expected side-effect of time travel, but rather a "mistake".

Time in the /HP/ universe seems to hme to ave a bit of a will of its own, trying to remain self-consistent and willing to contrive events (/Felix Felicis/-style) to get there. Hence how ordinary Time-Turner loops are created and how time eventually righted itself after Eloise's interference.

So I think that, with 'softer' methods of time travel such as that which is usually at play in a Peggy Sue fic, it's imaginable that Time could heal completely --- contrive events so that the same people are born in both timelines. Certainly, if the Peggy Sue-ing character actively tries to maintain this bit of his original timeline by playing matchmaker (as one sometimes sees), magic definitely could do the rest.

I'm a Catholic, and the Catholic definition, unchanged in all records since the 4th century when they started - which has always been the western, Christian concept - is that the soul is that it is your immortal, immutable, essential self, -which reflects who you are-. Because your soul is -you-, not someone else, and you determine who -you- are, because you have free will.

#+end_quote

It coheres perfectly well: people have free will, but they will only ever choose to exercise that free will in accordance with their own nature. See, for example, how JKR talks about Voldemort's ability to choose to be good:

#+begin_quote
  Having taken Harry's blood into himself, Voldemort is keeping alive Lily's protective power over Harry. So Voldemort himself acts almost like a Horcrux for Harry -- except that the power of Lily's sacrifice is a positive force that not only continues to tether Harry to life, but gives Voldemort himself one last chance (Dumbledore refers to this last hope in chapter 35). Voldemort has unwittingly put a few drops of goodness back inside himself; if he had repented, he could have been healed more deeply than anyone would have supposed. But, of course, he refused to feel remorse.
#+end_quote

There are two very revealing things in this passage:

Firstly, Voldemort did /not/ have the potential to choose redemption until he had taken Lily's blood into himself. The potential to be good is a real magical presence which Voldemort lacked until he accidentally incorporated it into his being.

Secondly, even after Voldemort accidentally gave himself the ability to choose redemption, he would never actually have made that choice. "Of course" he refused to feel remorse. It is not in Voldemort's nature to make that choice, even though it is theoretically within the range of options which are open to him.

All this also adheres to the implicit morality of canon. See how Harry can cast the Cruciatus Curse on people, use Sectumsempra on Malfoy, and use the Imperius curse on Griphook, all while still being considered a good person, and never once being classified as a "dark wizard".

Canon treats Harry as fundamentally a good person whose actions do not actually have any impact on his moral status as an individual, which is determined not by his actions but by his essential character.

It's free will because the choice is open to you. It's simply that as a matter of practicality you never pick it. It's like if you have a favourite dish at your favourite restaurant. Every time you go there you pick that dish because it's your favourite. There are other items on the menu and you're perfectly able to pick them if you wanted to.

That tradition has the soul being made of a non-physical substance and the seat of consciousness and reason, the "ghost in the machine". It is incorporeal, eternal, and determines how the body behaves (and not vice versa).

...But... why would you? Clever, and important to the history of human thought, as all these men are, they were laboring on insufficient evidence. If they'd known about neuroscience, those philosophers wouldn't have made up this abstract conception of the soul.

If you choose to believe in them, then rationally, the only sane way to think about souls in the modern world is as live-feed brain uploads that "record" your mind (normally instantiated by the chemicals your brain) so that it can keep functioning even after the original, fleshly substrate is destroyed. That is broadly also how I've always thought of /HP/ souls, give or take some epicycles about how they interface with the brain while the brain's still alive.

This ties into a question I have long held about your conception of the HP magic system: quite what do you make of the ordinary, Muggle-understood laws of reality? Because technology based on those laws /works/ in the HP universe. Magical Theory and Muggle Science are equally valid explanations of the world in every instance where we have data.

The way it seems to work is that the world normally runs on the principles studied by Muggle science, but some weird exotic energy called "magic", which wizards can command, sometimes blunders in, bending reality to /its/ alien set of rules. If we think of Earth as a computer simulation, then the basic program is Muggle physics, and magic is a collection of cheat codes.

So why then, in this particular case, would it be that even though physics perfectly allow for aeroplanes to fly, as Muggles say they should, they don't allow for masses of neurons to create sentient minds, as Muggles say they should?

I get the feeling your idea of how Muggle science and magic fit together is very different from the system outlined earlier, and may help me make more sense of your thoughts on soul. So please, if you would?

********** From [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bhmgzm/prompt_wait_a_moment_its_possible_to_transfigure/][this]] recent thread:

#+begin_quote
  My approach to this is something like the following:

  /We start off on a sound canon basis.../

  - Alchemy is real in the HP universe.

  - Alchemy describes the world in a fundamentally different way to Muggle chemistry.

  - Therefore if alchemy is true, Muggle chemistry cannot be correct.

  - Transfiguration (and other magic which concerns matter) presumably operates on the basis of the true, magical theory of matter, not on the basis of the incorrect Muggle chemistry.

  /Now for the more speculative (i.e. completely made up) elements.../

  - "Uranium" does not actually exist. Muggles have erred in identifying it as an independent element. As all wizards know, there are only seven metals.

  - What the Muggles have identified as the element Uranium is actually a form of lead. It differs from regular lead in the amount of the element of fire it contains.

  - When a wizard uses transfiguration to create lead, it will always create regular lead. You would need to perform alchemy, not transfiguration, to create fire-rich lead.

  - Wizards therefore cannot transfigure themselves a lump of "fissile uranium".

  Modern technology doesn't break for the same reason that bridges designed on the basis of Newtonian physics don't collapse. Just because something is fundamentally wrong in the way it describes the world doesn't mean it can't be useful, so long as you limit its domain to areas where its wrongness does not come into play.

  Nor does something being fundamentally wrong prevent it from making accurate predictions. For example, our most accurate models of fluid dynamics still contain obviously "wrong" elements such as bodies of water with infinite depth. Nonetheless they generate useful and accurate predictions.

  As for "imaging atoms", this isn't strictly speaking an accurate description of the process of electron microscopy. An image of an atom is not possible; they are smaller than the wavelength of light. The "images" produced by electron microscopy are really more like visualisations or graphs than images: they are produced by interpreting data through the lens of atomic theory. In the business this is known as "theory laden observation".

  If these ideas interest you, I recommend looking into the philosophy of science, which is a fascinating subject. For now, all that's really worth noting is that there are plenty of perfectly credible views of science in real life where the contents of scientific theories are not considered "true" in a naive sense, never mind in the Harry Potter world where magic exists.

  (If anyone is interested, personally I am a constructive empiricist with a bit of structural realism thrown into the mix.)

I reconcile them by that not being an accurate description of my position. I don't think you would ever find me referring to technology as an equal to magic lol.

My position is that Hogwarts is such a magical place that things which are too Muggleish don't work there. So, for example, an 18th century cannon /would/ work at Hogwarts because its aesthetic is suitably romantic that it isn't too Muggleish; whereas a modern rifle would not work because it is the epitome of modernity. But maybe a hand-made shotgun like a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lfo1QUGfWZE][Beretta]] would work at Hogwarts, despite being modern, because it is the product of craftsmanship.

************** Oh, I absolutely don't think that JKR has thought about these things /explicitly/. But she /does/ have a certain characteristic mode of thinking, such that you can kind of predict the /sort/ of answer she would give, were she to be confronted with a question.

I would say that among the characteristic traits of her thinking are:

a) the tendency to treat subjective values as objective truths of the universe,

b) the tendency to turn social conventions into magically recognised facts, and

c) the tendency to treat second-order abstractions as operating on the same level as first-order things.

One of the interesting things about the HP magic system is the way it has broadened my mind to alternative modes of thinking. In university when studying philosophy of science I was a pretty hard-nosed realist who would generally dismiss anti-realism out-of-hand. I could not comprehend how people would even begin to believe it. But thinking about a universe where magic is real has allowed me to enter the head space of anti-realists (which when you think about it, is in itself a fairly damning condemnation of anti-realism).

And beyond that... it's interesting to get in the head of an anti-realist, perhaps, but it's not the sort of thing I want out of a /Harry Potter/ story. The /HP/ universe, especially in fanfiction, is supposed to be an ultimately /fun/ place, the perfect background for some nice old-fashioned whimsical escapism. I do not want to live in an anti-realist world where all of Muggle science is a blunder and some people are just kind of randomly born unredeemably evil in an absolute sense.

#+end_quote

Yeah, in my fanfiction this is one of the things I do always change. For me, ambiguity about the soul is important in a story to retain any sense of high stakes - for a start, if the immortal soul moving on to an afterlife is a known fact, then everything on Earth rather loses its importance (and Voldemort's entire motivation begins to collapse).

I also dislike story elements which might, under close examination, only really make sense in a universe where a god exists (and I do think that in the canonical universe, JKR inadvertently wrote a world that is so anthropocentric that it implies the existence of god).

So while I have wizards know about the soul in fanfic, I do not have it known whether it is immortal or not. And I do have it mutable, though not trivially so.

--------------

On the other hand, all of Muggle science being a blunder pleases me greatly. I read HP for magic, not science, and I enjoy a world where one can escape from all of the scientific disappointments of the 20th century (quantum physics dispensing with the mechanistic, sensible universe; special relativity placing hard limits on humanity's ability to explore the stars; Godel's incompleteness theorems proving the impossibility of a perfect mathematical system; the second law of thermodynamics making the decline of civilisation in the universe inevitable). The world of modern science is a world in which the limits of human possibility have been established, and they are depressingly low.

***************** I see... Though I share your disenchantment with the limits of the possible that science dictates, I think my view where magic /bypasses/ science (without invalidating its general-purpose truth) works just as well to get the pleasant escapism of a world where those discovery do not bind us.

The immortality of the soul, on the other hand, I do not touch. An Afterlife is another one of those things which I really wish would exist, and I am therefore very glad to immerse myself in a fictional world where it does as a known fact.

Concerning the existence of some deity, and in general the origin of magic (within the purview that we are dealing with my version of events, where magic is sort of an alien force that imposes itself on the universe but isn't part of its wider system), I actually have a pretty neat idea of how it all fits together, if you'd care to hear it.

  But the traditional (Western) conception of the soul is that it is your immortal, immutable, essential self.
#+end_quote

The "immutable" part is much more controversial than you make it out to be. Certainly, there are Protestant schools of thought which think along those lines, but you'll find just as many for whom the soul starts as a blank, innocent slate shaped by experience. In which case you cannot equate the soul at an early point of life with the one at a later point, as it will have been altered by the intervening experience.

  How can I get behind a protagonist who's a complete psychopath?
#+end_quote

You either learn to divorce your own preferences, beliefs, mindset, and morality from the author/protagonist, or it overpowers your enjoyment of the story and there's nothing left in the fic to entertain you. I read fics where Tom Riddle is the protagonist, and he's a villain. Yes, he is a racist serial killer character, but I'm aware that reading it and enjoying it doesn't make /me/ a bad person, especially because it is fiction, and I know how to separate fiction from IRL.

But on to what I hate about fanfiction: other readers who make me out to be a bad or immoral person because I like reading about fictional bad people.

I've seen a couple of cases on Tumblr where authors wrote fics that touched on sensitive themes like domestic abuse or homophobia, and were attacked by a torches-and-pitchfork mob of other users for depicting and "enabling" problematic issues.

It was more of a rhetorical question really. I just ignore it, but it's still pretty darn annoying with how frequent it is. Because, you know, the author probably believes in that sort of shit. Especially if it's harry bloody potter being "light-sided" saying that kind of thing.
