I'm actually trying to come up with a backstory for a beast-god with infinite lives for a game elsewhere, and I just came up with the possibility that he might have been hatched by a phoenix (chicken-on-toad-egg style...or rather, chicken on snake-egg, since toad eggs are too tiny), basilisk style.

And then that got me wondering if the same concept, putting a phoenix into the basilisk-hatching recipe, had been done in Harry Potter fanfiction.

So yeah, anybody seen this?


** Chinese dragon, of course. Serpentine, breaths fire, flies.

**** To be fair, basilisks are serpentine, and neither chickens nor toads are snakes

***** Looking at the original myth of basilisks has them apparently being hatched by a chicken over a snake egg (the other way around, a toad on a chicken egg, actually gets you a cockatrice, apparently).

Because a serpent incubates the egg. /(Though the original myths say that a toad is also fine, which begs the question, where do the serpentine features come from?)/

*** That's...fair enough, actually. This is a perfectly sensible concept.
