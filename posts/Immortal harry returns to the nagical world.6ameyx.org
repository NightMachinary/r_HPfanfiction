** I really wish I knew of a Fic where Harry returns to or even lives on the Nagical World, but sadly I do not and therefore can be of no help to you.

*** Well, and she is immortal for all intents and purposes. It's also my favorite fanfic.

It certainly fits the request, after she has been time-travelling for 5000 years she "resumes" her identity of Jasmine Potter. It's slow-paced compared to most fics, but nontheless it's my favorite fic.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. At least not when the only other immortal around is your worst enemy and the closest thing to a friend you have left. The war ended over a hundred years ago and Harry Potter and Tom Riddle have each been enjoying the quiet life, whilst politely ignoring each other. However, war is coming. AU. Complete.

  Exiled for three centuries on a barren rock, Harry's saved by the crew of the Enterprise D. He makes it to the colony world his people planned to go to and finds they're just as insular as ever though Hermione and his friends set them on a better course. Their nuclear option, though, left Harry with no escape. A prophecy is once again in play and he's the Chosen One. Again.
