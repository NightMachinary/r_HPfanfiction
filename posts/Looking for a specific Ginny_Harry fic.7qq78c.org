I read this a long time ago and can't remember the name or find it by searching ffn. I remember that the weasley brothers all told Harry to stay away from ginny sometime during his 5/6 year, and he gets super depressed about it. After the war he becomes suicidal and tries to kill himself after seeing ginny with a bf. Eventually ginny finds out what her brothers did and her and harry get together or something. I think harry eventually forgives the weasley brothers but i'm not sure. Thanks for any help you can give me.


** Is this the one that harry had dragon pox? At the end they adopt a little girl from the orphanage? Im looking for this too! I'll linknit if I find it :)
