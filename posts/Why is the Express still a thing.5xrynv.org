** It's a nice place for students to socialize.

It's definitely not the most efficient form, but it looks fun.

It's kind of tradition now, and wizards take traditions seriously.

** I always assumed because it is for logistic reasons. All the students arrive at the same time, from the same direction, and can be funneled to where they need to go. The elves know where to grab the baggage, and it is all in the student's rooms before they get to the rooms.

If you allow alternate means of entry it becomes a huge headache keeping track of everyone and everything.

** Its a very symbolic transition for muggleborns, you go through a magical wall to get to it and then have a relatively normal journey where you can prepare yourself and maybe make a friend or two. I'm not sure 11 year old me would willingly step into a fire, I'd need more experience with magic to trust it.

I've also read stories where its enchanted to discover everyone's favourite food for the welcoming feast to make everyone feel more at home.

  yet a more secure route into the school (for instance, permitting a fireplace that might be officially entered by Floo powder) was strongly resisted by successive Headmasters, who did not wish the security of the castle to be breached.

Interesting: Flooing into Hogsmeade isn't considered as a solution.

***** Isn't the general impression from the books that floo is the primary means of access for the Ministry?

Sure if there was only one floo and everyone was travelling there from home it could be a problem, but with several it could be manageable.

Of course, since the Ministry has workers arriving and departing en masse every day, and Hogwarts only a few times a year, it might not be worthwhile. Then again, having a train dedicated to just 6 trips a year is a bit silly too.

**** To be fair, Hogsmeade is a /village/, and there might not have always been a place like Three Broomsticks where people actually would have access to a public fireplace.

Heck, even with that, since those weren't Hogwarts property nor Ministry for Magic property, it might have been that they couldn't simply decide to force whoever could have owned such establishments to give access to their fireplaces.

****** Yes, the /ministry/ could. Instead, the /minister/ did the Hogwarts Express thing on his own. Think about it for a moment: it gives us a hint that even if they potentially could, they wouldn't have done so for some reason, whether it be a serious reason or a trifle.

** Out of universe: because it gives us the whole train journey there + Platform 9.75, which are both iconic at this point and great story settings.

In universe: security? Tradition? In canon it's not really fleshed out, but I've seen fics that either give reasons why it's necessary or that provide alternate ways to get to Hogwarts.

In Prince of Slytherin, for example, most students choose to take the train, however you can still floo to Hogwarts if you want.

**** For us it would be. For wizards, it is entirely possible that the train runs on enchantments, meaning that no fuel is required, and any costs would be maintenance. That, plus the safety added in, makes it a good choice.
