** linkffn(12592097) has elements of this.

As Thiefmione's tutor, Dung is shown to use several personas, one of which is the fake Pureblood snob.

*** The story did have a potential to became “Ocean's Eleven” of HP universe, but unfortunately it isn't. There's no intelligence in any heists. The approach is always the same: break through the wards, then just go through each room collecting infinite amount of valuables. If meet someone, kick his or her arse.

An of course Hermione “Everyone-licks-my-arse” Granger.

**** You don't need a "casino grade" plan for the average wizarding home - or a lone vampire/dark wizard hideout - nor can you actually use such a plan for most of them. That'll be different when the crew starts taking on the old manors of Malfoy and co., where you need more than just time to break through the wards because they have far more resources than wards and traps - and the DMLE on call. Those are targets you need more complicated/sophisticated plans for, and that's what the crew's been working up to.

Of course not. They have absolutely nothing to hide and they are just happy to give their possessions to the only criminal amateur curse breaker in the magical Britain aka “Awesome” Hermione Granger.

In the story everything is designed for her benefit: from the wards, which could be broken with just a wand and time, to internal enchantments and traps, she's the only one who can see through and deal with.

****** Of course they have things to hide. But actually breaking into their hideouts is a straightforward affair once you found them. They don't tend to hold dances which you use to enter and then slip away, or have a very active social life. At least the two hard targets they hit during the conflict with Voldemort didn't.

In the story, Hermione had to learn everything - curse-breaking, disguise, playing a role, scouting - while Fletcher was the expert and her tutor. It's only in the most recent chapters that she's "graduating", so to speak, and finally has the skills to break into the old manors, for which more complex plans are needed.

In a similar way Harry and Ron have started to rise in the ranks of the Auror Corps, putting their training to use.

Yep, everything for your Heroine.

Reading your story at some point I wondered why she's bothering with some schemes? She can just go in the center of Diagon Alley and start throwing AKs at random people. Because she's your heroine it's guaranteed that *all* her targets will be Death Eaters, murderer, rapists, etc. and no one will have any concerns for her actions, may be someone will bring her a glass of juice in case if she's thirsty.

******** You're really not being fair to his story. Hermione hardly has everything going for her: her family is financially ruined, she is unable to act on her desires because Harry decided to be a stupid law abiding cop, and her general reputation is that of a thief who is now sleeping with Sirius Black.

********* My points have almost nothing to do with the plot, but the author's attitude. Hermione is her (or his?) big crush and it's clearly shown through the story: she's getting everything she wants too easy (the magical system is designed specially for her); everyone around her silently eats any shit she throws; she isn't questioned even once about justification of her actions, she is right by default; when it's clear she is in the wrong the story totally ignores it; etc.

The points you provided are just plot devices, they don't affect her character at all.

********** Hermione wants to tell Harry her secret, but Sirius is blocking that - and she owes him too much to go against his wishes. The magic system isn't "designed for her", whatever that means; it works for everyone the same, but she and Fletcher are the thieves the story shows. Once Harry and the other Aurors assault a dark wizard hideout you'll see that they deal with the wards in the same way.

And as the story shows, her grades suffered compared to canon because there's a vast difference between studying at the best magical school in Europe and studying at home with a single tutor. Harry and Ron outclass her in defence easily. And no one really "eats her shit"; nor does anyone follow her wishes - often quite the contrary. She's had to wait for years to get her revenge, she's been slandered in public, and even her shot at being exonerated has been foiled by Malfoy pushing through a pardon for her, which still leaves her as a convicted criminal on record. She can't even start a relationship with Harry because of her secrets.

As far as "questioning her justification" goes: Yeah, neither her tutor, who's a thief with an axe to grind against the Death Eaters after the death of his family nor Sirius who spent a decade in Azkaban due to corruption and abuse of power and doesn't like the Ministry and the establishment at all really question her wish to take revenge upon those who wronged her. That's pretty much logical, given their characters and backstory. On the other hand, Harry does question her views, albeit unknowingly, each time in conversation when he reaffirms his belief in following the law to enact justice. But to question her plans to her face one would have to know them - and only those who agree with them are in the know. For now. (Not that such soul searching has much of a place in a story about Aurors and thieves matching wits anyway.)

As far as all her targets being dark wizards and Death Eaters - so far, she, Sirius and Fletcher acted on Dumbledore's orders and intelligence. It shouldn't be a surprise that he wouldn't send them against innocents. Not that there were that many break-ins anyway. But heck, some people even complain that she hasn't had a guilty conscience because the dark witch whose home they were breaking in was stunned when she attacked them. Call me biased, but that kind of drivel I can't take seriously.

So yeah, if your complaint boils down to "Dumbledore didn't send them to the wrong, innocent target" I'll ignore it. If you claim that she's getting things too easily - that's your opinion; I don't share it. She's taken a long time to reach the point where she can now start her revenge (years, and almost 40 chapters), and already there are more complications building up.

*********** I don't see any point in detailed reviewing of your story here. I just shared my opinion and it's up to others (including you) to agree or disagree with it.

Still I think I can point at one more, the biggest, plot hole in the story: absence of any competition. If a home schooled child with some support can break into well protected houses and steal literary everything, there's nothing that stops teams of experienced curse breakers from making /very easy and very big money/ with doing the same.

************ See, that's why I don't really take your criticism seriously: You make up shit. It wasn't Hermione, but Fletcher who did the heavy lifting so far. And he's an expert thief - not an average Curse-Breaker or "a home-schooled kid with some support". And even he hasn't hit the Old Manors easily. Not to mention that Curse-Breakers who are in that league might not be inclined to enter a career as a thief if they can make great money working for Gringotts, or good money with far less risks working for the Ministry. Not that there are that many good Curse-Breakers. And as I said: It takes more to break into an Old Manor than going through the wards. They have defences that some dark wizard or vampire simply can't afford or lacks the support to set up. A single criminal who doesn't or can't trust anyone else simply can't offer the same challenge as an Old Family like the Malfoys in good standing with the Ministry.

And as the story shows, neither Hermione nor Harry and Ron are average kids. All of them are very talented and have been trained for years by the very best in their fields. After completing their training, Harry and Ron outclass the vast majority of the Aurors and Hit-Wizards from the get-go. Hermione is a prodigy in Curse-Breaking. They're far above the average wizard and witch who has trouble casting a Shield Charm or duplicating items at will. Yes, there is a lack of competition for wizards and witches of their talent, but those who are in that league make very dangerous competition.

************* You've just repeated my initial point: in the story everything is designed for Hermione's benefit: meaningless wards any good curse breaker can walk through undetected with just a wand, shrinking spell nothing can protect from for her to be able to carry literally everything, switching-through-the-walls spell only she uses to steal purses with money, undetectable animagi no one knows about, looking-through-the-walls artifacts no one bother to protect from, incompetent aurors with the main purpose of being puppets to Old Families and so on.

An example of that in your latest two chapters: [[/spoiler][she's just robbed the supposedly well protected Dark artifacts store the Old Families had dealings with. In the end it was so casual that you didn't bother to provide any details how your Heroes dealt with internal defenses, traps, secret rooms and containers]].

In the real world Fletcher wouldn't be the only criminal curse breaker, Hermione wouldn't be the only one who can form a team she can trust.

But your story has nothing to do with the real world and I fully understand that.

Edit: example has been added.

************** See, once again you make up shit. Stuff is protected from the see-through-walls spell (which, incidentally, is used by Harry and Moody) - but not everything is. (It wouldn't be very useful, anyway, if everything were protected.)

Wards aren't meaningless, but if they couldn't be broken through, the Potters wouldn't have had to go into hiding, and the first blood war would have played out very differently. And if you couldn't break through wards without getting detected, then the entire "thief" theme would have been rendered impossible from the start.

The Shrinking Charm as well as extended pockets/bags are canon. That the average wizard can't cast a shield charm is canon as well; at least my Aurors can do that.

I didn't mention how Hermione and Co. went through the defences of Borgin because Borgin isn't in the same league as the Old Families. His shop isn't a fortress, doesn't have centuries-old wards, and special defences. Hell, in canon, Harry appeared there by accident, and overheard Malfoy undetected. It's a shady shop, and I didn't show how it was burglarised because it wasn't that challenging for the crew. "Well-protected" is relative.

Also, Wizarding Britain is rather small compared to the real world - in canon, it's so tiny, 3000 people, that Fletcher might as well be the only real thief. In my story, Fletcher isn't the only criminal Curse-Breaker - just the best, in Britain at least.

Harry, Ron and Hermione aren't average, they are exceptional. Just like Snape, Dumbledore, Sirius, Bellatrix, Barty Crouch Jr and Moody aren't average wizards and witches either.

Because this isn't a story about a couple average kids winning against the worst Dark Lord in Britain's recent history thanks to luck/author fiat. This is a story about a number of extraordinary people fighting against other extraordinary people.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
