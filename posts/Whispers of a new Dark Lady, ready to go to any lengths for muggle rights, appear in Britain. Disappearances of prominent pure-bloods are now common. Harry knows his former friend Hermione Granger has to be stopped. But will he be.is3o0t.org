#+TITLE: Whispers of a new Dark Lady, ready to go to any lengths for muggle rights, appear in Britain. Disappearances of prominent pure-bloods are now common. Harry knows his former friend Hermione Granger has to be stopped. But will he be able to do so, especially now, when Hermione stole the Elder Wand?

** Well, Dangerous by BlackLotus kinda has something like that. I liked the pure-blood vs Muggle-born debates and some of the different viewpoints.

Disclaimer: H/Hr (I managed to skip over those parts). MarySue!Hermione. Canon!Harry, but somehow even more of a dumbass. Actually, everyone is to a degree (see Mary Sue above) but Harry especially.

The fic can be downloaded [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwfE6l6RtZAsYlo4cG9IOG9nWnc][here]] and there's a review thread on the site that shall not be named [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/dangerous-by-blacklotus-m.12887/][here]].

** I can't find it now, but I've read a story in which Harry is one of the few wizards left opposing Hermione (and maybe one of the few wizards left, period). Hermione has become a Dark Lady with SPEW as her cause.

** The elder wand won't answer to her. Harry still has its allegiance. Plus, in a duel, Hermione would probably lose against Harry because - one, /the wand won't answer to her/, and two, she may know more spells that Harry but he's the one with the actual battle experience. He's the DADA prodigy.

*** That would be both an interesting and cheap ending for her, going out due to the same quirk of fate and wandlore that killed Voldemort.
