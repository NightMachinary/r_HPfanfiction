I literally just read it, and I am in love. It's still going on, and there are just 11 chapters for now. But by the A/N in the first chapter, I know that it's at least 25 chapters long, and posts updates once a week.

Premise: Starts at his childhood, where Harry is being treated poorly by the dursleys, and later sold to a child trafficking ring. He escapes to an island, which is where the story is now. I have no idea what the story is going to be yet, which makes me even more excited
