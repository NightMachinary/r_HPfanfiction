** Because she's a snake and has no real free will of her own. I ignore Rowlings additions to canon after book 7's release

*** Ignoring anything Rowling says nowadays is a good idea. I mean... have you /seen/ some of her tweets? The woman's gone legit insane.

** It was just a dumb snake. JKR was trying to milk as much as she can from HP series with dumb additions.

***** I forget the specifics but basically nagini was a woman who's bloodline was cursed to force her to turn into a snake. I think over time the curse was supposed to make it impossible to turn back but at the time of crimes it hadn't reached that far yet. Yea crimes wasnt great fbawtft was really good but cog kinda screwed the pooch.

** Even if you acknowledge FB as canon, at the point where Voldemort recruits her, she would have turned into a snake completely, and lost her humanity as a result. The Maledictus curse might interact oddly with the Horcrux creation, though.
