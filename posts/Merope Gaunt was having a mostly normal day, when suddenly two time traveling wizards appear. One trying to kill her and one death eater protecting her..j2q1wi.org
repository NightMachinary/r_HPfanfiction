voldemort is only sparing lucius life, because he cares about his father who died protecting his mother.

** Merope was sitting over a cauldron, brewing a love potion that she hoped to use on Tom Riddle, the man she fancied, when she heard two cracks outside. She rose with her hand in her hand, and exited her home. Her eyes narrowed as she couldn't spot anything out of the ordinary.

There was a sudden woosh and Merope felt something shove her aside. There was a flash of green light. She picked herself up with her wand raised, though it wouldn't do her much good; her strongest offensive spell was the body-bind. Her eyes widened as she took in two wizards, their wands a blur.

There was a tall black-haired wizard and a blonde wizard.

A flick of his wand, and the black-haired wizard cast a spell that made her hair stand up. The blonde hair wizard responded with a wave of his wand that seemed to solidify the air. The first spell which also looked like distorted air slammed into the shield and broke it with a loud cracking noise. The shards promptly flew towards the black-haired wizard.

He hadn't been idle however. A wave of his wand, and the shards of solidified air flew together and were transfigured into a giant silver scorpion that charged toward the blonde wizard, accompanied by a stunner that Merope recognized from an old spell textbook that her father had briefly allowed her to read.

The blonde wizard's eyes widened. He waved his wand and the earth burst upwards beneath the scorpion, giving him the time to complete a complicated-looking wand motion. A pyramid formed of purple lines formed around him, the stunner bouncing off the space between the lines.

The stunner was immediately blocked by the black-haired wizard, the spell dissipating in mid-air. He had already, with a flick each, sent three silver spears towards the pyramid. The pyramid blocked each one, the spears colliding and falling onto the ground, but the scorpion was still charging at the blonde man.

The blonde cast a black spell at the scorpion which deformed the scorpion, but the scorpion had been mid-leap and it crashed through the pyramid, shattering it, and slammed into the blonde wizard. He fell, and didn't get up. The duel had taken seconds.

The black-haired wizard, who had marvelous green eyes Merope noted, looked contemptuously at the other wizard.

"You really thought you could beat me, Malfoy?" the wizard asked incredulously. "When has that ever turned out well for you?"

He turned towards Merope, who felt an icy claw grip her insides as she noted that his wand was rising.

"I'd say I'm sorry, but I don't think this will be much of a loss for you," the wizard said. His wand rose, green specks of light at the tip.

Merope closed her eyes. Loud noises rent the air.

"Ministry of Magic, drop your wand!" a voice shouted. Merope opened her eyes and saw a Magical Law Enforcement squad between her and the wizard, wands raised and ready to do battle.

A new voice, scratchy but smug, said, "I didn't need to beat you. I just had to delay you, Potter." It was Malfoy, who was slowly getting up.

"This isn't over," Potter said, who turned on his heel and vanished with a pop as seven spells flew through where he was.

Merope turned towards the blonde hair man who was limping towards her with the help of a transfigured cane. He nodded towards the squad of hitwizards before walking towards her.

He held a hand out. "Name's Malfoy. I'm here to save you. That guy who tried to kill you, he's from the future. Your son is going to become a great leader, helping us do some very great things, but some people didn't like that."

**** I mean, I wrote this to practice writing combat really quickly, but if we're talking canon, they're outside and you can outrun fiendfyre. Not to mention it can turn on its caster. Friendfyre's great at destroying stuff but it's not great for use in a duel. It's also sentient and has a mind of its own, rendering it incredibly inefficient. It even toys with the stuff that it targets. You might as well just conjure fire, transfigure it, or charm it another way.

***** I think the reason fiendfyre would be more useful than just conjuring fire here is because of how uncontrollable it is. Can't dump water on it and call it a day. With conjured fire you can just douse it with water. Fiendfyre not so much. Sure they might outrun it but it's your best bet with the limited time you have left before you need to apparate out.

** Draco Malfoy takes a pregnant Merope into hiding and raises young Tom along with her.

The mysterious assassin never makes another attempt on their lives.

When Tom writes home his first night at Hogwarts his letter says:

____p

Dear Mom and Draco,

Hogwarts is amazing, is everything I thought it could be from Draco's stories.

I got sorted into Slytherin (of course) and met a few potential friends or minions.

I think my favorite subject is going to be charms. The professor says she knows the two of you and asked me to include a letter to you. She already taught me a fun spell after the feast that rearranges written letters into different words.

Ill study hard and make you proud.

-Tom

____p

Dear Draco and Merope.

I haven't seen you both for almost 12 years, and I figured the best place to meet young Tom again would be right here at Hogwarts.

After a few years of teaching young impressionable minds, I think that Tom may yet not grow up to be the man he was before. He is not an orphan, he has support from parents, he gets to go to home every summer. He has a chance to be great and a chance to not be evil.

I will be watching closely and if this change does not effect his destiny, I will not have any hesitation to in killing him.

Sincerely, Ginerva Weasley Charms Mistress Head of Gryffindor Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry

As soon as that last part was read, the note burned into nothingness.

*** Because you can only convict someone for a crime they commited, rather than a crime they might commit?

Unless brewing amortentia is illegal by itself (which I doubt, the wizarding world is crazy enough to classify it as a party drug if taken with consent), Merope would only commit the crime after Tom Riddle ingested it. And how do we know Muggle baiting gets more than a hefty fine in the 1920s?

The second Tom Riddle is addled by amortentia, he'll want to climb Merope like a tree. Sure, they'll elope, but what guarantee do you have that the Dark Lord isn't conceived in the shrubbery between the Gaunt and the Riddle properties, 5 minutes after ingesting the amortentia?

If you are actually crazy enough to go back in time to kill a dark lord and think you'll have a snowballs chance in hell, I'd probably try to kill the entire Gaunt family while Merope was still a baby, just to be on the err side of caution...
