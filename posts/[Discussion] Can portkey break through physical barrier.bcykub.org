Suppose that a wizard created a cube of 10 x 10 x 10 m^{3,} and put them in the deepest trench in the world, or bury them underground. Can they make a portkey there?

Also, if the space is charmed with that extension charm, like newt's briefcase in closed condition, can anyone make a portkey there?


** Definitely through solid walls.

Also you can easily portkey from newt's expanded space, but you would be hard pressed to portkey to it since it isn't in a precise location being a moveable suitcase.

** Yes, and I even assume they can use portkeys to travel from space stations to the planetary surface and vice versa. However, canon portkeys seem to have a rather limited range of less than 100 kms.

At least Leta Lestrange and Newt Scamander had to travel Muggle ocean liners.

*** In Goblet od Fire Barty Crouch Sr talks about organizing portkeys over different continents so I doubt the distance is that limited.

  “So, been keeping busy, Barty?” said Bagman breezily.

  “Fairly,” said Mr. Crouch dryly. “Organizing Portkeys across five continents is no mean feat, Ludo.”

I think Leta and Newt just tried to avoid detection.

I think there's a simpler explanation: Portkeys are illegal to create except with the Ministry's permission, and the Ministry is only inclined to authorise them for public events.

***** Yes they seem to be quite restricted, but we do see that its possible to bribe somebody to get a Portkey in Crimes of Grindelwald.

***** Newt and Leta were both trying to avoid detection though. But yeah, they also do have to be authorised as well seemingly.

**** Or the reason that portkeying across continents is so complex is because they require multiple stops?

*** Portkeys are implied to have a considerably longer range. Grindelwald uses one Portkey to get back home from Grindelwald, wizards globally used them to get to the Quidditch World Cup, and JKR implied Newt could have used a Portkey across the Atlantic Ocean.

** If I recall correctly, portkey travel was described as seconds long with the recipient of ride mentioning breathing during trip. If so, a trip through space would be lethal. I don't have books four or five so I can't quote relevant passages atm.

*** Charmed suits to protect them or just straight up charms maybe? Hell maybe even have the port key be an airtight box.

** Portkeys teleport people, they don't physically fly them somewhere. That's just how it feels.
