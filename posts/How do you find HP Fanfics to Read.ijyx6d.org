Hi! I'm curious, how do you all find good hp Fanfics to read?

Search Filters: Finding fanfics to read through lots of filtering.

Recommendations: Either by friends and family or any platform like Reddit.

Favorites Scavenger: You find fanfics to read by looking at someone else's favorites.

Or any other way....


** I like to scroll through search results for specific characters, Scryer is pretty useful here since it has a few helpful search settings such as minimum and maximum length. Searching by character is pretty pointless on Ao3 though.

Recommendations, well that's what we're here for. Although one person's treasure is another person's tab-close. Recommendations in author notes are also pretty interesting since generally speaking, if you are enjoying a story there's a good chance that you will enjoy whatever the author is recommending.

Someone's favourites or followed stories, only for authors whose stories I've enjoyed. Everything else is random.

** I use this. [[https://www.faenfiction.com/fanfics/harry_potter]]

It's been my go to search directory, since I can no longer be bothered to 'search/filter' ffn or ao3 and rummage through piles of cringe-worthy messes.

I find something there, go back to ffn/ao3, search the title or author and read it on those(ffn Android app is beautiful for keeping track lmao)

** I read mostly on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. When I find a fanfic I like writing style wise, then after finishing the story I first check if the author has other stories available and after that look at their favorites. Good writers tend to read good stories, I've noticed.

** Searching through filters can be really annoying. It takes a lot of patience to go through the archives and try to find something that looks interesting. The best way to find good stories is to sort by favorites.

** I typically now just set a list of criteria and scroll until I find a summary and premise I'm interested in.

** I do it mostly through filters. Whatever character strikes my fancy at the moment, and sort by favourites and update date or complete, so i don't get abandoned stuff. The scrolling through the list.

** These days I mostly click "random" button in my application until I see some summary that I like. It's essentially the same as reading others' favourite lists just less repeated fics to go through and less hassle to keep track of said lists.

** I pretty much solely read on fanfiction.net, so I search for certain themes such as Dark, Slytherin Harry on Google depending on what I feel like reading. Try and find communities there to scroll through and check out. Reddit can be useful for recommendations, but I never ask, rather go of other people's posts. Recommendations within authors notes can be gold dust sometimes, as the themes generally carry through.
