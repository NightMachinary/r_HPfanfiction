Hi, I would like any and all fanfics where Harry is the reincarnation of someone, it dosent even have to be someone famous like Salazar Slytherin. Just the reincarnation of someone.

I've read one where he was the reincarnation of the God Dionysus but sadly that wasn't finished.

So any and all fanfics that fit this.

I'd also take any fanfics where people pretend to be Harry like in 'Courage and Cunning' or where Harry is replaced by someone like in 'The accidental vessal' where he is The archangel Gabriel.

Thank you for your help!


** I've been searching desperately for one where he's Morgan Le Fey. I always see merlin, the founders, and even Arthur sometimes. I wanna see a villain. I wanna see Dumbledore and Voldemort's reactions. /But more/ than anything, I want Luna to be Mordred reborn. Then, I can read everyone's deep confusion at her calling the very male and far too young to have children Harry "Mum" and him calling her "Son."

Of course, Morgan!Harry fics don't exist so all that other stuff will never happen.

Not as reincarnation but 'A long journey home' has it as time travel

** Are crossovers okay? If so, you can literally google "character reborn as Harry potter fanfiction" and click it off.

The one I can remember off the top of my head is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13286660/145/47-The-Long-Harsh-Road][this one]] where it's Loki that is reborn as Harry Potter.
