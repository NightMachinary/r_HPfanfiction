** I think we need more information about your Harry to answer these question : is he the same character than canon, only a little smarter, or does these change make him a completely new character? Anyways, if we assume Harry stays the same:

1. Yes. A lot of people want to bash Ron "because he is a traitor", but honestly, Canon Ron is an amazing friend from Harry. It's easy to only remember his worst moments, but this is a character who sacrified himself in 1st year so Harry could continue. He broke several law to go to see Harry in Privet Drive because he thought they didn't let him answer his letters, he also followed him to an Acromantula nest while being deadly afraid of Spiders, and later in the Chamber of Secrets to confront a Basilisk. He stood between Harry and Sirius Black on a broken leg, and told the man he thought was Voldemort right hand man that he would have to kill him to touch Harry.\\
   I would also like to point that, in most Indi! Harry fic who bash Ron are "lucky" to begin in 4th year, because their is no way their Harry would have stayed friend with PoA Hermione if he was to judge her the same way he does with Ron.\\
2. I will stay neutral on that point. I will just point that, if you plan to pair Remus with anyone else, their is only 2 kind of character who could work with him. Either a "strong" character who almost force him in the relation (a bit like Tonk did), or a character, preferably a werewolf, who is just as depressive as him, so they can get together while wailing in self pity.
3. If your Harry is similar to the canon one : no. Harry dislike Malfoy because he is basically a magical Dudley : a spoiled kid who bully others. And Draco dislike Harry because he is a spoiled kid who could never get over the fact that Harry refused to shake his hand. I doubt Harry being in another House, with another friends, would stop Malfoy to insult them. The only exception may be in Slytherin, because while being in the same House would give Malfoy more opportunities to be an ass, it would also give Harry the chance to befriend "equals" to Malfoy, like Zabine or Nott, who could not be insulted the same way than mudbloods or blood traitors.
4. I alway considered Snape as a bad man who did the right thing. Are his sacrifices enough to redamn him? Depend of the author so do what you want. Though, if you want to roast him, just don't forget that he made sacrifices, even if they are not enough.
5. Depend of you Harry (I feel like I said at every answer). Harry is very fond of Hagrid because he is his first friend. If your your different Harry managed to get friends in the Muggle world, or if Hagrid is not the one to take him to Diagon Alley, Harry has no reason to become friend with him. This also apply to other characters like Ron and Hermione.\\
   Ron became his best friend because they were together on the train, and later were sorted in the same House. If they do not meet in the Hogwart's Express, they would not have become friend (or at least differently). And if Harry is not in Gryffindor, then they would have spent a lot less time together, making their relation different.\\
   In Hermione case, she became friend with them because they saved her from the troll. And she was in a situation to be saved because she overheard a conversation between Harry and Ron. If Harry is not Ron's best friend, would he have had this conversation with someone else /this/ exact day? And if Harry is not Gryffindor, would he even know Hermione was not at the feast that night? Or where she was? And would he even care? The troll scene is one of the most overused one because people want to have Hermione as Harry best friend and can't think in another way to make them friend.

** 1) Do what you want, but I'd suggest keeping him as a minor friend

2) I think you should make different pairings for both Remus and Tonks. If you introduce an OC, make them a minor character.

3)Don't make Draco be tolerable until at least second year, unless you don't put Harry in Gryffindor or shun him on the train

4) Unless Harry doesn't shun Malfoy on the train, he should act the same in first year

5) Hagrid is tricky to write. Use the online Hagridizer for any of his dialogue.

** 1. I feel like Ron is really part of what made the books so good. If you consider that Harry ends up being able to save the world because of the power of love, I think it would have been impossible without Ron. He's kinda the greatest friend ever, with all his flaws. And, no matter what house (except maybe Slytherin), if they do meet on the train, Ron could still make an effort and stand by Harry. So, yes, make him a friend. And if you're having trouble with his character, just write him as a distant friend? Or at least not as the half assed enemy?

2. Personally, I see Remus/Tonk as an absolute mess that is not at all interesting/cute or anything good. I'd pair Remus with no one, because from what I remember of the book, he was interested in no one but himself and his self pity. The only interest in having him have a kid is that he won't take care of it and somehow it always fall on Harry to become this new, responsible guardian.

3. If they go off on better terms than « no, I won't acknowledge you in front of our whole year on the very first day », they can be on relatively good terms, no matter the house. Because, if nothing else, the Malfoys are good at politics etc. But the minute LV returns and they'd change their stance anyway. And if you want to make them really good friends, Draco would need a whole personality makeover. Slytherin or not, I don't see Harry being ok with people belittling and insulting his mother's blood (especially since she's basically the one who saved him from LV).

4. JKR herself failed at his redemption. I don't see the point. His ethics are all kind of awful. If you don't take into account the whole following LV of his own free will and taking pleasure in killing and torturing people based on their blood/birth, he's still an awful person who spends his time terrorising generations of students. He constantly escapes justice. He does nothing much which could redeem him. He's really an ugly person. Even to Harry, for whom he's supposedly enduring being a teacher and a spy/traitor. (Even as a Slytherin, i don't see him being much nicer to Harry. From the moment he saw him, he started glaring at him when Harry is just a kid.) So, really, good luck if you try to redeem him. You really should bother only if it'll really bring something to the story.

I don't know how much it'll help, but here is my super interesting opinion haha.

  Should I keep Ron as a good friend/person ( I don't wanna make him bad but confused how to moderate his character)
#+end_quote

Sure, if he has a character arc.

​

#+begin_quote
  Should I pair Remus with Tonks? Should I pair him with someone else? Or should I keep him alone? If not alone, is a kid from him compulsory?
#+end_quote

Personally, I say pair Remus with Sirius. But, if you do pair him with tonks (or another female) a kid is not compulsory. In fact, unless it's important to the story don't bother.

​

#+begin_quote
  If Harry is not a Gryffindor, should I keep him on ok terms with Malfoy? Should I keep Malfoy's interactions with Non-Gryffindor Harry polite?
#+end_quote

No, Harry had snubbed Malfoy on the train well before they were sorted. Malfoy's beef with Harry was that snubbing, not house choice. If you want them on good terms you need to change their interaction on the train.

​

#+begin_quote
  Does Snape deserve a redemption arc or should I roast him alive?
#+end_quote

Yes, he was a nuanced character that was trapped in his own personal hell. If you spend any time on him it should be either a redemption arc or at least a nod to the fact that Dumbledore condones his behavior.

​

#+begin_quote
  How should I keep his rapport with Hagrid? Thanks in advance.
#+end_quote

Only if you can write Hagrid decently and need him to drop plot in Harry's lap. Even JKR wrote him out in later books.

**** I think Draco would need considerable rewriting even in his earliest scenes to have a good or even neutral relationship with Harry. Harry was comparing Draco to Dudley from the moment he opened his mouth in the robe shop and Draco didn't know his identity then. Although Harry would certainly just shrug Malfoy off in first year if Ron would stop provoking him.
