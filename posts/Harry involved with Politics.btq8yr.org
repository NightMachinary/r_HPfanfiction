I recently read 2 fics by Earl Lonsdale on fanfiction.net but sadly they are not complete. The stories were amazing though and I am looking for something similar. The stories were "Henry Black and the Memory of Death" and "Journey Through the Dark". linkffn(8885369) and linkffn(6044969)

Post-War. Voldemort is gone, the corrupt system that allowed him to rise isn't. Nevilles perspective.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.
