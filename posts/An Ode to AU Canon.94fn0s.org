Harry Potter is a world of wonders

Filled to the brim with silly blunders

For who are the Potter old they may be

Dorea and Charlus or Euphemia and...Flea?

And woe to the person who travels in time,

Always back to 1945?

Still never sure if the Grangers are plain

Or a lost squib line with a daughter named...Jane?

Don't forget the Founders Four,

Whose Heir is of course one you'd adore

Speaking of heirs oh my Lord!

Black-Potter-Peverell-add-some-more

Let's not forget Draco the character blank slate,

Whatever quality you want, add then shake.

And Luna yes Luna never forget that witch,

Foreshadowing needed? There's your niche!

Dark and Light are a split that could exist,

And gray is Harry, oh what a twist!

But that's not all, don't forget the other Potter!

A twin believed to be chosen! That rotter!

The Ministry is corrupt, and full of hateful purebloods

Which is why a marriage law exists for the mudbloods?

No matter the cliche or fact you may use,

Or filter of fanfiction you may peruse

The world of JK is ours for the taking

Whatever you'd like, go ahead making

Something for all, no matter your color,

Knight, Politician, Worker or Scholar

A small little poem created to enjoy

Harry Potter, our wonderful school boy.

(Edit because mobile layout sucked)


** This is very nice, but isn't Daphne the blank slate? I'd say Draco has quite a lot of canon characterization.

*** That's definitely true. Still, Draco has a ton more "breadth" in terms of characterizations of him that you actually see of him. Daphne is technically a blank slate, but there's kind of 1-2 fanon consensus characterizations that are basically constant. In contrast, Draco can be anything, and it'll generally varies drastically from his actual canon characterization- you can have him be good, bad, whiny, arrogant, assertive, well-raised, a master of Occlumency, etc.

22% of fanfics on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] have him listed in the info box as one of the main characters, which is crazy when Hermione only hits 23.6% and Harry hits 28.5% (Ron is obviously only a major listed character in 6.1% of fics on that website)

**** That is probably very misleading though, given that there are a lot of descriptions where it's implied but never stated outright that Harry is the main character.

Where as Draco being the MC is a distinct enough change that putting it in the summary makes sense.
