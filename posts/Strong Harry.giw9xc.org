So I feel like I have been reading fanfiction for some time now, but still most of the things I find are like more like, somone helping Harry after his awful childhood or him learning to trast again or just breaking down.

So I'm wondering if tere are any good fanfictions in wich Harry solve his problems on his own, and like becomes independent and strong, without relying on avryone around him? beacous frankly, he is way stronger the the Dursleys...

P.S. Pls ignore all of my spelling mistakes English is not my native language whatsoever
