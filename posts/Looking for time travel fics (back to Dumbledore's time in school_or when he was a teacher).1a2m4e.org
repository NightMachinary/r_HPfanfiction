Yes, I'm looking for fics where either Hermione, Harry, Ron, Fred/George or Neville goes back in time somehow to when Dumbledore were in school or when he was teaching. I would be super grateful!


** I'm guessing fics in Dumbledore's time are difficult to write because of the sheer number of OCs you would have to create. At least with voldemort or James or Albus Potter you're only a a generation or so away. It's a pity. Dumbledore's a fascinating character. I think there is a lot about him left to explore.
