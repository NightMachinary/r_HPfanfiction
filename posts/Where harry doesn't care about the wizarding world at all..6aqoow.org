He is either extremely apathetic or actively resists people trying to position them how they wish whether it be snape, and his expectation of harry being well harry or albus/voldermorts pawn or even fudge's want for a poster boy in all of these situations, and more he just doesn't care nor will he.

*** I've already read The Art of Self-Fashioning, but i haven't read Hail Odysseus. Could you tell me a bit about the story please. It's just i always skip past it, because i try to read past the first chapter, and never make it. So if you could tell me maybe if the story overall improves.

***** One last question, and only because most stories do not advertise it, and this story seems like it might do it, but does harry learn wandless magic to any degree.

******* O.k. That's a bit dissapointing. I always had a theory that learning wandless would be easier if you didn't have a wand first. I mean think of it like controlled accidental magic. Or there is no magic in there bodies but they have something about them that allows them to harness magic in the air and the wand is the focus for that, but voldermort, dumbledore, and snape have shown wandless magic skills while you could accredit age to dumbledore, and voldermort, snape being able to use the mind arts without a wand, and the mind arts in general point to some type of internal magic, and should therefore not need a wand to use magic the same way other creatures don't want or need a wand to use magic.

Harry is pretty apathetic and just cares about exploring magic. Also having sex with all the women.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
