I am definitely a Harry/Draco shipper and have read a ton of the most popular HP/DM fics (as a well as obscure ones) and the Lomonaaeren fics just aren't that great! I feel like she writes Harry suuuuper OOC. Am I just reading the wrong ones? She has over 40 fics (edit -apparently over 300!) so maybe some are better...?


** Lomonaaeren is a damn god. I mean, there're prolific writers, and there's Lomonaaeren. By ao3's counts, she's written 352 stories in the HP fandom. And yeah, not all of them are masterpieces, but all of them are written very well with intriguing and original ideas, and many are lengthy.

My favourites from her are linkao3(986297) and linkao3(685932). And I say this having read less than ~50 of those 352 works. As quick as Lomonaaeren writes, I can always pick up a new top-notch story from her as soon as run out of fics to read.

  Sequel to Easy as Falling. Not only humans were watching on that day the world changed. Now Harry is balancing delegations from the magical creatures, romance, work, and trying to keep his phoenix from eating people. A Benevolently Snarky Dark Lord's work is never done.

  Need a perfect stranger? Ask Metamorphosis. Harry Potter runs the business secretly and becomes whoever's needed for each occasion. He's not sure whether he should be more surprised, worried, or amused when Draco Malfoy comes to Metamorphosis and requests an actor who can play his boyfriend so that his parents will disown him. Yet Harry has even more dangerous choices after he creates Brian, Draco's “perfect” boyfriend. Draco doesn't know who Brian is, but he's trying to find out---and now so is Harry.

** I don't read Harry/Draco so maybe I'm not in a position to answer your question. I do however have one of my own. Do you believe any Harry/Draco isn't super OOC?

*** I've never been into Harry/Draco, and I do think the pairing is inherently somewhat OOC on both sides. That said, Draco does display an inordinate level of interest in Harry's life (far more than Harry does in his). He's constantly going out of his way to taunt Harry, whether it's his yearly visit to Harry's compartment or making buttons that say "Potter stinks." Draco even seems to spend a great deal of time talking about Harry when he's not around. So I actually don't think that Draco being into Harry romantically is a massive stretch.

It's just that it's hard to imagine Harry changing his sexuality and forgiving Draco for his many many many transgressions against Harry himself and the people Harry loves. This is the guy that routinely called Harry's best friend a racial slur. Yes, people change but I don't think Harry's values would really line up with Draco's, and morality matters to someone like Harry.

**** Malfoy being into Harry isn't what I find hard to believe, like you said. I just can't stand D/H D/Hr, it requires a complete OOC.

*** So I totally get how most Harry/Draco is or seems pretty OOC. I would argue that that really only applies to Harry though because Draco's canon character has little to no sexuality, so him being gay or bi isn't in or out of character - it's just not mentioned. Draco being such a bully actually kinda makes him repressing his feelings more believable because it gives some background for why he's such a jerk.

For Harry, I think it's most likely based on Canon that he is straight. But some of the best Harry/Draco explain away Cho and Ginny by saying how Harry was so driven by trying to live up to everyone's expectations and didn't reflect on what he really wanted until after the war.

As far as them being attracted to their enemy/rival goes, I think there is a very thin line between love and hate sometimes and They certainly were very obsessed with each other in canon - more than is normal.

***** Harry is totally bi in canon. He has internal dialogue that mentions how attractive every new character is, male or female.

** Personally, Lomonaaeren is a bit hit or miss for me. She (?) has really original ideas and usually manages to write them out decently, but it's always really predictable and more than a little cheesy at times. It just depends on what you like to read. With the amount of fics they put out, you're bound to find at least one you didn't hate...

** For me it's because she's a safe choice for a comfort fic - if it's by her, you know it has to be at least somewhat good. So I'm never too worried about quality.

** Personally, I've always found her stories too wordy. Like, the characters are always so eloquent and the conversations seem forced and not realistic to me. She has a very distinctive writing style and is definitely a very well known author. I know mostly everyone likes her but for some reason I could just never get into her stories.
