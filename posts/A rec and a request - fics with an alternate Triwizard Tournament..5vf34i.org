The rec: linkffn(Lily Potter and the Triwizard Tournament)

This is one of the better next-gen fics I've read, following Lily Luna Potter through her seventh year at Hogwarts. For the first time in over thirty years, the Triwizard Tournament is going to be held again - and all of the Potter and Weasley children have been forbidden from entering. Obviously, things don't work out as planned.

I'm interested in more fics about the tournament, whether they follow Harry or not. In particular, I'm looking for fics where the tasks are different, or interesting, or solved in different ways. I've already read too many canon rehashes.


** Linkffn(the arithmancer) has a different third task- a 3D rotating maze with gravity manipulation so the spectators can see the champions. The first and second tasks have different solutions courtesy of Hermione's strategies.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** Linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) by Jbern has HUGE issues and flaws, but also does tons of stuff right - and the new tournament scenes and revised tournament are very much a part of what it does right. Worth a try. Takes a few chapters to get going. Includes canonish tournanent stuff but also a lot of additional stuff and new material.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon) has pacing issues and is also unfinished and abandoned. That said, it also did some interesting experimentation with alternative tournament stuff eventually.

**** There are kind of a lot of characters the author hated on in a way that annoyed me. The flanderization in the writer's portrayal of the Weasley twins is one - seriously not cool or interesting to my mind. The really random "Lily slept with Remus" part of the story was stupid and badly done and added basically nothing to the story. I had a similar reaction to the parts with Snape and the polyjuice potion stuff. It felt like the author wanted an excuse to hate on some characters that other people like, and rather than finding a legit reason to do it in their canon portrayal, instead decided to make some bullshit up to make the characters abhorrent.

There were a lot of times, basically, where the author took a dump all over canon portrayals and backstory of characters, but having not changed any elements of the plot prior to the third book's ending, the new portrayals did not actually make sense with how the characters involved had been portrayed in earlier books, and in general these new portrayals were all of the 'this person who was sort of cool-ish in Rowling's work is actually an asshole'. It's sort of like the absolute worst parts of the dreadful Deathly Hallows' Albus Dumbledore backstory stuff, and it was repeated like a half dozen times to no real gain.

***** Oh you've definitely jogged my memory. Yeah, I agree that a lot of the characters were fleshed out a lot more than in canon and in directions that probably aren't accurate. But I liked how he didn't bash Ron for once. I think both Ron and Ginny were some of the most reasonable Weasley characters in that fic instead of being mindlessly bashed like in other Godlike!Harry fics.

I actually quite liked the twist about Lily and James though. It showed that they were more flawed than Harry ever knew instead of the saint like figures that they were described as. Lily wasn't cheating on James maliciously or through lust, but simply in desperation in the hope to do a ritual or something to save Harry (I forgot the exact details).

The snape part was pretty overboard though. Still gave a pretty interesting reason for Sirius' "attempted murder" thing instead of purely being Sirius' fault.

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Being in an extreme AU, the tasks were completely reworked.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542): 4 tasks, based on 4 elements - Air, Earth, Fire, Water. Spectators could follow all of them easily. Bad guys had a really good plan.

The most hilarious one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3793741/1/Harry-Potter-Unchampion][Harry Potter: Unchampion]], linkffn(3793741), in which Harry gave minimal effort and intentionally lost the tournament. Dumbledore was not happy, Voldemort even less.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): Harrymort organized an House-Elf paper airplane production line and got in as the sole Hogwarts champion. Needless to say, he wrecked the Tournament and [[/spoiler][later Voldemort's resurrection party]].

The first task is the same (dragons are always awesome), but the other four are broad strokes at best of the canon Tasks.

  COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.
