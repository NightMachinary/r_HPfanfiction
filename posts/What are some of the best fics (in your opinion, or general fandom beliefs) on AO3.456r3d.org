I just got a Kindle and also just noticed that AO3 has a download feature so I wondered what the community would recommend from that site.

I normally read fics off FF.net but I'm branching out a bit, I guess. I'm aware a lot of fanfic isn't great though and there's a lot to go through, so any recs would be great.

This is for general recs mainly. In terms of my specific tastes, I don't really like any fics that make Hermione (or any female love interest really) passive, or helpless, or needing to be saved by super!male character. Anything outside that (het, slash, no pairing, whatever rating, set at school, as kids, teenagers or adults) is up for grabs.

Thanks!


** For FFN use [[https://ficsave.com/][FicSave]]

Download as .mobi and its the correct kindle format. Although the other two formats should work as well, .mobi is just the default kindle one.

***** If anything I have a great fondness for Korrasami. They're one of my all time favourite couples in fiction.

I don't like smut all that much, but other than that I don't have all that much preferences. Korra and/or Asami focused stories would be nice.

  Harry finally realizes that he has trouble keeping lovers both because of his looks and because he isn't very good at sex. He does what he can to alter that, but it seems he's never going to be good enough to satisfy a wizard lover. When Draco Malfoy offers, Harry thinks a casual relationship with him might be the solution to his problems. But he should have remembered one thing: when it comes to Harry, Malfoy has a problem staying casual.

  When the truth about a seemingly minor Dark hex Harry has suffered leads to the dissolution of his marriage with Ginny, Harry spins into a downward spiral. His private consolation is creating a fantasy life for himself in his journal as Ethan Starfall, a normal wizard with a big family. When he receives a random owl Draco Malfoy has cast into the void as a plea for help with his son Scorpius, Harry replies---as Ethan. There's no reason, he thinks, for an epistolary friendship with Draco to go further. But Draco might have different ideas about that.

**** AO3 does a few thing much much better then FFN, which means that certain fics can only be found there.

- A much better character listing system means there is more multiple (or stranger) pairings on AO3
- An explicit rating means there is more explicit smut
- A tagging system which helps find niche fics (and kinks)
- Embedded images means there is more authors which also illustrate, which, of course, is not always a mark of quality, but it /is/ a good indication that an author loves their work.

I use both sites so much I have no idea which fics are only on AO3. As you are sort of new, pick a favorite tag (be it a pairing, or not like 'time-travel' or 'smart Harry') and sort by kudos. Sure high kudos, like favs on FFN, is again, not always a mark of a good fic, but it is a place to start.

  3 January 2002. It's Thursday morning at the Burrow and Molly has errands to run and a son to rouse from his slumber once she's back from buying groceries. Things are about to go sideways for the entire Weasley family. Romione, Hinny, and other canon couples Auror!Fic. Special guests in later chapters.

** I'm fond of linkao3(2378390) and an amusing outsider POV linkao3(971643). linkao3(Escribamens) was a unique concept.

Ao3 tends to skew heavily to slash and explicit stuff, because I think people prefer FFnet if their story doesn't fall into those categories. FFnet was there first, after all.
