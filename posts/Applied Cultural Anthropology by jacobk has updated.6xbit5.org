[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]] is a Slytherin Hermione fic, and probably the best Slytherin Hermione fic. It has a realistic portrayal of how Hermione might have fared in Slytherin with more emphasis on her creative and ruthless side. Without a doubt, this is my favourite characterization of Hermione but the other Slytherin characters like Snape and Malfoy are depicted well too. It hasn't updated since April of last year so this is a pleasant surprise.

**** The author writes in spurts of chapters if I remember correctly. We should get a few more before they switch to another story again.

**** Last time I've been there, it was "Sorry, was busy. Next update should be in a week or two" /checks in a month later/, /fic is deleted./ Ughh.

*** Pretty much same, but don't feel like rereading the whole thing right now, so if it ever gets finished might go back, or maybe in a couple updates if it keeps updating occasionally.

** On one hand you can't really complain that someone providing free entertainment hasn't been providing regularly but... yeah, you can.

That's cool and all, but I'm kinda sick of rereading half the fic to stay on track with the annual update. If this is ever completed, I might get back to it. As is, nah thanks.

**** Yes. I've also been doing some original fiction reading and dipping my quill into original fiction of my own, but I plan on swinging back to fanfic writing in the fall.

Edit: I can't seem to write for shit in the summer. The weather exhaust me. Usually when things get busy in the fall (college resumes and stuff) and I have /less/ free time, I suddenly start writing /more/. Summer escalates my procrastination into untamed heights.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
