I recently read HPMoR and Significant Digits and while I didn't quite like how weird and unrealistic Harry was I liked the way magic was used in unexpected ways (example: time turner, magic space satellite, transfiguration).

I also read "Honestly Harry" and "Harry gets motivated" and while I really liked them they were way too short. Any recommendations for similar stories?


** I like the idea of assassinating someone by dispelling them.

Feeding them food transfigured from air over a very long time means the matter that makes up their body is also transfigured air. After a certain point this becomes a fatal condition when that matter is dispelled.

*** No, you just need a glass or two of water --- maybe three to be on the sure side. Transfigure it back about 15-20 minutes after they drink it and a majority will be in their bloodstream. At that point, one of two things happens:

1. If the volume remains relatively constant, they suddenly have the worst case of the bends /ever,/ and will probably have a stroke/heart attack combo the moment the bubbles hit their brain and heart.
2. If the volume expands with the same ratio as steam... well, one liter of water would instantly become 1600 liters of air. Inside them. The bone shrapnel alone would probably kill someone nearby.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

#+begin_quote
  Enter the world of Pokémon from a rational perspective. Instead of starting his journey in ignorance, Red has spent his years studying the creatures so central to his world... and he doesn't quite agree with all the information in his books. No time for rookie mistakes here: he's on a quest to discover the true nature of Pokémon, and maybe even find out where they really come from.

** Have you read any of the other HPMoR recursive fanfic? I quite like linkffn(Following the Phoenix). A lot of people are partial to linkffn(Minds, Names, and Faces), though I'm more neutral on that one. Linkffn(Nothing Left But Fire) is short, but has some interesting concepts.

#+begin_quote
  A single-/dual-point-of-departure spinoff from Less Wrong's brilliant story "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality", branching away in Chapter 81. Hermione is sent to Azkaban, but Harry is not about to give up. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like his enemy is about to leave things alone either.

  An AU/Continuation recursive fanfic of the excellent "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality". Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, the Boy-Who-Lived, General Chaos, etc., has had a rather busy year. With the term drawing to a close, Harry starts to discover the truth behind the enigmatic Defence Professor, Quirinus Quirrell.
