I recently read On the Way to Greatness linkffn(4745329) and my favorite part of it was when Voldemort hit Harry with the killing curse after getting his body back, destroying the Horcrux in Harry. Does anyone know of other fics where this happens? (Bonus points for an angst-y "King's Cross" type scene where he sees his parents.) Thanks!


** linkffn(Honour Thy Blood) has Harry being hit in the graveyard and dying before being saved by great uncle Black who trains him.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

*** Man, I totally forgot that happened in that fic, whoops. (I think Ginny having a kid at 15 overshadowed everything else in it for me, lol.)

**** Don't feel bad; I reread the fic around two to four times a year, and there's still some things I forget that happened until after I reread it again lol.

  The stupid hat was stupid and refused to help Harry. The whole school and its division in houses was stupid too, and the teachers.Harry was in Hogwarts, but he didn't want to be. He wanted to go back home.
