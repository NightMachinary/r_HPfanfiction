  Someone casts the Imperius curse on Draco Malfoy, and whatever the instructions may be, Harry finds himself an unwilling target. The encounter leaves him torn between pleasure and revulsion. As they fight in the aftermath, a tense game begins. Harry fights to convince Malfoy, and himself, that he was not affected by that initial encounter, or any of those following it. Faced with a series of escalating encounters, Harry must come to terms with desiring things he never thought he could, things he wishes he didn't respond to. They each use signs of arousal as weapons against each other in a mad struggle to finally shame the other into backing down for good.But it's only after the game is over that Harry starts to understand.(Harry Potter/Draco Malfoy is the main pairing, others are background/side pairings and Harry Potter/George Weasley is brief)

**** I give it a B (83%).

I thought the characterizations were pretty good in general and the writing was good. However, the story was very angsty, their relationship was really unhealthy/toxic, and honestly, the story had too much smut (2-3 times per chapter).

According to my notes, I list "sex" as a 3rd character because basically the story was about their unhealthy, angsty sexual relationship. If that is your jam, you may like it, as it wasn't a badly written story. Personally, I like a bit more romance and a lot less angst in my fics so that's why I only gave it a low B.

  It started with the spin of a bottle, and now Harry and Draco have gotten themselves so far into their own game there's almost no way out again. Except to keep playing.
