Lunas hubby and protection from nargles.

Haven't read the first one, but I have head good things about it. I have read the latter and remember it being rather conflict free. Not entirely sure though, hopefully you find something you like.

** I've read both and really enjoyed both. Luna makes a lot of since as a paring to Harry, in my opinion. I think the difficulty lies in how truly difficult it is to write Luna's character the right way.

** Not my speed most of the time (pure romance, I mean), But I did like those two quite a lot. Very cute, very fluffy, and surprisingly compelling.

Part of a series of one shots (I guess, though it's debatable), of which you'll want to avoid the latter if you don't want sadness.
