All I remember is that it was published on Ff.net and that they went to Riddle's time and had to get Dumbledore's past persona out of the way at the beginning of the fick. Also Hermione charming their clothes before they go to make them blend in with 40's crowd. I recall I really enjoyed it though, because unlikely teams are definitely my jam. Butterbeer for anyone who can help <3!

*** It's linkffn(Tearing at the Fabric) (though without the author, it's not guaranteed to find the right fic).

  An unlikely, yet undoubtedly brilliant trio take on a huge task. When war is over and nobody wins, there is nothing left to do but go back to the beginning and stop the hate which sparked an inferno. AU-time line and plot differences, time travel. Complete.
