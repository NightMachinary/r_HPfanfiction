** How would that work? "Nobody lives and everybody dies" is the only plot I can come up with off the top of my head.

*** Good point, they do seem to have quite conflicting premises. Harry Potter is steeped in destiny, R&M is in existential randomness. I think I'd expand on "infinite timelines, infinite possibilities" aspect of R&M. Maybe Rick can school Harry on the meanings of freedom and choice. I think I can also see him trying to seduce Hermione. Wait, maybe I should write this thing.

** This isn't really a crossover, and happens to be a oneshot, but it's a fun read nonetheless. linkffn(12369316)

  It's Rick and Morty, but with Dumbledore and Harry. Starting in Harry's fifth year, the real Dumbledore appears after several years of being away. Now Harry, already swamped with classes, a resurgent Voldemort, puberty, and a denying Ministry, needs to deal with a definitely insane and probable sociopathic Dumbledore. Will anything ever be the same again?

*** Ha ha! I haven't read it now but I'm thinking in Morty's voice, "Ah geez, Dumbledore. Is that really necessary?"
