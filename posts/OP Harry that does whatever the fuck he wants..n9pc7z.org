Like, let's imagine he's in Slytherin. It's fanon Slytherin, which has politics and shit, and king/queen of Slytherin. Enter Harry Potter. He has absolutely no shit to give about politics, if anyone annoys him they're quickly taught their place, king or not.

That kinda stuff.

Like, he can do whatever he wants because no one can stop him. Wanna expel him? Good luck getting him out of the castle. No one can make him do shit.


** "I am the King of Slytherin and you shall do as I say!"

"Want to hear a quick fun fact? You do! Alright, here it is: did you know that the French people cut the head off of their king because he was being an asshole? Here's another fun fact: did you know that my great great aunt was French? Wanna hear the best fun fact of all, though? Did you know that you're being an asshole? Vive La Revolution, am I right?"

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.
