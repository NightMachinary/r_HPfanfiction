I've noticed that for the most part stories in fanfiction use dialogue almost entirely as a method of exposition, or more specifically where Harry says his life story in its unfiltered entirety. I feel as though Dialogue is more often than not OOC, and I'd like examples where that isn't the case; where the dialogue feels as though it was actually spoken by a human being.

So, basically any story where the dialogue is interesting, or funny or witty, or something other than clunky. Any characters, any length, any genre.

Thanks.


** *Grow Young With Me* - This is what came to mind immediately. Most of the story is just Harry and an OC talking at a cafe. Best dialogue I've read in fanfiction. linkffn(11111990)

*** I've read that and I couldn't agree more - it's exactly the sort of thing I'd like to read more of. Couldn't recommend it highly enough.

** The "Weasley Girl" stories has some good back-and-forth dialogue between its characters, particularly "Secrets of the Past." The author's one of the few I know who manages to capture Harry's snarky, sarcastic side without going overboard with it... and the banter between Fred and George is really funny.

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

  AU, Sequel to "Weasley Girl." In an alternate universe where Ron Weasley was born a girl, and where Harry's first Hogwarts year turned out a little different as a result, the famous "Potter's Gang" are back for their second year at Hogwarts and hoping perhaps for a calmer year... ...but with a dramatic escape, a mysterious diary, a strange cat, a "loony" girl, a hidden monster and many past secrets coming to light, it looks like this year will be at least as eventful and dangerous as the previous one. Second novel in the "Weasley Girl" Trilogy. Fem!Ron, everyone else is their canon gender.

  February 29, 1980. Leap Day. At the Burrow, Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred and George, and (sigh) Great Auntie Muriel are waiting for the newest Weasley brother to be born. But something unexpected is about to happen. One-shot, prelude to the "Weasley Girl" trilogy.

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) I very much enjoy the dialogue here. It ranges from witty, interesting to really hilarious to serious and tends to really capture each character.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the accidental Horcrux) I love the inner dialogue between Voldemorts horcrux and Harry.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon. (Now at Hogwarts)
