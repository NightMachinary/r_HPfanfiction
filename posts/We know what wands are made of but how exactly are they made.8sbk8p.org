Disclaimer: Any and all ideas presented maybe nicked (knicked?) for the op's personal fic.

But in all seriousness, I know more about wands after starting a fanfic project on it than I ever really wanted to know. Everything from what types of woods are used and what kind of people they favor, to the different wand cores and the personality they reflect. There's wand rigidity and wand length and how they might reflect a person's character or forearm length respectively. I've also read, in one of the many tabs about wandlore I have open in the background, that there might be a link to a person's birth month and their wand being made for when they turn 11.

My question in all of this is: How exactly are wands made?

And magic ain't a valid answer.

How does the wand maker acquire the cores and wand woods? How do the cores get inside the wand? Why are the wands carved into a specific shape? Is there a reason for it beyond focusing the magic? And what's up with the whole remembering every wand ever sold? Do all wand makers have that ability? Is it an innate ability or is it learned? Why the rivalry between Ollivander and Gregorovitch? Is it just a turn war or is there an actual difference in the wands being made? How does a wood choose a core?

So many questions to ponder and some of them might already have answers in sources I haven't read. If so, please link them to me, I would love to read through them!


** - Well acquiring the cores seems straightforward enough. It seems like wizards sell pretty much everything from a dragon, and that may be the real reason they even keep the lizards alive anyway (#dragonsarepeopletoo). Unicorn hair apparently just pulls off on branches, so thats not too difficult. Of course, there is a problem of phoenix feathers. Literally only two tamed phoenix(s?) are mentioned in canon. I guess you can assume they drop them as they age like other birds as well, or leave the behind when they die and are reborn.
- Wand woods wouldn't be too difficult: just look for trees with a lot of bowtruckles or other magical creatures hanging about.
- Getting the cores in the wand seems difficult. However, magic leaves a lot of possibilities. For example, Dumbledore apparently "apparated" Harry's stuff, including his owl, to the Burrow instantly in HBP, so thats a possibility. Additionally, there are probably spells that make a material intangible, which combined with a levitation-movement spell could place the core in the wood.
- As for Ollivander...if you check Pottermore, it mentions his wand wood is hornbeam. Apparently, this wood is common among magicals who excel in a particular field/skill of magic. Its entirely possible he has dedicated such time and effort to his craft that he is personally invested in each wand he sells or makes. He would need to be, since Unicorn hair sells for 10 galleons while he sells wands for 7-8 galleons. Not only that, he lives alone and seems addicted to his work. Artists and artisans are sometimes like this.
- Mostly though, Ollivander only appears as plot device. In GoF, the whole "Weighing of the Wands" is a way for Rowling to remind everyone that Harry shares a wand core with Voldemort (it is for children, they might forget). In DH, he serves as exposition about the Elder Wand and explaining the for some reason previously unexplained rules/laws of wandlore that Harry later uses to oneshot Voldemort.
- As for wand shape. Their is no real indication in the /books/ that wands have any intricate morphologies. Thats all the movies right there, mostly for effect and to distinguish one person from another (bad people all have white or black wands, good people have colorful tan/brown/wood-like wands). The only noticeable differences in the books are the wand woods, lengths, and colors (most people can't identify beyond this).

Maybe one tail hair makes for several wand cores. Maybe wands are subsidized by the Ministry. Maybe Rowling didn't do the math and it just doesn't make sense.

**** I was thinking that some unicorn hairs are better for wand cores (healthiest, newest and therefore less folded, spindled, or otherwise damaged), but the majority make for excellent binding material, and are more valuable the longer they are. Anyone needing wand core hairs will pluck them from the unicorn, but the long strands have many other magical uses.

Or more simply, one unicorn tail hair can be cut down to four or five wand cores, so there's an economy of purchase for the full strand.

Thats sort of the problem with the HP universe. If you dig down into it, you realize how much things can be different while still being described using the same words.

That was both Rowling's strength and weakness as a writer: she always kept things general enough to set the scene while allowing readers to fill in the blanks in their minds.

*** As for rivalry. Let me ask you, is there a rivalry between Hogwarts and Beauxbatons? In theory yes. In practice, not that many people seem to even think about their "rival" much. Why would they? It doesn't affect anything in their day to day lives.

Gregorovitch and Ollivander have different styles and beliefs about wands:

- What woods are better (example Gregorovitch might use Linden wood, a common german tree wood, while Ollivander may use English Oak).
- Ollivander only uses three cores, but others are known to be used. Besides Veela hair, material from Kelpies, Trolls, Thunder Birds and others are known to be used in wand woods.
- Other chacteristics can be disagreed upon as well: what the meaning of "rigidity" is, what woods and cores are too unstable, how to collect materials, etc.

At the end of the day, most wizards/witches probably just go to whichever wandmaker they have easiest access to, has a better reputation, or is "traditional" for their family/culture/society.

** My headcannon is that the wandmaker harvests appropriate wood (or buys it from a grower/harvester) and stockpiles it. The wandmaker then meditates on the core he has on hand while selecting a woodblock and carving it. -carving the wand does have some artistic properties so it might end up willowy or tapered, bent or whatever really He then engorges the wood, transfigures it into having a gap into which he can insert the core, checks to make sure it isn't poking out anywhere and then cancels both spells so that the core is now interwoven molecularly with the wood.

** I had this idea not so long ago that wands were actually homes for magical spirits; different plants, animal parts, woods, fine craftsmanship, et-cetera, went into making it a desirable possession-target for spiritual creatures.

The idea being that once a spirit was snugly nesting inside a wand, they would help a wizard/witch with performing magic; all the faux-latin, particular motions and willpower and whatnot are more about communicating what you want done to your wand-spirit rather than any particular science, and as you grow older and you and your spirit get to know each other, spells become easier for you.

*** Adding to this (since I'm already on board with the idea); some woods and cores are more 'comfortable' for certain spirits to occupy, which is why wand behavior is somewhat predictable based on the type of wood and core used. This also gives rise to preferences of the type of magic those spirits favor.

** Likely by purchasing them or going to get them themselves. Cut, drilled, or spelled depending on your fandom flavor. Wands aren't carved as far as I know, they're just sticks taken off of trees; specific shapes are a movie thing. A wizard without a wand is just an uppity muggle. Wands shape the wizard just as much as the wizard shapes the wand. Fuck if I know. Learned, probably. Why the rivalry between Pepsi and Coca Cola? Is there a difference between Pepsi and Coke? It doesn't, the wandmaker picks them, and the combination chooses a witch or wizard.

*** Though customized shapes for everyday wands are a movie-thing, the Elder Wand has decorative carvings, and Rowling's sketches depict wands as perfectly straight, like your typical magician's wand; so I would think they /are/ carved, just not decorated unless it's a "fancy model" like the Elder Wand. Also, polishing (and applying veneer to) wands, as we know wizards do from the Weighing of the Wand, only makes sense if they're polished wood as opposed to random twigs that still have bark.

*** So for the combinations it's along the lines of throwing something at the wall and seeing what sticks? That actually could work but the statics of it would be awful!

Ollivander for example has his wands down to 3 cores and 38 woods. The likelihood of a specific wand being made is 1 in 114 (math might be way off) and that's only if there really is no affinity for a wood to choose a specific core. Yeesh.

** It's definitely 'nicked' :)

If you're looking for specific, canonical sources, even the Pottermore entries are pretty thin. But if you're looking for fanon ideas, I've come up with several in my own in-progress fic: linkffn(12723602)

Quick disclaimer: This may not quench your thirst for wandlore ideas as much as you'd like, because the fact that Garrick Ollivander is not as forthcoming a teacher as his son would prefer, and his son's impatience with him, is one of the central conflicts of my story. I'm looking forward to resolving this conflict in my own creative ways as my story nears its end in another ~10 chapters or so.

I go into the most detail about the inner workings of Ollivander's in the following chapters:

- Chapter 7: The Unicorn Hunt
- The beginning of Chapter 9: Severus Snape
- Chapter 11: A Group Lesson
- The beginning of Chapter 21: Todd's Plan
- (Todd Ollivander also touches a little bit on how different wands favour different types of magic in Chapter 16: Our Most Inexhaustible Source of Magic, and you also have a slight window into the wand-creation incantation at the beginning of Chapter 20: Quality Quidditch Supplies)

I'm leaving a chapter in which Todd makes a wand for my climax, or possibly even after my climax, though I'd be more than happy to share that unpublished chapter with you. I wrote it months ago.

This fanfic project you mentioned is very interesting to me (for obvious reasons, haha), feel free to share more!

  Todd Ollivander can't seem to shake his feelings for the new apprentice at his father's wand shop. It's not a good time to be distracted, as it's becoming clearer and clearer that Ollivander's is a major target of Lord Voldemort's during the First Wizarding War. (For those who like to skip around to get a sense of a fic, in Chapter One I suggest which chapters I think are my best.)

** One of my headcanons:

The two independent aspects of a wand are the wood and the core. These two determine several possible lengths for the wand; other lengths work, but not well. (Neville may as well have had a wand that was half an inch too short but otherwise suited to him.) The core, wood, and length determine who it's suitable for. They also determine a series of runes used to improve the function and longevity of the wand.

Preparing cores is a process, too, similar to tanning: a set of simple potions, cleaning, soaking, pressing, that kind of thing. Might take anywhere from a couple days to several months, depending on the core. The wood doesn't require special care aside from drying and a final shellacking at the end.

At the basic level, you can match any wood with any core. At the expert level, there are many subtle considerations for improving wand quality. A beginner's wand might be a quarter as effective as an Ollivander and last only a few years, even with the same materials. Similarly, width and taper have an impact, but at the basic level, your main concerns are successfully assembling something that a person can reasonably hold and wave. There's a handful of other wandmakers; they use cheaper materials (largely plant-based) and tend to have worse technique.

To insert the core into the wood, you use a spell that softens the wood, then thread in the core with a sort of needle. The wood reforms after the needle passes, like a liquid, and the needle opens once the core is in place, leaving it embedded in the wood.

In the past, people used staves made of magical wood, sometimes with gems embedded, sometimes with parts of magical plants and creatures. Bones at first, since they were durable and didn't require much preparation. These staves were bulky and inconvenient. They lasted pretty well, but they weren't terribly effective. By the time of the Founders, wands were common for detailed work but kind of sucky for power, so people who were rich enough had both. Things that required both power and finesse were broken into rituals involving multiple people, some with wands and some with staves.

Two hundred years later, wand technology had advanced to the point that few people used staves. But at this point, the wood-softening spell hadn't been invented, so the core was inserted by splitting the wand, cutting a groove, and then reconnecting the pieces around the core. The wand would be held together with wooden rings (expanded, fitted around the shaft into more grooves, and shrunk) and glue. This process was still the dominant one up until the past 70 years or so -- Ron, in particular, started off using a wand made this way.

** I think linkffn(Griffon Reborn) has a lot about the wandmaking process. My personal headcanon is probably overly complicated, but I can describe it a little:

- Acquiring materials: EVERYTHING is important. Location, time acquired (lunar cycles, etc), method of taking (willingly given, etc), tools used (silver knife?), age of source, and so on. Ollivander only gives the cliff-notes version to customers unless they ask for more detail.
- Placing core: I think there are multiple methods invented through history, with wandmakers having preferred ones. Some examples include transfiguration to make the wood "flow" around the core and set; impossibly intricate wood joinery; magically bonding the two together using an alchemical process; growing the wood around the core; etc.
- Carving/shape: I think wands call/speak to wandmakers and to an extent, their owners. What the wandmaker senses from the developing wand guides their hand when carving. I think the shaping helps to define how a specific wand will work magic (powerfully, delicately, conducted like an orchestra), but that it is essentially part of each wand's unique character.
- I don't think eidetic memory is necessary for wandmaking. It is, however, useful for such a nuanced area. In my AU there exist line magics (like metamorphmagery, seer blood, etc) which were carefully crafted over generations by pureblood ancestors (before blood magic rituals were deemed illegal). I think Ollivander's memory is one of these.
- Rivalry: I think it's a friendly rivalry between respected peers. The wandmaking community is small, and there's room in the world for all of them without stepping on each others' toes. I think different wandmakers have different techniques and preferences to others, and the "style" of a wandmaker can be recognised if you have some familiarity with their work.
- How woods and cores are matched: I think those who are sensitive to magic can pick up on some kind of harmony between the feelings given off by compatible materials.

An interesting theory I saw discussed here previously was that Divination was an essential part of wandlore: every wand was made with the knowledge that it /will/ be sold, at some point in the future.

** I have a detailed process worked out for wandmaking in the Arithmancer-Verse, which I believe is consistent with canon. Key to this process is that there is an enormous range of quality in amateur wands. If you just pick up a stick off the ground and stick a strand of a low-grade magical material like Flitterbloom in it, it will burn out instantly if you try to push anything more than a /Lumos/ through it. However, a professional wand will last a lifetime, so there have to be major differences.

First, trees are selected for their innate magical energy. Just as there are magical and non-magical humans, there are also magical and non-magical trees, the former being suitable for wand wood. (Pottermore effectively says as much.) Detection spells, feeling magic like Dumbledore does, and searching for Bowtruckles all provide clues to find the best wand trees. Once a magical tree is found, the best branches are harvested from it, selected for straightness, tight grain, and strength of the wood. The branches are stripped of bark and naturally dried for at least a year. (I'm drawing inspiration from how violins are made.)

For cores, unicorn hairs and phoenix feathers are easy enough to obtain if you can catch the animal. Dragon heartstrings are trickier. They would probably have to be obtained from a reservation when a dragon dies. In each case, a best estimate of the age, sex, size, and health of the animal are recorded, along with any unusual characteristics, which will inform the pairing with the wood and the traits of the finished wand.

Matching woods and cores is more of an art form, driven as much by instinct as by actual rules. If the materials' magic clashes with each other, the wand will fail in testing, and some pairings are harder to make work than others.

Once the materials are selected, a wand blank is made by whittling down a branch to an appropriately-sized cylinder, then is split down the middle with a sharp knife. The core is placed between the two halves, and they are glued together using a glue made from a special proprietary potion. Most of the carving from that point is decorative, but will tend to reinforce the magical traits of the wand in esoteric ways. However, tiny runes are also carved into the wand that increase its strength and resilience (and help the owner grip the wand). Testing is done at multiple points in this phase, and it is sometimes possible to save a poorly-matched wand (like Harry's!) by adding the right runes. Finally, the wand is coated with a varnish that is another proprietary potion.

I doubt an eidetic memory is necessary to make wands, but it's entirely possible that Ollivander is considered the best there is not because he makes better wands (although they are still quite good), but because his eidetic memory for the exact qualities of each wand lets him make the best possible match to each customer. It wouldn't have to be a result of /being/ a wandmaker either. There are other cases of wizards who simply have superior mental skills. (Remember that Percy says in apparent seriousness that Barty Crouch Sr knows over 200 languages.)

Wandmaking can be learned, but like any craft, it takes natural talent and a lifetime of work to become the best like Ollivander. Per Pottermore, the "rivalry" between Ollivander and Gregorovitch is most likely because they have differing philosophies about wandlore and wandcraft. Other than guarding their secret methods and recipes, I doubt the rivalry between wandmakers is that strong, especially in different countries.
