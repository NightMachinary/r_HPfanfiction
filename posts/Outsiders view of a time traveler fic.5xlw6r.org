Are there any fics that are technically a timetravel fic, but told from the view of someone who isn't the time traveler?

For instance: After Voldemort wins the war, Harry gets desperate and goes back in time to Marauder Era, where we follow James and co. as they try to make sense of the strange antics of this "Harry Evans" person (when he is actually rounding up horcruxes or preempting Voldemort's recruitment of certain Death Eaters, etc etc). If you have anything that matches, please point me in the appropriate direction.

Any person, any era, any pairing. The main point being the the narrator does not know the person is a time traveler, while we, the audience do. Maybe. If its a twist I'll take it as well, although how you would recommend it without spoiling it is another challenge......

Thanks in advance.


** "Many Thanks" might fit - James wonders about Hermione's actions, although he does realise that she's a time traveler relatively quickly.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

** The Red Knight linkffn(12141684) has something like this; the main character is a time traveler, but he encounters two time travelers from a different world entirely. It's not very pretty (The encounters, I mean. The fic is great!).

--------------

On another note, I found myself wondering recently; do time travelers ever think about the universe at large? Are they rewinding the whole universe just for their own little mortal affairs? Or just a more localized area, like the entire galaxy, or the solar system, or even just the planet? What happens if you rewind just the planet and astronauts on the moon or Mars notice?

"Uh, Houston? We have a problem...why are you even there, Houston? Why is Earth suddenly back in the 1970's? What's going on?"

There's a couple of ways I can think of to go around this; one is, yes, time is only rewound in a limited spatial area, which means it can be observed from the outside; this has a lot of plot potential in allowing a clash between past and present, and could even let various characters meet their own past selves.

The other way I can think of is that attempted time travel instead creates a pocket dimension, with the traits of so-and-so section of the universe from x amount of time ago; rather than remaining permanently isolated, once time in the pocket dimension lines up with time in the normal-world, the two areas that exist in both can fuse together, letting the pocket dimension overwrite its part of the main universe. Again, this has potential, if your protagonist observed inexplicable spatial changes, or widespread dissonance between what people remember and what's true ("Why is there a statue of...'Dark Lord Voldemort' here? I thought it was a Statue of Liberty...the internet has both, what the...?").

There's a thought for a fic; when Voldemort/Grindelwald/et-cetera Dark Lord goes far back in time to where no-one can resist him and takes over the world, people in the present day suddenly find their life circumstances, and even bodies, far different to what they remember them being the day before. What do you do when the entire population of the planet Earth is cast in roles they're unprepared for?

I'd assume simply rewinding physics isn't the problem, it's rewinding /souls/ that are the important part. We know in the HP universe souls exist, and are what makes a human (Muggles can be kissed, afaik) function.

So I assume time-travelling sort of "resets" the souls, and the physical world is easier?

...Another interesting possibility! Through some trick of magic, Harry is gifted a great deal of power and knowledge from the future. But it comes at a cost; the incredible amount of magical energy that was 'loaned' from the future to send the soul package must be repaid, and when its due date rolls around, all of the British Isles will be drained of their magic for (let's say) 7 days.

Can Harry and his allies defeat Voldemort, and evacuate the islands of all magic (to preserve the Statute of Secrecy) before that deadline rolls around?

*** I think going into specifics like that is rather pointless unless the author makes a point of doing it. There's really only 2 ways that it makes sense, everything in the universe does a big rewind and something gets sent back. No nonsense. Or you have that many-worlds theory where you blink out of existence or "die" in you present universe and you end up in a brand new universe that is in the past. Actually there are a good number of different ways the latter might be, I think Isaac Arthur has a youtube video where he discusses time travel in some depth like that for the purposes of looking at it in fiction. He kinda said it all so I'd just be repeating.
