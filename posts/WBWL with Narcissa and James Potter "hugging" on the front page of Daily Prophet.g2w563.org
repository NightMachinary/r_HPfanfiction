Which caused Harry rib injuries.

Ron and the WBWL ate with their hands. Even after Herbology. Despite not wearing gloves or washing up.

And I think the WBWL wound up as a seeker on Gryffindor quidditch team despite kind of sucking.

*** WBWL was basically Ralph Wiggum. He and Ron were recommended being held back, but couldn't because Arthur had a lordship/wizengamot seat now. Dumbles didn't want to annoy him.

Draco lost his wand, and was iirc tempted to go for a muggle style beatdown after the DP showed up. The prank involved polyjuice and Knocturn Alley hookers.

Story was borderline parody.

*** I don't remember it being completed when I read it, and the Malfoys were bad.

I think the WBWL was named James, but I'm not positive.
