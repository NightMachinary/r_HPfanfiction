Just looking for any fics with an abundance of Slughorn. Whether that is as a mentor or he gets a bigger role in some way


** linkffn(The Arithmancer)

Hermione is good at maths. Later on in the story, she hires Slughorn as a private tutor.

** My story doesn't have enough of him to qualify but I love me some Slughorn. In my headcanon he is all about the stuff that probably won't work 100% of the time in magic but is worth exploring sometimes. So he knows all the fringe spells and curses, and stuff, which is why he knew about Horcruxes. So yay for the Slughorn love!

** Slughorn is a fascinating character and I wish there were more fics with him! There is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4457149/1/Last-Chance][Last Chance]], which is a Dumbledore-mentors-Tom-Riddle fic, where Slughorn is Dumbledore's friend. He is not the main character, but plays an important role in the story.
