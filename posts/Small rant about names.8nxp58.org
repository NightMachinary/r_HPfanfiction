I have recently dove head first into the fanfiction community and I love it. But holy shit do I have a bone to pick about some names. These issues have been jumping off the page at me and I need to air them out to those who may understand.

1. Why is Hermione's middle name ever written as Jane instead of Jean? It has no effect on the story(that I've ever seen) and is so damn close to being Jean I don't understand trying to be original by doing it.

1.5. Same goes for other name changes. For example, Fleur's mother is named Apolline, and always has been. Unless you're doing a hardcore AU, changing names for the sake of originality doesn't make sense to me.

1. Albus's brother is Aberforth, not Alberforth. Just... nothing more to say.

2. Why does every child have to be named after someone? I understand the Potter family continuing the middle name thing, but that's tradition. James's dad was Charlus, so that was his middle name, Harry James continuing that pattern, etc. But every child does not need some namesake from our lovely cast of characters.

Edit: I now have found out that I was wrong about the exact Potter naming conventions, and confused fic for canon in regards to James's dad, who was named Fleamont. Also, Hermione's middle name was apparently retconned from Jane to Jean!(I prefer Jean by far anyway, so good on you JK)

I'd like to say I respect artistic license, do whatever the hell you want. Make Harry's hair blonde and his eyes lilac, give Padma Patil an eyepatch and the ability to fly, have Mundungus become a Dark Lord. One of my favorite changes was from a fic where Albus was revealed to have added 2 of his middle names on a whim. Changing names just feels like an unnecessary change at times, but this was just me getting something off my chest anyway, who am I to judge

Because JKR retconned Hermione's middle name to "Jean" so she didn't share "Jane" as a middle name with Umbridge, so a lot of fans might not have noticed.

"Alberforth" is probably just a common typo.

**** Yeah. She gave "Jane" as a middle-name in an interview early on and it made the rounds; then in /Deathly Hallows/, suddenly, when the middle name came up, it was Jean. Some people just glossed over it.

**** Fleamont and Euphemia are great names. I like Charlus and Dorea as well, but they were never actually James' parents. Just a glimpse of a name on a different family's family tree.

I also like the justification for them choosing James for their son because they both felt they had very stuffy names and wanted a normal name for their son.

** My only big pet peeve about the naming thing is the retconn with Fleamont/Euphemia. I don't personally use it and refuse to read most stories that do. There was already a long established Fanon naming scheme of Charlus and Dorea for the Potter Family and imo JKR should've just gone and made that canon instead of retro-actively making new names on a whim and announcing them as the new canon. Also in a similar vein; for the love of god it's Dan and Emma Granger. Nothing else.

*** I think it can work, as "Harry" is a very common sounding name in comparison to the vast majority of names from old family lines. I think my favourite variation is his actual name being Henry, though, as it has history within the family (there was at least one Henry Potter in the family tree), and Harry is actually a very common nickname for Henry.

** Firstly, you have two points 1.

1.- Someone already stated there was a small point where her canon name WAS Jane. Most people don't realize the change, also, since Jean is a much more localized european name, where as Jane is much more... Common.

1.5.- Artistic license! Doesn't have to make sense to be read, maybe not enjoyed, but can be read. Also, do note some naming conventions for secondary characters that don't get enough screen time are often pulled from other fics. Apolline is often related to Jean-Pierre for the father, similar to how 'Mione's parents are named Dan and Emma, something Harmony Shippers made popular and some people actually think canon since most HxHg fics will use it.

1 again .- I have never seen an Alberforth, which makes me believe is a typo.

2.- I mean no insult, but where do you come from that such thing is, well, not a thing? I myself I'm named after my father and several others in my family are similar. Children having namesakes is pretty common! Really, namesaking in HP is rather TAME. With how purebloods are painted I wouldn't be surprised about Lucius Malfoy II or Theodore Nott VI being a thing, just outright name your heir EXACTLY like you.

*** On your last point: we actually know that the Sirius Black we see is actually Sirius Black III. The Black family is especially bad with repeat names. But then again, they're almost as inbred as the Gaunts so naming the son after the father just makes things easier whenever the son hooks up with the mother.

For this one, I can see 4 reasons:\\
* the author genuinely think that it is spelled like this.\\
* the author used something like [Dumbledore2] and replaced automatically all instance of the word by a typo.\\
* the author thinks it's funny and doesn't care.\\
