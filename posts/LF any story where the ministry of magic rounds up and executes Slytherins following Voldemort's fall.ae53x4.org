Or anything where the magical world generally gets vindictive and vengeful towards anything voldemort adjacent following the war.

Bonus points if Dumbledore starts wearing green or something to protect his kids


** linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4269983/1/Anything-but-Slytherin]]) is not the exactly the same, but has a similar premise

  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming)

It's not exactly what you describe, but in the sequels of this a certain someone takes over Hogwarts (I won't say who to not spoil it) and they're completely brutal towards Slytherins during the war against Voldemort.

Grindelwald takes over Hogwarts after Dumbledore dies and does various things including using Slytherins as human sacrifices for a ritual to raise an army of Inferi to use against Voldemort
