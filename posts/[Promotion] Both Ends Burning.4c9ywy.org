Hey guys! I'm currently writing a marauder's era Remus/Sirius fic. The timeline will be from their 7th year, until 1981. I'm hoping to have mine stand out once the focus becomes the war. I've recently just picked this up again after a hiatus. Basically I don't know if it's any good or not, and would love some feedback!

** I just read chapter one. I think you definitely have potential, but I would try to focus on plot and telling a cohesive story rather than focusing on individual scenes. Chapter one could be summarized in Sirius's thoughts as a paragraph or two, and there isn't any action or mystery that draws the reader in. If there isn't anything important going on in a scene, you should skip it. I don't think that first chapter is a great example of your talents. The first chapter should captivate the reader, hook them into the story, and show them that this story is going places. If you were a reader, would you be hooked into a story with a slow first chapter? Honestly though, this is a pretty good first start at writing.

Just a heads up, Sirius signs his letter as "Messrs Padfoot," but Messrs is a British term for multiple Misters. That's why the Marauder's map is signed with it, because multiple people created it.

Also, you have "Remus'," which should be "Remus's." It doesn't matter that his name ends in S, he's still a singular person, so the possessive of his name is created by adding 'S. If that's confusing, think about the way you would say something out loud. You wouldn't say "James' car," you would say "James's car."

Good luck! Keep writing, and keep reading. Things like this get better with time, and experience can really improve your writing skills. Think about the things you love to read, and why the stories you like attracted you. Why is Harry Potter so great to reread, even after the millionth time? Why are classics so revered? How can you incorporate subtle symbolism, metaphors, and foreshadowing in your own work? Do you understand how those things impact the stories you read?

*** Thanks so much for your response! You make a good point regarding having some action in the first chapter. Just because I like really like long, introspective descriptions doesn't mean it holds everyone's attention! I think maybe I need to write more of the story and then once I have more significant plot developments, look back at how I'm going to organize it and what is extra and can be taken out.

**** Maybe a way you could link this to your overall story is have Sirius reading the Daily Prophet and complaining to James about the Death Eater activity. It establishes conflict, while the current first chapter only really has missing Remus and the full moon as obstacles. This kind of "action" could draw a reader in, and relates to your summary. Otherwise, someone interested in a darker story focused on the war might read your first chapter and think "oh, this is slow. I thought this was about the war."

Maybe after complaining to James, James leaves, and Sirius tries to clear his head by playing some music. He can't get it to work, gets frustrated, and starts to write a letter to Remus to complain about his "shitty muggle gramophone." That letter could slowly go from superficial hostility to actually missing Remus and inquiring about his recent transformation. If they're a couple or not could determine the subtlety of that part. This also foreshadows the way that the war gets under his skin a little, and he takes that out on Remus (even if it doesn't really matter now, and it was very mild).

The way it is now, I don't really like the inner thoughts and the letter together. They have the same information, which makes them redundant together.
