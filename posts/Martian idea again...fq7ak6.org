When Harry chooses to go back to life after the King's Cross scene in Deathly Hallows, instead of going back to the forbidden forest, his body disappears, and he wakes up on Mars at the start of the Martian, while the whole team is still there, in Beck's body. The evacuation still happens, and Watney is still left behind. For sake of continuity, Battle of Hogwarts happens on Sol 5. Statute of Secrecy is still in place internationally, and Harry/Beck still has Draco's wand.
