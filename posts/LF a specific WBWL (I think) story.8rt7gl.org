I think it's a fairly generic wbwl fic, but one of the main bits I remember is Remus (or Sirius) has a werewolf son who is supposedly part of Harry's brother's friendship group but they leave him out and bully him, so harry takes it on himself to make friends with him by tryna sit with him at lunch (??), and the werewolf keeps choosing Harry's brother until something happens and he chooses Harry instead which he reckons is the best choice of his life and Remus is v happy
