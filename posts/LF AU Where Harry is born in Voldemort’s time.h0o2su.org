A lot of fics seem to go to a lot of trouble to invent dumb plot devices to make Harry into a badass so he can compete with Voldemort on even footing like training with time turners or some such nonsense. But it seems to me like we could avoid the whole thing if we have Harry born in Voldemort's time so they could both be the same age and have roughly the same amount of time to grow, sort of like Dumbledore and Grindelwald. So I'm wondering if anyone has come across such a story.

  Tom and Harry are inevitable in any universe.OR: While Dumbledore and Grindelwald play their chess game across Europe, two young wizards form an unlikely friendship.[That one where Tom and Harry are born in the same generation.]
