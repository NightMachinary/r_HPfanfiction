So someone just posted this a few hours ago, but I still think it's not enough. HAPHNE is not just a pairing, it's a religion so I come to you, the followers of the religion to give me more Haphne parings.

** I completely and unironically agree with this post.

Although with Haphne being a religion, wouldn't that make Harry and Daphne a God and Goddess?

** If you want more Haphne pairings, you could go to your damn subreddit. It's already bad enough having to filter every pairings you don't like, we don't need cultists to shove their drivel up our mouth.

*** Despite the fact that Haphne is one of my favourite ships (alongside Harmony, though there isn't really any het pairing I don't enjoy at least a bit, if it's written well), I have to agree. Haphne shippers are unusually aggressive, even though we're less canon than Drapple. When I look at [[/r/Harmony][r/Harmony]] and their discord, I see people having friendly debates about pairings, or welcoming new people with their favourite Harmony recs. [[/r/Haphne][r/Haphne]] and it's discord though... No. Just, no.
