I've heard rumours that there was a completed version of Deadwoodpecker's Yellow Submarine on her Livejournal site. Unfortunately, her account has been deleted a while ago. Can someone confirm that there was a full version, or can someone even provide me with a copy of the completed story?

The only version I can find is on ffnet [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4464089/1/Yellow-Submarine][Yellow Submarine]]. I wouldn't mind reading the ffnet version, but I wanted to ask for the completed version first.

Thanks!


** I used to follow her LJ when it was active and I don't recall her ever finishing /Yellow Submarine/.

She went radio silent around then (including not completing her short story for an original fiction anthology we were contributing to) and I haven't heard from her since.

*** The rumour about the completed version on LJ I found in another thread around here, however, with the note 'I'm not sure'.

**** It was intended for jbern's /Horror, Humor, and Heroes/ anthologies. I don't believe you went beyond posting a portion of the first draft to the site that he set up for the invited authors.

** You can try Wayback Machine, but I can't tell that there's a good archive of it on there. I wish she'd finish Backward with Purpose too. What a fantastic series.

*** Thanks. I tried Wayback Machine, but unfortunately, I couldn't find a matching capture.

I read part 1 of BWP, and as far as I remember I really enjoyed it.

** Yes! I finished it, and it's on fan fiction.net. Socks is being finished, and I'm also putting the finishing touches on A Series of Escalating Dares.

** Unfortunately I haven't heard of a completed version. :( But if you haven't read it yet, the place it leaves off is a pretty good ending. There are a couple of loose threads but the main conflict is resolved.
