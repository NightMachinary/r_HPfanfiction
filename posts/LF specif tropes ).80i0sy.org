Hello everyone! I am a huge fanfic reader and recently I haven't been able to find any fanfics that I like, :( So, I'm making a list of specific tropes of fics that I've liked before in hopes that people might bring something that I haven't read before. Any length under 200k is fine. Slash and gen are fine but please no het. I don't know why but I find it incredibly boring.

Specific tropes I've liked before: --Harry and Snape are brothers/Harry and James are twin brothers --Harry is killed/Kills himself/Harry dies before Hogwarts --No Voldemort AU --Disabled!Harry

Thank you for any help!!! :)

*** Ya. I've read two or three fics with this trope before. Brothers and Fathers by DaughterOfAres on Ffnet. It's a very good fic.

** You listed almost all tropes that exist. That's not very "specif"

*** Ha ha ha yeah... I guess I was a tad bit overzealous. I've fixed it and made it a bit more specific now, lol! :)
