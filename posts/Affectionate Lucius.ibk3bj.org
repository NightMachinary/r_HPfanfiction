A fic were Lucius and Narcissa is still at Hogwarts. Lucius have feelings for Narcissa but she doesn't fell the same (to begin with, or they can just like each other in secret)


** Not exactly but Motivations by jeconais lucius and Narcissa have a moderate role and hes shown as a bit of a doting father to his squib daughter and affectionate towards narcissa
