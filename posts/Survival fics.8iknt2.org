Are there any good survival fics like forests of valbone or Vulpine Wizard? Like, any at all? I absolutely love any sort of fiction involving somebody in the wild learning to survive.

Bonus points for small magics and basic cantrips being shown off

Also, as a side note, is there any good fics that feel like smiling jester fics from other authors? cuz smiling jester is like my favorite writer on ffn.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** I'm genuinely curious why survival would be an issue with magic. Apparating to the nearest store aside, you can summon food (Accio fish/whatever fruit you want), conjure water and transfigure anything into shelter and tools. You can light fires or use magic to rig up a basic air conditioning system.

I mean, it would be fun to read about someone steamrolling a survival challenge with magic, but I get the feeling that this is not what you are looking for.

*** Survival is as much about mentality as it is about skill. You can have all the power in the world, but in a survival scenario that won't give you anything if you don't know to use it to survive. That is why it /could/ be an issue.

Take esama's series linked in one of the other comments here (“Island of Fire”, yes): part of the early challenge comes from not really having much in terms of available resource types, but the very beginning starts with how people weren't really surviving, they were waiting to be rescued, and it took a leader to make them actually do something. Stuff like that can be enjoyable to read.

**** I get that this would be a big issue in real life or even in another fictional universe. But using transfiguration to create a comfortable shelter would take 10 seconds, a basic house should be doable in under an hour and that is not taking into account that someone on Harry's or Hermione's level could simply make a Portkey back to the rains of London. Also, it would be really easy to build something aerial observers would notice (and be it a giant burning swastika).

The only challenging scenario I can envision would be a Frostpunk-esque ice-age apocalypse or an Inferno level heat wave, but those tend to go into the post-apocalypse genre and not merely survival.

***** This is why magic without limits, such as /seems/ to be the case with HP magic, is a bit boring. Because you're right--they would only be limited by their knowledge of what spells there are and if Hermione is with them, there might as well not be any limit at all. There's an idea for a very compelling survival story in the vein of "Hatchet" or something similar, but it's just ruined by "a wizard did it".

If you want to, you can run off the rails and introduce your own magical limitations, but then you end up with things that are generally derided by the HP fanfic community such as magical cores or the idea that using magic takes up vital energy that needs to be replaced by food or rest, so often times writers are stuck between a rock and the canon place.

I am pretty sure that you can get some food after portkeying to Trafalgar Square. Which made the whole Horcrux hunt even more ridiculous, but that's another topic.

******* Right? I mean, St Martin In The Fields is RIGHT THERE and they have an excellent basement cafeteria. Get some fish and chips, a nice cappuccino, sit down, relax, chat a bit. Then fuck off and go look at art at the National Gallery and levitate yourself to the top of Nelson's Column. Oh, bollocks, we're still looking for those damned things?

**** It just felt very forced to have Harry be that leader - the Harry of the first TWT task, who spent weeks being ostracised with only Hermione coaching him, and pushing him. I'd have expected Hermione or Cedric to step up and push the others into creating shelter, not Harry. Even if he were ready to lead anyone at that point, I felt it was wrong to bash everyone else into sheep waiting to be rescued so he could step up.
