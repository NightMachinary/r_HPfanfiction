  The first few chapters would be few days after the war, [ ... ], and he promised to Remus and Tonks that he'll keep him safe) and go to America.

Good enough reason. I'd buy into that.

  He also won't get paired with Ginny, neither any other canon girl [...] , so why not create one yourself?

If you do that, be very cautious. OCs can quickly become Mary Sue self-insert bullshit if you aren't cautious. If you make a new character, actually make /a character/. This new girl needs agenda, morals, drives, desires, flaws,... She needs to be a person.

Tips on how to write this won't much differ from any other writing tips. Plan out the plot and how you want to get from Start to Finish with your characters. Think about how your characters grow (or devolve) in the span of the story, and how other characters would react to that change.

Its not important if people don't like OC, if you don't care about imaginary internet points. And nobody can answer if you should proceed. Thats entirely your time, effort and decision.

** Speaking from personal experience, you'll likely realise that your idea is unfeasible a few thousand words in. You'll likely run into some kind of obstacle which makes realise that there's an issue you haven't thought about. The one I clearly see is that Andromeda would be the one who gets Teddy, and given that she's 42-47, she can easily take care of him. Hell, she could probably still have children on her own.

As for love interest, using one of the name only characters (eg Morag McDougal, Lisa Turpin, Fay Dunbar) and then writing your OC into them is better than a complete OC because there's a stigma against them. Background characters work if your story is good. I have a combined 2k favourites and 3k followers with Lisa Turpin, Tonks and Fleur as love interest (although the romance isn't the primary factor in either of those.

Your first idea will most likely never go anywhere. Neither will number 2, 4 or 7. But each of those will teach you something through the way ot didn't work out. Keep them around, you might pick one of them up again sometime in the future. So far, I've written 4 oneshots and have two ongoing stories. Another five projects are work in progress, mostly oneshots as well. But I don't just have 11 stories on my GDrive, I have close to fifty, and most will never be published. I had probably written 50k words before even publishing my first oneshot. So don't give up, keep writing and eventually, something good will come out of your keyboard, even if it does not feel like that initially.

** Planning is different for everyone. I personally start at the end and work my way to the beginning. There are tons of writing / story telling tricks you can get online. For example Brandon Sanderson has a Creative writing lecture on Youtube that goes through all basic story telling 'best practices'. I'm sure there are others that are more comprehensive.

My best advice would be to take your time. As far as I can see, you have no clear goal for your story except the romantic one. That's fine, but keep in mind that romance is pretty hard to write (I'd say as hard as comedy) and writing America would involve a ton of OCs, those tend to be hit or miss in fanfiction in general.

Finally: Have fun! Writing fanfiction (and writing in general) can be fun and even fulfilling, and there are plenty of people in the various fandom communities who would sit down and talk shop for hours.

** biggest most important tip - just write it!

don't overthink, don't overedit. Most people fail because there's always a reason/excuse not to publish.

People will always say nice things and people will always say mean things. Write for yourself, have fun and ignore the crap.

Yes, i intentionally didn't comment on your plot. I don't know how i feel about it, but like i mentioned before, not every plot is for everyone. (and also, a passionate writer can make almost any plotline work)

** If you remember any piece of advice, remember this: You can do literally anything you want plot wise as long as you write it well and keep your characters compelling.

** The first thing you need to do when writing planning a fanfiction is be honest with yourself.

Are you trying to write a good story or are you trying to write an exploration of the wizarding world for yourself? Some can be both, I'd say Taure's Victoria Potter manages it but some people go overboard. Something like For the Love of Magic is a bad story with numerous issues. What it starts off as however is an interesting exploration of magic and the wizarding world before it goes down the smut and politics road. Its terrible story but as an exhibition of world building its not awful. A lot of the best stories are focused on the story not the world. Take Flo's Aurors, its a great story with just enough world building to frame the story but the world building itself isn't the focus.

Planning is different for everyone. Some people say planning too much can stifle creativity. I think what some call over planning can make writing your story easier. If you don't have an idea of where your story ends then how are you supposed to get there? You can see in a lot of fanfics that update regularly, that pump out thousands of words a week that the author is carried by ideas. Then they run out of ideas or they realised they've explored twelve different ideas and have no idea where they are any more. The biggest curse of fan fiction tends to be too many words not too few. Compare my favourite fic, Contractual Invalidation with The Legacy. Both stories that have a similar cast, both stories that use a marriage contract trope. One is less than a 100,000 words, the other is unfinished at almost 750,000 words. Contractual Invalidation finished a story with some world building and character growth in under a hundred thousand words. The first book of Harry Potter is only a fraction over 75,000 words, a tenth of The Legacy. Good editing and planning cuts words not adds them.

I also am a fan of planning because it tells me what is going to be written but so long as you know how all the pieces fit together you can write them in any order you want. If you have a section that's bogging you down but you still want to write then you can move on and write another bit, you don't have to wait and see where your writing left you.

On your story, OC and the US. Its not going to be everyone's cup of tea. For me, bearing in mind I've not read your story but am basing this of what I have seen before. I'm worried. Pure OCs can be done well, stuff like Grow Young With Me has a great OC. Flo's Aurors has a great OC, they are in the minority. I'd throw in Contractual Invalidation's characters as good OCs depending on your definition of OCs too, some consider blank slates OCs and some don't. A lot of OCs, especially American ones are Mary Sues. Unbearable ones. The US also tends to be some mythical place of perfection and peace. I've always disliked the epilogue because it felt too clean. Everything wraps up neatly and they live happily ever after. I don't see that, I can understand Harry moving away from it all. The US historically within HP fanfiction is not a place I'm a fan of. JKR's world is whimsical and scary. Magical is wonderful and terrifying. Things don't make sense but they can when you have magic. I've seen people have the US as sensible, magic done right. They take the joy and wonder of the magical world out and set it up as a criticism of JKR's world. You've said you think why not create one for yourself with regards to a female character, why not do this with a country? Why stick with the US because 'mainly because we don't know much about those places as we do about American Wizarding World.'?
