** Cursed Child is just stupid. That isn't the first thing that wouldn't make sense.

** Despite CC being a mediocre fanfic, its plot actually made it clear that any attempt to profit from time travels with that device was going to backfire.

** Cursed child honestly was an abomination from a story standpoint. "You need another timeturner ? Here you go. It's a special and newly invented one too." Thats a plot twist written by an eight year old.

** I don't know if CC changed canon, but the Harry Potter series (sans CC) subscribes to the theory that you cannot alter the timeline. So... no.

*** No, it's that "bad things happen to wizards who mess with time", like people being unborn or Tuesday lasting minutes and Thursday lasting four days, and alternate timelines ca be formed.

**** That might be what someone has /said/, but canonically what /actually/ happens is completely different.

#+begin_quote
  In the Harry Potter universe, if you travel to the past, you've already traveled to the past.

  When they went back in time in PoA, they didn't change anything at all. All of what they did had /already/ happened.

****** Okay. I honestly didn't know that. I've never seen or read the play.

To be honest, though, it's just another example of why I don't think I ever will. Or consider it canon. I mean, it literally contradicts the precedent set in PoA about how Time Travel functions.

*** Your body displaces atmosphere, you exhale CO2, particles from your skin are falling off constantly, you alter the course of photons, etc...

Just existing in the past alters the timeline so that's not correct at all.

Jahoan seems correct on this one. "bad things happen to wizards who mess with time."

**** No in book three (the only time a time turner is used to try to alter the time line) shows that they didn't change anything. The timeline wasn't altered.

** Cursed Child is dreadful and whether it makes sense or not, I blame it for the decrease in Harry Potter fanfiction we've seen in the last couple years.
