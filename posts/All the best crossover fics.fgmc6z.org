For as long as Harry Potter could remember, he had only ever really needed---and wanted and longed for---one thing.

Family.

Family cared for one another, even at the expense of others that was not part of that family. In that, Harry could say that family is selfish and he was okay with it.

And Death had always been a part of his life and he might as well hold on to what was left for him.

(This one!!! I don't know what it was about this fic but for some reason it sucked me in and I couldn't stop!!! I loved this fic (still on going and recently updated) (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤ )

** Oh here are some others:

A Child Avenged [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4497336]]

(Short but very well done)

The Promise of a New Dawn [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/650264]]

(I don't recall any slash in this but my memory is a bit fuzzy. Apologies if there is.)

Harry Potter and The Dwarves of Erebor [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10747983]]

(Admittedly this isn't one of my favourites but that doesn't mean it isn't good. I'm putting this up here because while it wasn't something I loved, my friend would not stop talking about it for ages. (≧▽≦) )

Friend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1115333]]

(Short but sweet)

Only a Boy [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/398103]]

(Harry Potter isn't in this one. Set at Hogwarts though)

75: Chosen Again [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17450123/chapters/41088302]]
