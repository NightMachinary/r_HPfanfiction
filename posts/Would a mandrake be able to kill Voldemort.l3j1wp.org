I mean, it is a plant whose screams kill anything that hears it, this is such an underused plot-device, who cares about cocks killing basilisks? Mandrakes can potentially kill whole armies (assuming their screams reach far enough and that said army didn't come prepared beforehand -and even that would be a huge disadvantage since the only countermeasures shown are blocking your ears so you can't hear the screams or anything else really).

Actually, when you stop to think that such plants are kept at greenhouses where students can have access with or without permission (at least I think that is how the marauders got the leaves for the animagus transformation) I just have to ask, /why/ are dragons and basilisks regarded as too dangerous again? The ICW should have some heart and let poor Hagrid keep his dragons and the murderous abominations he made with cross-breading!


** Mandrakes were used at the Battle of Hogwarts, but for some reason they had no effect whatsoever. Also, if they can be used as a weapon of mass destruction, why hasn't some Dark wizard already killed everyone with them? And why are children taught about them at all? Why haven't they been made extinct just for safety?

My headcanon is that the danger of Mandrake scream has been greatly exaggerated. One would have to scream right next to your ear for quite a while before it kills you, and covering your ears with your hands after the scream has already started is enough to save you. This is the only way it makes sense.

This always pissed me off. The Battle of Hogwarts was an absolute clusterfuck of a melee, tossing mandrakes around will kill just as many members of the defenders as it would Death Eaters.

******* There could have been a spell made for just this. I mean wadawasi (iirc) was used to send something up peeves nose. Also if the cry is fatal you would only have to get it close to some part where people didn't have earmuffs on. Like anywhere they were not being thrown from.

******** Yes, and they could have very well known the spell - but they were under fire from the defenders at the time. The thing about the DE's is that they are selfish - no one would have wanted to be the one to drop their shield or risk it being broken to throw back the plant and get nailed with a curse, a banished rock, hot oil or a potions mishap (rated at 0.3 Longbottom or higher).

*** A group of twelve year olds spent an entire lesson (probably most of an hour at least) in a confined space with multiple screaming at once and only earmuffs for protection. They could still hear each other talk during this time, so the earmuffs weren't even that good. I assume that exposure causes headaches and nausea but probably wouldn't be that bad for an adult witch/wizard. The problem is that if you are working with them and are careless then you could become sufficiently disorientated that you can't force them back underground or realise you need to get away before you pass out, then it is only a matter of time before it kills you. It is not meant to be lethal, just discomforting enough that nothing wants to eat it. That is my version of it anyway.

**** Those were babies which would only knock you out, which is why they're great for 2nd years, enough risk to teach them the importance of safety measures while not actually causing lasting harm to the idiot who inevitably ignores them or messes up.\\
The ear muffs blocked out their voices in the books, the films just decided to be illogical.

As for why they're not more effective in battle, I'd imagine that if mundane hearing protection works a simple silencing charm would aslo do the job, and at the battle of hogwarts both sides were plenty capable of silent casting.

** Dragons aren't dangerous because they breathe fire or have sharp claws, they're dangerous because they're very hard to actually hurt thanks to their tough, magic resistant hide.

The basilisk is probably similarly magic resistant, and more importantly, even seeing it indirectly causes petrification.

A mandrake has no mentioned magic resistance, so you can just stun or silence them and mundane ear protection works fine against their cry.

****** I think it would depend on whether the person dies because of the sound-waves of them getting inside their ears (potentially the sound is cursed and it affects specifically the brain?) or if it is the sensory perception of it's cry that kills.

******* Hmmm. Good question. Covering one's ears with earmuffs (are they magical or just ear coverings?) can prevent death... is it preventing the sound from reaching the part of the brain that causes death or the perception of hearing (understanding?)... is it the vibration of the sound that is deadly or the sound itself?
