I really like all was well for Harry in the end. I also see that we have always seen him operation under an objective or under pressure/fear. Once the canon ends we dont see a blowout when that fear, oppression and objectives are all removed from his life overnight. He cold be a great father but he could also be an absent, workaholic ,dumbledoresque or unhealthily altruistic father.

This also came to me when I was reading an account of Gandhi , how he was such a great person, loved by the nation but had an extremely strained relation with his sons.


** I think the opposite is more likely, that he would become a helicopter parent.

*** I think this is more likely. He wouldn't want them to be as sneaky as he was. And he didn't have guardians who cared about the little things in his life so he would probably over do it as a parent.

** There is at least one, but I couldn't help you find it. His marriage to Ginny failed; she won't let him see the kids and she poisoned them against him. He becomes indifferent towards them. The story was incomplete when I read it, I don't know if it was ever finished.
