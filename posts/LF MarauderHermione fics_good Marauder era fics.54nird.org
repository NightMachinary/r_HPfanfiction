Looking for both marauder!Hermione time travel fics, romantic (HG/SB) or not. As well as good marauder era fics in general.

I don't have any triggers. Thanks so much. :)


** Almost everything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5869599/ShayaLonnie][ShayaLonnie]] fits your request. My favorite is probably Misplaced Moony but it's still updating - its a HG/RL but Remus time travels forward rather than her back. A Debt of Time, is also great, and it is super long which is exciting when the writing is good.

** I really liked Roundabout Destiny. It's a HG/SB fic with a time travel/ reincarnation twist.

She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** I really like Deception & Concealment by KissThis linkffn(2374643) . It's HG/SB/JP triad fic. Unfortunately, it is abandoned (hasn't been updated since 2008) but what's there is really worth reading.

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. An accident throws Hermione back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now, with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over?
