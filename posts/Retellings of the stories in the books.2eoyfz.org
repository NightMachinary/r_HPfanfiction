Are there any fanfics that basically retell the stories in the books but in the specific author's words? I've been re-reading the books but sometimes I feel like I want a different outlook on them and sometimes a different author does that.

** Survivors guilt retells the events of POA from Sirius point of view in part one, Remus's point of view in part two. It's quite on cannon but does have flash backs and a bit of slash.
