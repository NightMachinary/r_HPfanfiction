This is a story I would love to read, but don't have the patience to flesh out the details. Feel free to change things if you adopt it!

After the war, Death Eater and former Unspeakable Augustus Rookwood gets away and lives in the muggle world. He uses the Imperius curse on some muggle physicists to get them to figure out why Time Turners and other time magic can't change the past, and how to get around it in order to prevent Voldemort's defeat. They discover that magical people exist in multiple dimensions, so they're locked to their own timeline. The only way is to send a muggle back, but without magic their body couldn't handle the strain.

So Rookwood devises a ritual to send one of the scientists back a few hours into the body of his younger self in order to test it. But he doesn't realize that this will break the Imperius curse. The scientist gets a phone and calls the police, who are monitored by the Aurors, who send Harry and another Auror to investigate. They save the scientists, but Rookwood gets away again. The scientists tell them everything about the ritual, and Rookwood's new plan to completely brainwash a muggle by implanting false memories, and send them back to before Tom Riddle's diary was destroyed, since it would take too much power to go back to before Voldemort was first defeated.

The Unspeakables realize that if the past is changed, their timeline will cease to exist. They figure out a ritual to preserve their own timeline for long enough to send someone else back to counter Rookwood's plans, and also work out a way to track the use of time magic.

They need a muggle they can trust, who is willing to make this sacrifice. Harry has recently had a reconciliation with Dudley, who has been in therapy, lost weight, broken away from his parents, and has completely changed to a really great guy. Dudley wants to do something to make up for bullying Harry as a child, and has been working with abused children as a social worker and volunteer. So Dudley agrees to go through this ritual, and Harry shows him many of his own essential memories and even uses magic to transfer them into Dudley's head so he won't forget.

The Unspeakables detect Rookwood's ritual, and find him passed out from the immense power of it. They find out the details of his plan, and work out a way to stop it.

Finally, Dudley is ready. After the ritual, he wakes up back at Privet Drive in his own room, 9 years old. He immediately writes down the most important parts of the plan. He does his best to act like himself at first, but stops bullying Harry and develops new interests.

One of these interests is cooking. Dudley claims that he wants to be a great chef when he grows up after watching some cooking shows on the telly. He asks Petunia to teach him to cook, thus sparing Harry from that chore. Dudley can also make healthier, "gourmet" food and save food for Harry. He also often distracts his parents from punishing Harry or giving him more chores. Dudley shows interest in finance and business, and Vernon helps him start an investment account for his future instead of getting many useless presents today. He also takes up sports to get in shape and demands that the cupboard under the stairs be used for his equipment, and Harry is moved to his "second bedroom."

Harry is suspicious, but can tell that something is really different about his cousin. Finally, he confronts Dudley on the playground at school, where Dudley's "gang" now mostly plays football instead of bullying.

Dudley tells Harry a basic version of the truth. They start to meet in the park, and Dudley shares his experiences and decision to change his life. Then he says that Harry should start figuring out how to use magic. Older Harry had learned that he has a natural talent in Apparition and Legilimency, could do them both without a wand, and thought that younger Harry could too if he tried.

So Dudley becomes Harry's mentor, tutoring him in school and coaching him in magic, and after a lot of practice, Harry is able to Apparate short distances and use Legilimency when looking into someone's eyes. This allows him to see the copies of his own memories in Dudley's mind.

Dudley also helps Harry "act normal," stop doing accidental magic, and get Vernon and Petunia to leave him alone most of the time. The Dursleys don't mind Harry doing well in school as long as Dudley does too, and Dudley does very well.

In between school, avoiding Dursleys, and practicing magic, they find the muggle man that Rookwood will send back, and plan to intercept him before his brainwashed future mind arrives.

They get in contact with Ted Tonks and his family, and convince them to help capture Pettigrew. At Hogwarts, Tonks has no problem getting the Gryffindor password and mimicking Percy well enough to get into his dorm, stun the rat, and mail him home. Andromeda tells the papers and makes a huge scene in front of many witnesses, so Pettigrew's guilt is clear and can't be hushed up.

After Sirius is released, they get in contact and share information. Working together, they catch the muggle and do something to hopefully prevent his mind from being taken over, and make sure he can't help the Death Eaters.

Dudley makes the difficult decision to report his parents and Aunt Marge for child abuse with support from the Tonkses, and Harry and Dudley come to live with Sirius. Alternatively, they keep living at the Dursleys, with frequent visits from Sirius and protections against abuse.

They make plans to obtain and destroy all the Horcruxes, including an Unspeakable way to get rid of the one in Harry's scar. They will face opposition from the free Death Eaters, the Ministry, and potentially Dumbledore, depending on how you want to characterize him. The story could continue on into Harry's Hogwarts years, if you have more ideas, and it would be interesting to see what part Dudley would play in Harry's life going forward.

***** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9662175/1/][*/Dudley Dursley and the Sorcerer's Stone/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/401480/miliabyntite][/miliabyntite/]]

#+begin_quote
  Dudley Dursley, 37, has only just put his daughter on the Hogwarts Express and said goodbye when Platform 9 3/4 is attacked. In the ensuing explosion, he blacks out - and wakes up as an eleven year old back in Privet Drive. Confused and wary, he finds himself blundering through his life all over again, and unfortunately, being eleven isn't the only surprise in store.

***** Hm, after reading some of the recs in this thread, I think I might actually write it from Harry's perspective. Then all the exposition about older Harry and Rookwood and the Unspeakables would be gradually revealed in disjointed bits as he learns Legilimency and sees Dudley's implanted memories. I might then just end it when Harry goes off to Hogwarts with a plan to defeat Voldemort, since I don't really have anything after that. It's mostly just focused on the relationship between the cousins at Privet Drive.

** Actually, I've been reading a WIP recently called Kindness and Remorse by Rboooks on ffnet. Dudley is sent back to his infant body and is determined to give Harry a better childhood. There's 10 chapters at the moment, updated regularly and they're just pre-first year atm. Would recommend!

  Dudley lives with the guilt of what his family had done to his cousin. He resents the person he used to be and tries to live as someone better, but a part of himself can never truly forgive the cruelty done to the kind-hearted Harry. After a car accident, he wakes to find himself a child again. He sets out to make sure Harry has a better childhood all while hiding his own magic.

  Severus remembered dying---that last hopeless look into Lily green eyes. Now he's back in the past, inexplicably in the infant body of Harry Potter. Oh, and there's something wrong with Dudley. Weirdness ensues. A different time travel fix-it. Likely the oddest Severitus you'll ever read. Inspired by Path of Decision---I See the Moon---Athey's Rebirth. Betad by Eider Down. Complete.

** The title is decently compelling, but by the start of the second paragraph you've got something really interesting.

Sneakily supportive Dudley as a concept is clever. He's not trying to guilt-trip or inspire them to be better people (difficulty level: very high; author difficulty level: also very high), just get better outcomes.

How much future investment advice would he remember? 'None' is a fair answer.

This rundown falters a bit at the end. The Tonks family members turn out to be important, the Pettigrew plot is resolved easily, all so they can tackle canon's problems? Suggestion: you don't have to prompt someone with the whole resolution of the plot. On the other hand, there's no rule that someone can't be inspired by only some of what you wrote.

Diverging from canon is preferable, and you've already given one way to justify it with the dimension mechanic, but sometimes AUs are the most fun when they can justify more and more divergences organically from a simple premise. Offhand I can't think of anything, but to anyone attempting this it's something to consider.
