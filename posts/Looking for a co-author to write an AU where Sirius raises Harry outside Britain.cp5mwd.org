Hi all,

I made a similar thread two days ago but realized I couldn't fix the title...so I am making a new one. I have a story idea that may be interesting for some because it mixes Sirius as a "parent" figure, sentient Horcrux, and shedding some lights on East Asian magic(I made a fica bout it a while ago but deleted because I hated how it turned out and life got busy). My main problem is that I have hard time writing details, and my grammars always end up being inexplicably choppy and awkward. I would like to have not just a beta-reader, but a co-author who wants to actively give inputs for storyline ideas with me.

If you are interested, please comment or PM me.
