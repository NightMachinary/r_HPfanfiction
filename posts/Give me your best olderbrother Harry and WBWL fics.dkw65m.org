  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** linkffn(10610076): Time to Put your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is. It's basically a Master of Death Harry Potter is reborn as the older brother of Sirius and Regulus Black.

linkffn(12200475) Potters Against the World. Be warned this story contains incest, but the incest is handled really well at least in my opinion. Harry is banished from the magical world and his younger twin sister with the help of Gabrielle Delacor finds her brother, gives him his memories back and they time travel to the triwizard tournament to stop Voldemort. the incest is pretty well done, it's not shown as some triumphant beautiful thing like most incest is, or it's not ignored and treated like a normal romance either. Harry and Rose admit that they are fucked up and broken people throughout the story and it does have consequences within their friend groups and family.

  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).

** Linkffn(Three Black Birds)

Harry is Born in Fred and George's age group and is the older brother of the boy who lived. Its a pretty good and decent look at neglect and how it affects a family. James and Lilly didn't abandon Harry for their WBWL brother on purpose they are just a young couple caught up in everything and when they are finally told that they've fucked up they work their hardest to fix the problem.

Harry is also a decent older brother in this even if his brother doesn't deserve it
