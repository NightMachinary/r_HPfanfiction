#+begin_quote
  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** It depends on what you mean by good. I find a lot of the Harry raised by Marvel character crossovers end up with the magical world being bashed or made too look like it's full of idiots.

Having said that, there is a Loki kinda takes one raising Harry post first year story (Mischief's Heir on AO3) but I'm not sure if that's what you're looking for.
