Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Chapter 14

#+begin_quote
  Not that he didn't get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager to share his experience.

  "Depends where you want to go, Harry," he said. "It's never too early to think about the future, so I'd recommend Divination. People say Muggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if they're thinking of working in close contact with them - look at my father, he has to deal with Muggle business all the time. My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your strengths, Harry."
#+end_quote

I have seen many fics which say Harry and Ron took the Divination because they were lazy and wanted an easy grade as Divination was supposed to be.

But in actuality it was Percy '12 O's in OWLs' Weasley who recommended it. Coincidentally Ginny took the three subjects Percy recommended. What happened between books 2 and 3 that changed divination from a subject that an extremely academically inclined student like Percy recommends to a more or less fraud class?

BTW are there any !Seer Percy fics? He did get an O in divination after all.


** I mean, is it a fraud class? Harry and Ron seem to pass it when assessed by Trelawney, but they bomb the OWL. Which is sort of what you'd expect when you literally make up almost everything you hand in rather than doing the work... and your teacher lets you get away with it (or is incapable of telling the difference).

Whether or not actually doing things properly leads to results? Three comparisons.

Firstly, in real life statistical modelling, one of the early lessons is about reading residual plots. There are two major things that can go wrong here. One, not seeing a pattern that's there. Two, seeing patterns that aren't there. This is not that dissimilar to reading tea leaves in the sense that one's reliant on one's ability to interpret visual information. It's also not as straightforward as it sounds (and deciding whether it matters is also an additional question).

Secondly, in Harry Potter, I would compare the patronus. It's made apparent that it's impressive to be able to conjure one and it's been explicitly articulated by Rowling that not everyone can. This implies that it's possible to perform magic correctly but not achieve the results.

Thirdly, we know from the books that the Unforgivable Curses must be meant. I think people in fanfics tend to extend this to all spells, but I can't recall a canon basis for that. In any case, Hermione is our main criticism of Divination and her objections basically come down to "it's obviously fraudulent". In other words, Hermione's never going to be able to mean to succeed with Divination techniques because she doesn't believe in what she's doing.

All we really know about Divination is this:

- the Grimm was in Harry's teacup
- the Grimm wasn't an omen of Harry's death (contrary to Trelawney's interpretation), but his godfather could transform into one and only didn't call someone because Harry stopped him from doing so
- Trelawney doesn't know when she gives true prophecies
- True Seers are rare
- Centaurs love it
- Prophecies are subject to lots of interpretation and seemingly self-fulfilment

There's some indications that Seeing is hereditary and it may be the case that prophecies are guarantees... if this person does these things, then you know for sure stuff will play out like this... rather than predictions... this person will do these things and these consequences result.

Our next port of call is to consider the differences between Percy and Hermione. The first is pompous and ambitious whereas Hermione's neurotic and obsessive. Divination really doesn't align with the latter's traits... it's most natural interpretation conflicts sharply with both Hermione's great fears (which are about the future, e.g. her irrational fear of failure) and her highly pronounced tendency to try and control the direction of her life (mainly via excessive studying). I don't see any particular connection between Percy's major traits other than what he says, "It's never too early to think about the future". Even if Divination doesn't necessarily work for Percy (on account of lacking the gift), he'd receive reliable insights from Divination completely differently to Hermione.

But, possibly, Trelawney had previously made the "12 children and the Ministership" prediction about Percy. It'd shape his relationship with the subject, right?

*** Interesting. I'd also point out that when trying to predict the future, exactly when something happens isn't always clear. Take the Grimm, for example. Harry didn't die straight away, or even that year. But he did die towards the end of The Deathly Hallows, even if he came back straight away.

**** Good point.

Honestly, I'm really inclined to the idea that Divination is real but it's inherently hard to believe. I am sort of writing a fic where Fred Weasley II (Freddie) is into Divination in a big way. Originally this is because of the way his older relatives react (prank value) but later because he's convinced his predictions are usually correct but always get rationalised as something else. For example, he finds out a good name for Rose's first kid... she decides to use the name but not because he predicted it, but because she likes the way it sounds. Mostly though doing this gives me a way to insert ridiculous head canons without needing to do heaps of writing.

I also like the argument you see in some fanfics where a character like Luna or sometimes Harry goes to Hermione, "You used to think magic was absurd, but you know it's real now, right? So why's this different?" The last one of those I came across was, iirc, a Harry's raised by Trelawney fic. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4966520/1/The-Inner-Eye-of-Harry-Potter][pretty sure it's this one]])

*** The class is presented in canon as a fraud, yes. Hogwarts is the only school in Britain, after all - and as such, if the sole divination professor is a fraud, it's kind of fair to see the class as a fraud. We also know that Dumbledore wanted to get rid of it.

The way I see it, Divinations is a thing - but it's a thin in canon where you need to have the skill to make it work, and it seems to be a gift that you either have or don't.

I do like the idea of a fic turning divinations into an actual discipline of magic that anyone can use, and going deeper into making it useful but not overpowered. I just think that the books do present it, as a /class/, as useless - even if seers do exist and the centaurs are able to use it.

*** Thank you for the well thought out comment. I like the comparison with statistical modelling you made.

I called it mostly a fraud class due to her picking a student and predicting their death throughout the year and the fact that as you said Harry and Ron just predicted increasingly bizarre and ridiculous ways one of them dies and she accepted them and I am having trouble Percy actually recommending it if that is what usually happens. He might not bad mouth the class but I don't think he would recommend it.

BTW that 12 children prediction was made about Harry. Once again thank you for the comment.

** Divination isn't a fraud subject - Trelawney may be useless at times, but she does make more or less accurate predictions more often than not. The centaurs predict war coming all the way back in Book 1.

I think people think that Divination is fraudulent because they expect 100% results all the time, but the very definition of divination prevents that.

#+begin_quote
  divine gerund or present participle: divining 1. discover (something) by guesswork or intuition. 2. have supernatural or magical insight into (future events).
#+end_quote

It's a combination of the two meanings - the diviner is discovering something about their object through magical means, but it is up to the diviner how to interpret what the magic tells them. When you're making an assumption based on your own intuition, you can go wrong.

A good diviner will be correct more of the time, while a bad one will be wrong more of the time. Trelawney falls somewhere in the middle - her predictions do come true, but they also go wrong as well.

As for Trelawney predicting her students' deaths, she's actually making the right predictions more often than not - her students come close to death a lot of times, both in the past, the present and the future. A LOT of times. Several of them die (the muggleborns who are captured by the Registration committee), several of them see death of their peers in the battle.

** I think a large issue with the class is that Trelawney puts /heavy/ emphasis on possession of "the Inner Eye" as the mark of a good Diviner. The problem is that that's a largely innate trait that one cannot really control, and basing one's entire expectations on "I either have this knack or I don't" as what makes one successful in a subject is not entirely accurate.

You don't need to be a Seer nor having some esoteric "Inner Eye" to do well in Divination. In truth, the subject is more about observing the world around oneself through the lens of the magical and /interpret/ one's observations to hypothesis about future events. The use of magical interpretation and rituals for focusing one's thoughts into the proper mindset is what the subject really ought to be focused on: taking in highly abstract data that wouldn't make sense to anyone else, and interpreting some form of meaning from those observations.

Divination, as a subject, is pretty "wooly", sure, but the few that seem to really think about it that way are those whose mindsets are highly rigid and systematic: Hermione and Professor McGonagall are the stand-outs there, in canon. Both individuals are dismissive of Divination but share a knack for the more scientific arts of Transfiguration: the structure and surety of working within known bounds where input and output are clearly correlated and easy to derive comes more naturally to them. Hermione and McGonagall have that inclination towards the strict and disciplined - they expect a certain result when steps are taken, and find Divination's need to deal with abstract data to generate abstract, highly variable results which are open to interpretation... disconcerting. It doesn't fit their style, that they can't trust that the results are exactly definite, but instead are open to interpretation, irks them. So they're dismissive of it.

Percy's accurate in saying that Divination is still a solid subject... it's just that the teacher is horrible at teaching the subject and puts a lot of emphasis on how she personally views the subject (Trelawney relies on the concept of an "inner eye" to focus and observe the world in order to use Divination to produce predictions, even when she's not in full-blown Seer-mode) which doesn't line up with how others might achieve the same state of mental-flexibility for interpreting abstract data. And since the teacher for the subject is terrible at explaining the subject in a way that others who don't share her methodology can understand or utilize, most people find the subject useless and bogus. It also doesn't help that she's terrible at figuring out whether her students are making up data because she's not actually checking their work too carefully.

Percy, OTOH, excelled at Divination because he actually studied the subject, not just blindly listening to the professor rambling about nonsense like the "Inner Eye". He obviously figured out what the actual meat of the subject was - interpreting abstract data to generate abstract predictions which you can refine in the future by being aware of the prediction and being open to noticing the context through which the prediction will come to pass, thus giving you forewarning about events and circumstances - and studied how to do /that/ instead of whatever hooey Trelawney raved about. I mean, he got an O in the subject, and definitely knew how to do well in Divination, even if he didn't happen to be a Seer nor have that "Inner Eye" concept that Trelawney raved about.

** Trelawney herself is mostly a fraud but the actual omens and concept of Seeing is suggested not to be. If Percy and the Weasleys grew up with things like the Grim being treated as fact rather than belief it makes sense for him to treat Divination like an academic subject. When the trio take the class, it's only Ron who takes any of it seriously (at first at least). Neither Hermione or Harry grew up in the magical world, so none of the symbols and predictions will hold any weight for them.

** I disagree that the class is seen as fraudulent. There's a difference between Divination and Prophecy.

Divination teaches reading tea leaves, palmistry, dream interpretation, and using tarot card layouts. All of these things can be taught and are a matter of recognizing the patterns and memorizing the meanings. Crystal ball gazing arguably takes a Gift to do properly, but it's only one aspect.

So, the class is not a fraud nor an easy grade.

The TEACHER, on the other hand, is a drama queen who is as much of a braggart as Lockhart, in her own way, and makes false prophecies to try to make herself look good. Every year (according to McGonagall), she predicts the death of one of her new third-year students. The other "predictions" she makes in that first class are either self-fulfilling (tell the most nervous student in the class that he will break a teacup) or so vague as to be useless.

That Harry and Ron failed their OWLs is on them. They didn't take the class seriously, made up all of their assignments, and didn't study for the test. (It's no different than the bullies who get other students to do their homework, but bomb the test because they didn't learn any of the material.)
