I am looking for Snape fanfic recommendations. I would really like to have one with him still in character (nothing where he is suddenly nice). I am fine with pairings with Hermione but I want no - or very little - smut. I'm looking for a good story, not smut.

â€‹

I will take a happy ending but I'm a huge sucker for a sad one!

** Mostly in character. Slash pairing, but very little romance let alone smut. Epic, sprawling story. linkao3(11284494)

  Severus wasn't formally trained as a spy by either side. Luckily for him, someone noticed and took him in hand. Marty might be old, but that didn't mean he couldn't help the younger generation.

  Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]
