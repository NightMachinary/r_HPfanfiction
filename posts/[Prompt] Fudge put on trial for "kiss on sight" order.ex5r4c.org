Because Sirius was never tried (let alone convicted), ordering him kissed on sight would be an extrajudicial killing (or extrajudicial kissing, which might be a thing in the wizarding world).

*ETA*: I am highly amused by how opposite the responses are!


** Yes, please, somebody write this down. As a lawyer by education, I always hated how everybody ignores this travesty of law.

*** IKR?! Unless the Minister of Magic has the right to order a citizen killed out of hand - which I do not believe for a moment - it's blatantly illegal, but no one seems to notice!\\
Sirius doesn't even need to be proved, or even presumed, innocent. He hadn't had a trial, therefore illegal!

**** There is even worse:

  “The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August,” said Dumbledore. “Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven, again, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August. In your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.”

  “Laws can be changed,” said Fudge savagely.

I grew up in the Communist Czechoslovakia, my family had unpleasant experience (to say it mildly) with both Nazi and Communist regimes, but I don't think even Hitler and Stalin in their worst ever openly admitted they will change laws to produce results they want (of course, they actually did it, but they at least pretended to follow the rule of law).

** This is the bread and butter of Indy!Harry fics. They get Sirius a trial, and Fudge and/or Dumbledore is thrown under the bus for trying to murder the Lord of the Ancient and Most Ancient House Black, ending a family line, jaywalking, etc.

*** I've read a number of Indy! Harry fics, including ones where Fudge is tried, but I've never seen this point brought up.

** There is also the point of how he executed Crouch Jr and the only protest from Dumbledore was that they should have questioned him first and not the summary execution. This explores it a bit.

So looking at this incident it appears that what he did was well within his powers. It is time for to flee the country if it is true.

*** Given that Dumbledore expects the dementors to betray them to Voldemort it makes sense he'd be in favour of execution and it's not like he has any doubts about the man's guilt.

*** The difference being that Crouch Jr. had been tried (granted it was more than a bit of a kangaroo court) and sentenced. Black wasn't.
