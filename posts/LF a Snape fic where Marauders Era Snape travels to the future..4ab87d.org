I've been reading Snape-based fics, and I've read good ones set during the HP series, afterwards (ignoring his death), and even during the Marauders era. I've seen some where Snape travels back to his youth after dying, and ones where characters from the HP era travel back to teen-Snape's time.

Are there any interesting fics where the teenage or young Snape travels /forward/ and then learns from his other self's mistakes?


** Umm there is one I read, I think it was called "300 Days" where bitter bigoted Snape is thrown forward and encounters Hermione, who helps him return, obviously influencing the past.

*** Thank you. I guess this plot setup isn't that common!
