** This puts me in mind of Deadpools powers, where he has like, super cancer or something, but if he starts to die it kills part of the cancer off, sending his regeneration into overdrive until he's fully healed at which point the cancer also gets healed. Imagine this on Harry...

*** Ok now I want to see full Deadpool Harry, full on insane from the pain of the basilisk Venom fighting the Phoenix tears, which have also left him covered in scars, which on the plus side no one's looking at his lightning bolt scar anymore. He could even break the fourth wall, pointing out fanfiction tropes when they happen and incessantly mocking them, etc.

** No. The body processes poison until the point that it eventually leaves the system even when phoenix tears are not involved. Unless Harry's blood is goblin-made.

*** That might be true for normal poison but you forget that this isn't normal poison, this is MAGIC poison. Who's to say that magical toxins don't just continually effect the body unless some kind of cure or treatment is introduced?

**** I don't think JK goes that deep into the chemistry of poisons in the books.
