I recently started reading fan fiction, and I prefer to read HHr. (No, I don't like Weasley bashing).

A couple of friends I've made via fanfiction.net told me that generally HHr 'Shippers' are not liked. Why is that?


** There's a sort of difference between liking particular ships and being a "shipper", as it were.

Shippers have a particular passion for their ideal "ship", often referring to it as their OTP, which stands for One True Pairing. They tend to regularly imply not just that they like the ship, but that ship is somehow correct, ideal, or necessary in fic.

HHr shippers are often disliked because of the way some of them (mis)characterize Ron in order to facilitate the ship; others dislike them because they ship different ships; other people may simply not like HHr and therefore dislike the people who ship it.

Shipping culture is a whole ball of convoluted nonsense. I'd advise reading what you like and doing your best to ignore the ridiculousness behind the ships.

** Typically very devout HHr shippers are seen to exclude all other ships, that nothing could possibly be as good as HHr, personally I like three or four ships. Also because many HHr stories demonize other characters and put hermione on a pedestal. She is not perfect and she fought with Harry sometimes just like Ron did but they tend to gloss over those. She also occasionally becomes what we call a "Mary Sue" you can google the term for a more exact definition, but essentially it means she solves all the problems in the plot, and it seems like nothing is a challenge to her. Basically HHr shippers, typically, elevate their ship at the expense of others at a much higher rate than other shippers. IMO anyway, correct me if I'm wrong anywhere here.

Well, there's at least one scene in canon that works like this.

#+begin_quote
  As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione. they seemed to melt away before her, drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as fast as they could. Hermione looked after them curiously, until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path.

  "My children," he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was cracked, high-pitched, he sounded distraught. "Where are my children? What has he done with them? You know, you know!"

  "I--I really--" stammered Hermione.

  The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat. Then, with a bang and a burst of red light he was thrown backward onto the ground, unconscious. Ron stood there, his wand still outstretched and a look of shock visible behind his beard.

Hermione might be better at magic and pre-warned, but she sometimes loses her nerves at situations like these.

******* So, basically, what you're saying is that if Hermione loses her nerve when she is

1. suddenly accosted by
2. someone who is an innocent victim
3. of the person she is impersonating,
4. who is the same person who had tortured her a few weeks prior, and
5. whose wand she would have had to use to hex the above-mentioned innocent victim, and
6. all without having won that wand's loyalty,

that's canon behavior. I don't see what it has to do with the sexist and all too common fanfic trope that I had outlined.

I'm saying she loses her nerves in stressful, confusing situations. This is only one example of it. Now, I've only read one story where Hermione was raped, and it was a long time ago, so I can't say this for all the stories featuring it, but it certainly could be a situation that causes her to freeze. Like with the troll. Like many rape victims experience. There's nothing unrealistic about a guy with lesser magical skill saving her, and the situation I quoted had both pre-warning and an inept opponent.

#+end_quote

*TL;DR:* Context --- in-story, in the fandom, and in the broader society --- matters, and in context, yes, the situation is sexist.

In this particular pattern, it's not just a rescue of a character who happens to be female by a character who happens to be male, taking place in a vacuum. It's a rescue of the /female romantic lead/ by the /male romantic lead/ from a /sexual assault/ attempted by /a rival romantic suitor (or stranger)/ that's contrived /to facilitate the central romance/. How often does /that/ script get flipped?

Then, there are also fandom-specific aspects of the scenario: in particular, with Ron and WBWL!Neville, making them the attempted rapists degrades and bashes their characters in order to make the romantic protagonist --- Harry --- look better. (Now that I think about it, Viktor Krum also gets a lot of that.) Sexism can be against men, too.

On the matter of capability, it's important to remember that ultimately, anything that happens to the characters is /author's decision and responsibility/. In other words, we can speculate until we're blue in the face just what a canon-consistent Hermione could or couldn't and would or wouldn't do in a hypothetical situation that she'd never encountered in canon, but, ultimately, what matter is that /the author chose to put her into this scenario and then chose to have her be unable to defend herself/, typically /in order to facilitate a plot where she gets rescued by her OTP/. In other words, the author /chose/ to take away a female character's competence and agency in order to facilitate a romantic relationship, in a way that practically never happens to male characters. Tell me that's not sexist.

Ineptness of antagonists enters the situation in a related way: it usually means that they are utterly helpless before Harry, and are utterly unable to outsmart him or put him in a situation where he is helpless before them, yet seem to be far more successful when it's Hermione they're after.

And, the last bit, about Wandless Magic, is another trope you see in these sort of fics a lot: Harry discovers some amazing new branch of magic that gives him massive powerups, or just an ability to not be helpless if disarmed. Hermione, despite having never seen an area of magic she didn't want to study (She even gave Divination a chance.) somehow never takes advantage. Wandless Magic is a particularly popular one. Sometimes, no specific reason is given; and sometimes, there's some extrinsic factor like needing a minimal amount of some inborn "magical power" or "magical core" to do it. Either way, it's /the author choosing/ to empower the male romantic protagonist while disempowering (in relative terms) the female romantic protagonist, in a way that ends up facilitating the rescue romance plot.

#+begin_quote
  Now, I've only read one story where Hermione was raped
#+end_quote

I haven't read many either --- because I usually spot signs of a bad Harmony fic early on and stop reading --- but usually, her Designated Love Interest rescues her before the crime is completed and then visits righteous vengeance upon +the fool who dared to tried to rob him of his prize+ the bad guy. (For that matter, it can be general peril. Most of the argument still applies.)

#+begin_quote
  I'm saying she loses her nerves in stressful, confusing situations. This is only one example of it.
#+end_quote

You picked a particularly extreme example. Frankly, I'm not sure how /anyone/ of the trio would have done in her place. Ditto being /locked/ in a room with a troll. (Harry and Ron were entering the situation, rather than having it forced on them, so they got a bonus to Emotional Fortitude roll, where Hermione got a penalty.)

****** It's not just "a few vocal people".

Harmonian bashing and ignoring canon is well documented in the fandom, and if you're going to equate that to a few other random shippers doing that, then you're wrong.

The point is, the H/Hr ship is definitely more prone to bash because it poses a threat to the major canon couples, and it has the merit of being somewhat more realistic than others, which is why people will... advocate more strongly for it. The only other ship which has shown nearly as much militancy is Snape/Lily, because even JKR said that it could have happened had Snape not been canon!Snape.

** HHr shippers tend to be ... avid. The most vocal ones (not "most" of them) are also very defensive about it.

I think part of the reason for that defensiveness is that both Harry and Hermione are shipped with so many other characters that (some) fans of HHr feel as if they have to aggressively defend their choice from detractors.

But the vast majority are quietly enjoying the pairing, and the wild-eyed furor of diehards seems to have mellowed in general.

Either that or I'm really great at ignoring it.

** There are very very vocal anti-Harmonians out there, who will argue until they are blue in the face that the ship is impossible. And there is a middle ground who see it as possible but not inevitable, and there is the fanatic shipper who believes they are perfect for each other.

When somebody says "HHR Shippers are not liked" they are saying THEY don't like them or they know people who don't like them. Like everything it is subjective and most likely a vocal minority.

I'm an HHr Shipper, but I also stick mainly to Harems because I love all the girls somewhat equally. Mostly it isn't that Harmonians "hate" Ron, they hate anyone but Harry getting the main heroine of the series. They wanted their perfect cliche couple instead of the cliche "they argue because they like each other".

Just like what you like and if you debate your reasons for why HHr are a good ship, make sure you keep it friendly and don't insult the intelligence of anyone who is debating back with you. Anyone who assumes you are an idiot and treats you as such because you prefer HHr should be ignored (including your friend, or friends friend's). Don't tell them that to their face, just drop the subject if you feel attacked.

*** I am also a HHr shipper, but feel absolutely no need to attack or degrade other ships (I imagine much like most other reasonable people). I've always shipped this pairing because it was the one that made the most sense to me, something about it I found easier to relate to.

To be honest I really couldn't care whether someone ships the fucking Whomping Willow with Harry's Nimbus 2000, that's an outlandish opinion but they are entitled to it. I suppose I've never really understood why some people can't just respect that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. The fact that someone else ships Hermione and Voldemort has absolutely no bearing on myself. At least I don't think it does...

I'll read pretty much any pairing, I've read stories pairing Harry with pretty much every other significant canon/fanon character. If someone writes well enough that the chosen relationship works in that piece of writing it's all good. It's not offensive that Harry and Hermione aren't together, or whatever "OTP" someone prefers. The fact that you ship some pairing should not be a defining characteristic of yourself as an individual.

For example, personally I tend to AVOID harems; because I've simply not read many harem stories that I've enjoyed. However the fact that you like harem fics does not suddenly mean that we are sworn enemies and I'll be declaring a blood feud between our families.

Basically as you've said, if asked I would identify as an HHr shipper. I wouldn't identify myself as part of a group of people who hate Romione or any other pairing. Likewise if my preference for a particular pairing offends you, I couldn't give a fuck.

(Any harem fics you'd recommend to someone wary of them?)

***** Well you're honesty is definitely appreciated, but I shall endeavour to at least try and read the ones you've supplied since I asked. Your first rec does assuage some of my apprehension though, as most of my issues with harems revolve around the love interest all being interchangeable sex puppets for Harry Potter, Our Lord and Saviour, to do with as he wills.

*** Well, first of all anyone who supports a certain pairing shouldn't degrade other pairings. I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who like HHr but don't hate R/Hr with such immaturity. I certainly don't. HHr is something that I wished had occurred. Does that mean I hate R/Hr? No, not at all. I think R/Hr is great as well. I'm truly sorry now that because of those twats (as you so rightly put it) a lot of people hate HHr Shippers and the Ship itself. And Jesus, I'm not trying to tell you 'we're not all like that'. I don't even know who 'we' is lol. If so many Harmonians are really that bad, I'll just be content with calling myself 'An individual who likes HHr and minds his own damn business when it comes to other Ships'. I like the ring of that.

  Heron shippers, as some pathetic attempt to be degrading. I can't think of any other group of people in the HP fanbase that has done that.
#+end_quote

I wasn't there, so I'm probably missing some context: why is that degrading? I, for one, wish that the fandom had a concise verbal shortcut to refer to the canon pairing, and "Heron" has a nice ring to it (unless you hate birds). It also has a nice demonym version:

- Harmony -> Harmonian
- Dramione -> Dramionist/Dramionite
- Drarry -> Drarrian
- Heron -> Hero

**** I honestly have no idea what about it was meant to be degrading. Maybe it's because it puts Hermione's name first in the title, so that fuels their Ron bashing somehow? I dunno, all I know is that it was most definitely used in an attempt to be degrading. Everyone else calls it Romione, which has a much better ring to it in my eyes.

***** I like "Heron" better. I haven't seen "Romione" used much, and, IMO, it's neither here nor there, because it tries to merge on two similar, but different consonants (Ron + mione), making it too tempting to pronounce it "Ronione" (or "Romeone" because the first five letters are one letter away from "Romeo"), whereas "Heron" merges on a common consonant and is a word.

*** Everyone knows the worst pairings all [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3zccxa/if_people_can_requests_smut_fics_between_harry/][involve the Giant Squid]], surely? Jokes aside, I think the main reason you dislike Harmonians is that there are relatively many of them, so the shit that everyone does is so much more widespread and louder as well. I've found much more seriously stupid shit from Harmonions, but every OTP has something like that - there's just generally fairly few hardcore Dean/Luna shippers.

** There is a vocal minority of people who simply hate Harry/Hermione, and blame "Harmonians" for it. Pretty much all the reasons they make up to explain their hatred fit other pairings as well (90% shitty stories, bashing of other characters, unfit characters, preachy fans etc. etc.).

** too make it short and sweet, H/Hr shippers aren't liked not because they support a canonically unrealistic pairing(put your guns down Harmonies, my OTP is H/Hr) but because on how they view their ship as essentially a "gary/mary sue-ish" ship. a pairing so perfect and impeccable that people will degrade to insufferable behavior to defend it.

With that said though, i hope you don't feel discourage in liking your ship. this is a really helpful and awesome sub(at least from my experience) where any fan of the HP fandom is welcomed with i myself starting out as a H/Hr shipper. just don't try to force your opinions down our throats.

** Mostly because because people who refer to themselves as a "shipper" facilitates a toxic environment that breeds bad stories that are not well written, well planned, or logical at all, but since it's the particular ship, it's eaten up like cake. I mean, if you look at the entire swath of HHr stories, their is maybe two in the entire glut that are above average.

** Kinda late to the discussion (as always, for some reason when it comes to the interesting discussions I somehow miss out on them...), but here's my reasoning: the Harmony ship views itself as direct competition to the canon ships, even though both are fanon ships, so of course they will be more militant, and also why you have a bigger proportion of the Harry/Hermione shippers being completely delusional and bigheaded. You won't have this problem with ships such as Ginny/Luna (which is my second favourite Ginny-ship) or Seamus/Dean (something happened there I'm sure), even though both are also just as fanon as Harmony. Ships that have no threat whatsoever against the canonical "order" are by definition more peaceful.

Which is why the vast majority of the Weasley bashing (especially Ginny and Ron, since they are the direct threat to the Harmony ship) is done by Harmonians.

It's been a problem for more than 10 years, since HBP came out, and while the number of H/Hr shippers has gradually decreased over time (at least in the book fandom, the movies is something else), the Harmonians have only become more desperate to prove that their ship is the only true one. Which explains why they completely misinterpret JKR's words from the Wonderland interview, which further fueled the delusion. In their view, JKR did not say "In some ways Hermione and Harry are a better fit [compared to Ron and Hermione]", instead it's "Harry and Hermione MUST be together, Ginny and Ron can just fuck off".
