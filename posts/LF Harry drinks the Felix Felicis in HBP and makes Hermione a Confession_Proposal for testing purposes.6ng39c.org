Now this imagination does always pop-up in my mind, when i listen or read to the Passage in the Book, so im wondering if there is a Fic, he confess his Feelings to her (true or fake) or make a proposal to see if it Works. Doesnt matter if its H/Hr or comedic/parody or AU


** That's... actually not a bad premise for a fic at all. Don't know of anything like it unfortunately

*** Given the nature of the Felix Felicis, if it even lets you do something like this, the consequences of it would be glorious to see.

*** Granted this is the fan fiction world, but the nature of the potion is such that unless its going to "work out" he wouldnt feel the inclination to do it.

The question then becomes, could you FORCE it to provide luck in a way, or make choices without the nudging of the potion effectively doing 1 of 2 things.

Either causing it to force luck in a new direction or making it so your luck doesnt pan out even with the potion.

Definitely an interesting premise and thing to explore though.

**** Or if 'not working out' is better than 'working out'. It's supposed to be luck potion.

***** Grew up in abusive household, bullied in school, tortured and hunted by dark lord, manipulated by an old man, forced to sacrifice everything - and Harry is still the kindest soul you'll find.

Yeah, I do blame Snape, that vindictive bastard.

****** Despite him being the only one who cared for Harry? Spies can't live the live the way they want. Especially when their handlers are capable to penetrate mind.

Yes! Snape picked on Harry. But don't let your fanon Snape-hate bleed into everything.

Harry's growth wasn't normal. If he became vindictive and let his life become "similar to dark lord" instead of "equal to dark lord" as said in Prophecy he would have been dealt with by old senile fool who destroyed far too many lives than necessary.
