Did he conjure new Cloths Apart from his cloak every day incase someone managed to get poison into his wardrobe ? A new knife every time he needed one for anything apart from potions, only drinking freshly conjured water that has never left his sight? Vanishing food he Took his eyes off for even a second, poison detection charms every time he does to sit down. A way to destroy all stray hairs,skin cells,toe nail and blood to make sure it's not used in any magics that could be used against him. Brewing his own potions.

What do you think Mad-eye did to protect himself and what more could he have done ?


** My head cannon on four year was always bothered by how fake Moody would not get noticed. My process was that Dumbledore was just asking Moody to help, and the teaching was really useful because it came from him.

Sure the attempt was made to get him, but it wasn't until task 3 where he was actually replaced.

Otherwise that implied only two wizards attacked Moody and won, replaced him and then got away with pretending to be him for a year.

I'm not saying it isn't possible just always felt like alot of damn trouble to be teaching all those classes for some mad Crouch Jr. And holding up his cover. And having enough Polyjuice to teach classes all day long for a school year. And having time to bewitch the cup.

Made more sense that Moody was paranoid all year because Crouch was looking to take him out and it takes a whole year for it to work after the first attempt before the school year.

...

I think if I take cannon at face value Moody is paranoid to the highest, but in practice has not really protected himself. He was taken out by Pettigrew and Crouch Jr. right? That's it?

Just rat man who is a coward, and a crazy guy?

Moody you are incompetent.

*** I think that's an uncharitable view to take. My view is that Moody /used to/ be great and competent, but grew more and more neurotic the more enemies he made and the more traumatic experiences he went through, until he was the near-useless ball of nerves we meet in canon.

*** How does getting injuries mean you lack skill? He was a dark wizard catcher, it's impossible to go your entire career in a such a field, as doggedly as we are told he did, without ever getting serious injuries. It's not heresay that he was an extremely good auror, otherwise Voldemort wouldn't have gone after him first in DH. Now the photo thing was rather ridiculous from a security perspective.

**** Are there any other (ex-)aurors his age? It seems to be a profession where people die young and don't retire at all. Having survived to retirement age and fully blown civil war, even while receiving horrible injuries, is a testament to skill.

*** Having a photo with everyone in it was pretty dumb for everyone involved.

In his defense though, Barty Crouch was supposed to be a mad genius and technically much younger then Moody.

*** The biggest tip off to,that was that ther was no failsafe built into his magical eye.there should have at least been a failsafe to make it so it would knock out anyone who had the eye in who wasn't moody Infront of Dumbeldore.(but then if it did that we wouldn't have had the plot of the forth book can't have the adults being to competent).

What ways do you think a competent moody would have had in place to stop his identity from being stolen?

**** That failsafe sounds very convoluted. In what situation outside of 'being kidnapped and polyjuiced by a Death Eater, who then meets Dumbledore as me' is that a useful precaution to have?

EDIT: Just read the second part: the simplest way to avoid being impersonated is a series of code phrases exchanged between Moody and Dumbledore at the start of a conversation to confirm the other's identity. So long as both Moody and Dumbledore can use occlumency this works out easiest.
