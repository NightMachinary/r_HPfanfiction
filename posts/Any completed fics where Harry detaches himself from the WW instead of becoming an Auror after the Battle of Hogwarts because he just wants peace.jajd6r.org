It can have choosing a different career, travelling the world, etc. However, please no Draco/Harry, Harry becoming evil or that kind of thing.


** linkffn(The Sea King by Doghead Thirteen) is a short interesting read.

#+begin_quote
  Nineteen years ago, Harry Potter put paid to Voldemort at Hogwarts; now it's nineteen years later and, as the diesels hammer on, a bushy-haired girl is still searching for The-Boy-Who-Walked-Away... Oneshot, Deadliest Catch crossover.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307781/1/Heroes-Assemble]] hero's assemble by stargon1 fits that criteria. It is a marvel cinematic universe crossover with avengers and so might not be what you want. The book doesn't really feature his travels before he meets the avengers except that he does leave Britain and travels. This is a really good story and even if this isn't exactly what you want you should check it out and the authors other hp series the cupboard series is really good also. I hope this helped
