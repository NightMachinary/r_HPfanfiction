Soul bonds (and other types of miscellaneous bonds) are a common trope in fanfiction, and like most such they're frequently done poorly. Even some of my all-time favorite fics are guilty of this. What makes it bad, though, and how can it be handled well? I've divided the topic into three aspects - "Formation", "Advantages", and "Drawbacks", and will link to some examples among fics I've read (sorry so many of them are RobSt - those are just what happened to come to mind).

*1) Formation: How does it happen?*

How /does/ the bond form, and how does it relate to the relationship between the two characters? Badly-handled bonds tend to form quickly or instantly and occur early in the story. The stereotypical "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4357909/1/A-Kiss-Can-Save-The-World][first kiss, flash of light, insta-bond with superpowers]]" version is a classic bad bond, though at least that one does tend to come between two characters already in a relationship. The worst that I've seen are probably the Veela Bond fics (or other creature mating bonds) in which either Harry saving Fleur/Gabrielle triggers an automatic bonding or Fleur (or Draco in some notorious fics) just instinctively chooses Harry as a mate.

A better handling is something more organic and gradual, with the bond forming because of the relationship rather than vice versa. Ideally, it should look like a normal, plausible romance and only later have some sort of revelation of "oh wow, you've actually formed a soul bond!". Alternatively, the bond could be something formed deliberately, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7392700/1/Banking-on-Her][Banking on Her]]. Basically, if the bond (of whatever type) is the /result/ of the relationship rather than the /cause/ (or a driving force), it's a lot less likely to suck.

Far too many fics that include bonds have the characters becoming close ridiculously quickly, in some cases [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow][going from complete strangers to bonded-for-life in less than a day]]. Not only does that shatter the reader's immersion, it also throws away all of the story material that the more natural growth of the relationship would provide.

EDIT: As [[/u/Brilliant_Sea][u/Brilliant_Sea]] commented below, much of this section boils down to agency. Don't write a bond that takes agency away from characters unless you plan to address that loss of agency (such as by having the characters object to it).

*2) Advantages: What are the benefits?*

If the bond has no effects other than locking in the pairing, it's probably crap (unless the whole story is about the conflict of Harry being bonded to someone he doesn't like and cut off from someone he already loved, but even those can suck). Having the bond empower both members, in moderation, is reasonable. Turning both into Super-Merlin Dragon-Shifting Awesome-Mages(tm) is not.

Well-written bonds give some kind of benefit that advances the plot without removing conflict. Examples include allowing one to borrow power from the other, letting them feel each other's status/location/emotions, or in some cases suppressing or driving out the scarcrux.

There should be clear limits to any sort of ongoing benefit, even if those limits change over time as the bond develops and/or the characters grow. Always remember [[https://www.brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/][Sanderson's First Law of Magics]]: An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.

Also important: The bond should be reciprocal. Having Harry gain a massive power-up but his lover get f**k-all is just begging for accusations of misogyny.

*3) Drawbacks: No such thing as a free lunch*

Related to the limits mentioned above, it helps if there's some kind of cost or drawback to the bond. One of the most popular is that if either dies, both die; this is better than nothing, but it doesn't really do much for the story because the audience knows you're not going to kill off your main characters (usually - looking at /you/, GRRM...). Much more interesting/useful would be something like "if they get too far apart, they start to sicken/weaken/suffer": It creates a clear limitation on their actions that they didn't have before, and also can be used to drive further drama by forcibly separating the two and showing their struggle to reunite as they get increasingly debilitated by the bond's effects.

*End Note:*

None of these are hard-and-fast rules, of course. For example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5403795/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Price-of-Being-Noble][Harry Potter and the Price of Being Noble]] actually uses instant Veela bonding as a major source of drama and conflict rather than just a shortcut to a Harry/Fleur or Drarry pairing.

Thoughts? Disagreement? Invective-laced commentary?

*** You just summed up much of my massive wall of text in two sentences - this is really the thrust of the first section (and I'm going to edit such to reflect this). Bonds that drive a relationship or create one /ex nihilo/ take agency away from the characters, and so are best used as a source of conflict wherein the characters object to this loss of agency. Bonds that simply reaffirm a developed relationship or that are created deliberately by the bonded characters don't deny agency, and can in fact strengthen it.

**** True. But I can see exactly how it could go that way. Imagine being 14, being "trapped" with relatives you can't stand but knowing you will be getting away from them shortly. To suddenly waking up, finding yourself 6 years younger, stuck with someone you don't know, taken away from friends that you made and suddenly too young for any potential romantic interests that you had.

With everything else that had happened to you before than I could see how the anger and despair could drive you to that final decision.

** Often, I feel like soul bonds (and marriage contracts) are thrown in just to get the desired relationship going ASAP. When well written, that can add an interesting dynamic to the relationship - that is, that it starts off forced/semi-forced, but it still develops into an actual one. There's an appeal to that sort of situation, when well expanded upon - but it's hard to do right, and is usually pretty lazily done.

For soul bonds, though, I think there's a variety of ways it could go. The first thing an author needs to figure out is /why/ they even exist - what is it that makes that sort of bond a thing? That'll inform the way it takes shape in the story. Your formation point handles that fairly well - though even an 'instant' bond is not always a bad thing.

What is, on the other hand, is the bond affecting them too much. One thing that I think your post is missing is what exactly a soul bond /does/ - is it attraction? Is it love? What exactly does it do to the relationship?

That's the key, really - moreso than any other concrete advantage or disadvantage to the soul bond, it's the impact it has on the relationship that matters. Combine that with the reason the bond exists/how it forms, and that's all you really need to make it interesting.

For myself, I think soul bonds should not really have many - if any - positives if used. Perhaps limited to a general awareness of the other's state of mind if they're in turmoil/feeling something strongly - or a 'pull' towards their location. Disadvantages are more important to it in my view - it's what the bond imposes on them that makes it onerous and interesting to work around. For instance, making them need to see each other every X amount of time, or they get antsy. Making them need to touch/be close every Y amount of time, or they start to weaken. Making it so that they feel that connection in a way they don't want to or resent, getting that little bit of connection into the emotions/thoughts such that the other resents it.

To try to explain my thoughts a bit more, I think a fic that involves soul bonds that built up over time and as a consequence of an expanding relationship should have it at a low 'level' - that is, it's not very powerful and doesn't do too much, but it's more of a commitment like marriage that takes it a step further. For a fic that wants to use it to get the main pair together and explore the dynamics of that semi-forced relationship, I think it should be medium in strength - enough that it's an annoying pull, but not overpowering, and with a way out of it that they could be working towards.

I hope that makes sense!

** I like it when the Soul Bonds are not necessarily romantic in nature. Every person can have multiple soul bonds, these bonds are just souls you are fated to meet, interact with and be impacted by. This could be both positive or negative in nature. Society as a whole could find it romantic when this fated interaction is romantic in nature, with other individuals finding the thought of falling in love out of free will and not because fate decided you would meet someone more romantic.

So Harry would have a soul bond with his parents, because his soul was fated to meet theirs. A soul bond with Voldemort because they were fated enemies. And a bond with a few other people that managed to shape Harry into who he is.

** Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) has the concept of soul bonds being a marriage ritual/enchantment enacted over 12 days of the wedding by a charms master. It grants you a feel of the other person but no other power. They'd fallen out of fashion because through either fate or mischance, if one of the bonded died, the other tended to follow. I liked the concept.

One way to treat this, is to not forget the difference between magical compatibility (or your soul bond concept) and romantic love. Romantic love should /require/ magical compatibility (in story) but magical compatibility should not /guarantee/ romantic love. Only make it possible.

Another thing to not forget is that we don't get infinite choices. Sexual orientation is not exactly a choice but leaving aside societal/cultural pressures, it wouldn't be something a person would naturally rebel against.

It comes down to how the wizard/witch view themselves; they /might/ view the bond as something that is naturally a part of themselves rather than something imposed on them.

Soul bond is a trope; it /can/ be done well if the writer is skilled.

*** I find it funny how many people equal a soul/mate/ with a soul/bond/

Imo a soulmate is someone who the most compatible to you down to your very core, your soul. And I don't think that that is restricted to only one person or only to /romantic/ love.

And then there are the soulbonds. In my head-fanon for a natural soulbond u have be soulmates before can form, and yes not restricted to only one person or only to /romantic/ love.

And then there are artificial soulbonds benign like marriage bonds or hostile like the connection between Harry and Voldi.

And yes I know the natural ones invites for poly or harem storied but that don't have to be necessary a bad thing. It really /really/ depends on the writer.

** I think the "Soul Bond"/bonding that is done in The Accidental Bond by kb0 is handled pretty well. While the bonds start early it's due to Harry's "saving people thing" and the actual development of the bond (beyond the initial formation of it goes at a reasonable pace.

For the most part I'm usually ok with the Bonds no matter how they are formed etc. Even if I have to seriously suspend disbelief due to facets of the story being illogical or unbelievable when people act way beyond what would happen in real life (It is fiction). My main criteria is does the story keep me entertained.

If the story does that it's ok with me.

** Another thing that can be done is that the bond is actually a bad thing like it was done in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518/1/Error-of-Soul]].

In this it happens when people have a really strong relationship be it friendship or romantic or brotherly or sisterly. And it is treated as a tragedy because you can literally hear everything your bond partner is thinking. Every uncharitable thought they have about you that they never speak out loud and that puts strain on the relationship and usually the people involved end up hating each other with a passion.

There some other drawbacks but that would be getting into major spoiler territory and so I will stop.

It does offer some really strong soul magic once the bond matures enough but well it is rare.

I also liked it's take in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23303341/chapters/55814365]] 'You do it to yourself' in which a ritual has to be performed to form it and if the people aren't in close enough alignment it kills them outright and it was only performed when they were desperate and had no other option. Sort of like a last resort. It also binds them together. If one dies the other will die too. It was definitely an interesting read.

** I remember one where it's a Harry/Daphne, due to a marriage contract made by Orion Black who was very sexist.

The contract enforces itself by kind of forming a "bond" without all the benefits other fics have, and if you try to resist it gets worse, it's apparently semi-sentient or something, with guarantees to make the involved start to get close and court each other, so at the beginning they have to keep in contact, have to meet once a week for dinner and interact with each other, Harry tries to play the system and misses some dates due to work until the bond makes him actually sick because meeting her once a week for a few minutes for a sandwich is not considered dinner by the contract, so they have to increase contact and live in the same house.

The main problem is both involved start with zero interest in this, Harry is a busy Auror who hasn't had success in past relationships and Daphne instead of the self-assured pureblood heiress we normally see is an awkward girl whose family despises(especially her father) until they see in her a way to the spotlight(they go so far as to prevent Harry from meeting Astoria earlier because they think Harry will reject Daphne over her).

It deals with it in a surprisingly realistic way, with the "bond" generating lots of resentment and anger(and pain) way before any affection starts forming.

Bonus points for Harry and Draco entering a reluctant mutual alliance against their father-in-law who is an asshole to both of them.

I know want to find this fic but can't.

** I feel as if Soul Bonds are a sort of "overcharged" replacement for the "love at first sight" trope - you know, where there's an attraction that defies logic and common sense, often one-sided, which can either save or destroy a character - or form a romance. Such things do happen, and I feel using a soul bond, sometimes with visible marks, is inferior to simply having Harry fall for an impossible target against all odds, and struggling to come to terms with his attraction - one way or the other.

Anyways, the werewolf that the main character is bonded to, he's an absolute arsehole. Tries to manipulate her, charm her, and force the bond. Each of these attempts is met with his friends telling him not to be a dick, or even the pack leader stopping him.

** One of the more interesting "soul bond" interpretations I've read is actually not in Harry Potter or fanfiction at all but in the Night Angel books by Brent Weeks. In that story the bonding is done through an enchanted set of wedding jewelry. In a standard relationship the bonding is only done between two people as they are wed. No agency violations at all.

Jewelry with stronger enchantments have varied strength of effects but the strong effects are a limited sense of emotional empathy, awareness of where the other person is, deepening of relationship, shared dreams, and breaking of any other magical bonds. The disadvantage (to some) is a permanence to the bond, and magical pressure to avoid cheating.

In the story one person uses the rings to create a bond with someone else purely out of a desire to break a compulsion that she was under. The magical pressure of the enchantment trying to create a relationship between the two of them is a trial. The man who is trapped in this magical marriage is in love with someone else, and hates his "wife" for trapping him, the emotional empath abilities make his hatred of her affect her a lot. Later she struggles to suppress the bond which allows him to continue his relationship with his love but makes her miserable whenever he is "cheating" on her.

​

I really like this style of bond. If entered into by people in a healthy relationship there are positive benefits and no downsides. Works well as a world building aspect with minor plot effects in a fic where characters get married towards the end.

If entered into by people who aren't fully understanding of the implications (eg dumb 16 year old Hogwarts students) there are things that can cause reasonable drama and plot points if the bond is a more major aspect of the plot.

If entered unwillingly or without any understanding of what is going on then you can have an engaging plot with lots to explore in the relationship. Works well for a story where the bond is the major aspect of the plot. People can fight the bond, and even win against it if they'd like. Or maybe they get worn down by the magic making them understand their bonded and their feelings on a deeper level and have to come to terms regarding if they want to commit to the relationship and whether or not their feelings are real. Lots of directions to go.

** linkffn (The Bonds of Blood)

The Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs

Not the usual soul bond. The way the bond is formed and the problems caused are well explored. The bondmates do not immediately become close and both of them hate the bond. Harry / Ginny.

The bond is formed because of a magical accident. The bond does not ensure the affection between the bondmates. Most people who have bonded similarly in the past committed suicide unable / unwilling to fulfill the requirements of the bond. Almost all of the effects of the bond are detrimental. I believe this a unique take on the soul bond and to be honest I like it. Especially because the amount of effort that the bondmates have to put to make it work. I dislike most soul bond fics in which the bond is simply a means to bring 2 or more people together.

Perhaps soul bonds just develop between any people with a strong personal connection, including friends, rivals, lovers, maybe even hated enemies.

Maybe a soul bond can form between an entire generation of students, marking a clear divide of culture and values in the same way that we muggles call ourselves millennials or boomers.
