I find the idea of light and dark spells to be pretty eye rolling, I mean; there's a lot you can do to make a spell that is seen as light, as a dark spell.

Wingardium Leviosa is a spell that makes objects fly. Well; what if they had a rather blunt object fly, like Ron did with the club to the troll? But instead of doing something like that to a troll, someone decides to seriously hurt a student or whomever with Wingardium Leviosa. (Maybe even kills someone?)

Or something similar with other spells that are seen as "light" Would really like a story that explores this, possibility.

No Super Powerful Harry (Harry smarter or more powerful than he was in canon is fine, but make it believable)

No Harem Harry

No Seer Luna

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

No Weasley bashing, as I really love the family.

I'd also rather have no Dumbledore bashing, as that has gotten really old; but if it's done in an interesting way I'll allow it.

Other than that go nuts with it.


** The updated Dark Lord in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort][I Am Lord Voldemort?]], linkffn(12980210), is using normal household spells to kill his enemies, just to mock the notion of light vs dark magic. He also invents a new spell that's like the reverse of the Cruciatus, but has a similar end result as the victim's mind is forever trapped in a blissful world of their own.

#+begin_quote
  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power. Translated from Russian.)

** Light magic should only be magic created by positive feelings, and of that we only have the Patronus, and perhaps the cheering charm and the ridikukus.

The Leviosa spell doesn't have an emotional component so it should be considered a neutral spell.

******** So Hogwarts teaches dark magic? All herbology spells are harmful, a trimming spell can easily mutilate someone..

I honestly don't remember it being like that, dark spells had more to it, like being difficult to treat and impossible to fully cure. For example Lockhart removed Harry's bones, something clearly harmful, but he was healed next day. If a school nurse can easily heal such "dark magic" why the hell does Alastor Moody look like that?

********* There are different levels of dark magic. And there is debate in cannon on which spells count as dark. But no definition is really given in cannon. Utility spells are not considered dark, the cutting charm isn't as far as I can tell. But any spell labeled hex, jinx, or curse might be depending on the person. It's not very well thought out, but JKR isn't very good at actual world building, she's a storyteller.

******** ... Are you trolling or something? Anyway, back to your previous comment. The patronus is a light spell used to repel specific dark creatures, we know it requires happiness to work yet we also know that at least Dumbledore was able to instantly cast it while being *furious*. It is then a canon fact that as long as you can channel the proper emotional component to the spell, whatever else you are feeling doesn't matter. Voldemort can be having an orgasm while casting crucio on a muggle as long as he is capable of hating the muggle and wanting him suffer.

Like I said previously, you can't group spells into light and dark just based on their offensive capabilities, because then Hogwarts would be a dark arts school just by having Herbology..

********* Wait, nevermind. That was just a formatting thing where it looks like it was.

You say that emotion matters. And we also know that spells of any type can be cast regardless of the emotion being felt at that time. You're just pulling apologetics to support this now. You can make it for a fanfiction, but this is the equivalent of using an assumption to support an assumption. I'm done here.

P.S. Harry didn't think of happy thoughts when he cast his first patronus. He just knew he could because he could before which worked better than ever as it was his first full patronus.

************ *Cherry picking*

Cherry picking, suppressing evidence, or the fallacy of incomplete evidence is the act of pointing to individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position while ignoring a significant portion of related cases or data that may contradict that position. It is a kind of fallacy of selective attention, the most common example of which is the confirmation bias. Cherry picking may be committed intentionally or unintentionally. This fallacy is a major problem in public debate.The term is based on the perceived process of harvesting fruit, such as cherries.

*** Personally I like the idea that wizards have a sort of innate awareness and ability to influence their own magic, so directly magicking an alert wizard against their will requires that the caster be /significantly/ more skilled and/or powerful than the victim. This would also work as an explanation for why Barty Crouch could transfigure Draco, but they never actually use it in combat.

** Well, if it's light spells I often think of MTG. You know along the line of healing and support magic... Then you get the Oblivion or God's Wrath... Smiting people like the Abrahamic God.

A trope that light isn't good, Dark isn't evil..... Technically, is hard to pull off.

Though, I remember there's a Dresden crossover that it is noted that Harry uses a terrible white magic that killed a dragon and all that jazz. Like all the spells he used is white magic that purifies all and technically, who hasn't done a little bit of sin .
