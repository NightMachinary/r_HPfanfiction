"I'm 15 years old. My home in the Muggle world is in Little Whinging, in the southeast of England, and I don't have a girlfriend. I attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I don't smoke, neither do I drink. I'm in bed by 10 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

Basically, Piers Polkiss, you are a troublesome thing that would hinder my sleep. Therefore, I shall eliminate you with my Stand.....

*Killer Queen*."


** Harry had never liked cats. They were mean, they shed hair all over Figg's\\
house, and after tripping over one for the fifth time before watching a\\
photo album full of them, it was hard to have anything else besides\\
contempt for them. He hated cats, that is, until he got cut with some garbage while cleaning the garden and got a pair of cats of his own.

Sure, they were not very catlike, with one being more of a plant, and living in the stomach of his other weird, ghostly, mute cat. But he loved them all the same.

His love might have started because for the first time in his life he had something of his own that liked him but no one could take away. Maybe it was that his weird tall cat came with his first toy ever (and wasn't it cool, an RC car that could trip his bullies over and over again?) or it might have been the time one of his lovely, lovely cats made the stick his cousin used to beat him go /Boom/.

Yes Harry didn't know where they came from, what they actually were, or why they could follow him everywhere, but he loved his cats. And if anyone tried to harm them (/not that they could even see them/) he would blow everyone up, and then himself.

** Harry shrugged, downed the contents of the tiny bottle and wandered through the flames. The room beyond was circular and held the Mirror of Erised, in front of it stood a muscular blond man.

The man turned towards Harry and struck a pose, smirking

'You were expecting Snape? To bad! It was me, Dio!
