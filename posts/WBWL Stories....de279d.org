Are there any WBWL stories where the Potters still died (Cause I cant imagine the Potters ever being abusive/neglectful) and Harry was left with the Dursley's and his sibling was raised in the wizarding world and is an absolute prat. Preferably Sirius was still chucked into Azkaban and when he escapes he doesn't really like Harry's sibling...? Maybe Dark but good Harry? Maybe Harry is quite close to Snape and maybe in Slytherin?

  Take a WBWL-verse, add in some Slytherin Harry with Voldemort's memories, and add just a dash of Parselmagic, and what do you get? Harry Potter and the Sorting Hat's Gift, Book 1 of the Saga of the Lightning Speaker.

  For as long as he could remember, Harry Potter hadn't been alone. By his side had been his twin Jason.Then they arrived at Hogwarts and were Sorted into different Houses. Suddenly, a chasm lay between them, one Harry couldn't cross and Jason refused to.So Harry had to learn how to stand without his twin, finding friends and fighting a war along the way.

** !linkffn(The Secret Rune) is a story where Rose (the WGWL) is sent to live with Petunia, who made up with Lily before Lily died, while Violet (The actual GWL) is sent to an orphanage.

  After the Halloween attack of '81, Rose was declared the Girl-Who-Lived, and Violet was all but forgotten. The twins were separated, one receiving a better upbringing than the other. But Dumbledore made a very big mistake. Rose was not the GWL, Violet was. And now she's learning the truth... Dark!Harry, Twin!Harry, WrongBWL!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry. Warnings inside!
