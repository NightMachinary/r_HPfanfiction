Have you seen cosmic science and other stuff? Thats like magic. Especially when we start dealing with quantum mechanics. So it's like magic is quantum mechanics in a macro scale.

For example what we know about Dark matter is 1: there is something, 2: it interacs with gravity 3: there's a lot of it. Dark energy one the other hand, we can't detect it, measure it taste it but we can see it's effect. We can't explain it, it just exist.

(I've been watching because science and stumbled on Night crawlers teleportation. The science explanation of teleport that appearing will cause a loud sound made me think of apparating.)

Also Isaac Newton is known as the Father of Modern Science as well as dubbed as the Last of the Magician. He lived and worked in seclusion since people won't "respect" him if they find out he's dabbling in alchemy but he did use his knowledge in alchemy to make the modern Science, namely optics and the telescope

(1689 is the year of statute of secrecy employed, his book principia came out in 1687) he's highly secretive and said to have died due to his alchemical pursuit.

In fact people just go to him, ask him about papers and then he gives them but never really associated with other scholar unless he has to, just deal with people that he respects or just because the person he respects says to speak to other people. So technically, Isaac is the last Alchemist any muggles know.

Anyway, if you have any fic recommendations I'll appreciate it


** TBH I'm working on one, but it's a looooooooooong way from even chapter 1 -

I came up with a (hand-wave) version of Loop Quantum Gravity, and tripled the size of the Standard Model particle chart, which gave me a way to make magic work that fits both IRL and canon.

Using that, I built up a theory of evolutionary biology, which explains why not everything is magical (after all, if it is such an advantage, one would expect the evolutionary pressure to push everything magicward).

Then I extrapolated backwards from canon to construct an entire sociological/political/religious history for the wizarding world, then extrapolated forwards, using the development of mundane knowledge and IRL history as a guideline, to write a history-of-magic-knowledge, considering both which pre-Statute societies had mighty empires, religions and legends, and how magicals might have made reasonable or odd mistakes about the nature of magic, just as mundanes did IRL about the world, then went back and considered how that would have induced changes - in fact, I was able to construct a really nice backstory going back several millenia, that explains the roots of antimugglism and anticreaturism (using the history real-world prejudices as a guide).

I have a thick stack of notes on the backstory, and like, half a page of actual story.

I'm honestly considering dropping the latter and writing a fic that's basically a HP textbook: "The History and Natural Philosophy of Magic" - but as it is, it would require either writing from a God's-eye view, or putting in a small framing story that sets it as being written late in this century or so, Hermione having induced a scientific revolution in the magical world...

*** I would totally love this "text book." In all honesty I kinda wanted to do magic is science as well but I am not good at building story around it. I could write a pseudo thesis about the subjects

The possible genetics that causes magic to be born with not magical. My head Cannon is that wizard-ship has three alleles that govern it. Magic core is incomplete dominant. mage circuit(enables use of magic core) is recessive. Circuit suppressor is dominant. The routine casting out of squibs caused the Advent of carriers and the reason why pureblood don't like marrying muggles. Muggleborn are technically winners of genetics lottery.

The economic history of wizarding world is reminiscent of the real life effect of segregation. The backwards politics kinda reminds me why France failed to emulate the success of the British empire during industrial revolution. The effect of free communication vs. the government controls all info that stifled progress. Everything is so easy with magic that people did not strive for efficiency.

OP seems to be asking about fics where magic falls into the "sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" principle, which is fairly common in futuristic scifi.

#+end_quote

Yeah, I'd agree with that definition. Soft scifi is 'science themed' and 'hard scifi' has actual scientific backing. There's probably a better way to define the difference between the two, but saying that one has space magic and the other not is a pretty comprehensive roundabout way to phrase it.

Isn't this besides the point? OP was asking about science, not scifi. Pointing to a scifi story that falls very deep in the soft-scifi direction doesn't really help. It's like recommending Star Wars.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1141722][Safeguard]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/esama/pseuds/esama][esama]] touches on the differences between science and magic, but it's unfinished an either abandoned or on a long hiatus. Still one of my favourite stories of all time.

Both [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] (Series) and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719529][Ninja Wizard: The Adventures of Harry Potter, Dimensional Traveler]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_fairy/pseuds/mad_fairy][mad_fairy]] touch on how magic is related to science, but mostly in terms of what makes magical people different from muggles.

  Post Avengers/ Sequel to Cognosco. Tony just wanted to one-up his buddy Loki. He never thought his experimentation on teleportation would pull some boy from a different universe into his lab basement. Harry's "first" day there is plain horrible: a botched CPR, parachuting without a parachute, and then his wand breaks. Merlin, he was only a researcher! Ch20: Push and Pull

*** Eh, not really. HPMOR-Harry begins by /thinking/ that magic can be explained scientifically, but halfway through realizes that this just plain doesn't work. He loosely comes to the conclusion that magic was /designed/ by ancient wizards/Atlanteans/aliens whatever, and that they designed it to purposefully defy analysis.

**** Wasn't it more that he realised magic couldn't be explained with the /current/ scientific understanding of the universe? In other words, magic itself is not fundamentally unscientific, but rather the current theoretical framework of physics is missing something, and possibly that human minds are unsuited for thinking about certain recursive problems.

Harry goes off on interesting tangents about that at various points throughout the fic (the mind projection fallacy, etc.) For example, there's this part in ch 14:

#+begin_quote
  Harry had looked upon magic and refused to be intimidated. People had no sense of history, they learned about chemistry and biology and astronomy and thought that these matters had always been the proper meat of science, that they had never been mysterious. The stars had once been mysteries. Lord Kelvin had once called the nature of life and biology - the response of muscles to human will and the generation of trees from seeds - a mystery "infinitely beyond" the reach of science. (Not just a little beyond, mind you, but infinitely beyond. Lord Kelvin certainly had felt a huge emotional charge from not knowing something.) Every mystery ever solved had been a puzzle from the dawn of the human species right up until someone solved it.

***** Yes, but all of this is in, what, the first third. The fact is that whatever the truth may be (and I believe the author has stated that the most plausible conclusion is that the entire HPMOR universe is a simulation), Harry abandons trying to "science-ify" magic for the entire second half. So it would hardly be a satisfying story for OP.

****** I feel I should point out that the reason he moves on to other priorities is /not/ because he believes magic to be fundamentally mysterious. It's because he believes that magic research is exceptionally /dangerous/. And all his most respected mentors agree. So, it's more important to focus on fixing magical society and achieving immortality; novel transfiguration can wait.

******* It's been a while since I read it, but I do think it's a mix of both. He's also pretty put off, as I recall, by his whole "made up a grand theory of how he's going to become God in ten easy steps, then the /first/ experiment goes wrong and has to trash the whole thing" fiasco. He doesn't stop believing, of course, that there is ultimately a rational explanation for magic; but he gives up on his hopes of /finding/ that rational explanation through entry-level experimentation.
