Dumbledore apparate on the steps, appearing to slide down them. Before the Death Eaters could react, Dumbledore had stunned two and had hit one with the jelly legs hex. The remaining Death Eaters, not fighting anyone else started to run, but Dumbledore pulled them back with what looked like a invisible fish hook.

Harry looked over and saw Sirius barely duck Bellatrix's red jet of light. Laughing he said, "That the best you can do?"

They both new that only one could survive this encounter.

Harry duck he heard Lupin shout. He rolled to the floor as a green jet of light flew over his head. Turning to his attacker, ready to strike, "Voldemort?"

Laughing, Voldemort shot Curse after Curse at Harry, "You can't hide forever boy. No portkey to save you this time."

Barely missing all his curses, he flew forward towards Harry, who had tripped backing away from Voldemort. Stepping between them, Dumbledore and Voldemort

began to duel. Red, green, and silver light filled the room with vibrant color, giving the glass a eerie glow to it. Harry started to back into a corner so Voldemort couldn't target him. As much as he wanted to help, he knew he would only get in the way.

Looking over at Sirius, he saw a green light go under his arm, as his curse hit Bellatrix square in the chest, killing her instantly. He then strolled over to her body, laughing, "Nice shots cuz, guess you weren't good enough. Time to get your master now."

At that point the rest of the Death Eaters had been rounded up by the members of the Order. The wizards all began to converge on Voldemort, eager to kill him

once and for all.

"I will be back," shouted Voldemort as he apparated away!

Harry ran up to Sirius hugging him, "I'm glad you didn't get hurt"

Harry walked over to Ron to see he was gaining his sense again, "Bloody hell mate, that was one great fight, eh?"

Rubbing his head, Ron mumbled, "What fight? All I remember is Uranus?"

"Your kidding mate."

"Nah I remember it all, just messing with you," chortled Ron.
