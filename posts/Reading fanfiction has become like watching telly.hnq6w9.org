so i read alot, normal novels (recently started crime and punishment) and of course fanfiction. When i read 'normal' books, its not necessarily a chore but I have to take breaks and give the book a rest from time to time.

But when it comes to fanfiction I can read for hours and hours without needing a break or to clear my head a little. It's like binging a series or watching telly. It kind of washes over me and keeps me satisfied in the best ways possible in a different way to 'normal' books.

I'm not sure if this is a good explanation or makes sense as it's pretty weird to think about as they're both, in essence, the same thing but here we are.


** I can kinda see where you're going. It's a bit like watching tv because you don't need to think very hard. I mean this in every positive way, but it is essentially very easy to read because we're very familiar with the setting, the characters and most tropes, so we don't have to be always absorbing new information with every new paragraph, therefore making it less tiring for our brain (i hope this makes sense)

** I've been reading fanfiction for over a decade now...maybe even close to TWO decades...so I totally get this. I love reading "regular " books but with fanfiction, you have more control over where the story is going and if you're into romance, the main couple. Not everyone likes the mainstream couples from books/movies/tv. Also tags for fanfiction helps to know what you're getting into that you might not get from the original sources.

**** Lol...I feel so old. Must have started in my preteens/early teenage years. I remember sneaking on to the computer at night and trying to cover up the dial up sound as not to wake anyone.

****** Sit down youngin and let me tell you about dial up. Internet was hooked into the telephone lines in the house. So to get internet, it basically had to dial a number or something to connect. Not sure how it all works. But you can google the sound of dial up internet. Most annoying sound we old folks had to hear.

** If you're reading on your phone, just make sure to use the equivalent of an 'eye comfort' setting on there. Helps stave off the strain.

*** Most phones have specific read modes, but some others have a 'night mode' which basically dims down the blue light emissions from the display. This reduces strain on your eyes like [[/u/Vg65][u/Vg65]] pointed out. It isn't recommend to read on phones which don't have either of these features.

** I tend to compare fanfiction to pre-made meals. When you want to fall into a story quickly and effortlessly, you pick up fanfiction. There's no need to get to know new characters and there's some sense of what you are going to be reading. Low effort experience for the reader.

Though I have to say that good quality fanfiction is way more flavourful than what was placed in the microwave oven.

This easy way of reading might explain why it's so easy to go on and on and on.
