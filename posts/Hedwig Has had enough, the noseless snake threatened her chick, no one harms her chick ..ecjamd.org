Hedwig calls in the postal owl strike force,forms an Alliance with The plague of pigeons in London and the seagull mafia from New York, Hedwig leads the strike team into wales and pecks Bellatrix's eyes out, the Legionnaires of the pigeon poo Brigade Douse Voldemort and his followers in a rain of pigeon Excrement with thanks to MUSCA that been enchanted to harden like concrete Trapping anyone covered it turning them into statues. The seagull mafia dive bombs any Stragglers.

When the deed is done The owls return home to stacks of bacon Provided by the Ministry For services rendered. As they couldn't figure out how to pin an order of Merlin on an owl. A lifetime supply of bacon was deemed to be sufficient payment


** I forget the name of the fic, but this reminds me of this scene in the owlery where Hedwig was in the top spot, and the owls of Harry's friends are all near her while she is attending "court". She made lots of mentions of bacon tariffs/offerings. Angry Harry or Runestone path.

Or the Crack path: Hedwig Unhinged or Laser Owl, Kung-fu Toad and I forget the Rat's name in that one Rorschach's Blot.

  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

*** No.

Evidence 1: Harry is not an owl.

Evidence 2: Harry is growing up not in his parents' nest but with another family.

Conclusion: Harry is a cuckoo. Thus "chick" is the proper word to use when referring to him.
