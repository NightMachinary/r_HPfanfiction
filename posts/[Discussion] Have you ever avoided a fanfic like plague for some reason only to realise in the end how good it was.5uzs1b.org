As the title says, have you ever avoided a fic due to pairings, bad summary, or popular dislike, but after finishing every "interesting" story you came back to that one and changed your opinion drastically?

** I kept avoiding Backwards with Purpose like the plague because I generally don't like HP/GW stories, but I finally gave in because time travel is my favorite trope. I was pleasantly surprised, it did a pretty good job, not my ultimate favorite or anything but it wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting. It even had some feels that stuck with me even now when I can't remember most of the plot, like Mrs. Weasley not sending Harry a Weasley sweater. I thought it dragged on a little towards the end (or maybe it was in the sequel?) but overall it was pretty good considering I was so sure I was going to hate it.

Honestly, its FFN's stupid 400 character limit on the summaries which is at fault. No one can summarize such long fics in so few characters, so dozens of decent stories get skipped over because their summaries aren't good enough. It's honestly dumb.

I didn't understand how the same guy who'd written Richard Castle, Watcher(I'd read it on questionablequesting, before I really got into the HP fandom) could write something as mediocre as the cupboard series.

After realizing my mistake, I read Patron, and loved it, and now I'm reading The Dark Lord Never Died. They're both pretty original, and awesome. The ideas sound cliched, but the execution is great.

** Yes. I avoided Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches for a long time, despite its good rep at this sub, because I'm not into harem and WBWL. In fact, I don't even recall reading a fic with elements like these before DPSW. But one day I was really bored and thought "well... why not". Ended up finishing it in a few days and really enjoyed it.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. Story is high on Political intrigue.

I was completely blown away by just how good that it was.

I had gotten used to Harry/Ginny fics being Ginny worship a la most things on Sugar Quill from back in the day, and this definitely was /not/ it. Heavily fleshed out characters, decent world building, and a nice plot. It didn't make me into a Harry/Ginny fan, but I don't disregard those stories out of hand now.

** I have a sort of related story. I am incredibly slow when it comes to starting. For some fics, it's because I just don't want to drop the five consecutive hours reading, get engrossed, and reach the last update from two years ago right in the middle of the story.

For some, it's because I'm currently struggling to write a fic, and don't want to read something /too/ similar for fear of it either draining my motivation or driving me into a corner and writing something different to avoid becoming a poor copy.

That turned out to be a well-founded fear. Not too long ago I decided to start reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11280068/1/The-Brightest-Witch-and-the-Darkest-House][this]], thinking I had got myself situated enough that it wasn't too big a deal. I got through the second paragraph before I just about had a stroke. I knew Slytherin girl who occasionally crossed the line wasn't particularly original. I knew establishing it by having them knock somebody out for a good cause wasn't particularly original. [[http://i.imgur.com/pgbNoEe.png][I did a triple take when I realized her name.]]

So I'm still avoiding a lot of fics like the plague.
