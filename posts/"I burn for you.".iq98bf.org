Background:

I'm doing this Swagbucks offer where you need to get to level 160 in an app to be paid a certain amount form the site ($40.00, here I come!).

Basically, it's one of those cheesy casino slots apps. The slot I'm "playing" right now is a fantasy/dragon themed one.

One of the pay-line icons is an attractive, fiery-haired woman in a Warcraft-style dress, holding a ball of flame. Her catchphrase? "I burn for you" in an unhinged voice.

Naturally, this connected to two things in my mind: yandere and fire elemental.

...Not sure what that says about my subconscious, lol.

So, yeah.

No-one believes Harry when he says he's being stalked by an attractive girl: she always seems to vanish when others aren't around.

People complain he often stinks of ash, though.

Meanwhile, girls that are interested in Harry or that Harry is interested in suddenly find their belongings spontaneously catching fire, and they have the horrible feeling they're being watched...

When Death Eater corpses turn up after being burned alive, people begin to investigate his "outlandish" claims more seriously...


** It doesn't even need to be a dragon, just a jealous and extra powerful Veela.

*** Fleur and Gabrielle's cousin. They try to apologies for their crazy cousin's antics, and treat her batshit insanity as being "quirky" and nothing too severe.

** This is totally off topic, but oh god, I forgot about swagbucks. I did that for a few weeks in between jobs.

Have you looked into Amazon Mechanical Turk? It's data entry or surveys in exchange for small cash payment. You can have it turned into Amazon gift cards or sent to your bank account. I did a mix of the two for a while.

*** Yeah, Swagbucks fell by the wayside for a lot of people in recent years: it's either a staple earner for them or they moved onto the better sites.

I've used mTurk a bit in the past, but since I'm in the UK, I can only get it send to my Amazon.com balance: while some UK users can get the bank account option, I'm unfortunately not one of them.

And given how ridiculous import prices are... I think an SSD had 40% of its value added on as import fees. Not good. :(
