The only good Harry/Hermione fic I've ever read is 'Vox Corpis'.

I'm looking for recs for five star Harry/Hermione stories.


** linkffn(Shadow Walks) is 4.5/5 IMHO, but it doesn't have a drop of bashing or Sueifying. It's pretty darn good.

His most recent work - linkffn(Favorite Things by Stanrick) - is oddly funny for a slow-burning H/Hr romance.

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

** Depends what you're looking for in a Harmony fic, I ship H/hr but i don't particularly like Vox Corpis' style of a slow burn romance. However i'll recommend some of the ones i /really/ liked.

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=5185&chapterid=&agree=1][Forever Knight]] is a superb and fantastic story that features excellent characterization and story telling. this story by far is my favorite in terms of romance when it comes to H/hr. Also there's no Ron Bashing where a good major of H/hr stories suffer from and to be honest i really liked Ron in this story. Warning however is that there's a bit of smut and could get quite angsty(not necessarily a bad thing if you ask me).

*Unlike a Sister* linkffn(6574535) is a canon compliant post-epilogue story. It features Harry and Hermoine as Adults and pretty much how they live their lives. now while this is a "fidelity-fic" and i find a story a bit boring, its well written and gives us a different yet interesting perspective into Harry and Hermoine's relationship as a whole. Too bad it hasn't been updated in over a year just when the really good parts start to happen.

*Fulfilling Obligations* linkffn(4418163) is similar to the previously stated story with the exception of plot structure(The story progress in specific time periods after DH and all the way until the characters' adult life) and adds a bit of twist in the whole relationship canon. Where Unlike a Sister is more into the development, realism and contrast of the pairing, Fulfilling Obligations serves more like a "What-If"/"Could have been" type Story that is overall fairly well written and at times emotionally draining.

*What We're Fighting For* linkffn(9766604) is by far one of my favorites fanfictions out there. Yes it's cliche and the writing could use a bit of work but damn this fic has a special place in my heart. it's an AU where harry has been kept living in secrecy and training to become the ultimate +badass+ soldier.

*Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor* linkffn(2841153) /warning: if sensitive to graphic subject matter, do not read this story/ if that's not the case however and you're looking for a fun and easy going read then look no further. this fic shouldn't be taken as seriously though as there's barely any romance development in this story, but the relationship doesn't feel as unrealistic, forced and/or cringeworthy as other Harmony fics.

** Well, personally I really love The Draco Trilogy. It has a really good Harry/Draco bromance, as well as Harry/Hermione ship. There's a lot of humor and homage to tv-shows (like Buffy, Blackadder) and other fantasy books.

It starts with Harry and Draco changing into each other via polyjuice in Potions, and then not changing back. Hilarity and drama ensues.

Honestly it's my favorite fanfiction ever. My friends and I reference it all the time! We even went so far as to have it printed in book form. Anyways, it's not online anymore, so I uploaded the PDFs to dropbox if anyone wants to check them out.

On the other hand, I really like finding Buffy and Blackadder quotes in there, as I am a fan of both shows. The PDFs I linked has references at the end of each chapter.

And in the end, I thoroughly enjoy reading the Trilogy, despite the debacle surrounding it. It's only fanfiction after all.

** My favorite H/Hr stories, none of them containing Weasley bashing:

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005): the real war began after Voldemort's fall.

*Returning to the Start*, linkffn(10687059): even though not very popular, I like this fic a lot.

*Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925): technically not a H/Hr story, but I really want them to get together.

*The Power of Love*, linkffn(11251745): fem!Harry/Hermione, dark, violent, and very well written.

*Call Me Moriarty*, linkffn(11602420): another brilliant dark fem!Harry/Hermione.

Finally, *The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), is a superb story that's going to be finished in 10 days. After the Voldemort's fall, British wizarding world still sucked. Harry had enough, assumed the mantle of a Dark Lord to finish off remaining Death Eaters and pureblood extremists. Implied Harry/Hermione/Ron threesomes, no explicit scenes so far.

This puts her above Dumbledore in terms of intelligence, but lots of H/Hr fics make her into a genius so it's not that surprising.]]

[[/spoiler][However, this fic also turns her into an inhumanly sexy woman with perfect fashion sense (inherent to vampires, apparently). Not only she has superhuman strength and reflexes, she also becomes an expert at hand-to-hand combat (so not just power, but actual /skill/) and teaches Harry at some point. She fights using those as well as dual enchanted pistols and a sword. And not just any sword - a katana. /Of course/.]]

[[/spoiler][Not to mention, she has two older vampire boytoys... Er, "Shadow Kin", following her around as their "Alpha" because she's just so amazing.]]

The horse cutter sword/zanbato is closer in function to the Scottish Claymore or German Zweihander, and be more useful in widespread battle than a one-on-one duel, which is what most katana-cultists use to masturbate over how superior the Japanese blade is to European ones.

  *Description:* War, werewolves, wizards, death, the undead... Harry has his work cut out for him. And then there's Hermione, who's a different set of vamp-angst altogether. Though war and death has changed so much, Harry knows he could beat the odds of a bitter fate. Now he just has to make her believe it. WARNINGS: Probably too much sex and extreme violence. EXCERPT: It was a night like this one long before when Hermione Granger became the center of his life. He didn't know back then that was what happened. All he knew was that she had appeared at the Dursley doorstep and quite possibly shifted his understanding of life.

****** You're right, the author summary is utter crap (probably trying too hard to avoid spoilers).

It's been a while since I've read it but I'll give it a try:

The story features pretty extensive vampire lore, but more along the lines of badass vampires (think Buffy; not the glittery Twilight kind).

Hermione is turned into a vampire very early on. Her attempt to (naively) maintain her relationship to Harry and remain in the human world fails spectacularly and she disappears. After years of fighting Voldemort and searching for Hermione on his own time, Harry is in for a surprise when their paths cross again.

** The sad thing is, there aren't any stories that I would give a five star. Vox Corporis is well-written (as far as I can remember), but the pacing is way too slow and has too much emphasis on the pairing. I would probably give linkffn(Definitions of Romance) a 4.5, rounded up to 5, but that's more to personal preference than objective writing (Also, it probably helps that it's just a short oneshot). Enembee's linkffn(By the Divining Light) has parts of H/Hr, but that's just a side thing and is hardly developed on.

The best I can give you is 5/5 fics with good H/Hr friendship, which otomh would be linkffn(What Lies Beneath; The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks; Stages of Hope)

** Notebooks and Letters linkffn(3867175) is quite good. It's post-GoF and as the name suggests, the story is told mostly from Hermione's journal and letters. It's competently written and believable from the standpoint of canon, though it takes a weirs turn towards the end that I don't like very much.

Unlike a Sister is one of the best romance stories I've seen in this fandom, however, it's a whole different level. It's rare that you see someone who can write with some actual skill and emotion, instead of simply passable prose that gets recognition for avoiding basic grammar and verb mistakes. The chapter where they watch La Traviata is beautiful and touching, and the story really drives home Harry's obsession and its immoral consequences for their families and marriages. I couldn't decide whether I wanted there to be an affair. Unfortunately, it may as well be abandoned, but what's there is worth reading.

Aside from these and VC, I haven't read any other fic that I'd recommend. It's honestly cringeworthy to see thrash like Forever Knight mentioned in the same breath as decent stories. Fanon has a big boner for turning Hermione into an infallible goddess and Harry as her subservient simpleton.
