You can definitely be critical of a character without it being bashing. But bashing exists because you are critical of a character. You could say it's kinda a overly extreme form of being critical. Most have a general idea of both which probably look very different. But when would you say something stops being critical and starts being bashing whats the line between them? The main difference?

Also what characters do you like seeing people be critical of / you like people showing these characters in a unfavorable way , but you don't like seeing these characters be bashed.

For example I like seeing fic where people are critical of Snape but don't like Snape bashing. ( The only bashing i like is Umbridge bashing)


** Being critical of a character: This one thing they did was kind of f*cked up not gonna lie. Let's have a character arc where they learn not to do that.

Bashing a character: Exaggerating those faults to a point that the character is unrecognisable. This one thing I hate about them? Let's have them do it constantly.

** If you want to get specific about characters or setting stuff, bashing is highly relative, depending on how you see the characters or setting stuff in question. Ron is a perfect example. Interpretations of his character vary wildly. For people who see him as a feckless, disloyal moron, stories portraying him like that aren't bashing. For others who see him as loyal and good, him being disloyal and prejudiced will come off as bashing. Whether those interpretations are canon or not is another question, but whatever the answer to that is, people still have those differing interpretations and thus these conversations about bashing will remain affected by that difference.

Without the specific examples, however, bashing is basically just the difference between criticism and critique.

Criticism focuses entirely on the negative, to the exclusion of any even mildly positive aspects. It's simply "This is bad, here's why." It's why we make the distinction of 'constructive criticism' - it's still negative, but it's an attempt to help you build yourself up.

Critique involves a more rounded analysis covering both the good and the bad of a thing. "This is bad, however it's not that important because of this reason, and can even be countered a little by this other thing that is actually quite good."

A good character analysis is a critique - to go for a spin of the cliche: Dumbledore is a manipulative spider who wants to control all of Magical Britain, but he also fights against Voldemort and is actually trying to help people with his machinations.

If you take out the good and just have 'Dumbledore is a manipulative, whiskered old wanker who wants to control everything', that's just criticism (and not even constructive criticism at that), and that's what most people perceive as bashing.

** I always find bashing stems from when an author doesn't know what to do with a character. They don't want to leave a character out but the character doesn't have a place in their plot, so they just bash the crap out of them.

Its perfectly fine to be critical of characters as no one in the Harry Potter universe was perfect. It's a whole another thing to say this character has no redeeming traits and should be insulted mercilessly.

If you can't say anything nice about a character just leave them out.

** Bashing is, first and foremost, not about criticism, exaggeration, or even making someone a villain, as it is about /degrading/ and/or /disempowering/ a character. All major characters have both virtues and flaws, and bashing is often about removing the virtues from a character, with flaws coming to the fore being a secondary effect.

For example, Canon Dumbledore's virtues are his power, his wisdom, and his benevolence. Take away his benevolence (e.g., stealing from Harry, discriminating against the poor oppressed Slytherins), his wisdom (e.g., making foolish decisions around the protagonist), and his power (e.g., turning out to have had feet of clay magic-wise all this time), and you get a typical Manipulative!Dumbledore.

But, how many Manipulative!Dumbledores make for a villain half as compelling as Dolores Umbridge?

For another example, Canon Hermione's virtues are her brilliance, her sense of justice, her independence/proactiveness, and her generosity. A bashed Hermione tends to lose out to the protagonist academically (i.e., take away the brilliance), take it poorly but do nothing to address the problem (i.e., take away the generosity and proactivenes), and obsess over and be paralysed by "rules" and "authority" (i.e., take away the justice and independence).

** Bashing is a very unfair assessment of a character. As a rule of thumb I'd say, bad traits are blown out of proportion and good traits are swept under the carpet. Critical judgement allows more objectivity or character studies and is more like assessing both sides of the coin and not actually bashing them for their bad deeds.

And moving on to your last question, it kind of applies to most characters. I don't want them to be praised and their bad traits forgotten but I also don't like to see them bashed. People are complex.

*** I mean true I guess the better question is who you prefer to see in a more antagonistic role. They could still be morally complex but the narrative isn't really siding with them and their flaws are a bigger problem even if they aren't the main antagonist or anything. Like for example in book 4 Ron is in a more antagonistic role. His flaws are causing more problems for alot of people and he's being kinda a dick. But he's not like a villain or anything. The narrative is critical of him but I wouldn't say its bashing him.

** It's usually Snape tbh but if not Snape uhhh maybe Molly? She does some shitty things I'd be happy see people be critical over since its not really in canon. But I hate Molly bashing. I don't think I've seen Molly critical stuff just Molly bashing and Molly being cool and no in-between I guess. Hermione kinda the same but someone already said Hermione.
