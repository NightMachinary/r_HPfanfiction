Im looking for fics where Harry (for whatever reason) ends up in a different universe and meets a good dumbledore, that is utterly disgusted with his counterparts actions. (Harrys original worlds dumbledore i evil/manipulative/senile)


** Dumbledore and Harry aren't disgusted at canon Dumbledore here, but they certainly don't approve of some of the steps he took. Also it's hilarious.

** Your view on original Dumbledore is wrong, so it's going to be difficult to find a fanfic to start with.

*** Well thats.. an odd comment.. i never said the original dumbledore was cannon dumbledore, only that he would be evil/senile/manipulative.

And calling my view wrong is not very polite, i could just as well call you naive for believing cannon dumbledore is good?

**** I think he missed all the options you gave, Dumbledore didn't have to be evil.

Dumbledore certainly was something and I personally believe he was just senile, it didn't help that he probably spent decades without prolonged social interaction limiting himself to dealing with his three jobs full-time.

*** Whether it's wrong or not doesn't really matter in this case, because there are plenty of fics out there that portray a manipulative and/or evil Dumbledore. It's hardly a rare phenomenon in the fandom.
