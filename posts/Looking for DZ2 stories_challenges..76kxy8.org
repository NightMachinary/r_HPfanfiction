Does anyone knows where I can find the stories that DZ2 has deleted, and any stories that are based around his challenges. Thanks in advance.

** There is a DZ2 community on FFnet. Check there. But for the life of me, can't figure out why anyone would want to. DZ2 is one of the worst writers in the fandom.

He/she starts dozens of stories a year, gets the chars through most of Year 1, then loses interest and moves on. That, however, isn't why they're bad. Plenty of people start and don't finish.

They also write literally the same fic in half of those. They create or accept “challenges” that literally force the narrative on rails, then state “everything else is up to you..” when literally nothing is up to the author, it's all predetermined. Why bother?

Additionally, nearly all of those fics are “dark” Harry wankery where he gets to win all the time because he wins. Yawn. Powerful!Harry needs powerful enemies, and most writers get this wrong unless they're writing puff pieces, which 90% of DZ2 qualifies as.

Furthermore, they write like a bad comic writer. Everything is the same tone, same style, and looks like it belongs on the pages of the latest Rob Liefeld abomination.

Good luck - but as their own profile states, if it's gone it is because they don't have any intention of finishing it, nor do they think it's worth keeping.

*** Yeah. I know, but sometimes I just feel like a puff piece where Harry wins all the time. It's why while I don't read such stories often, I still enjoy them from time to time if for no other reason than, because it's fun to pretend.
