Like Indian descent Harry because so many fics make James of Indian descent. üòÇüòÇ


** I have never once encountered a fic where James is of Indian descent, though a few people on this sub have mentioned it before. Is this seriously a thing now? (Not criticizing, just curious.)

*** I think so. I didn't get into fanfic until last year and I've seen a few. I think they're mostly written by teenagers who are trying to raise awareness on inclusion. Which is fine but sometimes it's hammered in and cringeworthy. I did, however, read one that included parseltongue as something praised in India, which was an interesting take.

*** It's been a done for a few years now. The oldest fics seem to date back to 2015, though it started appearing more a few years back. There are some head canon posts and fan art from Tumblr that I think made Desi Potter fanfics start popping up more starting around 2017/2018.

*** I've seen one or two good fics with the Potters being Indian and dozens more that have 'inclusion' hammered in to the point of painfulness. Almost zero characterisation, just sudden announcements of their identity.

** I've been reading fan fiction for almost 20 years and I've never seen a fic where the Potters are Indian.

Anyone got any recommendations?

***** Anything is possible on ao3. From a Dobby pairing to a horcux pairing, any tag is possible as long as enough people write about it.

Ao3 doesn't discriminate in that respect.

You can chose to exclude any tag you don't agree with. I always exclude Cursed Child because as far I'm concerned, it never happened. It was badly written fanfiction that became popular.

Could you link a few of the better ones? I've not read any fics with this.

** I've never encountered that either. Is it mostly a thing on Tumblr? I pretty much only read on ff.net, and occasionally Ao3, but there I pretty much only read Ao3 fics I've seen linked here.

*** I see it quite often as a really small, off-handedly mentioned thing like in Hermione Grangers Hogwarts Crammer. Does seem to happen a lot in slashfic, so I would imagine it's a Tumblr-spread thing. When they're making a polyjuice potion, this exchange occurs:

#+begin_quote
  Harry squinted at her suspiciously. ‚ÄúYou're not going to make me white or something, are you?‚Äù

  Hermione snorted. ‚ÄúDid I make me white?‚Äù
#+end_quote

Hogwarts Crammer - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278]]

Never seen it done on a more culturally-linked scale, interestingly. I've seen fics like that where Harry is just Harry with a different skin colour, but nothing where he or his family actually have any Indian culture linked in.

**** Yeah, I pretty much only read gen, and especially don't read slash(not criticizing, just not my thing) so I guess it makes sense that I've never seen it. The closest thing to a slash fic I've read recently is October, and I'm pretty sure Harry is white in it.

***** Eh, each to their own. Considering I've read someone who says they stop reading a story if the format is 'Name said' instead of 'Said Name' (or possibly vice versa, I forget the specifics), I've gotten used to the idiosyncratic tastes of the Harry Potter fandom. And if people wrote/read what they believed in reality, I'd be very worried for the fans of some of the fics written here. :D

But yeah, it's prevalent there, not absolute. And that's only to my limited experience, too. I've not been here in the fandom reddit very long and I've really not read all that widely.
