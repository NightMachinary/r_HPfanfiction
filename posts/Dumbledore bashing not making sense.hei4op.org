Y'know, Dumbledore gets a lot of hate for his actions and his manipulations, but, at the end of the day, did it work? Yes. Did pretty much every student at Hogwarts survive? Yes. Does Draco turn out to not be the worst person in history? Yes. Even if you want to stretch his actions to seem incompetent, he still got it done.


** I think most of the blame for Dumbledore actions/inaction could be fairly put on Ms Rowling's shoulders. Her worldbuilding is oriented only as much it carries her story, when she doesn't need it, she left horrible holes which are inexplicable in-universe without some horrible inconsistencies on side of many actors. E.g., just out of the top of my head: there is no reason in the world why Chief Justice couldn't order of somebody who was thrown for twelve years in jail without trial. And burden of proof is on the side of the prosecutors not on the defendant. There is no explanation for this in-universe, but Ms Rowling just wanted to have Sirius locked in Grimmauld Place until he went a wee bit crazy.

*** Why would he go on a crusade with the whole rest of the government though? And that for someone who CONFESSED to his crimes, for which he was caught almost red handed ? Even Bellatrix had more chance for an appeal because she didn't hang around at the scene of her crime for gods sake. In Sirius' case there was zero ambiguity, many witnesses, confession, perpetrator caught at the scene of the crime. Also remember it was basically martial law then, with the war still ongoing. Sirius was extreamly lucky to not have been executed then, when he was believed (I don't why, but it's cannon so...) that he was LV's right hand man.

******* I'm not quite sure why you're bringing up veritaserum, but I was more referencing the confundus and more importantly the Imperius, which we know Death Eaters used.

I'm making assumptions about the existence of potions, but love potions exist so other kinds of mind control potions aren't impossible.

The big point however is that there are many many things that can make Sirius appear guilty while being innocent and so a trial is important as it allows for soberly looking at the evidence and making sure Sirius is not compromised. And veritaserum doesn't fall in this category.

EDIT: Though given all the magical things that obscure things I'm not sure how you can charge someone to the level of no reasonable doubt without veritaserum, since the polyjuice potion exists. And likely other things that make it hard to prove that it's the person being accused is actually the perpetrator.

EDIT 2: Though seeing your other responses we agree on the necessity of the trial. I'm loving all the info on legal stuff btw.

****** Since at least early modern age (in Czech law since 16th century) it is held as a foundation of the legal criminal process that “/Confessio est non regina probationum/” (Confession is *not* the Queen of evidence), because the overwhelming stress on confession in the criminal process (held under the maxim opposite to this one), which was typical for the medieval process led to too many false confessions, forced confessions, and another miscarriages of justice.

**** I meant *after* Harry's third year of course. His cannon excuse was that he doesn't have enough solid evidence to prove Sirius' innocence. That is a two-fold nonsense: there is no way how to definitively prove innocence (alibi is proving impossibility not strictly speaking innocence), and thus all legal regimes since the beginning of the world are based on what the old Latin maxim states: “/semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit/” (“the necessity (or burden) of proof always [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law][lies with the person who lays charges]])”). Logically out of it comes the concept of /presumption of innocence/, which is kept by all civilized or even non-civilized legal regimes (including mostly Nazi Germany, excluding Stalin's Russia and probably current Northern Korea). Unless Sirius was /proven/ guilty in the trial, there was no legal reason for him to be in jail, and thus should be immediately released (and perhaps criminal investigation should be reopened).

There is no shade of evidence anywhere in the canon that there was any kind of plead agreement, just to the contrary (aside from nobody mentioning it, you also need a trial even for a plead agreement):

Plea deals happen /in the context of a trial/. The plea is step one of the trial, with step two being either case for the prosecution or sentencing depending on the plea.

(It's why suspects used to be tortured by pressing with weights to force them to enter a plea: with no plea, there was no trial.)

Sirius's complaint that he had no trial is fundamentally that he was not permitted to plead before the court /at all/, which a plea deal would have specifically required.

****** Not so much 'less common' as 'happen in a way that a US lawyer wouldn't recognise as a plea bargain.' There's a certain amount of haggling over what precisely goes on the indictment, which may or may not involve defence counsel saying what he can or can't 'persuade his client to hold his hand up to' and pointing out the relative chances of the prosecution making more serious charges stick.

Plea bargains therefore officially aren't a thing in the UK. Which is why I didn't spend several hours about thirty years ago in a stuffy Crown Court interview room not trying to sort out what definitely wasn't a plea bargain with a recalcitrant client whose sticking point wasn't the charge of reckless driving of the getaway car.

Since he was holding his hand up to, among other things, arson and robbery, I'm still not sure what his motivation for that was.

** Oh, boy you're poking at a hornets' nest.

Dumbledore is an excellent example of "the road to hell is paved with good intentions." Just because his plan worked doesn't mean his actions aren't easily twistable and occasionally reprehensible.

However, I will say Dumbledore isn't bashed all that much for his canon actions. Case in point: he doesn't want to leave it up to a baby. In fact, he tries his best to keep Harry out of it, which is the actual problem at hand.

Edit since we're here:

- Barty Crouch Sr, and the Council of Magical Law, was in charge of Death Eater trials. Not the Wizengamot, which we don't even know if Dumbledore was part of at the time. Sr is the reason Death Eaters were free.

- James told Dumbledore Sirius was his Secret Keeper. It was up to Barty Crouch Sr, Fudge, and all the Aurors on scene to check Sirius' wand.

- The curse on the DADA position is very much like Lily's sacrifice: magic caused by an action. Voldemort couldn't enter 4 Privet Drive. Bill Weasley, lmfao, wouldn't have been able to remove the DADA curse.

So he plays the, "just do as I say because I know best" card time after time, without ever telling anybody why.

And when he inevitably fucks up, because nobody is perfect and he's not as infallible as he thinks he is, he plays the "forgive an old man" card. He can't have it both ways.

And the biggest bullshit he ever spewed is when he tells Harry he kept things --- EVERYthing --- from him because he loved him too much.

Dumbledore is barely even a character in the first few books, he's basically just there to occasionally provide exposition, and as such I don't think it makes any sense to try to come up some motivation for any actions he doesn't take.

He didnt know about the horicruxs so I wont hold that against him but my argument is that his ENTIRE plan that decided if everyone he knew would live or die, was for harry to take care of it, even before he accidentally put the timer on his life. Like dont get me wrong his side won but the literal only actual "plan" that worked was a literal prophecy that voldemort himself made sure happened. The stone trap Voldemort easily broke in and Dumbledore was hoping that riddle would just sit there for another hour or so. The chamber of secrets, there plan was send a hat if someone decides to fix the problem, 3rd didnt have any sort of plan, neither did 4th, 5th was avoid harry and have snape teach him a thing. 6th was die via snape and hope no-one checked his corpse for the obvious signs of curse damage. And 7th was hope harry was jesus. We never see any sort of evidence that Dumbledore was planning ANYTHING else during these books. Dont get me wrong I have problems with Dumbledore's methods but I think he was a good person. I pretty much share your sentiment that he was a professor, not a leader or soldier but that doesnt mean his plans werent awful. It's easy to forgive the awful planning since he wouldnt even be the one making these plans if he didnt have such bad luck with men but nevertheless his plans were just flat out bad.

This is what Vernon said after they got back from the zoo. No meals plural: canonical proof that he was ABUSED by withholding of food. Having a child skip dinner is not abusive, but multiple meals in a row skipped IS.

Locked in the cupboard for DAYS at the minimum. Locking a child in a cupboard has not been acceptable since the Victorian age.

For your second point, yes his life was controlled by Dumbledore. His rightful guardians said he was not going to Hogwarts. Dumbledore sends Hagrid to BULLY them, KIDNAPPING Harry (who went willingly, but was still taken from his guardians by force). They get to Gringotts, and hey! Harry has an account that /Dumbledore had the key to/. By what right did he have this key? By what right did he withhold these funds from Harry's rightful guardians? (I'm not saying it was a good idea to give them access to the money, because they'd have stolen it all. But your argument is that Dumbledore didn't hold control Harry's life, which this shows that he did.)

Starting at the end of fourth year, Dumbledore insists that Harry go back to the Dursleys in the summer. His position as Headmaster in no way gives him that authority, nor do his other positions.

#+begin_quote
  ...Ron told Harry about a meeting Mrs Weasley had had with Dumbledore before going home.

  'She went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer,' he said. 'But he wants you to go back to the Dursleys, at least at first.'

  'Why?' said Harry.

  'She said Dumbledore's got his reasons,' said Ron, shaking his head darkly.
#+end_quote

After that point, not only does Dumbledore insist he go back every year, he stipulates how long Harry must stay, and where he's allowed to go other than that. He goes so far as to set guards to make sure Harry stays, and instructs them (and his friends) to keep Harry in the dark. He even kidnaps Hedwig to make sure Harry can't contact anybody.

Dumbledore controlling Harry's life is CANON, no matter how much his apologists try to whitewash it.

** Ultimately a lot of poor decisions were made by Dumbledore.

- Traveling to the Ministry via /broom/ when called away. This might be excusable in the first book, when other methods of long-distance transport hadn't been introduced yet, but this issue pops up again in later books.

- Knowingly leaving Harry in an abusive home for over a decade.

- Setting a trap for Voldemort in a /school for children/, putting it behind a door that a first year could unlock, and announcing it to the school(I wonder just how many students actually knew about Fluffy, at least, as the surest way to get a teenager to do something is telling them that they shouldn't).

- Never calling in a curse breaker to break the curse on Defense Against the Dark Arts.

- Never ensuring Sirius Black got a trial, he was Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot by the time Black broke out. And this probably speaks more to the corruption of the wizarding world than Dumbledore specifically, but both times summary execution pops up(Sirius Black, and Barty Crouch Jr.) no one bats an eye at the execution.

- Distancing himself from Harry when he /needed/ an authority figure in 5th year. His stated reason was to make Harry a less tempting target for Voldemort, but

- 

  - He's stated to be the only wizard Voldemort has ever been afraid of.

- 

  - Voldemort has been demonstrably obsessed with Harry Potter ever since Harry became the Boy-Who-lived.

- The Ministry Six beat the Order of the Phoenix to the Department of Mysteries, by at least an hour, despite flying from Scotland to London via thestral. With access to portkeys or floo, the Order should have been there much faster.

- Not using the post war anger to make sure known death eaters were sent to Azkaban to break the pureblood agenda's back.

  - He's Albus fucking Dumbledore, defeater of the last Dark Lord, and given the power of the boy-who-lived story, it should be an easy thing politically to force either veritaserum or political disbarment.
  - There was enough anger to throw Sirius in Azkaban for live without trial

- Not using the basilisk fiasco to ruin Lucius politically
- Leaving Malfoy free after he both managed to almost kill Ron/Katie and then tried to Crutacius Harry (the Sectumsemtura incident)

Pretty much, due to his hangups (Aria's death making him more passive/forgiving) and the writing of the story (The tone change from a children's story to a YA story and then the fact that Rowling didn't tie all the events of each book together, e.g., inventing things in later books that cause massive issues in earlier books), we're left with a Dumbledore that might be very competent/powerful in a personal capacity, but that's a terrible and ineffectual Leader of the Light.

**** During 3rd year is, as [[/u/Vercalos]] says, on Dumbledore for sure; however, I find it really unlikely that Dumbledore only became Chief Warlock post-1981 given his extreme age (he was 99/100 in 1981) and the fact that his claim to fame was Grindelwald which happened in 1945.

So I find it really unlikely that he wasn't Chief Warlock, but we also don't know since the books don't say one way or the other.

** Dumbledore sitting on his arse, sucking lemon drops, letting a child getting abused, and doing nothing for 10 years is IMHO totally BS.

Canon good guys only won through an atrocious amount of Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiats, Plot Armors, and multiple “Lucky Hero” tropes. Even then, the bad guys completely took over, carried out genocides against Muggleborns, murdered who knows how many Muggles, tortured hundreds of Hogwarts students with Cruciatus, and finally killed off another 50% of the good guys before losing to JKR's (Words of the God) many shenanigans.

Good guys had it best a Pyrrhic victory. It was just an awful cluster fuck.

And this is what should have happened when Harry turned himself in for executionn:

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort then strip searched Harry and performed a thorough Veritaserum and Legilimency interrogation on him.

  Voldemort: Hahaha, that's interesting! Dumbledore was indeed cunning, but you daft moron just blew his carefully crafted trap for me. Harry, do you believe I would just cast a killing curse at you? Do you believe I was really that incompetent as not to perform a full interrogation of you? But now, you have completely lost. Nothing will stop Lord Voldemort anymore!

  Voldemort: Rookwood!

  Rookwood: My lord?

  Voldemort: Dose this idiot with Draught of Living Death and lock him behind the strongest ward in your Department!

  Rookwood: Yes, my lord!

  Voldemort: My most faithful, the final victory is upon us. We shall now take the castle and crush their last pitiful resistance. You must kill Ronald Weasley and that mudblood whore Granger at all cost!

Do you see how retarded that whole plot was?

By throwing these kids to the wolves, by making them the frontline fighters against those sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums, the establishment of Wizarding Britain has created a whole generation of hardened and ruthless child soldiers.

They won a brutal victory against overwhelming odds, after experiencing unimaginable hardships and suffering, so don't ever expect them to go easy on their enemies. Even the Wizard Jesus can only take so much, and he will crucio any enemy who spits on his friends. His friends will be even less forgiving.

That was one huge cluster fuck.

This is D+D levels of subverting expectations. The reason Harry and Dumbledore do this (and tell Voldemort about the wand) is /because/ Voldemort is too arrogant to do everything you mentioned. It's a fatal flaw 7 books in the making.

Nevermind that Voldemort himself /cannot/ do any magic against Harry here and that Neville knows about the snake.

*** Is there evidence that Harry's friends will be less forgiving post-war? Draco almost killed Ron and Katie and was fine, Lucius avoided Azkaban even after planting the diary, helping execute the Department of Mysteries break in.

This is unpopular, but Harry's decision to snap the Elder wand makes more sense than flexing about to everyone in the Great Hall. Any surviving Death Eaters knows about the Elder wand allegiance and can simply kidnap Harry or his friends and torture them for information. And there's nothing the Order or Ministry can do about it, given the heavy casualties sustained.

Death Eater confirmed casualties

- Voldemort, Bellatrix, Peter

Order/Ministry confirmed casualties

- Snape, Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore, Scrimgeour, Amelia Bones, Emmeline Vance, Tonks

- unknown number of Aurors, leading to Ron and Harry being accepted into Auror Department as a result of heavy casualties

The Death Eaters got off light here. Yaxley, Dolohov, the Lestranges, Travers, Mulciber, Avery, Nott, Selwyn, none of them are confirmed killed. Anyone that survived can simply bide their time and strike back, given the weakened Ministry.

*** Ah, yes, my favorite. Trying to have Voldemort not just end the fucking fight right then. Definitely makes a good argument against Dumbledore not being the bad guy. As I said a couple minutes ago,

Ah, ok, so you expect a transfiguration professor turned headmaster to be able to kill a wraith? How? He was susceptible to the one horcrux, ended up dying to it, sacrificed his remaining health for the locket, and died for it, and tried to give Harry the support he needed in order to complete the task after he was dead. Dumbledore couldn't enter the chamber, got blocked at every turn by Malfoy and the Ministry, and had to hold three jobs. Like, Dumbledore didn't know that Voldemort was alive, no proof, but he did suspect it, and didn't know how, until the diary, and then he had other obligations, but once Voldemort returned he managed to get the number out of Slughorn, and start tracking them down. He didn't just leave it up to Harry, he died getting as far along as he could, trying to track down hidden artifacts.

JKR set it up so that no good guys were actually competent in the series. Mad-eye got beat in his house by a person who was under the imperius for years before just getting free, and a rat. Not a single auror did anything productive until the final fight, and even then it was the same ones who were in the Order to begin with.

*** The others I can understand, but number one - the Imperius curse, among other things, exist. Also interrogation, to see what else the supposed spy in Dumbledore's top secret vigilante group shared with the still free, still active Death Eaters, would've been smart. That one, I think, was just denial and relief. "War's over, sweep it all under the rug, let's forget about all the violence and terror that we inflicted on ourselves and get on with living enough that we can insulate these memories in our heads as best we can."

**** If you look at Harry's life, It has always led up to him dying at the right time. I understand having it as a back up plan, needs of the many and all that. But Harry was brought up specifically so that he would allow himself to be killed.

There are several parts in canon that prove that Dumbledore knew Harry was in danger. For example, he admitted that he knew that Quirrel was possessed by Voldemort. He knew that Voldemort was after harry and what he do? Nothing. He knew that a professor was actively trying to kill an eleven year old, potentially putting any number of students in harm's way. And still Dumbledore did nothing.

And that's just one example, so don't tell me Harry wasn't raised as a lamb to the slaughter.
