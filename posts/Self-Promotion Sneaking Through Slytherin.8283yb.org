** a little advice, if you so choose to take it: the formatting of the work makes it incredibly difficult to read. it's just one big block of text. double spacing would be a huge, huge help. otherwise, the content seems promising! best of luck.

**** not sure what word processor you are using, but don't most allow for a "select all" and double space option? it shouldn't take tons of time away from your schoolwork.

** I'm not gonna lie, this is pretty bad. It doesn't flow well at all, nothing really makes any sense, random caps-locks, and multiple other things make me immediately want to close out of the tab. My advice is to practice writing more, and maybe get someone to help you with flow and people talking.
