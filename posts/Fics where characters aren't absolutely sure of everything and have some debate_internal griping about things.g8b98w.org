[Apologies, the background/foundation of this request bit is quite long. If you want to ignore that, skip the two initial big paragraphs and just go right to the last one before the link.]

So, it's quite common in this fandom to be incredibly distinct in ones opinions and interpretations of near-everything in the series. Right or wrong, there's still enough there that we draw vastly diverse conclusions from the same events and character moments put into the same words. To some, Dumbledore is a useless, but ultimately well-meaning old man who's simply trying his best, to other's he's a Utilitarian Machiavelli-reborn who wants Harry married to Ginny and dead fighting Voldemort so he can steal all his money and keep the Wizarding world alive. Right or wrong, we all see events differently and there's no sure single accepted answer on anything. We see this all the time in the fandom.

But we rarely see it in fics.

Harry always seems to be absolutely sure Machiavellian!Dumbledore is evil or Snape is good or Draco's arse looks really perky in those leather pants we so often dress him in. I don't think I've seen more than a handful of fics (Scienra Cwena, for instance, link below) where characters have disagreed or debated or just been unsure about their interpretations of events and people. Harry rarely gripes and rationalises about how "Dumbledore can't have been a monster like that! He can't have known they locked me in a cupboard and tried to hit me with a pan that one time! Look how he was trying to cheer up Hagrid on his own, or how he verbally bitchslapped Lucius that one time." and so on.

So, I'm looking for more fics like that. Fics where the Protagonist isn't so sure about things being Black or White, even if things totally are. If Dumbledore is a villain, fine, but I'd like for Harry not to immediately accept that in the first five minutes and actually have some internal quibble about things or have multiple characters take different views that they debate like we do in the fandom. Is Dumbledore really evil? Is Snape really a hero? Is Draco's Arse really worth dealing with him /being/ one? YMMV, and I'd like Harry's to as well. :)

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

*** Heh. It's not the first time tech and I have been at odds. Took me months to stop my phone's autocorrect from changing the name of my hometown to a body part. :D

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13342558/1/Outrages-So-Hideous][Outrages-So-Hideous]] has this with Ron having doubts about Harry. If I say any more I will start giving spoilers. It is really good fic that you should read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning-to-the-Start]] has this with Hermione in regards to Harry after she finds something about Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12235646/2/Harry-Potter-and-the-Last-Chance-Deleted-Scenes][Harry-Potter-and-the-Last-Chance-Deleted-Scenes]] features how Dumbledore's perspective slowly changes as the story continues.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]] Face Death in the hope and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12402654/chapters/28221378]] Men of War has Harry struggling with his view of Dumbledore.

Hope you like them.

*** Interesting bunch. I've only read the Last Chance one (the main fic was fun), but a quick glance at the rest and they all seem interesting. Face Death and Men of War, particularly so. Thanks for the recs, HHrPie! :)
