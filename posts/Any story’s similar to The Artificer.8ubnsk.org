Like the title says I recently read the five chapters of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9874294/5/The-Artificer][The Artificer]] and really quite liked the idea, unfortunately it hasn't been updated since 2013. So any story's with similar elements?

  Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.
