So i opened the new story by Robst. Proud Parents i believe the name is. I have to say he is not my favorite writer if anything i think Harry Crow would be my favorite and it is not even that great imo. But this new one feels so forced and rushed. Then if you look at the comments there is everyone praising him for it. It is almost like they are walking softly or something. So tell me your thoughts if you have looked at his new work. If you want to call it that.

  He's no Rakeesh or /Perspicacity/ or Taure or Starfox5 or White Squirrel.

I should hope not, m'lady. There's no room in our bed for a third, even if he has a spiffy fedora to tip.

Uhm excuse me? I've read a bunch of his stories and that one is easily the worst and most ridiculous one. It's as if someone was trying to write a crack!fic but forgot to put in the punch lines

*** While i can agree with that. It at least covers more than 5 seconds of Harry's life. Like i said its not the best. But atleast in that whole aspect it showed Harry training while he was already supposedly op. He did at least try to give life to the world. Failed yes, but tried.
