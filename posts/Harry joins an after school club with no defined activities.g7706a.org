:END:
Every 8 months I want to read this fic and can't find it again, I remember Ron and Hermione didn't join because there was studying and poker. It takes place over Harry's 7 years, All 4 houses join and Harry eventually becomes president. Other members include Lavender and Parvati.

*** Does it have any mirrors, do you know? I don't quite fancy making a new account just for one story, even if it does sound somewhat interesting.

** I remember the story and several scenes but I'm having trouble finding it again. It's a club that starts in first year and at the first meeting harry goes with hermione. She doesn't stay with it because it's so unstructured. Harry sticks with it and it isn't until the 3rd or fourth meeting that the club gains structure. I think a vicki or Victoria leads it.

It becomes a Harry/Astoria story as the girls in the club (who come from all houses) decides that they need to be together. I remember that Harry has a picnic with the greengrasses and he has Sirius show up with astoria's favorite chocolate.

At one point Harry has Lucius Malfoy come into the school (Malfoy has a squib daughter) to test an idea he has that squibs can make potions and carve runes. Draco gets pulled up and fails miserably. Harry then helps Lucius' daughter through the steps to make the potion and then to carve runes.

Lucius then asks Harry for tutoring for his daughter and other pureblood squib children. Lucius turns against Voldemort and even sets up Bellatrix to be killed by his house's protective charms/wards.

Oh every year harry keeps trying to get Hermione to join but she refuses. Then she finds out that for the last couple of years the Headboy and girl are all members of the club.

The last scene has Draco spouting off loyalty to voldemort and Parkinson Sr obliviates or imperio's him

And with all that I can't remember the name of the fic or find it in the searches I'm doing.

**** That's it. Thanks.

It seems I have it as an epub document and the normal window file search doesn't look at the contents of epub documents.

Anyone have a recommendation for a search that can examine the contents of epub documents that works with windows 10?

***** I knew I'd read it recently online, searched Harry Potter fanfiction "study club" and it was on the first few pages. I don't have many epubs though so can't tell ya on that.

****** Actually it looks like i just had to go into windows and change the indexing option for .epub files to include content. Of course I now have to wait for the computer to completely reindex everything.

Thanks again for finding the story. I knew immediately what the OP was looking for but just couldn't remember the name of the fic.
