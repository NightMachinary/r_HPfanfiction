Right in the middle of reading a fic and boom can't access the next chapter.


** and that's why i try to download a copy of the fic through calibre once i'm sure i like it. got burned a few times due to incidents like that, or the author suddenly deciding to take the story down right when i was in the middle of reading it.

** Working for me right now. May have been a brief outage. Guess we need to make a portkey archive archive!
