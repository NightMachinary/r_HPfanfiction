by good i mean a decently written story with zero to little tropes. I don't mind much of the plot as long as it makes sense or coherent and no dimensional/time-travels.

I prefer the fic to have adult themes(violence, moral dilemma, smut etc) because i can never imagine vampires being anything below rated R. Also if the story has romance and/or main pairing, no slashes.

maybe something like [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=5185&chapterid=&agree=1][Forever Knight]] but a less emphasis on the romance and more concentration on the vampire stuff.

** linkao3(Sanguis Reatus by Hecate's Kiss)

linkffn(The Bloodmoon Rises by Fulminanz)

I'm not sure how good they are, but relative to a lot of vampire fics they're very readable. Bloodmoon is Hermione centric.

  Voldemort had not only sent his Death Eaters to the Ministry, but vampires as well. Hermione and Harry fall to them and find themselves in new, undead lives. While Harry struggles to remain human, Hermione becomes what was believed dead long ago. She becomes a Countess, an heir to Dracula. Unfortunatly, there are no books on that. Vampire!Hermione/Harry, Dark!Hermione Dark!Harry

  Due to a botched ritual on the longest night of the year, Harry has become something unheard of in the wizarding world - a living vampire. Harry must now determine how to kill Tom Riddle, avoid a meddling Headmaster, and keep from going into blood lust all while dealing with a typical school year. And he can't seem to keep from watching his Defense Professor. He's not certain if it's just for the blood, or something more. Merlin help him.

** It will never be finished and I can't remember it well enough to vouch for it, but I'll throw it into the mix on the hope of keeping the convo alive :f

Blood and Chocolate: linkffn(5313484)- definitely a few tropes (hopefully the fun ones that you can stand that help the storytellying along?), H/G, incomplete

** I've written four, but they range in quality from unfinished and bad, to unfinished and terrible. They mostly follow Stoker rules, rather than shiny twilight nonsense rules, so that's a plus I guess.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4882920/1/Lemon-Drops-and-Blood-Pops]] Albus/harry time travel. He's a half-vampire. Vampires are hedonistic and sadism filled. Pretty good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4843070/1/Gives-You-Hell]] Albus and harry are some of the first vamps in twilight. Pretty decent writing if you can stomach Harry/Edward and the faerie-like vampire portrayal of Twilight
