** please let me know if i'm overstepping with the constructive criticism or anywhere else!

the voice you have for ebony is well done. it definitely feels similar to the author's voice in the original. it's sort of manic and rambly and self-conscious, like a real teenager starting a journal for the first time. it fits the epistolary format of the story you're doing, and it interprets the original story in a way that makes it make more sense.

on the flip side, the way it's written seems self-conscious and overly aware of what it's doing. it's pretty clear you set out with the goal of "fix my immortal," and i'd say you focus too much on fitting in all the details of the original story and making explanations to fit them in a more realistic setting. in an epistolary format like the one you're using, it can be difficult to "show don't tell," so it's understandable when the explanations feel kind of forced, but it's still a problem. this is closely linked with another element of your story so far; we're constantly reading an uninterrupted monologue, and especially with the kind of character ebony is it gets tiring/overwhelming.

if i were you, i would try to mix in other perspectives on the world of the story. maybe we switch back and forth to a more traditional format and follow ebony around throughout her days to get more of a grounding in time and reality. alternatively, maybe we read the journals/letters of her friends as well.

by the way, the journal format is a really good idea for conveying the sort of "biased" feeling of the original; the feeling that we're only seeing one (weird, twisted) view of the story and from a narrator who really wants to portray herself positively at all costs. i wouldn't have thought to make that format choice!

even if you don't continue or finish this, i'm glad you posted it! cause it's a pretty fun take on a fascinating artifact of fandom history, and it really got the gears turning in my head.

*** Woah, thank you for the awesome reply! I don't think you can overstep with constructive criticism - and what you've given is great! I wasn't planning on telling the story through more traditional means, but now I definitely will, whem Ebony is finished introducing "her" world.

As an adpiring writer, the positive comments made me feel really good, so thank you for that too! :D

*** I agree with the journal format being the best device for description based upon Ebony's narcissism. My feedback is that she isn't narcissistic enough at all. Tara wrote this fic in a story narrative so it justifies opening with a thick description of Ebony. But Ebony presumably already knows who she is so the opening description can be littered throughout.

And it needs to be punchy and irreverent. She's a self obsessed teen and a Mary sue... Bold, rash and filled with hormones.

She might write:

October 11th

I fucking hate Lavendar Brown! That stupid prep was starring at me when Draco came up to me today. If she wasn't there with her band of preps, it would have made it perfect when Draco said hi to me in the perfect weather. It was raining and snowing! I'm such a goff, I love it when it rains and snows. It reminds me of the song lyric from Good Charlotte's (enter some lyric here I have no clue).

I fink Draco likes me. I looked really good today as I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it, a black mini skirt (etc etc). I think lavender mucst be jealous of me because I'm a vampire and I have long black hair that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears.

And I'm a vampire!

A/N: spelling mistakes intentional

Having said all that: I commend your goal and I look forward to reading it.

**** This is the main issue I've encountered when writing this - how true do I stick to the source material? That was such a fundamental thing to decide for Ebony - do I keep her as irritating and narcissistic, or try to write her into a somewhat likable character? I decided to take the second route, so that anyone who decides to read it could root for her as a protagonist. That being said, I did try to make her rambly and somewhat flawed to capture some of the original traits of her character. I do understand where you're coming from though - does my explanation of how I've decided to write it make more sense?

Actually, when it starts getting to the smut, even like this I might change my mind.
