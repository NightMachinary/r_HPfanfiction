So I've been giving fem!Harry and 'reincarnated as a girl'!Harry stories a try recently and I've encountered a recurring theme where Harry is trying to get a grip on menstruation. While it is a legitimate hook for angst/funny/coming-of-age type stuff, I'm completely at a loss to understand the recurring theme where Harry, in his new female body, is struggling with muggle feminine Sanitary products.

They simply don't use anything muggle in Wizarding Britain. Medicine, transportation, housework, leisure - Wizards and witches use magic or a magical device for everything. EVERYTHING. It's really jarring for me when I read a fic where female Slytherin Harry has started her period and she goes to Snape for a package of Always tampons.

Wizards and witches Use. Spells. For. Everything. I can't imagine Hermione Granger, the brightest Witch of her age, bothering with tampons or pads when she can just point a wand at her abdomen and say 'menstruum arrestum'. There's a potion that regrows your fucking bones. Contraceptive potions and spells are heavily represented in the Fanon, so why wouldn't there be spells or potions that deal with Aunt Flo?

The term 'simp' is usually used for a guy who does anything for a girl in order to get inside her panties, but once he learns that pussy is not a reward he moves on... maybe even insults the girl. I think Snape, even if at some point had romantic feelings for Lily and he is also quite creepy, genuinely cared about her as a friend. He spends the rest of his life atoning for the sin that he was accomplice to her death and does this without anyone (except Dumbledore) knowing - even going as far as being hated by everyone towards the end of his life.

And aside from the general argument that the kid looks like his father... there are many things to be said about it, such as the fact that Voldemort could penetrate the minds of his servants and if he saw Snape treating Harry well there would be consequences. Not to mention that Voldemort could also see through Harry's mind. Also, in before, in HPB the connection is broken... Snape doesn't shit on Harry's work in DADA. He is annoyed by the fact that he acts disrespectful towards a professor and almost kills a fellow colleague, easily lies about it and then he doesn't show any remorse. Even if you were the loving parent of such a brat, you would not tolerate such a behavior.

Don't get me wrong, Snape is a foul, vindictive and nasty character but I don't think he falls in the category of what we call nowadays 'simps' or 'incels'... not from the book description anyways.

** Even if the younger years might not have the ability to be casting spells directed at their reproductive organs, I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination that enchanted underwear would be easily accessible (or super easily cast) and leagues more practical/hygienic/straightforward than muggle sanitary products. I really like how it's addressed in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847/chapters/18163144][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] where the author has an older witch explain 'domestic' and 'female' charms to Hermione, among them spells to better deal with periods. It's addressed in a very realistic way considering the world building, as one of the comments is that witches are weary of using products they haven't enchanted themselves as unsavoury types may use their blood for magical rituals when it is "vanished".

**** I mean, it's just not true that wizards and witches /use/ spells for everything. They still brush their teeth with toothbrushes. They still have showers rather than cleaning themselves magically. They still shave with razor blades. They still do laundry. They light their houses with fire, not Lumos charms.

The overwhelming evidence of canon is that wizards typically use physical objects to perform day to day tasks rather than using spells to directly achieve the end result. The difference is those objects are enchanted. Maybe the shower is enchanted to be the right temperature, and maybe the razor blade is animated so that it shaves you itself. But they're not just using spells to go /zap/ and achieve the end result.

In fanfiction, sure, you can make new stuff up. But let's not confuse that with canon. And let's not pretend that it would fit tonally with canon either - the aesthetic of wizarding society is not some sci-fi universe, nor is it high fantasy.

And I quite like it that way. This will probably result in my being called a boomer again, but I think there is a certain comfort in a well-made object. In our world of disposable fast fashion and vegetables that come wrapped in two layers of plastic, there is great attraction for me in the idea of the simpler life. Objects that are built to last rather than be thrown away after a single use. Vegetables that you've grown yourself. A fire which brings not just light and heat, but also atmosphere and the feeling of being home.

As Muggles, there are many good reasons why we don't use fires anymore. They're fiddly to start. They make a mess. They create carbon emissions. They're difficult to regulate and you can easily get too hot.

But with magic, you can have the benefits without the drawbacks. And once you can do that, I think the "traditional" option is just superior to the "modern" one. Why would wizards stick a Lumos charm in the ceiling like a magical light bulb, when they could have a cosy, instant-start, no-mess, magically regulated fire burning happily in the hearth? Why would they use a spell to wash, thereby robbing themselves of the relaxing, mind-clearing ritual of water?

*All that said:* with respect to periods, in VP I simply have the girls take a potion each full moon. So long as they take the potion, they don't get periods.

***** Nail on the head. I've had an essay stewing in my mind for a while about how wand casting magic is single threaded -- you only cast one spell at a time. From a user experience perspective, when you think of a wand as basically a souped up multi-tool/smartphone for this analysis, that sucks. The natural inclination and solution is to enchant things to have features and functions instead of relying on charms constantly. And you're totally right: there's a significant satisfaction (and market) with objects that do things.

Why cast a warming charm when clothes would most likely be already enchanted to keep your temperature regulated? That should be the default for all clothing, not just high end stuff.

Similarly, why couldn't undergarments be enchanted to vanish bodily fluids on contact. Take a potion for the cramps and balancing the hormones, sure, but the process of menstruation itself is very natural and unlikely to be messed with directly. They'd more likely just make it more convenient.

I actually have my AU set up where women's magical resonance fluctuates with their cycles (based off hormone levels). So they wouldn't want to completely remove periods. But that's just the direction I went with mine.

******** *Maintaining multiple spells simultaneously*

I feel like this is too innumerable to count. Flitwick levitating hundreds of ornaments at Christmas time. Neville remaining petrified while the trio completed the 3rd corridor tasks in PS. Any time anyone casts a protective charm then goes on to cast other spells from within its protection. Casting spells while dissilusioned.

I can't think of any example of a spell failing because a wizard then went on to cast a different spell. The fact that spells stay in effect once you've cast them is kinda the basis of their whole society. And the system you're proposing, where wizards use lots of objects with spells on them, relies on this exact fact. A charm on an object is still just a charm; if casting another spell cancelled the previous charm you had cast, that would include charms you had cast on objects.

*Casting multiple spells simultaneously*

This is rarer. The most obvious example is Harry casting 3 stunners at once in DH, where he is holding 3 wands. That's a pretty limited and specific example, but it shows that it's possible in theory to cast multiple spells simultaneously.

I don't think it's limited to situations where you are holding multiple wands, however. I'm fairly sure Dumbledore's animation of the statues in OotP must have involved numerous spells at once: one, to bring them to life, a second, to direct them to follow his will (we see in HBP that Hermione uses a separate spell to direct the birds she has conjured), a third, to strengthen/shield them (Bellatrix's spells bounce off them after Dumbledore animated them, where a moment before, when confronting Harry, she had blown off a statue's head with a single spell). So I think Dumbledore cast 3 spells on 3 different statues with a single wave of his (single) wand.

********* Ah, right, so what I meant by single threaded was the second category there. My understanding (or implementation) is that once most spells are cast, they don't require sustained magical concentration, and you're free to cast another. Some spells like the Patronus might differ, and wouldn't allow you to cast another spell until you stop the patronus.

The multiple wands instance is a good counter example, as far as canon goes. It seems an extreme outlier, though, and if it didn't have some kind of significant drawback I think you'd see wizards dual-weilding all the time, instead of never.

The Dumbledore instance could be interpreted many different ways. I always thought of it in a similar fashion to the duel between McGonagall and Snape with the rapid fire free transfiguration. After a certain degree of skill and experience it appears that you transcend individual spells and bend reality directly.

My main line of thought on this subject is thinking about tactics in combat. Tempo is huge in combat, whether in martial arts, swordplay, MtG, chess, whatever, so determining the rate at which someone can effectively cast spells is fundamental.

***** my favourite take on magic is in the dingy corners of diagon ally, the unused classrooms of hogwarts, the weasley home in general. These places bring normalcy to magic that makes it so attractive to me. Not that magic is'nt this new discovery for a bright-eyed muggleborn entering a new world, but that it's also a well worn and old part of some other witch or wizard's life.

The older more careworn look make sense to me because it puts forth an impression of what I imagine magic would do to people's priorities. Maybe it's a look that's characterized by the wizarding world shuffling into the shadows, but that's not as whimsical for me.

I pine for the weasley house, though. To me it reads like a house held together by intention and magic. There's a homeliness inherent to a building that seemed to grow ramshackle for their needs. Where magic isn't used to negate every concern and worry. Where magic works hand in hand with time and effort. Where a mother's and father's love and care for their children builds an impossible house even as they struggle with poverty.

I just had to pull this comment out, and say, /everybody/. Look at the muggle world - in the UK, women have had to pay an additional tax on sanitary products because they're considered a 'luxury', a tax which has only been abolished in this year's budget (after a LOT of lobbying/protesting). Period poverty is a genuine thing experienced by many women. Girls across the globe have to miss school because of their periods. Realistically, I don't see why wizarding Britain and Hogwarts in particular (which seems to prefer to turn a blind eye to student safety and support anyway) would be any different.

That being said, it's not particularly something I'd like to read about in a fic and it amuses me that fem!Harry dealing with her period is so common that it appears to be a trope!

**** Tl;dr: Thank you for this ride, I have never put so much thought into wizarding menstrual cycles before.

Feminine hygiene (and women's health in general) is under researched in the muggle world, so I can easily imagine that it would be in the wizarding world too.

I think the problem with a spell or potion is that you would come against the problem of side effects. Yes, wizards can regrow bones but it's extremely painful.

Also, what interactions would a period potion contraindict? Could taking such a potion only be necessary for cases like PCOS and endrometriosis where pain and significant health problems balance out, say, not being able to have grapefruits, hair or life saving potions? (Grapefruits interacts with many muggle medications.)

Does the potion itself cause side effects, perhaps headaches, stomach aches, mood changes, extra spots, a slightly green tinge, etc? Perhaps long term effects - hormone development (do you need a fixed quantity, would it be too changeable in teens) or can long term side effects occur if you take it too young?

Do you need to vary the dose or take it at particular times in the cycle? Under 16s generally have a settling in period with periods. As much as the idea of taking it at the full moon (a suggestion downthread) sounds highly convenient it doesn't match up which are typically far longer than the adult cycles. Even in adults, healthy cycles can be from 21-40 days. So if you're a teen who doesn't have or know the pattern yet, you'd be a bit fucked with a potion.

In the muggle world, a serious consideration for giving under 16s the pill is whether they are reliable enough to take the pill regularly. Teens are developmentally the same in both worlds so it strikes me that Madam Pomfrey/St Mungos might not prescribe potions to young people.

As for spells, well, the pre-OWL years mostly focus on spells on objects. For example, the Cheering Charm is an OWL level charm. Eloise Midgen, on the other hand, tried removing her spots without the experience and ability required and had to have her nose reattached, leaving it permanently off centre. If I remember correctly, the staff weren't very impressed about it.

On this basis, it seems to me that spelling periods away would be (at the earliest) a NEWT level skills with most women unable or wary of performing it. Potentially, it could even be something taught during Healer training and akin to a hysterectomy.

Since muggle products aren't electric, they shouldn't interfere with Hogwarts and therefore could easily be used by muggleborns who trust them more. There's also the fact that Hogwarts uses toilets and (as far as we know) toilet paper as well as baths and showers which seem to have a few special effects rather than being fundamentally different to muggle items. So at some point, muggle hygiene practices integrated with the wizarding world.

I can imagine that spelled products would be popular - for example a fabric pad (of sorts) which stops blood spilling onto clothes, but either sufficiently absorbs or vanishes (perhaps one variety is more expensive than the other) the flow. Given that wizards previously shat on the floor and vanished it rather than simply bespelled it out of them, this makes more sense to me.

Potentially something akin to a moon cup, for those who are less squeamish but don't don't enjoy the transit process from body to pad?

** Women have been dealing with menstruation for thousands of years, without using modern tampons. I don't necessarily agree that there's a spell that just eliminates the whole process, but there's certain to be some form of dealing with it available in the magical world. In keeping with the rest of the world building, it's probably something old-fashioned in form, but with either an enchantment or the use of simple spells (e.g. scourgify) to make it as useful and safe as a modern Muggle tampon. I'm not sure exactly what that would be (or how disgusting or unpleasant it might seem), but I agree that the idea of going to a teacher for Muggle goods is ludicrous.

*** Tampons, as a concept, are over three thousand years old. And that age is just what we can prove (Ancient Egyptians made them out of papyrus). I'm sure magical ones don't come with a plastic applicator, but them using something very similar to a modern tampon isn't impossible at all.

**** This is essentially what I'm getting at. Historically women would have used something similar in concept, but different in materials and overall appearance. Or maybe there were other historical techniques that approached it slightly differently, I don't know. The point is the magical version's might not look like your pure white manufactured bullet, and certainly not made of rayon. Probably whatever was common in the 18th and 19th centuries, but with more magic.

Though one just directly using a magical plant is actually a good idea

But at least the sentence structure was fine, the plot held itself together, the curse breaking parts were interesting (as a fan of bloodborn and the souls games). It was a good distraction from the myriads of broken English, plot holes bigger than the original series plot holes, incomplete, abandoned, and otherwise impossible to read eye-cancers that ooze out of FFN and AO3

Meanwhile the boys are told nothing so they have to learn about life from their parents and each other. One dreads to think what poor Neville thinks is going on. I imagine Hannah having to get be him a crash course in female anatomy.

** I don't really know why it has to be addressed at all. I don't care how wizards deal with their poop, if their toilets just vanish it or if they've got a variant of whatever charm Lockhart used to vanish Harry's bones so they can vanish waste straight out of their colons, or if their toilets are magically (or non-magically) connected to the Muggle sewage system, or even if they just dump everything into the Lake. It really isn't relevant to character development or the plot, so you can think of whatever solution you want.

*** Hogwarts has toilets in canon, if only so they can get smashed up by Trolls or have a thousand-year-old Basilisk hiding in a secret tunnel behind the sink. Presumably the average toilet actually gets used and it's just kinda wired up to the wizard equivalent of a septic-tank.

That said, agreed. Unless it's actually super-relevant to the character or plot, just don't mention the unmentionables.

** I wouldn't necessarily say that there's a spell to outright stop menstruation, as that would come with its own pitfalls, but rather something that automatically vanishes the, er, mess somewhere along the way.

It /periodically/ vanishes it for as long as the spell is in use, I'd say. This also allows for greater opportunity for witches to go commando beneath their plain black robes whenever they want, just like the boys. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Magic is the great equaliser, yeah.

** I agreeeeee, in my headcanon, they must have potions to just not have you period, but just like taking muggle anti baby pills without pause, they still do mess up your hormones. so a lot of girls/women take different approach. spells to vanish it right when it's leaving, or underwear that takes it in and you just wash it afterwards. hell, even muggles have such underwear. the magical type would be just slimmer, basically just a normal one with a spell on it.

the reason why I don't believe they would use muggle products are quills. so they use quills instead of pens. do you really think they would take pads and tampons from the muggle world? most wizards don't even know how to dress muggle. and yes, there are muggleborns, but conventional pads only existed for what, a hundred years? you would think witches would find a way by then already.

*** Wizards use the Hogwarts Express, which is a locomotive that only goes back and forth to the magical Village which is right next to their magical School. Wizards are seen using a single train to get back and forth to and from a magical destination.

The only car we ever see them using in the series is the Ford Anglia that is INVISIBLE TO MUGGLES AND ENCHANTED TO FLY.

The Knight Bus is a double decker Style bus, but its resemblance to muggle Transportation stops there.

When we see those pots in Molly's kitchen, they are washing themselves. Normal pots do not do that.

The clock in the Weasleys home isn't actually a clock; it's a dial that magically tells where every member of the family is and what they're up to.

Look I get it. Certain things in the Wizarding World seem mundane on the surface. However everything that Wizards and witches come into contact with gets touched by magic. Can you imagine the Ford Anglia being completely mundane, or the Knight Bus just being a regular muggle bus, or the Hogwarts Express just being another part of the British Rail System that only goes back and forth to Hogsmeade?

The Wizarding World has a sense of Wonder attached to it. Wizards using strictly muggle products and muggle items blows up my suspension of disbelief. The muggle-borns have a little wiggle room with this but even something as boring as cellophane tape had to be repurposed into spellotape. I'm assuming feminine hygiene would be handled by spells or potions but honestly I wouldn't mind If madam Pomfrey pulled out a packet of any of the magical Sanitary products which have been mentioned above; I do mind if it just says Tampax on the tin. It's not magical. It's lazy.
