One of the big issues I have is kids not acting like kids in fanfiction (kids talking about political alliances, marriage pacts, etc.; when I was 11, I cared about Dragonball Z, not who I needed to marry to secure a critical trade deal against my rivals in Magical Congress). So I was thinking... Are there any fics that age everyone up to a more appropriate age for adult themes and content? Kinda like the Magicians. So basically, instead of Hogwarts being the equivalent of early education, it's basically college for wizards.


** Not quite college-aged, but older: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300/1/Black-Luminary][/Black Luminary/]] has students start Hogwarts at 14.

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

** These kind of stories are always shit, because it makes zero sense if you think about it for more than 3 seconds: Just one example... How do purebloods function? Do they just get home-schooled until they are adults and do nothing else that has anything to do with their wizarding heritage (JKRs version that they do fuck-all until they are 11 is already bad enough)? How many muggleborn would actually ditch their old life as adults? If Harry attends Hogwarts at 19 instead of 11, does that mean Voldemort tried to steal the Philosopher's Stone 8 years ago? Was there a Triwizard 4 years ago? Etc. etc...

It's just a bad idea, unless you throw everything from canon out the window and should just read The Name of the Wind instead.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.
