Is there any stories out there with Harry being a pureblood with him hating muggles or at least not being evil/racist?


** Only have seen those in fics with blood adoption involved really.

** What's your definition of pureblood? Legal or biological? In "Patron", Harry is legally a pureblood, but biologically the son of James and Lily. "Pureblood" and "Muggleborn" are purely legal definitions there though.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

** I would really like to find a story where Harry is biologically a pureblood. I just think it might be an interesting setup.

** Since there are so few responses, does that imply that that aren't any stories where Harry is a biological pureblood?
