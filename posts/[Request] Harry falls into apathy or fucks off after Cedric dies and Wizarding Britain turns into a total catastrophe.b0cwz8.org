  I know there's that one where Harry gets all paranoid b/c he doesn't realize his guard is from the Order of the Phoenix and he hides his identity in a Fidelius using a random muggle, and in the end Dumbledore has to win the war single-handedly.

** I guess linkffn(11916243) is not enough apathetic for your taste, right? Harry & Hermione get away from England just by Eurostar. BTW, that's one thing which I don't see investigated much, in stories like linkffn(12181042) people are running away with complicated Portkeys and heroism; is it necessary, would Lucius Malfoy really know what to do at Heathrow? Quasi-sequel linkffn(12373273) just have Percy and Audrey sit on BA plane and fly to Prague [sic; that's where I live ;)] for the weekend. Would really Dolores Umbridge know how the plane stays in the air?

** I don't think these quite fit what you want for various reasons, but they're the closest I can think of. Apologies if I've forgotten any contain annoying helpful Goblins.

/The Sniper/ linkffn(3918135) Definitely my favorite of this sort of stoy. Harry takes off after he loses his trial in OoTP. Has a decent short sequel.

/Harry's Had Enough/ linkffn(7573003) Pretty angsty Harry during OoTP. Has a sequel (/Damn Wizards/) with Harry as Prime Minister of Muggle Britain.

/Weary Wizard/ linkffn(10300874). Eh. Rather predictable but angsty Harry in OoTP leaving wizarding Britain forever. Lots of cliches, but a decent time-waster without challenging characters.

​

/Extradition Challenges/ linkffn(11936172) This one really stretches your request (e.g., it's set before the Tournament starts), but I think it's possible you'll enjoy it, so I'm including it.

Another one that obviously stretches your request and honestly doesn't quite fit it is /Screw Them!/ linkffn(10322302) a pretty trope-y version of the 'Harry is mistreated because of the Parselmouth incident and leaves the wizarding world' cliche. There's a longer sequel.

/To Become a Muggle/ linkffn(5866364). I don't care for this story, but it has Harry "leaving" the wizarding world the summer after GoF. But he doesn't exactly leave...Lots of cringe-worthy tropes (e.g., ridiculously stupid and evil Dumbledore).

**** Yeah I started reading "To Become a Muggle" and dropped it in short order. Like so many fics that start with interesting premises, it rapidly devolved into boring fix-fic territory. Maybe it got good later, but after a coupla tens of thousands of words, it was still dull, conflict-less fix-fic nonsense.
