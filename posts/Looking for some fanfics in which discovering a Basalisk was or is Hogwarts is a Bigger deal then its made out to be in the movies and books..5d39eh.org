  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** Selling off the Basilisk corpse would net a lots of Galleons for Harry, Ron, and its victims.

Some fics picked on that, went way overboard, and made them all instant millionaires.

I like how [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] handled that issue. Both fics still have its slayers selling its parts off and make some money. *Delenda Est* further considered the effect of dumping too many Basilisk parts at once on the market and the risk of tipping Voldemort off. *The Accidental Animagus* let the proceeds be split evenly among Harry, Neville, and all its victims. They even found the last remaining relative of Myrtle Warren, and they cleared Hagrid's name.

** The Basilisk matter really gets out of hand in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]].

It's a heavily AU with a Slytherin Harry who have a twin who was raised with their parents. Contrary to what you my expect it's decent. The fic is held down, by using quite a few bad ideas in worldbuilding (some are the cliches, because author likes to toy with them, some are original), and technical problems with starting chapters but the plot is strong enough to warrant the read. Ongoing with regular updates.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** I think what they mean is that in most fics and canon the attitude after finding the Chamber of Secrets and killing the basilisk is "Yeah great now we won't be in danger anymore time to move on."

In other fics however finding the chamber usually leads to finding a picture of one or more of the founders of Hogwarts, Harry becoming all knowing and more powerful, and suddenly Salazar Slytherin speaks out about Voldemort and blood purity.

*** Just imagine what would happen if the Basilisk entered the great hall during dinner, that's the end of the entire generation of magical humans in Great Britain, atleast. The heirs to lots of important families, now dead. I think Harry should get more for it the a pat on the back. He didn't even make any money in cannon.
