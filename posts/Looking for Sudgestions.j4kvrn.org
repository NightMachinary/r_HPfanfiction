Hey guys, looking for Ritual Magic fics. There's not much to say other than, don't care how dark/ twisted they are and all are welcomed.

T.I.A. ðŸ™‚


** Linkffn(cadmean victory) and linkffn(new blood) both feature ritual magic with some pretty substantial depth to them IMO

*** Thanks for your comment! I have read A Cad' Vic', and it is one of if not my favourite fic. I agree that it goes into some detail. I'm looking for more of the same if not better (if there is any).

Thanks again ðŸ™‚

  In the aftermath of a peaceful summer comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually. And now, a remastered version is coming to my Patreon - initially free.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

This fic focuses almost entirely on ritual blood magic by using a ritual knife to carve runes or symbols with specific meanings on the body, in dedication to specific celestial bodies for permanent effects. I really enjoyed it and give it a solid 10/10. Hope you enjoy ðŸ˜Š
