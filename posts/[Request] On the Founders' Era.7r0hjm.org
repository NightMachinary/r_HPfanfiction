So, I decided to start writing fanfiction to hone my writing skill and had an idea for one at the founding of Hogwarts.

Are there any good fics about that period? For now I'm mostly researching history and trawling the wikia for scraps of information, but I would like to read some to see how other people have gone about this.

Thank you for your time :)
