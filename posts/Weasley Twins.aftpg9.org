#+begin_quote
  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

** You should take care to title and flair your post appropriately.

The uninformative title and lack of a flair makes people disinclined to click on your post. The correct flair in this case would be "Request", and a more appropriate title would be "Looking for the best fics centered around the Weasley twins!".

(This is by no means intended to make you feel bad, just to make you aware of the issue)

Hope this helps with your future posts,
