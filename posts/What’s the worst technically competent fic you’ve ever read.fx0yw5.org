I'm talking fics where the grammar's good, the characters are consistent, and have good ideas but either have something that's a complete dealbreaker or are just poorly executed.

Mine would have to be Partially Kissed Hero by the infamous Perfect Lionheart. There's some really cool ideas, the whole Fae!Harry bit, everything with Manipulative!Evil!Dumbledore, etc. The grammar's decent, too. What breaks it for me is how poorly the fairer sex are treated in that fic. +Brainwashing+ I mean, “Friendship Potioning” a bunch of ladies just to get them to be your allies? No thanks.

It's just distasteful, all around.

Because Ron would team up with Malfoy to beat up Harry. Sure. Also, "I do not forget, I do not forgive." Ugh.

******* So, Seventh Horcrux, basically? :D

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/]]

And sure, having him lash out and be cheesy-villain in his dialogue isn't the best way, but it is workable - see fifth year for evidence of angry angst and crappy dialogue potential - I'd probably take a more slow seduction path prior to the 'I do not forgive, I do not forget' outburst though too, like you said.

Let him get tempted (perhaps by the little voice of Scarcrux Voldemort in his head, sent visions and dreams and such) to be a little more violent here, or a little more ruthless there. Let him rationalise it to himself - there's a war on, after all, and you have to do hard things in war. Let him grow to the point that he'd think nothing of bludgeoning Malfoy over the head and revealing his arm to the Great Hall (proof of him being a death eater). Let him fall, bit by bit, ever so quietly, until he's just as bad as Voldemort.

He's still Harry, thinking of others before himself, doing it all for the best of reasons, but he's Voldemort too, in the methods he chooses to use because he believes that's what's right to do, that's what's HIS right to do, because he's the Chosen One and he has to win. He can have genuine friends and still be villainous. He needs that knowledge from Hermione to protect her, after all, and doesn't she want him to live through the war? He could, if she'd just go research in the library for just a little longer. Etc. etc. etc.

You're right about things being slow, but that doesn't mean he can't go Palpatine level Camp-Evil-Villain-Dialogue. He's an idiot, not a Shakespearean actor, so his dialogue will still be clunky, but the kid can get cheeky at times, and a Darker Harry can turn that "No need to call me Sir, Professor" stuff into his own evil dialogue quite easily. I can picture him turning Bellatrix's manor lines back on her when he finally catches up with her.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

**** Here's a few,all relating to their lives after the war

Parvati Patil spent the majority of her Diagon Alley trips talking to Madam Malkin about fashion and eventually took over the store after a dark curse blinded Malkin during the Battle of Hogwarts . Dean married her and designs the outfits

Justin Finch-Fletchely eventually walked away from his family's money and became Muggle Studies professor and marries Susan Bones. They have one daughter named Amelia who eventually married Albus

Seamus was a longtime bachelor until accidentally getting Sally-Anne Perks pregnant on New Year's Eve. Their son is named Colin and is James' best friend

Ernie Macmillan left the wizarding world behind and married a Muggle. He wrote a fantasy novel about a heroic young hero named Cedric

Michael Corner was the result of a one night stand between a Muggle nurse and pro Quidditch player David Jones. This makes him cousins with Megan and Gwenog Jones. He eventually became an administrator at St.Mungo's while his wife Padma is an Unspeakable . They have their own twins in Rose and Albus's year who David adores

Katie became the Holyhead Harpie's manager and married Alicia. They adopted several war orphans and made them Quidditch crazy . Oliver is their unofficial uncle . He never married and eventually replaced Madam Hooch

Dennis went through a very rough time following the death of his brother but eventually pulled himself together and became a Daily Prophet journalist . He married Rionach O Neal (movie only character)

Anthony Goldstein married a Muggle and had a son . He became an Auror and is Seamus's partner. They're like the Latino cops from Bad Boys

Marietta's scars eventually faded. She married her old friend Roger and had a daughter. Hermione forgave her after a few years and they now drink coffee together and gossip when they have the opportunity

Cho and her Muggle husband have a magical son who Lily has a crush on. Harry's groan when he found out could be heard for almost a mile

  This story came from the thought that the Weasley introduction was a setup. This is NOT a time-travel story. The premise is that the Dursleys got him there very early and Hermione, being the perfectionist that she is, also arrived very early. Thus they meet and the glory of H/Hr begins. AU For now not a T rating, will probably change in later chapters.

** "Sunset Over Britain" and its sequel "Sunrise Over Britain" by Bobmin. The guy was a genius (or at least close) where HP fanfiction is concerned. But this story... UGH!

The story starts with Harry suddenly being incredibly powerful, more so than Voldemort in fact. That's perfectly acceptable, as far as I am concerned, but, since it would allow Harry to finish Voldie off immediately, it wouln't make for much of a story - which the author apparently knew. So he decided to suddenly make Luna into a seer and start giving prophecies. Perfectly acceptable too. Why not? The problem was that the author also made up the idea that a prophecy HAS to be followed. Not some mere notion of what may happen, if some conditions are met. Not a prediction of what will happen no matter what. No. In that story prophecies were orders that had to be followed - or else. (Which makes you wonder how there could be prophecies in the DoM without their subjects being informed of them, if the consequences of failing to do as the prophecies say are so dire.)

Now there was the perfect and incredibly moronic setup for the story to progress exactly the way the author wanted, despite Harry being so powerful that he could have ended the war (and the story) within two or three chapters.

(And, yes, I did call something that was done by someone who is now dead "moronic". I did *NOT* call Bobmin himself that. In the first paragraph I already stated that I consider him something like a genius, but even a genius can have a truly moronic idea now and then - everyone does that. And I refuse to call that idea anything but what it was.)

The way the story progressed was that Luna (or was it Hermione? I read it years ago and I suppose it doesn't really matter) would give a new prophecy now and then, it would be interpreted exactly the way the author wanted the story to progress and that was of course exactly what was done then. That lead to the all-powerful hero not really fighting but instead preparing a place in Ireland to evacuate to which lead to a whole town for magicals being built. They saved cultural treasures from Britain, evacuated magicals (nearly completely disregarding the muggles) and then abandoned the whole island and tens of millions of muggles to Voldemort - all because prophecies said so, because the author wanted Harry to build himself a whole town in Ireland.

This went on for about and and a half years (years six and seven) and, if I remember correctly, culminated in Harry's group actually helping to make Voldemort more powerful, so he would be Harry's equal, so Harry would finally be allowed by the prophecies to fight Voldemort.

All the while it was painfully obvious that none of this would have been necessary or even adviseable in a logical and sane world. Only this series of incredibly stupid plot devices was able to explain at least on some nonsensical level why all that happened.

And the really frustrating thing? Like all Bobmin stories it was otherwise a good read - only it was continuously interruped by bouts of incredible frustration whenever the author introduced the next prophecy giving incredibly stupid and ridiculous instructions. Really: Anytime such a prophecy was introduced I felt insulted that anyone would try to feed me that kind of shit and expect me to swallow it. That really ruined story that could otherwise have been truly great.

** Linkffn (Delenda Est)

Just recently read this in its entirety, and hell does it leave you wholly unsatisfied. It's rather well written grammar wise, but everything is so... dull, not to mention predictable.

The Harry/Bellatrix pairing started off somewhat interesting, however the author goes overboard in the whole "political marriage" thing, and its perhaps the most unsatisfying interactions between two characters you will ever see. He's very obviously trying to hint at 'a fierce love under the surface' but draws it out from chapter 1 to end and snips it off with an inconclusive daily prophet summary of their relationship...

Voldemort is also a rendered a complete pussy. Disarmed constantly, forced to retreat at all times, throws tantrums like a child, refers to Harry as a "Lord of equal stature" and whatnot. Classic cringe.

The protagonist is also a time-travelling demi-god. Learns a spell that allows him to phoenix apparate anywhere he wants warded or not. Has that trope of always seeming tired or weak, but somehow claps everyone's cheeks just cos.

There's so much more, too. Your term of 'worst technically competent fic' cannot be more on point.

I don't know how the fuck I stomached it from beginning to finish.
