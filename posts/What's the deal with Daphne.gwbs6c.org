Basically, that. I haven't stumbled upon any Daphne-centered fanfiction myself, but ever since I joined here I keep seeing recs or requests for Harry/Daphne fanfiction. Who is she even? I only remembered she was mentioned briefly in the books. Is she like the only hot Slytherin girl so everyone is shipping her because there is no one else.. or am I missing something?


** There isn't really a good Slytherin in the books. To a lesser extent there isn't really even a cunning or ambitious Slytherin. Some writers want to fill that hole. Daphne is the name of a Slytherin we know of and she doesn't have anything negative attached to her other than probably being one of Pansy's friends who laughed at Hermione after she got hexed with the teeth growing spell.

It is a nice name.

Some people find Harry lacking. Few argue he's nice but a fair amount of people who believe he isn't proactive enough. Throw in a new character to change things up. Either give him a reason to be more proactive or a device that makes him take his own survival more seriously. Harry almost certainly could never have beaten Voldemort in a fight but some found it disappointing he never seemed to try.

The Wizarding World is a magical place. That being said, we only really see Diagon Alley, Hogwarts and a bit of Hogsmeade. Harry doesn't really care and honestly exploring much of it would have bogged the stories down. Some readers however, want to explore the world a bit, explore the history, the culture, the differences between muggles and magical. Perhaps even see if they can make the pureblood vs muggleborn issue a bit more grey and less cartoon villain who is obviously evil vs people who have done nothing wrong. A way of exploring that is to introduce a character who has reason to be more involved. Ron is a pureblood but the Weasleys are oddballs and shunned by some and he's never shown to have any interest in the outside world beyond quidditch, he's a child who takes it all for granted and is stuck at Hogwarts, he has no reason to care.

Draco vs Harry the pettiness. According to JKR, the woman referred to only as Malfoy's wife in the epilogue is Astoria Greengrass. Some people like the idea of Harry and Draco as brothers-in-law for all the potential petty fights and arguments. Some even try to use HP/DG to try and 'save' Astoria from Malfoy.

*** I got to say that this is the best summary of why people like to use Daphne as a character.

** Shes basically a blank slate for people to have a good slytherin while keep pansy and to a lesser extent millicent as the evil slytherin girls.

*** While she started as a blank slate, her fanon personality is pretty fixed now, and some readers will get very mad if you do it differently. Especially in a Haphne fic

**** While Daphne has taken on a Fanon personality a large majority of readers will embrace different characterisations as long as it's done well.

**** Very true yet those same readers wont blink if ron is suddenly a closet pure blood supremacist or Neville is the type to use love potions on a girl to get back at harry for causing his father's wand to get broken. I'll never understand people lol

****** I've only read one. Harry potter and the two lovers I think the name was. Neville and his aunt use something I cant remember if it was spells or potions to make susan bones leave harry and be with nevile cause he was pissed after the ministry raid in ootp. Honestly it was a good story other than s major character death that I absolutely hated at the end cause it was seriously heart wrenching

** She's probably one of the most popular fanfic characters despite barely coming up in the books. Her personality differs from fic to fic and nobody can say it's OOC because nobody actually knows what she's meant to be like. She's honestly just short of being an OFC with how customizable she is lol.

  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.

** Basically, she is the perfect character for when an author wants Harry (or his MC when he is different) to interract more with the Slytherin:

- She is not an OC (escaping the stigma linked to it), but has not fixed personality so you can do whatever you want with her
- She has a pretty nice name
- The only truly named girls in Harry' year are Pansy and Millicent, one is a shrew who spent way too much time with Malfoy (and try to give Harry to Voldemort), and the other is said to look like a feminie Goyle (or Crabbe). Daphne can be a "nice" (and hot) girl who can be with Harry
