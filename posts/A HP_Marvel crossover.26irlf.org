Even before he DoFP ravings I'm actually curious about how authors pull this off.

I'm currently reading/have reread [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9443327/1/][A Third Path to the Future by Vimesenthusiast]] and it exceeded expectations. To be honest I'm tired of the usual going through Hogwarts shtik and would prefer an 'after voldemort' thing like what the above author did.

So any recomendations?


** Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] by Morta's Priest? Its a Harry Potter/Avengers cross-over where Harry gets transported into the marvel cinematic universe. I would highly suggest reading it, it is one of the best and highest quality fics I have ever read.

Here's the description:

#+begin_quote
  The world is breaking; war and technology are pushing on the edge of the unbelievable, and S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately attempts to keep the peace. The soldier and the scientist are not the only lights that push back against the darkness, however; magic will encompass the world again as the last wizard makes himself known.

*** I honestly haven't. Will check it out. Although if you ever find other Marvel cross overs, albeit leaning to the x-men (Scott was right!) let me know? I've also read a fic where Potter was the master of the Hollows and was Bffs with he movie version of Tony Stark as well as Potter having a Pheonix animagus form. He also wasn't aging as well as a mechanic. Forgot the title of that fic though.

**** Here's another one I found last night [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6093972/2/Thinking-in-Little-Green-Boxes][Thinking in Little Green Boxes]]. I haven't read much of it but it's a Deadpool/Harry Potter crossover. If I find any others (especially x-men!) I will let you know. If you can remember the name of that fic I would love to read it.
