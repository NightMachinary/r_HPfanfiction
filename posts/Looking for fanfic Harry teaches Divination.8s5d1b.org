Its an AU and Sybil was murdered by Voldemort. Harry learns divination after Hogwarts hires him.

Harry wasn't summoned to the au. No one knows he is from a different universe

**** I do remember reading more than once here about how the author wanted to be paid on patreon for new chapters and how even after being paid he didn't deliver. This being years ago, I think we can safely assume it's abandoned, which is a fucking pity.

That is, unless the patreon story is bullshit and the author is merely taking a 3+ years break. Very unlikely.

***** The most likely scenarios are that something happened (life-changing event, etc.), they lost interest in writing or have no time, or they got wind of the fan response to what is at best marketing someone elses world, and at worst a variation of plagarism for money. Not saying I agree, but those seem like the most feasible answers.
