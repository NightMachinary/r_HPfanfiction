There are a bunch of theories other than the good old power of love explanation as to hiw Harry survives the AK.

The theory I have developed in my head after reading a bunch of others is the idea of a binding magical oath. It takes a bit of explaining but here goes.

Firstly the soul is actually the source of a wizards magic and a ghost is when someone leaves an imprint of their magic in the world. A horcrux works because this magical core if you will is supposed to stay together so if you die it is attracted to the horcrux and doesn't move on so you can be brought back to life.

Next is a magical oath. When Lily dies she begs Voldemort to kill her and leave Harry, Voldemort never denies her deal and kills her. Taking a life is a serious thing and now the piece of Voldemorts magical core is in a magical oath to leave Harry alone thus the killing curse rebounds.

Next time Voldemort sees Harry is when he posesses Quirrell. Now if Harry had fallen from his broom I am sure that he would have perhaps bounced through accidental magic and something else would have harmed Quirrell, perhaps he falls off the stands. The next time they see each other Voldemort tries to kill Harry and his host body burns to ash.

In second year Harry comes face to face with a seventeen year old piece of Tom's soul or magical core. This piece of Tom was not there that night and as it is so old it is slightly different to the Voldemort that made the oath/vow. This Tom could have killed Harry but Harry triumphs through his own merit and a bit of help. The piece of Voldemort is attracted to Voldemort's current largest piece which is the main Voldemort and joins back together. This again changes Voldemort's soul/magical core as it is slightly different, different enough that the oath is no longer in effect.

When Voldemort faces Harry again in fourth year he is no longer bound under the magical oath as his magical core is not the same one that took the oath and the protection it offered is broken. Both are now on an even playing field except for the horcrux in Harry.

One would think that a piece of Voldemort's magic would be strong enough to over power a baby. We already see that a younger and less powerful piece can possess ond over power Ginny when she is eleven. The reason that Harry is not overcome or effected by the horcrux in his head is because it is a piece of Voldemorts magic which is under an oath to not harm Harry

What other theories are out there that also work well?

He tells her to stand aside, clearly rejecting her "deal."

No, I don't think I will.

** Okay seriously. I know this is going to sound stupid and petty but what is it with people and abbreviations and acronyms? Why can't people be arsed to write whole words anymore? It only takes like two seconds. I can understand using it in a chat or online forums like this one, but it's really jarring in fics. Every time I see "AK" my first thought is Avtomat Kalashnikova and not the killing curse.

Anyway, pointless rants aside I believe Lilly found a dark ritual and used it. A possible explanation of why no one did it before is because dark wizards are not selfless enough to sacrifice themselves. And because she had to make Harry's scar and not a lot of mothers would harm their own children. I know it's not a great explanation but the alternative is the writer saying "it just happened this one time".

*** The dark ritual also works but you cannot say that nobody has ever died for another by stepping infront of the killing curse which is what makes the original power of love theory so unbelievable. A less likely occurance is the fluke that the wording of their conversation invokes the oath.

**** Just thought of this - who says it hasn't happened before?

Harry's example is special and unbelievable, because Voldemort was the most feared wizard of the last century or two, and then he was /UTTERLY ANNIHILATED/ by a one-year-old baby.

There's two parts for why this is so:

One, normal dark lords don't go after babies specifically, and those people who do go after babies aren't the worst thing since the invention of tax breaks. So what if some random wizard explodes and a baby survives? Maybe he didn't use the correct spell and blew himself up.

Two, the spell. Voldemort's signature was the killing curse, a spell with no escape or method of defense. you're hit and you die. lily and james were also dead by it, and Harry survives? Holy shit.

***** Perhaps it has something to do with protecting the innocent. A baby like Harry would be consodered innocent by all unlike an adult who would not be. Lily dieing for an innocent soul protects them.

*** Why is it a dark ritual? What I mean is that I miss a comprehensive theory of what Dark Magic is. The way I see it naturally wizards and witches have some kind and amount of magical power naturally. Dark magic is then when you use somebody else for your purposes (without or against his will and knowledge), in the extreme case when you literally sacrifice some other human being for you to gain some amount of magical power.

What Lily Potter was the exact opposite: she sacrificed herself to gain of somebody else (her son). I would call it a White Magic.

I think it is a lovely analogy of (pick your choice) the Kant's second formulation of the ethics (Formula of the End in Itself: act so that other's are the ends for themselves not the mean for you) or the Christ's Law (“No one has greater love than this--that one lays down his life for his friends.” John 15:13 or Matthew 20:25b-28 “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in high positions use their authority over them. It must not be this way among you! Instead whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave---just as the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”)

Just a thought.

** My preference is some ritual or enchantment that Lily either discovered, modified or invented.

** It was a ritual, cost and effect.

Lily paid with her (and perhaps even james') life, creating a protection fueled by that sacrifice. It was powerful enough to rebound the energy of the curse.

a piece of voldemort splits off and attaches to the part of harry where the lingering shield is weakest, the spot his curse hit, and forms the shape of a Sig rune (elder&new futhark for /power/ and /protection/, most likely determined hy voldemort himself, as in "protect me, maintain my power", which ironically backfired).

Hagrid comes and takes the baby to Dumbledore, who sees the protection quickly decaying now that it's been used, and uses the last of its power to weave an enchantment around the only relatives harry's mother left behind, mimicking the effect to a smaller degree. The reason he sent harry to that house every summer was mostly because it really was safer there, but also because the enchantment most probably required him to actually "live" there.
