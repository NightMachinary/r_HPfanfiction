I got this idea that I'm very interested in reading. Where Sirius, Tonks, Remus and Mad-Eye are brought through time from the fight in department of mysteries to the future (shortly) after the war in some way, without affecting the war (possibly from an alternative universe). Tonks and Remus could be shocked by Teddy and Harry would get to be with Sirius again, now a free man.

Anyone interested or know anything similar or just good time travel stories with these characters, especially Tonks and Remus.


** One of my favourite time traveling fics & fills most of your requirements, but Remus & Sirius are from before Harry's birth - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/534478]])

  Teddy and James are in the middle of breaking up when Remus and Sirius - teenaged, travellers from the past - drop into their life.
