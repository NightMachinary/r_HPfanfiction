I'm looking for any good female (born a girl) Harry Fanfiction. I'd also like it if there's some focus on Harry's relationship with Sirius and or Remus. Maybe fics where he gets free early and rescues little Harry from the Dursleys and raises her himself. Parent Sirius fics I mean, that stretch into the Hogwarts years would be great! .

Or fics where Girl Harry goes to Hogwarts, and just you know lives through that. If she's a little smarter or aware and proactive than canon Harry, that'd be awesome. Any ship is fine tho I'm fine with no ships too. I'd prefer if FemHarry isn't paired with a girl tho, if other characters are, that's fine. She should have real connections tho. Good friendships I mean.

(If you've got any good fics you could recommend that fit this but isn't girl Harry, please rec that too!)

Some fics that I've read recently in the area that I adore are:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7728121]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11009412/1/Arya-Lily-Potter]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6762790]]

Also, a lot of Ellory's fics are great too. If anyone knows anything that fits, then I'd be very thankful, if you'd rec them.

Have a nice day!


** Fem!Harry is my favorite! All of these are either complete or ongoing.

This is the most canon-compliant Slytherin or fem Harry I've read. Everything she does I can see Harry doing. Also super well-written. The literary allegories are to die for.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6109822]])

Darker version of the one above. Harry is not a good person. The ships listed are less ships and more of how these men affected her life. (The Sirius one broke my heart.)

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3694820]])

More of an AU. Ongoing. It's absolutely hilarious, has a great plot, and features the most awkward and self-sufficient Harry I've ever met. I legit scream-laughed at the ending to the latest chapter.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15676317]])

Very AU, but a pretty canon Harry. She's a total tomboy who is super into quidditch and collects snakes. Multiple horcruxes are running around, Voldemort is running the government through the shadows, Sirius Black has a daughter that was raised in a nunnery, and Snape is just trying to keep Harry alive.

  There are stories with snakes that bite and say {you knew what I was when you picked me up} but this isn't one of them. This is the kind of story where the abandoned child walks in the jungle beneath the branches full of hissing things and tells them {we be of one blood ye and I}.

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership.

  They sought her out for conversation sometimes, cornering her in the garden or at the park, not that they ever had much to say. Really, Harriet thought snakes were rather dull.---------Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with grass snakes, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing to happen to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. Harriet attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she makes new friends, encounters a prickly Potions Master, learns about the Boy Who Lived, and meets the enigmatic Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor, Professor Tom Slytherin.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

** Definitely check out linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) if you haven't already. Tom Riddle launched a political party instead of a war, so lots more people are still alive (including all the Marauders), but blood status discrimination and segregation are legally enforced, eg only pure-bloods can go to Hogwarts. Harry and her pure-blooded cousin (Sirius Black's son) hatch a risky plan to swap places, so she can learn potions from Professor Snape and Archie can learn Healing in America.

Harry is smart and proactive and works hard, but carrying such big secrets all the time puts a strain on all her relationships; she's well liked and has good friends, but she's keeping things from them and they can tell. And any time she excels, that puts a bigger spotlight on her and increases the pressure on the ruse.

No characters are bashed, and indeed a bunch of them are portrayed more sympathetically than canon - even Riddle himself turns out to have good motives mixed in with his bad ones, to Harry's shock. But the stakes are as high as ever.

Fourth year was just completed, fifth year should be starting within the next few months.

** I'm late to the party but... I've tried or read most of the fics that are already recommended here and I can second:

Swiftly Falling Snow: is well written with some sensitive issues well handled and major focus on raising Harry. For me the biggest selling point of this one is that it goes through all the things that happen at Hogwarts and still manage not to bore you since Harry handles things differently and the consequences are very logical.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25917352/chapters/62988739]]

When Harry Met Tom: It is very funny.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15676317/chapters/36419703]]

​

And I will add The Never-ending Road : no-one adopted Harry in this one but it starts at her second year and it does have a lot of focus on her relationship with Remus and Sirius. Hermione and Harry friendship is goals and the first part of the fic is completely gen. Great quality writing and awesome characterizations.

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

Slytherin

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12867461/1/Slytherin]]

Summary: female Harry (Hyacinth) Potter is sorted into Slytherin. She is happy, bright eyed and easy going, the opposite of any Slytherin so how is it that she is the unopposed princess of Slytherin
