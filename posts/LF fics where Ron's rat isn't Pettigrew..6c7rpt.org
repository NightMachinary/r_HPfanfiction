And ovfuckingcourse they can't cange the plot so Petters escapes takin trip to Autoban. Anyway. Moral is I'm annoyed with those fics and I want a different thing.

Edit: Grammar.


** It would be a great plot twist if an author wrote book 3 with Remus thinking Sirius was innocent, but when he casts the spell to turn Peter back into a human it doesn't actually work. The plot twist is that Sirius did betray the Potters, Pettigrew is actually dead and Scabbers is just a rat.
