are there Fics that have an OC character, who follows the Canon and do critisize some actions of the People. I mean, some actions that are commonly "annoying". For Instance:

Hermione blames the School in Year 4 that it has Houselfes. Why doesnt she confront dumbledore about it and question him?

Or that Harry has to enter all trials, instead of simply disqualify himself on purpose.

Or the fact, that anyone close to the Ministry knows about the Tournament, despite its "gag order", so the OC wants to learn legilimency, maybe.

â€‹

The Canonical story should be constant, just that some actions are more critisized, as mentioned above. No Bashing, just critic.

  Every body persists in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by force impressed. The seventh year sequel to That Terrifying Momentum.
