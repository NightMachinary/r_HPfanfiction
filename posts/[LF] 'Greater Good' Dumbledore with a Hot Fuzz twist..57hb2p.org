[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnqPrDN77Xg][The Greater Good scene from Hot fuzz]] if you don't know it.

The idea popped into my head and I thought it could be funny.


** Make Hogwarts Great Again by Albus Trump

The finest school of magic in the world, Hagrid said. But standards at Hogwarts have slipped, and it has lost its once prestigious status. Journey with Dumbledore as he grabs Hogwarts by the pussy. For the Greater Good.

** Short explanation for those of you who aren't familiar with the film:

The sleepy little village of Sandford has a crime rate of practically zero, and has won the Best Village award for several years in a row.

This is because the village's Neighbourhood Watch Alliance are secretly murdering everyone who makes their village look bad (gypsies, street performers, bad theater performers...), with the police inspector (part of their group) covering up the deaths as freak accidents.

In a nutshell; kill people to preserve your public image. Sort of like a more vile Gilderoy Lockhart.

I can see this, kinda. An evil!Dumbledore who responds to problems in the halls of Hogwarts with discreet false-memory charms, personality-'correcting' potions, arranging for troublesome students to 'withdraw' over the holidays, and if all-else fails, sending kids into the Forbidden Forest in the middle of the night to hunt down something attacking and killing unicorns...all for the purpose of maintaining Hogwarts as the best and safest school of magic in the world, of course.
