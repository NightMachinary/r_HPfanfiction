:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I doubt this be fruitful, but I figure I will try anyway. I remember long ago (prob. before 2014, but I might be wrong), that I read a Harry Potter where he either traveled through time or dimensions. I only remember it in a very vague sense.

The only thing I remember is that theres a scene where hes staying in the Hospital Wing and, I think, being overseen by a St. Mungos Healer for mental health or therapy or something (I think it was because of his prev. home life and adventures, or maybe he mentioned his unorthodox traveling through time/dimensions? I might also be wrong, and he just injured himself some way or got ill...). There were privacy curtains around his bed. I think the scene I remember was just Harry talking to the healer with the curtains closed, and the healer writing things down.

Also, I think he was adopted into a family and had an sister due to said adoption, and they were there to see him. I think that Tonks was somehow involved (either friend, girlfriend, sister), but I might be confusing that with another fic...Thats really all I remember.

If anyone knows what I am talking about, please tell me! Thanks in advance, if only for reading my post.


** I think I recognize it, so it's probably a pretty popular fic I found in a recommendation. Is there any chance some of the Blacks or Charlus Potter were involved? Maybe Charlus did the summoning?

Edit: maybe that was The Blood Incantation. But how did he end up in the hospital wing?

Maybe A Riddled Universe?

*** Theres a chance since I know Ive read fanfics like those before (time travel, xovers, and dimensional travel are among my favorites)...Though, granted, I dont specifically recall ones with Charlus summoning Harry...

Also, thanks, cause now I am wondering about another fanfic where Harry goes back to the maruder era, gets adopted by his grandparents, and encompasses at least a few years since said grandparents get killed, they all graduate (except, I think, Harry who graduated later because he was younger), him living with James & Lily, and dating Sirius (including a date involving a ride with his motocycle). Granted, that one shouldnt be too hard to find since Ive done refound before.

*** Hmm, maybe...I couldve sworn it was time travel but maybe I just mixed it up. I do vaguely remember reading this fanfic though, so it probably is it. Thanks!
