Does anyone have a working link (or a file they're willing to share) for the "Portions for Foxes" series by WonderWoundedHearers? I read it years ago, and just got strangely nostalgic for it and I'd love to read it again. It still shows up in google searches as on FF.net, but it was deleted ages ago.

Thanks!


** I have it as a pdf that I could send you.
