** Seems likely to me that it's the kind of decision the digital effects team would make to fill the map, rather than anything JKR would have had a hand in.

Not that it matters so much, given the very uncanonical nature of the PoA movie. Underage magic is allowed, Harry receives his firebolt at the end of the year not Christmas, etc.

** Having read that article I have two theories about this, one being that maybe Newt was visiting Albus Dumbledore about something, especially as during fantastic beasts, it was mentioned that Newt was one of Dumbledore's favourites.

My other theory is that he was assisting Hagrid with a creature, explaining his presence there.

**** There was another theory I had but it was very outlandish and that was that Newt was polyjuicing himself as his grandson, Rolf, in order to see what the state of CoMC teaching was like.
