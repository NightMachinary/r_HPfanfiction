There's almost a ludicrous number of Harry x Creature slash, usually "Harry is the submissive mate of x Death Eater" but with so many cute and downright sexy female creature races in fiction, why are the non Slaash fics more prevalent?

Female Vampires, we have people like Seras Victoria, Arcueid Brunestud, etc, instead of just "Vampire Draco" or "Random Male Twilight character when Alice is the only interestingly developed character in the series"

Hell, we've got Elves. Elves being Sexy females is almost a trope in other fiction (LOTR, Warcraft being major ones) having some High Elf that all house elves worship or whatever...

Succubi? Definitely. Devils, Demons... Sirens, Nymphs...

The only ones I ever see are Veela, with Harry x Fleur or Gabrielle, and they're not really very creaturey (And even then, Hermione is shoehorned in. (Price of Being Noble and a few others)

Are there any Harry x Female Creature/Magical Race fics that aren't just Veela?


** linkffn(The Song of the Trees; Hell Eyes by Jezaray; Eclipse of the Sky; Animagus Mishap; Outcast's Alley; Won't you Save me; Chrysochlorous; To Train a Dragon Rider)

Those are the ones I remember. You said that Veela aren't considered creatures, so I excluded any that would go a bit more indepth into veela lore.

Animagus mishap is a smutfic with several disturbed things, but fairly well written, with somewhat of a plot. He bangs a lot of creatures, people, animals, animagus, etc.

Song of the Trees is a secret, cuz spoilers.

Hell Eyes is fantastic. If the author decided to go solo OG work with just the extended universe he created, he'd make money for real.

Outcast's Alley was a bit meh for me.

Won't you save me is a bit interesting, but not a really healthy relationship imo. I liked overall and is quite fluffy, but it has some unnecessary angst sometimes.

Chrysochlorous is a fantastic Twilight crossover with a unique and logicaly different Rosalie. Also, I disagree with your point about Alice. Jasper is as developed as her, imo and there's a few femHarry/Jasper out there. Even Harry/vampBella

To Train a Dragon, Its Arya, so a sexy elf. def no smut but good romance and extended plot. Unfortunately, its abandoned in a pretty sucky place, with like 3 more chapters , it would've end.

Saved the best for last, imo. Eclipse of the Sky is simply wonderful, it has a OG creature as the pairing, a complete character, with flaws and personality, with fantastic world building, a bigger and darker war (its pretty much global) a better and worse Voldemort, close to canon personality for Ron and Hermione, but without going into that trope of Ron being the most jealous person on earth and Hermione being muggle wank. The synergy between the Trio is only matched, imo, in The Sum of their Parts. Ron is really funny and cool in this. Kally(the OC) curiously enough, is quite similar to Harry, both are extremely paranoid, prejudiced against the things they think its wrong/evil, and stubborn like mofos. This Harry is basically canon, but with more paranoia, a reason to go to any lenghts to protect those he love, because of Sirius death, which he took as a lesson. A great Dumbledore and really really really close to canon Dumbledore as possible, but with a lot more action for him.

Also, the Horcruxes are badasses. None of the "I've seen your heart and its mine" bullshit that anyone would ignore and not go into a trance, when the person HAS BEEN FUCKED WARNED that some shit would happen... Anyways.... if you haven't noticed, I love this fic, so i'm biased. There are a few flaws, and for some reason there's a lot of flaming going on. I just enjoy it everytime he updates, which is fairly frequently.

  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?

It is also brilliantly written, with solid characterisation, witty humour, and a full complete story with an satisfying conclusion to boot. ( slightly rushed in the ending though imo)

  Harry strikes a deal with a vampire and ends up getting far more than he had expected... (Canon compliant till the end of the fifth book but with a whole bunch of invented back story. How much do we know about Potterverse vampires, after all?) No slash, potential Dumbledore bashing, kickass vampire!

Honestly, HP fanfiction seems to avoid the more fantastical. Not a lot of monster girl romances out there. Hell, it is a setting with transfiguration and that is only rarely played with...

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's world is flipped upside down when he is unexpectedly visited by a naked fairy on his fourteenth birthday.  Finding out that he is a rare species of incubus known as a Choiceling is the least of Harry's problems when he discovers just how drastically his life is about to change.  How will our young hero deal with an entire year at Hogwarts when he has to have sex at least once a day just to survive?!  Join Harry on an epic tale of love, lust, and innocence, as he battles against much more than just dark wizards and learns just how strong bonds can be.
