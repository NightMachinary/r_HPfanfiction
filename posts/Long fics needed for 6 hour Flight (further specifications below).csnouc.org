I'm looking for a fic to pass the 6-hour wait time at the Frankfurt Airport, preferably over 100k words. Here are some stuff I'm looking for:

- Mostly canon compliant fics at least in regard to characterization. I don't mind AU's but I prefer fics with *no bashing.* (any good AU rec is appreciated)
- Honestly while I love Hinny and Ron/Mione, I don't mind other pairings as long as no one is out of character.
- Plot heavy. fics
- Auror Fics (Casefics)
- The Wizzarding World integrating with the Muggle World
- Fics set after DH

I know this is a lot and a fic doesn't have to hit all these categories, just give me something exciting and/or well written and in character! (Please)


** Northumbrian has lots of stories that fit your specifications: post-Hogwarts, mostly in-character, aurors, muggles... This for example.

** I got it, its the best thing for your trip. An epic 3 part series, over 1.5 mil words all together. Well written and lots of twist and turns. It deserves alot more love than it currently has. The first book is linkffn(Resonance by GreenGecko). It has proper pacing and character development. Give it a chance!

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Over half a million words.

Competent characters. (Except for Voldemort kinda, but he's not the main villain.) No Weasley or Dumbledore bashing.

Plot heavy.

Eventual Harry/Hermione, but other pairings are explored. Teenage romances don't always turn into everlasting love.

Harry and Ron become aurors in the second half. The main mystery for them is something the reader already knows though, because half of it is from the thief's perspective.

Second half set post-Hogwarts and post-Voldemort, with Harry and Ron hunting some remaining Death Eaters. Not post-DH because the war goes differently in the first half.

Wizarding/muggle world interactions.

And it's definitely one of my favorites.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** My favorite AU is linkffn(Living With Danger) and sequels followed closely by linkffn(Be Careful) if I want an AU of DH. The latter probably has fewer tropes. All the fics by this author include heavy plot and excellent world-building. Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, Neville/OC, Draco/Luna (it works I promise they both have character development). No bashing
