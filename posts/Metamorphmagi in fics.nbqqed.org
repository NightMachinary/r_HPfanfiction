Would love to see a fic where one of the non-Tonks characters is a metamorphmagus. I'd especially like if it went into a bit more detail about the ability and its limitations, as well as just how your life may be different from the average joe. Thanks!


** Harry Potter and the Metamorph by hermyd

Harry is a metamorphmagus, Tonks trains him.

  Harry decided that the only way he can win this war with his sanity intact is to train his own way without interference. But then he discovers an ability that he needs help with and only one person can provide that-Tonks. They bring the fight to the DEs in their own way so that the war will finally end.

*** Looks interesting, I'll definitely check it out! The training especially looks quite interesting as I'd always presumed you could just immediately control the ability. Thanks!

**** Other authors have their own takes on how the morphing ability works. This was the first fic I remembered where someone other than Tonks has the ability. There are other stories where Harry has it.

  When Umbridge is about to CRUCIO Harry, a woman knocks on the door. Enter Delphi. She's out of Azkaban and into another timeline. Violence ensues. But she also wants friends because she's low-key lonely af and everyone she's ever met hates her. Join her on her bloody journey. I don't own any of these character, J.K. Rowling does.
