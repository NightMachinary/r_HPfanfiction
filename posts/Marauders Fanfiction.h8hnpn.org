hi! I'm currently writing an HP fanfiction on the Marauders. I first wrote it in French (and got 130K views which isn't bad for a French fanfiction) but now I'm writing it in English so if you guys could check it out I'd be so happy :-)

name: The Reflect of Illusion

[[https://www.wattpad.com/682805512-the-reflect-of-illusion-synopsis-%2B-info]]

synopsis :

(Marauders Area, Sirius Black x OC)

Saying Mia was delighted to go to Hogwarts was pure irony. But what was the safest place she could choose during the war? With her sarcasm and her unstable temper, she immediately intrigued those assho- well, the marauders, who will do their best to make her life even more grotesque than it already was.

Between protecting her relatives or discovering her secrets, the young witch will have to make a choice, which won't be without heavy consequences.

Between dangerous discoveries and unspeakable secrets, Mia will also have to face her worst enemy: herself.

Thank you! stay safe :)
