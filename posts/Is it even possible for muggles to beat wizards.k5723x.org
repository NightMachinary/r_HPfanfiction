Without any muggleborns assisting, do you think they could take over the wizarding world in a shock attack? Squibs would side with muggles for this one, so they would know most wizarding locations around the world.


** As long as they don't wipe the wizards out immediately, I doubt it. Considering we have real-life bunkers in which you can take a /direct hit/ from a nuke and be just fine, I heavily doubt wizards would have problems defending against nukes. There's also a lot of stuff that wizards could do to cripple the muggle world entirely. I remember a fic where Dark Lord Harry used alchemy to simply turn the world's biggest oil wells into water, completely destroying civilization within a month, leading to easy conquest. And there are just so many other things they could do, like spreading a disease that wizards can cure easily but muggles can't. Stuff like poison in the water supply is extremely easy to do when you can be invisible and apparate - what are they gonna do, ward against it?

Imperioing the muggles to nuke themselves isn't a viable thing since most countries don't have one single person that can launch nuke by themselves (maybe North Korea?), but wizards wouldn't have much difficulty simply killing the leaders, throwing the muggle world into chaos. Hell, just steal the nukes while you're at it.

Not to mention that bulletproof armor exists for most calibers, so I'm sure wizards could easily come up with something to block bullets between alchemy, runes and enchanting. And once you're past that, just shield a squad of death eaters up and they'll destroy NYC overnight.

And lastly, I highly doubt we saw the full potential of dark magic - namely, because Voldemort wanted to rule, not destroy the magical world. Fiendfyre alone could level cities, imagine what else dark wizards have in store. Not to mention necromancy, basilisks, /dragons/, house elves - hell, a war could be won with house elves alone, just order them to kidnap all the world leaders. Dementors that muggles can't even see, just waiting to feed. Depending on how hard creating an inferi is, entire cities could be taken out by a single wizard with the only expenditure being the time it takes to raise the local graveyards.

In any world where Harry doesn't end up marrying Hermione at the age of fourteen, muggles stand /no chance whatsoever/ unless they somehow exterminate magic completely before the wizards can retaliate. It's not even close, really - any singular wizard, even the most pathetic ones like Pettigrew and Lockhart, is an entire army by himself when fighting muggles.

** Not really. The only advantage Muggles have is their numbers. They outnumber Wizards by ridiculous margins. At least 1:10000. The only possibility would be some sort of war of attrition. However even that strategy is questionable due to existence of Legilimency and Imperio.

Muggle weapons very likely can harm a wizard - but only if they are taken by surprise. I imagine a simple shield charm will prevent pretty much all projectile weapons.

Nuclear weapons cause too much destruction and harm Muggles far more than wizards. Considering how spread out wizarding population is. They could perhaps attempt to bomb Hogwarts, but chances are they never be able to find the place. And due to high amount of magic there, explosives are likely to fail even if they find their target.

All in all Wizards, despite seemingly backward, are as gods by comparison. Or like some extremely advanced aliens whose tech is so far beyond anything found on earth that it looks as magic.

Only real option is nuclear armageddon - a pyrrhic victory. I suppose far in the future where humanity has spread to other planets ... perhaps could be a viable option to eliminate wizard kind. Assuming wizards remain on earth.

*** The size of the disparity also depends on how well things like Muggle-repelling wards work. If Muggles try to aim nuclear weapons using GPS, can they still pinpoint coordinates? Do they redirect drones as well as Muggles?

Honestly though, once the wizards got serious they could literally gut governments. They could imperio officials and leaders to do their bidding, set countries against each other instead of against wizards, kidnap officials and find out their plans using Veritaserum, and in the meantime add to the chaos by evacuating the UK's magical population and setting a couple dragons on major population centers with a timed portkey to get them out or something.

** Frankly no, every time people come to this they start talking about bombs and guns etc... so lets break that down and focus on the ministry it self.

The Where: The ministry is underground in central london with entrances all controlled magically baring a single phone box that doesn't require magic to use. (Its possible there are multiple but I doubt there are more than 10)

The People: Assuming that anti-muggle spells/wards (yes I know thats not the cannon word but everyone knows what I mean) can be bypassed by the attackers they can only breach the building in single digits at a time. Defenders can enter far quicker and are already present in large numbers (both auror headquarters and normal wizards are present).

The Need for Suprise: Wizards have access to the prime minister at their whim. If this is not a surprise all the organisers of such an attack will swiftly be replaced, obliviated or confounded into obedience. Therefore the attacks must not be known of before hand by wizards.

The Attack Vectors: As muggles there are a limited number of ways to attack the ministry. Tunneling in is possible but is going to alert the wizards to it, such a task under central london will not go unnoticed and require a large number of workers. Such an approach thus looses the surprise of the attack and is likely to be prevented all together.

Bombing is likewise completely out. Setting off a bomb, gas attack or any other destructive device within central london would see so many dead muggles that the organisers of such an attack would never consider it (be it for political or humanitarian reasons).

The only remaining option therefore is to attack in person. With entrances that only allow single digits to enter at a time and a guard checking said entrances the attack would be easily discovered and swiftly repelled.

Summary: In the end, its all very well saying that muggles have nukes but wizards live in the same cities they do. For every other attack there is a counter and wizards are perfectly able to use muggle methods themselves.

** As written? Not meaningfully. Wizards have means of just flat leaving that mundanes have no way to counter, and access to mind control to conduct decapitation strikes on mundane governments at will.

From the books alone, members of the Ministry have direct access to the UK Prime Minister, and between the Imperio, the existence of Veritaserum, and Legilimency, no state secret is safe.

Consider an American Dark Lord popping into the Oval Office and convincing the President to call in a pre-emptive nuclear strike, without the US Department Of Magic on his side to protect him.

** From what I understand of magic and Wizarding society in canon, I think Muggles could (mostly) wipe out wizards. However, that would not be due to the wizards' ability or raw potential, but because of their mindset.

Dueling on an individual level with spells seems to be the preferred combat technique, seen throughout the books. Despite the fact that you'd think (controllable) area-effect spells and potions would be a priority, I don't see much (if any) evidence of that through the books. The wizarding mindset seems mostly stuck in some kind of knightly culture, where success on the battlefield lies in the results of a bunch of individual 1 vs. 1 battles where two trained and well-equipped individuals face off, as opposed to blasting your enemies off the battlefield by any means necessary.

I think a war between muggles and wizards would be akin to some of the fruitless and tragic WW1 battles, with the Muggles holding the machine guns, and the wizards going over the top with bayonets fixed, only to be mown down.

So, I believe the wizards would lose a battle with the muggles because their mindset and leadership would be stuck in that way of thinking. Eventually, they'd realize otherwise, but in enough time to turn the tide of the war? I doubt it. I just think it would be too hard (at least initially) for Wizarding society to understand the concept of total war, and the mass destruction Muggles could bring to bear in an instant. Yes, muggle-borns would know, but the upper echelons of society and the ruling classes aren't (typically) muggle norms. And the pure bloods seem to grapple with the concept of a microwave, let alone getting them to understand a bunker busting bomb.

So I think the wizards would lose in reality, even though on a theoretical level they should easily win.

Plus, wizarding society seems very dependent on the Muggle world for certain things (like raw materials and foodstuffs), so that even if the wizarding world won, they would probably suffer many casualties until they weaned themselves of their muggle dependence and became entirely self-sufficient (which would take decades). So any victory would be Pyrrhic.

*** Where would you attack? Muggles can't see Hogwarts and because its unplottable squibs can't point it out on a map so you can't just bomb it. The Ministry and Diagon Ally are in Central London so you can't bomb them. Most Wizards live in Muggles neighbourhoods. So that only leaves Hogsmead which would just invite retaliation from the Wizards who can then easily confund the PM, the cabinet and all of the military general's which would effectively win the war straight away.

**** Dunno mate, those are the kinda things I'd figure out through the drafting process. If that wouldn't work that have squibs “infiltrate” the Wizarding areas with a lethal bioweapon targeted specifically at the wizards biology. Like that one virus in the game Hitman in the Sapienza level.

Anyway, we're a crafty bunch I'm sure we could do it if we really wanted to. The question really is, why would we?

****** It would honestly depend on how much the squibs were willing to assist. All it might take are some samples of deadly wizard-specific diseases such as dragon pox (I mean it killed Harry's grandparents and countless others in its natural form), and some tissue samples from living wizards and I'm sure they could figure out a way to engineer an especially virulent version.

I think muggle researchers would be more interested in isolating the genetics for magic and then using retrovirus insertion to deliver it to muggles or squibs. Magical gene therapy. Which I could totally see squibs being on board with, because that would allow them to finally be full participants in the society they were born into. And like every shiny "new" technology, muggle governments would be eager to weaponize it somehow.

** I think it depends on how the war between muggles and wizards would go: muggles have the numbers and the technology, but wizards have mindcontrol.

In an outright battle I think muggles would win. You can't do much against nuclear weapons, even with magic. There are also much more muggles than there are wizards and witches and they aren't exactly bulletproof. I think guns and bombs are equally effective against wizardkind as they are against muggles.

If the wizards fight in a clever way on the other hand, muggles wouldn't stand a chance. Imperio the world leaders and they have won. No chance for muggles at all.

Arthur Weasley is one of the wizards who is actually interested in muggles and their technology. He can't even pronounce electricity. Muggleborns leave muggle-education at age 11 at latest; that's not a age where you can understand the concept of radiation. I am sure there could be a way to survive radiation with the help of magic but if you look at the canon there is no way somebody actually has invented such a spell.

******* Arthur's interest in muggles is strictly a hobby, not an actual interest in the sciences that muggles keep advancing. Shacklebolt, on the other hand, was able to act as the prime minister's bodyguard for months without an issue. That means he's not just muggle adjacent but knows how to live as one too. And I doubt he's the only one. Fudge and Scrim... That lion-like bloke, were able to easily rearrange a phone call between the highest elected offices of two major countries. Those phone calls aren't just a random call to chat. They're prearranged and scheduled with talking points and all. Just think about that level of access for a second.

It wouldn't even be hard with globalisation at work. Just wait until a UN-meeting, go in (metal detectors don't work against wooden wands and the best security system is useless if you have poly juice potion and invisibility cloats), greet every leader with an imperio - bam world domination. Why risk a upfront battle if you can win so much easier by being clever.

Don't want to help the Muggles using magic when they ask? Then don't. It's a non-issue, unless they can force you to do it.

There's also the biological factor of magic. Wizards live longer lifespans, reproduce and have magic children... you fuck with that gene? Hell, find a sample, use PCR and electrophoresis and synthesize your own biological engine of magic generation; now no one is special.

I think this comment section severely, severely underestimates science, and assumes magic itself is 'beyond' it. But outside the narrative logic of a soft magic system, this wouldn't be the case. If you obserbe that magic and electricity have interference, then you're halfway to literally killing magic humans from the inside.
