Hey guys,

I am kind of itching to try my hand at writing a fanfiction again (note: I am not promising anything here, my last tries all crashed and burned after all and nobody will ever get to see them, much less read them!) and I've thought about how a student could earn some extra money at a boarding school and I kind of got this idea to sell things to other students (little things people might need like contraceptives (I'd buy tons of condoms, lubricant, some cigarettes, porn mags if I could get them (especially if it's the pre-internet pr early internet age, so no pornhub etc.!) etc. to smuggle in and sell to the other students!) and such) and I'd like your input what else could be sold for profit among the students (especially if you have say trust vault full of money so that you can buy a larger stash - and order more if that sells out too quickly - of things to sell!)?

Any idea is welcome, even weird ones :)

So stage is yours guys :)


** This would be a good use of the expandable trunks. Harry buys one and uses it as a storage for his contraband.

I'd have in stock:

- Porn magazines. Easily distributed, especially if you hide them in books.

- Alcohol. Anything and everything I can get my hands on. Lets face it. The customers I'd have are teenagers and teenagers swallow anything that gives them a buzz and isn't entirely legal for them to have.

- Quills, Parchment and other supplies. I'm not sure where students in Hogwarts get their spare parchment - its never said - but maybe you could make that a market? Also you could add muggle stuff like ring-folders, staplers, pens, notebook to your selection due to their practicability.

- Potions. From contraceptive to psychedelic anything that could go for a quick galleon. Hangover potion, Dreamless Sleep, even Polyjuice for the right price.

- Broom Rental. Buy a few good brooms (doesn't have to be Nimbus or Firebolts) and rent them out for a few bucks. They're way better than the school brooms and if you'Re only looking for the occasional casual ride, its way cheaper than to buy your own.

- Tobacco and Herbs. I'm sure the casual cigar, pipe or joint aren't even the funniest stuff you could get out of a well stocked greenhouse. I'd buy a trunk big enough to have a greenhouse in it with all the fun plants in it. When I harvest I can supply the student population with a wide variety of herbal drugs.

- Repair and Clean Service. Buy some houseelves and let them work a little shop. Repair clothes, bags or let evidence vanish. All at the flick of a houseelf's finger. May also write homework for you for the right price - just don't expect to get good grades for it.

Depending on how good Harry's moral compass is, he could even go into highly criminal territory.

- Dark and Dangerous. Need a bit of Knockturn Alley? Sure thing, step right up. We got it all, from uber-potent love potion to candy that makes your enemies bones turn to glass. Your desire is our business. Your revenge is our trade.

- Prostitution. If your Harry has truly lost all sense of morals, maybe he buys some... idk... Succubi, Lamia, Nymphs and whatnot on the black market and lets desperate boys and men have fun with them (or let "his girls" have fun with those poor sods), for galleons a plenty (loss of soul, free will, or other bodily, spiritual, or mental harm may apply).

** While not necessarily popular among wizard born students, arranging to have daily deliveries of various Muggle newspapers and selling magicallyâ€‹ produced copies would make a steady business, perhaps more for the sports//gossip sections among the younger years. Heck, a local bookie operation could work for both magical and muggle sports.

There money to be made going the other way too. I mean, you could make quite a tidy sum just going to the Room of Requirement, asking for all clothing/furniture not used in the last say 100 years, and selling it through venues along the lines of Antique Roadshow.

** Generally speaking the stuff that sells is going to be stuff that is either against the rules, or is quickly used up and needs to be replaced.

Quills, ink and school supplies could be a small, legal business.

Food items that aren't available at dinner, like candy, we're a solid sale at day school, it would only be worse at a boarding school I imagine.

Porn would likely be an option, but more likely to just be passed around rather than sold. Thinking back to that age, one magazine would last you months, if not the whole year, simply because that is what you had access to. Make with any kind of sex supplies, there is probably a market, but not a huge one.

Drugs and alchohol would be the highest value, but highest risk items. Someone has a hookup outside the school and can smuggle stuff in.

Heres an excerpt from the wiki:

#+begin_quote
  A charm is a spell that adds certain properties to an object or creature. Charms are distinguished from transfigurations in that a charm adds or changes properties of an object; it focuses on altering what the object does as opposed to what the object is.[1] For example, the Colour Change Charm causes something to flash different colours; the Levitation Charm causes an object to levitate; the Cheering Charm improves upon a creature's mood.

  An object that has a lasting charm placed on it is called bewitched, though charms in general appear to last longer than other spells.

Fiendfyre can destroy a horcrux because it's cursed fire, not because it's hot. It's the magical qualities of the fire not the physical qualities that are especially destructive.

One suspects that if you tried to melt a coin with fiendfyre there would be no coin left at the end of it, and no pool of melted metal either. Just ashes.

Also I highly doubt a killing curse could destroy a non-living horcrux. Horcruxes are destroyed by damage to the physical container, and the Killing Curse is not a particularly physically devastating spell.

Just had an epiphany: killing Harry wouldn't have removed the horcrux. Unless his body was cremated (and even then, depends how), the soul piece would still be stuck to the scar. In a properly twisted world, killing Harry would only make him a corpse that the horcrux would then attempt to possess, making him inferius!Harry.

***** The idea that moderately high heat poses a serious problem for a set of abilities that includes time travel, creation of matter, teleportation, and manipulation of space is kinda absurd. From the perspective of Muggle science, if one were to treat magic as energy, then there is more energy used in a single Aguamenti charm than in a nuclear bomb. From a more magical perspective, if one treats magic as entirely separate from physical law, then the amount of energy in a fire doesn't really matter, because "energy" is not part of the system of magical law.

Do you mean by "usually" that its just a commonly accepted thing in fanfiction? Because I highly doubt you argue on any kind of canon basis here, but rather on a big fat bulk of fanon and fanfiction tropes.

************ Really? Cus as far as I'm aware the only reason they're unblockable that is given to us is is simply that they're unblockable by magic. Only a physical object can stop them. So if you have proof, please point it my way.

By usually I mean in fan fiction that is how it's explained. As far as canon goes it never explains what would happen so we don't know if a Protego can stop a bullet. But if that's the case why wouldn't the Death Eaters attack muggles and then shield from bullets? They could simply stand there and trade fire with muggles, and then apparate away, obviously there has to be some sort of catch with how bullets interact with shields. Maybe after a salvo of bullets a shield breaks like a salvo of magic can break a shield? Things I think about instead of sleeping after a 10 hour shift.

Yes, we were talking about Protego, which is magic. The Killing Curse and the Cruciatus are unblockable by magic. Why do I have to point this out? Have you read the books?

Which makes it absolutely useless in any kind of argument. If we're talking about fanon, its all about preferences.

I personally believe that the only reason the Death Eaters didn't go all out on the muggles was that Voldemort could do without the ICW getting a panic attack and intervening. The attacks he did were on the edge of what can be explained away - the Statute wasn't broken. I would suspect that we see more of how the ICW reacts to dangerous breaches of the Statute in the movies that are coming up.

*************** A bullet is in no way the equivalent of a Killing Curse. Its not even close.

A bullet is a /physical object/ accelerated to high velocity and kills by piercing the body, ripping wounds into them. Bullets have a chance of hitting in a non-lethal way.

The Killing Curse is a /spell/ that kills a living thing. It leaves no physical mark, no wound. It just ends life in an instant. It doesn't matter if it hits you straight in the heart, or on your pinkie toe - you're dead either way.

The Avada Kedavra is a spell in a group of spells that are known as "unblockable", which in this context means that they are unblockable /by other magic/. These spells are magic specifically designed to ignore shields.

Bullets are non-magic physical objects. They do not have the magical properties of the Killing Curse that allows the curse to ignore the Shield Charm.

From the wiki:

  The Shield Charm (Protego) is a term applied to several varieties of charms. They create a magical barrier to deflect physical entities and spells, in order to protect a certain person or area.

********* There's no canon statement. Who knows if it could actually create gold?

We only know it actually extends life due to their extreme age. Perhaps he made a deal to not do so if it can make gold. Or they didn't do anything because goblins attacking a wizard as famous as Flamel would spark another war they aren't ready for.

As for goblins using alloys, see their creating the sword of gryffindor.

All it takes is a squad of well trained mages to sneak into command officers' homes, extract intel, then begin assassinating world leaders. You can't equate magicals to spear carrying zulus.

********** Just to interject, you both have good points and bad points. First of all, the gold. We never actually see any specific details about the Galleons in the HP Verse. However, if the scenario that you describe were true, then the Wizarding economy would have collapsed ages ago. Thus, we must assume that the money is protected somehow. It might be enchanted so that it is impossible to melt down. While it is less likely that Galleons could prevent furnaces from operating, it is perfectly reasonable to assume that the heat energy simply doesn't reach the metal.

Now, if I had to create a magical monetary system, compliant with canon, yet still making sense, I would use sympathetic magic, like the Protean Charm. First of all, let's assume that the Goblins have a monopoly enforced by treaty over the gold, silver and copper markets. All of their currency is backed by the gold standerd, and it is patently illegal to sell or buy hold from someone else. What the goblins do is create a massive bunker, an underground magical Fort Knox. There, they have every coin in existence. All of those coins have serial numbers, and are magically tracked with a ledger. What everyone thinks are Galleons and Knuts, are actually magical constructs, bound to their counterparts via sympathetic magic. Any changes which happens to the master coin in Gringotts happens to the slave coin in common use, but not vice versa. Thus, they cannot be melted down, damaged or destroyed by normal means, and even if they were, the monetary value was not lost, it merely was transported to Gringotts where they make a new slave coin. If the master coin is enchanted, the slave coin picks up it's enchantments, which is primarily how they track it. It you try to duplicate it, it will only last for an hour or so before the magic runs out. This is what is commonly known as leprechaun gold. This also deals with Flamel nicely. While Flamel can make gold, he is required to sell to the goblins. The goblins then are free to control that supply of gold, and sell the raw material at a marked up price, or else use it to make currency which they can then circulate at their discretion.

As for the benefits/downsides of muggle vs wizards, consider it this way. These are both what equate to first world countries. Wizards are debatably even more advanced in that aspect, as they are closer to a post scarcity society. Both countries have what could be considered weapons of mass destruction. Muggles are exponentially better at a traditional war, where as Wizards are just about the best at asymmetric warfare, with some of the best possible abilities for guerilla warfare possible. The point being that they are on roughly equal ground society, culturally, and in regards to military strength, I am of the opinion that both sides would damage the opponents irreparably.

*********** It's possible, but unless we have a clear statement, we simply have to assume no one does it simply due to treaties.

My problem with this is why is Flamel bound to sell it? How does he benefit? I don't see him simply agreeing to that. I feel Flamel simply doesn't use that aspect since he's been alive so long he's accumulated enough gold that he has no need to create it.

As for the warfare, yeah they might be better at hit run, but as soon as the military discovers their settlements, they simply turn on the firepower and blow it to shit. Boom. Hogwarts and Hogsmeade are gone. Diagon alley is a problem as it's supposedly in the middle of London, but then the government declares there is reports of a bomb threat, and they blow the shit out of it. Now wizards have no stongholds, and are scattered. Aurors and hit wizards attempt hit and run tactics, but just like the Viet Cong, they'll lose witches and wizards along the way. And with the Magical population being supposedly low after the first wizarding war, and probably still low, they couldn't stand to get in to a long term war. On top of that, where do wizards get food? Gotta assume there is some trade with the muggle world, as food can't be transfigured according to Gamp's Laws.

Or what I'm trying to say: Once the muggles fight with the gloves off, the wizards may do so themselves. Fiendfyre is the first that comes to mind, simply because its such an easy spell (Crabbe could do it) with such immense destructive power. No firefighter could do anything against somewhat sentient flames. You'd only have to fly your broom across New York, Tokio, Berlin, London, Moscow,... and let loose. A team of wizards could burn the civilizations of muggles to a crisp in no time.

So muggles may "win", but only at the cost of everything they have ever built and only after the deaths of billions.

The way I see it, once wizard caught on that the muggles have it out for them - meaning, once the first strike is over, they're almost impossible to catch off guard again.

If anything you'd need to take wizards out silent, instantly, simultaneously at several places and in great masses. Yet, miss even /one/ wizard with half a library and you could face the end of global muggle civilization.

HP wizards are insanely overpowered. There is no limit to magic, as far as we know. If Muggles can't finish it really quick, they'll be in the defensive afterwards - even if its only a small team of wizards surviving.

24 bombers - a squadron - do not carry enough firepower to level a city. They may eradicate Hogsmeade and seriously damage Hogwarts, if they can find it, that is, but if the Slytherins and Hufflepuffs are in their Common Rooms, they have a good chance of survival.

But lets assume they eradicated Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. 50% of magical Britain dead in one go. Hell, lets assume that the muggles react really fast and get Diagon Alley and the Ministry too. Wizarding Britain is done for.

But then you face a problem. How do you bomb something you can't even find? How do you find Durmstrang? Its unplottable. How would you find fideliused places? You literally cannot even comprehend their existence.

#+begin_quote
  Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, the Durmstrang Institute, and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry have all been rendered *unplottable* with powerful magic to protect their students and secrets from Muggles and Dark wizards.
#+end_quote

I get how you'd find Hogwarts. Hogsmeade isn't unplottable, so you just bomb the vicinity. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons, though. We're not even talking about the other schools.

So you decimate hundreds of thousands of magicals all over the planet, who weren't in unplottable locations at the time of your assault and couldn't apparate there to safety. Win for you, I guess.

However, have fun with that mustard gas and those nukes... wherever you let them drop. Wizardkind is gone from your radars and those pesky wandwavers started apparating into your cities, flinging their own mass-destruction spells around. Where do you drop the nukes? Where do you drop the mustard gas? At the last known location? Just into the middle of the plaza where there is a house-number missing? What about your own people you kill? How many thousands of your own are you willing to sacrifice to kill one wizard?

If I were a wizard I'd fidelius house after house in all the biggest cities. Your own people are my meatshield. Wann bomb a safe-house? You'd have to take thousand, maybe even millions of your own with me.

***************** Ok, I am back to interject again. First of all, the muggles have a slight tactical advantage. They aren't stupid, and have a bit of technological advantage over the wizards. Bullets travel fast, and really too fast to defend against. In book seven, we see that apparation is not fast enough to evade a skillfully thrown knife. Also, disillusionment is useless until wizards catch on that they need to adapt for thermal cameras and also silence themselves. I can't personally imagine that disillusionment works for all of the EM spectrum, but know never know, magic is wierd.

However to give some love to the wizard side, consider that the guerilla warfare is orders of magnitude more dangerous. Wizards can be invisible. They can teleport. They can communicate faster than light, and that communication cannot be jammed. They can also travel faster than light, and that can't be jammed either. And Dark Wizards are even more deadly. The Imperious curse would wreck havok in the mugglle government. With a competant caster, there appears to be nothing wrong. They would also retain all their memories, so any kind of polyjuice check would fail. With one efficient dark wizard, you could easily imperious a large portion of government. Here comes nuclear warfare.

Because infiltrator tactics like those give wizards victory in most situations, what can they do if they aren't allowed. Well, first off, legilimency is a very powerful tool, all things considered. But also, consider this. Wizards won't fight muggles the same way they fight wizards. Wizard combat is mostly dueling style, with beam weapons, because more area of effect damage could be canceled or negated. But on muggles? If you transfigure polar bears, and use the impervious charm to make them bullet proof, then portkey them behind enemy lines, it would be carnage. Polar bears would kill and eat just about anything, and are one of the few apex predators which actively hunts, and kills humans. And if you can't shoot it, or outrun it, your Kevlar vest will not help whatsoever. Or, if you are a dark wizard, you can make an inferi horde. Imagine creating Inferi, putting them under an illusion to look normal as well as a Notice-Me-Not, and then leaving them to walk around a populated city.

And finally, while the Muggle world has weapons of mass destruction, so does the Wizarding world. Basilisks. Nundus. Mandrakes. Fiendfyre. Dementers for that matter. All of those options, if used correctly, would kill thousands, millions of muggles. Creatures are the real dangerous part of the wizarding world. Magic outright laughs at the concept of DNA and inheritance, so you can breed a venomous lion porcupine creature, with a firey crustacean, to create 12 foot long, heavily armored lobsters with explode from both ends as a means of propulsion. That, coupled with dragons, and other deadly creatures is a rather terrifying concept.

****************** If Muggles would do something against wizards they have one chance. They have to completely eliminate the wizards during First Strike. Not just that. It would have to be a global, synchronized, all-encompassing first strike. Given how many wizards live amongst muggles, that would be not only genocide on the wizards, but also genocide on your own people. To make a One-Catch-All strategy, muggles would have to sacrifice a lot of lifes of their own. Bullets may travel fast and bombs may kill a lot of people, but the moment wizards catch on, those two option will be neutered by protective charms and by simply vanishing to where muggles can't look - can't even remember to look because those places are simply gone from the collective memory.

I also think you're making this way too complicated. You assume that wizards would attack soldiers. Why? As a wizard I would avoid all serious fights. I would apparate around the cities, cast fiendfyre into the most densely populated part of a city and disapparate. My populace would be situated in tents in caves under Fidelius, while agents would travel around the world in their own tents, casting fiendfyre and the darkest bit of magic I can find until the muggles are either extinct or grovel at my feet, begging for mercy.

The muggles would have one chance. If they miss that window of opportunity, they're done for.
