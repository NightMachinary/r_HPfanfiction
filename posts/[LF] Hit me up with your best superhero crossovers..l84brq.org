Personally I prefer crossovers where Harry gets the powers/identity a single character, and not just something that plops Harry down in the middle of a universe of heroes, but I'll take anything as long as it's well written. I also prefer DC, but I'll take anything.


** Well, may as well self-shill a bit.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2030536][Harry of El.]]\\
^{Doomed planet. Desperate scientists. Last hope. Prophecy. New family. New fate. The Last Mage of Krypton arises.}

Self-shilling done.

Most of the HP/Xovers I know of tend to be Harry in another universe or set in a mixed-verse, not power-transfer.

** Well:

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10305062/1/Speed]])

In which we meet the Prewitt cousin they don't talk about and Ron gets the Speed Force

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12273128/1/Legion]])

In which Mordru has conquered the United Planets of the 31st century and the Legion of superheroes need a powerful magic user to fight him. All the magic users tell them about the almost forgotten legend of Harry Potter.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11648412/1/Death-s-Knight-Revisited]])

In which Harry finds out what he's really been chosen for. His real task was to gather the Hallows. Then Death has a job for him.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7263388/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freak]])

In which Harry meets a hero (only loosely associated with DC) who has the solution to Harry's Voldemort problem.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9640182/1/Intervention]])

In which certain cosmic beings are annoyed that the Hallows even exist, that Tom Riddle has continued to live beyond his life, and finally that Harry is being manipulated into suicide, so they send their errand boy, Boston Brand to fix things.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10283253/1/Leaving-the-Nest]])

Not a Harry Potter cross, just a pure DC story of the young Justice animated universe.

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

  In the 31st Century, Mordru has won. The United Planets is in collapse, EarthGov destroyed, and the Legion decimated and scattered. The Surviving Legionaries decide their only feasible way of fighting back would be to recruit a legendary Magic User. After much debate, they settle on Harry Potter... who turns out to be a bit different than his legend would suggest.

  From June to July 2012 the talented Heather Sinclair produced a wonderful story 'Death's Knight' a crossover of Harry Potter and the New 52 Heroes. Available here: /s/8187641/1/Death-s-Knight. Heather's story ran out of steam, but she gave me permission to adopt it. Where her's started 5 years after the end of the world, mine starts about 20 minutes before.

  It was a normal dismal 16th birthday for Harry in the park near Privet drive. Harry was isolated from everyone he cared for, the Durselys were all being right bastards, and life just plain sucked. Then Harry met a stranger.

***** Oh, lord, don't. I'm just an old guy who has watched far too many movies, far too much TV, read a whole lot of SciFi, Action stories and Comic books.

I just file off the serial numbers, rearrange the words a bit and pass it off as my own. There are no new stories.

** Linkao3(Holly Potter and the Midlife Crisis) is one of the best MCU crossovers I know. I haven't really found many DC crossovers I liked so far, most of what I see is saturated with tropes and edginess.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up. This Fic is now complete!
