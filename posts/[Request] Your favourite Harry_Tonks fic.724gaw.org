Best if fic focus on pairing instead of turning into a harem.

I like this one because it's well written, and both Harry and Tonks are adults. I personally have trouble with the age difference when Harry is 15/16 and Tonks is 22/23.

*** Yeah especially when they're young adults that 7ish year difference is really pronounced, it'd be better if they're older but I don't think I've ever read anything where they are.

  To avoid the unjust prosecution of his friends in the days following the end of the war, Harry Potter signed a magical contract in blood. Years later, Harry struggles with the balance of his latest Auror case involving a wizard ritualistically murdering Muggles, periodic contract renewals, and both the developing and deteriorating relationships with those closest to him. HP/NT.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.

** Does anyone know the name of the fic where Harry and Tonks started dating during his 6th year I think? I read it a long time ago and can't for the life of me remember the name of it.

In this fic Tonks has an auror team, she's best friends with one of them and slept with him once when her fianc√© cheated and beat her. Her partner dies during the fic. It's also mentioned that she dated Bill Weasley at some point. I think Harry also gets some training from Borgin in the Wompong Willow.

Stories where Harry gets seriously rigorous training and becomes appropriately powerful are some of my favorites.
