I will have a go at pretty much anything though it might bot always take the direction you anticipate.


** Hmm... okay. :) If you find them interesting, these should keep you and anyone else occupied for a while.

- Harry has always been a mysterious element to the rest of Hogwarts' population: quiet, apathetic, and seemingly bemused at people's behaviors. One night, Lavender Brown spies him from Gryffindor Tower's windows walking down to the edge of the Forbidden Forest, bathed in the glory of shining moonlight, to meet a cloaked figure. She quickly realizes his terrifying secret.
- Male veela exist but are rare and sequestered away from the world by their much more numerous female counterparts. When Fleur meets Harry, she immediately knows what he is, much to her inward panic.\\
  Why is she panicking?\\
  When male veela go through their "flowering" sometime around their early teens, they become hyper-aggressive, easily provoked, territorial, and incredibly resistant to magic, like a silver-back gorilla on an unholy mix of methamphetamine, cocaine, and PCP.\\
  By the time the Goblet spits out his name, Harry has begun to slowly enter the first stage of this part of his life-cycle.\\
  Fleur believes his innocence to not only try to placate him and to stop him from going on a rampage, but also because no veela would be stupid enough to enter something as strenuous as the Triwizard at such a critical time in their life.
- Since coming to Hogwarts, Harry has always been shy and introverted, often vanishing for hours at a time outside classes. Even Dumbledore is mystified.\\
  A character hears him muttering to himself in a strange, seemingly inhuman language one day, and much to his and everyone else's surprise, they answer back fluently. Harry is happy to meet someone who has a connection to somewhere he was raised.
- Harry books passage aboard a klingon ship. He unintentionally terrifies the klingon crew by trying to be friendly and doing things that'd normally kill other humans and klingons (perks of being a wizard).
- Shunted out of reality and out of phase with everything else, Harry (in his boredom) wanders Azeroth. Unfortunately, his mere presence causes ripples, and he ends up being worshiped as a new loa by various troll cultures, a new god by various primitive cultures in Northrend, and as the Unseen Emperor of the nerubians.\\
  He has no idea and continues to wander.
- After the War, Harry lives as a wandering hermit in the wilderness of the UK: dense forests, snow-capped mountains, and even caves mean little, courtesy of basic magical skills.\\
  When he's tracked down by his old friends and acquaintances, he's terrified: he was in hiding from an enamored supernatural presence. And his friends just led her right to him.
- Harry's child from an alternate timeline arrives in the past: her mission? Ensure her parents get together in Back to the Future style hijinks. Unfortunately, another child of his from yet another girl from a second timeline arrives with the same mission...
- In a world where Draco Malfoy never existed and instead a female Malfoy child was born, "Dracina" comes to the horrifying realization one day that she has a crush on her 'hated' rival, Harry. Her confused actions after this revelation utterly unnerve Harry.
- Arriving in Equestria like a flaming splat of bird shit, Harry vaporizes the current Big Bad by quite literally landing on their head.\\
  Ponies celebrate: he's just freaking out that he now has hooves, wings, and a horn!
- Harry's Earth is quite literally a Death World compared to even other settings, like Buffy's Earth, and it's saturated into the very fabric of his being. As he wanders around doing tourist trap things, his presence causes many in that setting to panic because they think a 'Big Bad' of their setting is wandering around (e.g. pure demons for Buffy, Outsiders and Fallen Angels for Dresden, et cetera) and doing parts of a nefarious plan.
- Harry wakes up with wings and the ability to spit stone-melting venom. He's surprisingly nonplussed about it.
- Harry has happily settled down with his wife and has the ideal family life that he always wanted: a house with a fence, a dog, a loving wife, and three adorable kids.\\
  However, his wife has a massive secret/double-life she keeps from him (think odd, like a princess of an entire magical nation, the crime-lady in charge of a continental-spanning empire, a demoness in charge of an entire circle of Hell, a goddess of an old pantheon, et cetera).\\
  It's becoming increasingly hard to hide this life from him, but he seems quite nonchalant/nonplussed about a growing list of oddities and giveaways that occur on a weekly basis, as he grew up in the magical world/his colorful Hogwarts life -- he simply doesn't see them as being odd.
- The reason the Weasleys don't talk about their squib accountant cousin? He works for Wolfram and Hart, and his wife is one of the more peaceful demons out there who he met at work.\\
  Much to the Weasleys' horror, he hits it off with their half-demoness daughter.
- In an attempt to dispose of the Hallows, Harry chucks them through the Veil. After all, it's a doorway to the afterlife, right?\\
  Unfortunately, they land in Westeros and create a self-replicating inferi plague. The Night King, ready to march south, suddenly finds himself and the other White Walkers being assaulted by hordes of feral inferi attracted to death... which happens to be him and his fellow Walkers, as they're the biggest source around. Worse still, they're infecting and subverting his dead on 'killing' them!\\
  The shoe is suddenly on the other foot.
- Harry accidentally becomes a Lich. He and another unlikely character try to keep his secret as they go about their daily Hogwarts life.
- After being universally displaced, Harry wakes up on the throne-world of a minor goa'uld lord. After some misunderstandings occur, he kills the goa'uld with his magic. Unfortunately, the human population and jaffa believe him to be an even more powerful goa'uld (a 'god') that just stole his predecessor's shit like they always do. Not knowing what else to do, he maintains the charade. He realizes he's over his head when he sees the jaffa re-tattoo the 'symbol' on their heads with something associated with him.\\
  Like most lies and deceptions, it snowballs until he's viewed as a peer by the rest of the System Lords. Welp.

*** I don't mind. I am feeling a bit uninspired and sad about my current fic and need jumpstarting. Crossovers I can't do unless I know the other fandom however.

**** How about Harry noticing his accidental magic, but instead of jumping to the common â€˜I'm a wizard and must learn magic' he instead concludes that he is a god and thus, to get more powerful he must make the population of Little Whining start to worship him (maybe he had read American Gods?), the blood wards hide this from the ministry, and so by the time his letter arrives he has been continually breaking the laws of secrecy and underage wizardry.

Or maybe a Drabble in which Harry is summoned to another dimension a la 0800-rent-a-hero, but instead of the summoners getting a hero who had killed Voldemort they get Harry Potter, also called Death destroyer of worlds, the pale rider, horseman of the apocalypse who killed Voldemort along with every other human when he and the other horseman's brought the end of all things, and now the order is unwittingly asking him to end their world. Could be a standard HP story, or could be a crossover with either Supernatural or Good Omens, if with GO, maybe have him bring Adam (the Antichrist) with him. Alternatively maybe the whole prophecy of the apocalypse was the muggle interpretation of a prophecysed war between muggles and magicals that the magicals won.
