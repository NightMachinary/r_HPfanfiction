#+TITLE: Given the possibility imbued in at least one of Voldemort’s horcruxes, do you think it likely he “backed up” his memories and locked them away somewhere on the off-chance one of them were to come to life?

** It did not "come to life," it IS and always WAS alive. It's a piece of his SOUL, which holds memories and consciousness. If you split the soul, you split the consciousness. The Diary Horcrux was just the only one where Voldemort actually deliberately gave it the means and tools to interact with the world and other people around it, in a much more complete manner than the others were capable of. :)

*** First, yes, you're right. I suppose what I meant when I said "come to life" was "form a new body".

The Diary was the first Horcrux, created while he was still in Hogwarts. The first war would have ended sometime in Voldemort's 50s-60s, if I'm not mistaken. It just seems to odd to me that the Diary would be his most advance, most useful Horcrux when he must have had a veritable horde more knowledge when he created the others.

It is possible he realized that the Diary's ability to form a new body was a /mistake/ and was a "default configuration" of a Horcrux of which he removed, via his more comprehensive knowledge of the process, when he created his later Horcruxes.

** Er, I think that was true of all the Horcruxes. Being a part of his soul, each could potentially have come to life, either through possession or through getting itself a body; each had a consciousness and Voldemort's memories up to that point. Of course, it was only an encouraged feature in the Diary, where he had done all he could to make the process happen, whereas the other Horcruxes didn't have as obvious a way for the soulshard to reach out and possess someone.

*** That's likely to be true, but not really what I was asking. :p

There's no confirmation either way, so I just left it at "at least one".

**** What i also meant that in my view, memories wouldn't have been enough to allow embodiment; only a bit of human soul can possess another human soul. Now, he /could/ use his memories to create a Portrait-style copy of himself, but make it a statue rather than a portrait; the issue with that is that the statue could never use magic, which would be extremely frustrating for a being who "remembered" being Lord Voldemort.

***** I think... we're still talking about two separate things. Let me be a tad more specific.

Given that Voldemort knew that at least one of his Horcruxes could gain a body of their own, do you think he would have left memories leading up to his death so that the Horcrux which gained a body (such as a Diary, had it been successful) would be able to "catch up", as it were?

****** Aaaah! I get it now. Hm. No, I don't think so. As I said, I think even Diarymort was just supposed to possess the Hogwarts student, and its gaining a body and trying to become a full person was Diarymort's /own/ scheme, not what Voldemort intended.

** Why would Voldemort need a back up of his memories while his actual memories were still intact? Horcruxes are all the backup he'd need, since that would keep his actual consciousness 'alive' as a spectre.

*** You're referring to the main soul. The 'less-than-a-wraith' Voldemort. But at least /one/ of the Horcruxes seemed to be able to form their own bodies, but were only aware of themselves to the point of their creation. The backup of memories I was referring to were for the Horcruxes, not Voldemort's "dominant" soul.

** This has always been something that confused me, im not sure if it was a plot hole or what. But if diarymort succeeded in regaining his form, then there would have been a second voldemort running around. That couldnt have been what voldemort intended when creating the horcruxen, and doesnt seem to gel with how the rest of them work. The enemy voldemort from the series wasnt spawned from any horcrux, they are all accounted for and destroyed. He seems to be the same shade that got killed on halloween

*** Let me clear things up. Coming to life isn't what Horcruxes were /meant/ for (they just act as anchors for the original bit of soul).

/But/, of course, the soul-shard has its own consciousness and has the latent capability to possess people. Voldemort, being a horrible genius, thought to make this "glitch" into a "feature" by encouraging Diarymort to possess someone and so fulfill Voldemort's own will in reopening the Chamber of Secrets in his stead. This was the original plan, at least, the one Diarymort knew; but it seems that Voldemort's fear of death had grown stronger over time, such that his adult self kept the Diary at Malfoy's indefinitely, never actually delivering on his intention to order Lucius to plant it at Hogwarts.

As a result, by 1993, Diarymort had spent 50 goddamn years in the Diary with no one to talk to. So he started out fulfilling his original utility function, but as the year passed and he learned that his true self was (as far as Ginny knew) dead and gone, he decided that what the hell, why should he be a good boy and stay in his prison of a Diary if his original self was no longer around anyway? Instead, he figured out a way to fashion himself a new body, intent on taking up his vanished other's self mantle of being Lord Voldemort.

There's a bit of debate on whether Diarymort would have independantly sought out the main Voldemort and made him a body, and, supposing he didn't, would have happened if/when the original Voldemort-wraith came back to full strength on his own. (Would the two fight, reluctantly form an alliance, or would Diarymort submit to his master-soul?) But those are the basics.
