** Ah, why not? I can take a teeny break from my Kingdom Hearts longfic (342,000 words and counting!)

*Harry, Katie and the Couch*

"Harry, what...is that?" Katie asked, staring at her husband.

"This?" Harry answered, hefting the weapon. "This is a halberd. It's a polearm, traditionally used in two-handed combat, especially against cavalry."

"And why do you have it?" Katie asked, putting her hands on her hips. "Harry..."

"I was thinking this would be perfect for the couch--the proper couch that is. This is far too long to be effective in the love seat."

"Harry...darling...husband," Katie said slowly. "Why are you planning on putting a weapon in our couch?"

"Protection!" Harry said excitedly. "This would be absolutely a measure of protection."

"Protection from what?" Katie asked. "Nargles?"

"No..." Harry said. "Why, has Luna said anything?"

"She hasn't actually," Katie said. "Though she'll probably be by before long, she left her slippers behind the last time she came for tea, and as I understand it, she's been barefoot for the last week."

"Ah," Harry chuckled. "Classic Luna."

"Harry, enough about Luna for the moment," Katie said. "What do you think we need protection from?"

"Death Eaters out for revenge, regular renegade dark wizards, dementors, any number of Hagrid's pets except for Fang..." Harry said counting off on his fingers. "Umbridge, Rita Skeeter..."

"Skeeter?" Katie asked. "Is she why you've lined all of our windows with screens and tazers?"

*ZAP!*

"Yes," Harry said. "I find that most effective...now, setting the halberd aside, what should we do with this katana?"

"Katana?!" Katie shouted. "Harry, where did you get a katana?"

"Kreacher found it from a friend of his in Chicago, if you can believe that," Harry said. "Wish I spoke Japanese, there's a name on this sword I can't make out."

"And where are you going to put the katana?!" Katie asked. "Over the mantle?!"

"No, no," Harry said. "The fireplace is connected to the Floo Network. That's where the steel-toothed bear trap is."

"Harry...sweetie..." Katie said. "Husband...you're acting a little bit overboard with all these safety measures, don't you think?"

"I don't want to take any chances," Harry said. "I want to keep you safe..."

"And that's very sweet of you..." Katie said. "But what about..."

"YAAAAH!"

"Oh," Harry said. "That would be the trap I set for journalists..."

"Harry..." Katie said. "Please tell me you didn't just trap Luna."

--------------

"Luna, I am so, so, so, so sorry," Katie said. "And Harry's sorry too!"

Luna was bound from neck to ankles with rope, dangling by her toes from the chandelier. A dozen swords were positioned so that if she were to move so much as an inch in any direction, she'd be cut into pieces.

"I do not mind that much," Luna said dreamily. "This is a far more interesting death trap than the one I accidentally triggered in Peru."

"And what were you doing in Peru?"

"Looking for a Swooping Neet-eagle," Luna said. "But there was nothing to bind me in that tomb. Just a very large boulder that was far too perfectly round that chased me."

"Hold still, Luna," Harry said. "I'll get you down..."

"Take all the time you desire," Luna said. "It's not often I get to dangle upside down--there weren't many trees suitable for dangling by my knees on the grounds of Hogwarts, don't you know. But if you could vanish the swords..."

"Not vanishing," Harry said. "But I'll set them aside...let's see, here's the gladius and the rapier and the scimitar and the claymore and the falchion and the two dao and the saber and the gari and the dha and the urumi..."

Katie watched the growing pile of swords with an increasingly aghast expression. She glanced back up at Harry.

"And there we go...that's the last of them," Harry said, sheathing a cutlass. "And Luna...hold still and I'll get you down. Oy, I said hold still!"

"Harry!" Luna squealed. "I have to say, this tickles very much. You'd be better off to just...ah ha ha!"

Luna broke into an absolute fit of giggles, even though Harry was no longer even trying to undo the knots tying her toes to the chandelier.

"Er..."

Katie pulled her wand out and summoned the loveseat. She flicked her wand again and Luna dropped from the chandelier onto the small couch.

"Oh, thank you Katie," Luna said. "This is most comfortable."

"Harry," Katie said. "We need to talk..."

"I understand your frustration," Luna piped up. "But Harry was only doing this because he wants to protect you. And his measures will protect the baby as well."

"Baby?" Harry blurted. "Wait, what baby?"

"Er..." Katie said.

*** If looks could kill.... everything would be as it should be. But it wasn't.

The Basilisk was feeling extremely annoyed. Her first master and father died and left her all alone. Her second master left her for fifty years without any warning and came back to act like a jerk. Her newest master seems nicer, but she was let down before too many times, so when he got pulled away by that stuck up bird, she decided to follow him. A bit of ancient and confusing magic later and she was on the surface, bipedal. And her master was getting crowded by sniveling humans instead of being with her, and no matter how much she glared at them they would NOT DIE!!

However, I can't help but notice that you've almost completely shafted Ron. What about Ron and Lavender talking through the reasons they didn't work out and trying again? Or better yet, starting their relationship the first time around for better reasons than spiting Hermione and Ginny?

******** Actually she made an unprovoked and violent attack. If his relationship really wasn't anything to do with her, there's no particular reason for him to focus on her having kissed Viktor Krum. He should have said something about how he's not interested in Hermione and doesn't have to be in a relationship with her if he doesn't want to, but he never said anything about how he felt or didn't feel about her. That's telling IMO. He was hurting and not over her. And he never talked about that with Lavender; they didn't talk much at all. So it wasn't resolved.

********* She was attacking him for snogging Lavender. He focused on her kissing Krum because he wanted to turn her objections back on her, and he'd just learned that she'd supposedly kissed Krum. It's not like there was an active conversation on the topic of Ron's relationship with Lavender. It was just Hermione attacking him, and then Ron ranting to Harry.

" 'She can't complain, he told Harry, 'She's snogged Krum. So she's found out someone wants to snog me too. Well, it's a free country. I haven't done anything wrong.

-Chapter 15, Half Blood Prince (Late chapter fifteen)

He then says how he didn't think he had been in a relationship with her that led to any sort of obligation that meant he couldn't snog Lavender.

"...just as friends...I'm a free agent..."

I said, aloud, "Oh, ta gueule Remus, you blood bastard." I think my stars every day that nobody else was in the room when this happened. Like, I didn't mean to say something so rude(I know I could've been more like "Taisez-vous, s'il vous pla√Æt" but it's much longer and doesn't really fit the context. and at the time, I had completely forgotten the existence of 'Tais-toi' which I probably should've used at it's much less crass than ta gueule.) But the point is, I curse a lot in French. Like, a lot. I'm also very crude in French. Most people I know don't speak French and so it's a great alternative.
