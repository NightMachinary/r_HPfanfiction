:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Don't really remember any details of the fic except it's end battle. Instead of wasting time hunting horcruxes, Harry goes for the Kill and he alone defeats Voldemort in a duel (and while dodging he manages to get some death eaters that were watching to get hit with Voldemort's own spells) , killing him. As there still are horcruxes, Voldemort instead of dying turns again into a wraith. Harry traps wraight Voldemort (memory is a bit vague here, I think he trapped him into a bottle or some other object or something) and then send said object into space. Trapped into space , thousands upon thousands of kilometers away from any help, Voldemort was never going to be a danger again, so there was no need to go after horcruxes. And Harry still scolds Moody at the end, saying it was really easy to defeat Voldemort and someone should have done sooner.

"Was this all part of your plan, Harry?"

I read this prompt and couldn't help but get JoJo flashbacks.

**** Thanks. However I doubt I will use this. Every time I put Exclamatory mark, my keyboard automatically adds a space. And it is annoying as hell to write a Few alphabets, then notice the space, then delete everything to the space and write again!! XD
