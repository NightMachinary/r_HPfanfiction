** My favourite AU trilogy' first piece is linkffn(Promises Unbroken) by Robin4. It was written before the fifth book, but the first four year and before is also not canon. Basically Sirius was the secret holder, he didn't became traitor... So Voldemort is still around and the war is still ongoing. Also living, adult Maraduers! I love the world building and that the enemy is a real threat.

*** I liked the premise but not the writing, idk why. I couldn't get through half of the first one before I gave up. Like I honestly have no idea why I don't like it. The grammar's fine, the style's not offputting, etc. Maybe it's just one of those things.

** - The Phoenix and the Serpent: a complete re-imagining of the post-GoF situation. So many interesting takes on canon characters, as well as wonderfully crafted OC's. Aspects like the Broom Brigade, the metal golems, the Black Patriarch, or even Dahlia. Well worth it even if abandoned.
- Skitterleap: this is probably the most original version of "What if Grindelwald won the famous duel?" that I have ever come across. A non-stop roller coaster that teaches you as it drags you along for the ride.
- Hogwarts Battle School: you know all those people who wax poetic about the horrible safety standards at Hogwarts? Yeah, they need to read this fic. What if Harry Potter met Ender's Game.
- Also throw in the Alexandra Quick series, though thats more AU following Fantastic Beasts than anything else.

*** My problem with Skitterleap is that it is so original that it in no way reminds the Harry Potter. It really could just as well be an original novel. I also feel that's the weakest fic from enembee in general.

*** Alexandra Quick doesn't really follow Fantastic Beasts, if you are referring to the movies that is. It does take place in America but it features a completely OC cast and really the only way it is related to Harry Potter is that is takes place in the general universe. Books 1-7 are cannon and in the recent past but they have little bearing on the story. It is AU in that it was written before the days of Pottermore and JK expanding upon the potterverse and it's wider world, the magical world of America in the AQ series is completely unique and not from the Fantastic Beasts canon.

That being said, I highly recommend the series. Don't let the OC cast put you off. The characters are compelling and well thought out. The story is intriguing and original, it could easily be its own set of original novels.

** It depends on what you mean by AU.

I break AUs into three categories: Divergent, Different but Similar and Full/True.

Divergent is straightforward. Follows canon, but an event changes the path. More commonly known as For Want of A Nail. This can only considered an AU in the broadest definition of term as the ideal story of this kind would be entirely within the canon world but one event goes differently (for example: Ginny dies during the Chamber of Secrets) and future events change accordingly. The best example of this category would be linkffn(Forging The Sword), for it's nailing of canon characterizations, good magic (it's not top tier "magical theory" but better than the vast majority of fanfiction) and sheer brilliance in how it handles the butterfly effect. For some honorable mentions:

- linkffn(What You Leave Behind). A brilliant fic, with three points of departure instead of just the one which is the main reason I have decided to name it an honorable mention. Great magic, a fun Hogwarts and incredible whimsy.
- linkffn(The One He Feared). Another damn brilliant fic, but one cut short by overly clever plot planning, giving it an honorable mention.e Amazing magic, best canon Dumbledore characterization and matches canon tone/style very well.

Different but Similar fics are AUs in which the worldbuilding and magic may be different yet the story still follows the general canon direction. A better description might be Canon+, wherein the story is essentially canon plus a few changes and added complexity. I can't really give a single best, as stories that fit the category better might be worse than ones which don't fit it quite as well. So have a list of honorable mentions instead:

- One of the more currently popular examples of Canon+ is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). Many would call this a full-on AU, but I disagree. The plot is literally canon plus extra details and worldbuilding. Voldemort goes to kill the Potter children as one of them is likely the child of Trelawney's prophecy. One of them survives the Killing Curse somehow and Harry ends up being raised by the Dursleys. He discovers during the first school year that the Philosopher's Stone is hidden in Hogwarts and he foils Voldemort's attempt (via possessed Quirrell) to obtain it. Second year is about the Chamber of Secrets which has been opened because He-of-the-Great-Hair (Lucius Malfoy)>! slips the Dairy-Horcrux to a Weasley. Also features !<Gilderoy "Lying about my past" Lockhart>! as the Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor. Third year is Sirius no longer in Azkaban and now everyone is losing their shit. In Fourth year we know (from Chapter 1) that the Triwizard Tournament happens, Voldemort is "resurrected" in Little Hangleton and (I'm 95% sure on this) Dumbledore knows Peter Pettigrew is involved in said "resurrection." !< Yes, that is literally the plot stripped down for both the first four books of canon and the first three years and one chapter of fourth year for HPPoS. Most of first year is absolute garbage, things get really interesting at the end of first year and really picks up in second year. Third year is still a little early to tell the quality of. Brought down by: the utterly insane decision to fit multiple years in one story with the length each year has been, a few absolutely terrible decisions and bonkers pacing.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux). I felt the need to include this as an example, but it is the worst of this category that I'm naming.
- linkffn(By the Divining Light; Conloadh's Song). Good fics by enembee with a Neville BWL featuring Old Magic. From Divining Light, we know that essentially the important plotlines of the first three canon books occur (Stone, Chamber, Sirius Black, Tournament) with a few things flipped (aforementioned Neville BWL, evil Sirius, genius Harry) and Conloadh's Song has Umbridge trying to do Umbridge-y things as well as Occlumency lessons for Neville.
- linkffn(Lesser Evils by ScottPress). I've discussed this story often, but a dark!Harry that diverges after Little Hangleton, with changes to worldbuilding regarding Voldemort, Grindlewald, Horcruxes, the family Black and so on and so forth.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone). One of my two favorite fics. Takes place in the summer between CoS and PoA with extra worldbuilding (focusing on goblins and the Sorting Hat).

Full/True AUs are exactly that, the essence of Alternate Universe. Noncanon plotlines, noncanon worldbuilding and noncanon magic. I believe [[https://www.reddit.com/u/Ihateseatbelts][/u/Ihateseatbelts]]' criminally underrated linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome), the other of my two favorite fics, is the best of these. Great magical theory, a Wizarding World that truly feels like its own culture that diverged from the rest of humankind centuries ago, a great vocabulary, every character has a unique voice, magical synesthesia in the form of Wandsong is brilliantly handled, a version of wizarding religion that I think is the most realistic as compared to the faux-paganism it usually is and all the small touches. The only thing I dislike is the update rate. No honorable mentions, because I don't feel like writing a bunch more for this comment but check out The Skitterleap and PotDK if you haven't already.

*** Huh. You'd think that "Harry gets serious about training to beat Voldemort" has been done to death, raised from Horcrux, and then re-killed, but Forging the Sword was really impressive. Fleshed-out characters who have their own drives and sometimes clash with each other, who have to really work and pay the price for what they get and still don't always succeed, with quality prose backing them up. I know it was being delayed; any idea if it's still going to be completed?

** PODTK, the Firebird Trilogy, and Black Luminary are my three. I can't choose one as they each do something incredible in their own right.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom is a Voldemort won AU that hits Voldemorts character out of the park, /as well as keeping Harry in character./ Incredible characterizations, engaging plot, but unfortunately abandoned.

The Firebird Trilogy takes a matriarchal society and changes every facet of life. Quidditch is no longer played by males; they are far too valuable to risk. The covers are truly amazing and terrifying, far more moving than generic politicking we usually see. All in all despite the dystopia, there is a lot of uniqueness and creativity. Complete.

Black Luminary is a currently updating AU that still has lots of secrets to be revealed. Featuring a host of OC's and original events we have a promising story. After the fall of Grindelwald a group of light purebloods form the "Pillars", a political powerhouse. Families like the Blacks are found themselves reviled, and Harry Black is no exception. It's been one hell of a ride and I can't wait for us to learn more. My only complain is the characterization falls flat at times, but everything else is nothing short of incredible. The Lethifold Arc was really damn good.

To me the most interesting thing about Firebird Trilogy is how it takes the unequality of magical cores so often seen in fanfiction and not only have it have an actual impact on the setting, but it builds the setting around it.

I really didn't like what happened with Hermione. Given the nature of the marriage it felt arbitrary and against the spirit of what went before. I've seen other people on here say the same.

I also disagree with you about Harry's eventual job. He'd never had any kind of inclination towards wand making before and for him to end up doing a boring job felt like a total waste of his power. Yes gender-based wands was a Big Thing in the story but that doesn't mean that he had to end up there.

Just to reiterate - I loved the story. It's only the last few paragraphs that I really don't like.

I also find that the first book is almost impossible to reread. Hermione spends so much time being wet and pathetic. On first read you can sympathise but having read it and knowing what came next I just wished she'd pull herself together and get on with it.

Contrast with White Squirrel's other long book, the Accidental Animagus, which I didn't like as much on first read but preferred second time around. Except for the waste of words on that Quidditch alternative.

** Linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) was the first AU I ever really enjoyed. It has a highly believable twist on the way blood purity affects status for starters, then adds in magic from around the world, some fantastic battle scenes and great storytelling.

Linkffn(Quoth the Raven, Nevermore by GenkaiFan) probably won't be to everyone's taste but I enjoyed the way it merged Harry into the Real World by adding to existing legends. Hmm. Need to reread this one.

Linkffn(A Different Halloween by robst). Yes. That robst. His problem when writing is that he never ever gives Harry a hard time, but in this story he doesn't even pretend. It's a tale of a happy upbringing in the wizarding world and doesn't pretend to have tension or drama in it. It works somehow. Good as a feelgood story when you're feeling down.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion by Driftwood1965). I don't normally read bashing stories but this is the exception because it's funny not malicious. One of the few "funny" stories that actually raises a smile.

And yet, it's really a story of healing, of using the memory of that tragedy to build relationships stronger and deeper than before, to fix his own mistakes and protect the people he cares about.

** Probably linkffn(Changes in a Time of War) by Miranda Flairgold

It's so AU that Harry changes his name and is referred to through the next 3 books of the story by that name. Hogwarts and Voldemort, as well as everyone in England are tertiary at best to the story of Harry at his new school.

Basically... if you took a completely different story and then said "by the way, the MC is actually Harry Potter". ...but in a good way

** Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin or Prince of the Dark Kingdom would probably be my top picks, but since those are already linked here (I think), a couple up-and-coming AUs are linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) which is a political AU with a Slytherin trio. It's also the first in a series, and iirc the author is currently on the third one. linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19) is another great and unique AU which features an immortal Salazar Slytherin as the ruler of Wizarding Britain and a well-developed caste system. I really like how Tom Riddle's character is portrayed in this one.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

***** Go read the spoiler sections of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/95sfxn/whats_the_best_most_extensive_au_youve_ever_seen/e3vf9wr][this comment]] I just wrote.

tl;dr Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin so far is literally the canon storyline with extra bells and whistles. Hell, I can guarantee that Harry's "Slytherin way" of doing things is going to actually fail for the first time if The Sinister Man reaches the end of fifth year which is "coincidentally" the first time canon!Harry's way of doing things actually failed for the first time.

Additional/partly different worldbuilding is not the only ingredient that makes an extensive AU. A different core story is required as well.

EDIT: Hell, this definitely should be considered a canon rehash since many of the worldbuilding changes were done to help justify why the canon plot points still occur even though there are so many other changes that, on their own, would more than justify those plot points not occurring.

EDIT 2 ELECTRIC BOOGALOO: Just to be clear, I actually /like/ Prince of Slytherin. I just refuse to pretend it is something it isn't.

**** Being a canon rehash and an extensive AU are not mutually exclusive in my eyes. Yes, basic canon plot events (Quirrel goes after the stone, The diary petrifies people, etc) happen, but they happen in completely different ways. Characters' motivations are different, the actual mechanisms are totally different, and all of the background lore is very different.

Also, between each of these stations of canon we see lots of stuff that's not in the canon books. These lend the fic a huge AU feel that other fics (that just skip from station to station) don't have.

The question put forth by the OP is "What's the best, most extensive AU you've ever seen?" Prince of Slytherin is not the most extensive AU due in part to it's reliance upon the canon plot.

I've seen a couple super super out there AUs, but none of them had the quality of PoS. PoS is very good, and pretty AU. It also handles the AU element it has better than anything I've ever seen.

The only fics that was more AU that I liked as much were probably Island of Fire and Elizium for Sleepless Souls. I'll try and read through a few fics with bigger AUs, but I tried a couple already mentioned in this thread (e.g. Pureblood Pretense, Sacrifices Arc) and didn't really like them as much.
