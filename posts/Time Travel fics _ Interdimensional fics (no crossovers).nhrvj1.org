Looking for some good complete time travel or interdimensional fics (no crossovers, pref no slash). Any length above 20K is ok.

On FFN or AO3


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12446118/1/Intersecting-Realities]]

124K words. Complete. Harry/Fleur (The romance is not the focus of the story).

Slytherin!Harry who has just beaten Voldemort recently and is about to live happily ever after with his girlfriend is summoned by Manipulative!Dumbledore into a universe where his counterpart died. He's understandably super pissed but instead of acting how you'd expect fics like this to go (bashing Dumbles and the Order the whole fic while dealing with Voldy anyways), he empties his dead counterpart's Gringotts vault, put it in a trunk, and does another Universe Jump to try and get back home, thinking that the Manipulative!Dumbles who summoned him can go fuck himself and deal with his Voldemort problem on his own.

His Universe Jump fails and he ends up in an universe where his counterpart is alive but a girl at the end of Fourth Year. After his failure, he realises that even if he jumps again, there's no guarantee he'll end up in HIS OWN universe and he has no way of going back home to the love of his life so he might as well settle in this Girl-Who-Lived world and try to make himself a new life while he's there.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** So, I seemed to have not saved that many as I thought but they're unfinished anyways. Here's a few I like that /are/ finished-

Pretty good, a few plot twists, made my brain flare a bit but that was because I was tired when I read it lol. It's time-travel

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope]]

A lot of people have heard of this one so I wouldn't be surprised if you have too, just here making sure, it's good and dimensional-travel

​

** Harry travels back to the point where Voldemort first dies, basically fixes everything in the course of two chapters (fun quick two-shot read): linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17732855]])

Basilisk Born: Harry travels to Merlin's time after the dementor attack; some people don't like it but I thought it had a really cool plot development and the writing is quite decent. It is quite long, but it was completed recently at 72 chapters. Summary might seem a bit cliche but give it a chance if you have time. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born]])

​

Windshear: Harry transported to the 70s during Voldemort's rise to power. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear]])
