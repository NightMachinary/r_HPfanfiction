Dennis is fine too, I suppose. A fic where Colin becomes main cast and yet stays written in character is ideal. I'd like to see Harry come to terms with his fanboy.


** A fellow AFC writer, Cheddartrek, did a very nice one-shot featuring Colin: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8461800/1/The-Twine-Bracelet][The Twine Bracelet]].

*** The Twine Bracelet is easily one of the best fanfics I've read, imo. I definitely second this one.

Also, I had no idea you frequented this place. Awesome to see a big hp ff name here. Your stories are very enjoyable. :)

**** Thank you for your kind words.

That said, my being a "big ff name" is debatable. I wrote a few stories, nothing remarkable. And [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]], [[/u/wordhammer]], and [[/u/Taure]] all haunt the sub and are more accomplished writers than I.

***** Maybe you're not a big big name, but you're certainly someone people should have heard of imo, you're in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP_5_Starred_and_Featured_Authors/84507/][the DLP 5-Starred and Featured Authors Community]] and in both HHH2 and HHH3, and I've often seen you mentioned. Might be because I pay more attention to DLP stuff though.
