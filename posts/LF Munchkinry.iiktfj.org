Anything where characters use the abilities they have in creative or unconventional ways.

Like HJPEV trying to use a time turner to fiind the answer to literally any verifiable question, or Milo from The Natural 20 exploiting combinations of DnD and HP magic, or Graham and Lily in Wizard's Guide to Banking exploiting polyjuice and sperms banks to clone muggleborns.

Bonus points if the results are hilariously OP and completely change the rules of the game for everyone else, resulting in a unique setting.

This is literally the story that made me discover the term munchkinry.
