Hello all,

I was just daydreaming and found myself thinking about this scenario. Does anybody have a recommendation that fits this description? Ideally they would both be raising Harry, not either or. Thanks!


** The Stealing Harry series on Archive of Our Own is an interesting one. It goes through most of Harry's third year I think before the author quit, but the author did leave notes on how it was going to finish out. The characterization is kinda out there, but it's worth a try.

** Many years ago I started reading [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/58157][Stealing Harry]] by Copperbadge. It was a really popular story when it was being written, but I never finished it. I'm not a big Sirius/Remus shipper and couldn't get very far into it. Looks like it's been expanded into a pretty large series since then though!

** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/691439/whydoyouneedtoknow][Dangerverse]] features Sirius and Remus, as well as a bunch of others, raising Harry. And it's a damn good read too.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6036153/1/Torn][Torn]] is a big one rec'd on TvTropes. I haven't read it yet [Harry being raised by marauders is not my glass of kool-aid] but I think you might enjoy it. Harry is five when Sirius all but kidnaps him and unlike those listed below, this one is complete and rather long.

edit for my derpy formatting

*** Actually, "Torn" is not about that. As far as I remember, Sirius escapes from Azkaban and worried Dumbledore arranges for Remus and Emmeline Vance to take Harry in. Meanwhile Sirius stumbles upon the Burrow and kind of becomes Ron's pet (it takes him some time to discover Peter is in there too). Sirius and Harry don't meet until the last chapters, I think.

On the other hand, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2129089/1/Truths][Truths]] Series by the same author should fit the requirments.

** Sirius /and/ Remus? Let's see:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1733937/1/Scenes-From-Another-Life][Scenes From Another Life]] by Atalan (one-shot, mild Sirius/Remus)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2109424/1/Living-with-Danger][Living with Danger]] by whydoyouneedtoknow (series in progress, Sirius/OFC, Remus/OFC, eventual Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, Draco/Luna)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7679830/1/A-Twist-of-Fate][A Twist of Fate]] by Emcee Frodis (in progress, Sirius/OFC)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8423267/1/A-Life-More-Ordinary][A Life More Ordinary]] by nursie91 (in progress, gen, lots of hurt!Remus)

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]] by MarauderLover7 (sequel in progress, eventual Remus/Tonks, past Sirius/Marlene McKinnon) probably fits. Or not. Harry's eight or nine when Sirius takes him away from the Dursleys.

This doesn't start with raising Harry, but along the way I'm pretty sure Sirius and Remus raise harry together...starts in third year. It has been a long time since I've ready it, and theres sequels for fourth year onwards... I really enjoyed them anyway.
