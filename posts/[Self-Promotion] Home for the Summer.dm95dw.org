Hello everyone!

This is a short story I wrote about an incident occurring during the summer following the Battle of Hogwarts. It's a bit spooky. I'd welcome feedback if you'd like to provide any.

** Hi.

Before I start, I'd like to say that I've never written a story, nor do I possess any great faculty for criticism. I realise that it's much easier to critique than to write, so please don't take any of the following as a personal attack upon your abilities.

I really like the premise of your story, but I think you may be falling into the "she said, this, then she said that, then she did this, then she did that" mode of writing. You - the author - is telling the reader Hermione's inner thoughts rather than having Hermione herself express them.

Take the following excerpt:

"The imminent threat gone, Hermione wanted nothing more than to leave - to apparate to The Burrow or Grimmauld Place and revel in the comfort of her friends - but thoughts of her defenseless parents forced her to remain where she was."

Could be instead expressed as a stream of conciousness:

/It's gone, but there could be more out there. I need to get out of here. The Burrow, or Grimmauld Place. No! My parents are here, I can't just leave them!/

The relief at the immediate menace defeated. The fear of as yet unknown danger. The thought of escape followed by the realisation that loved ones are at risk.

I look forward to seeing your future work.
