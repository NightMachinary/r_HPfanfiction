An AU where the events of the TriWizard Tournament are the same, but they take place in a different order. An example: issues with the transport of the dragons causes a delay in their expected delivery to Hogwarts, meaning the First Task has to be changed.

The First Task is the Lake, the Second Task is the Maze and the Third is the dragon.

In classic "butterfly effect" fashion I think this would lead to a myriad of changes.

With the Lake Task happening first, it would change the hostages for Harry AND Victor. With Harry and Ron at odds (as well as most of the school thinking he entered himself) AND with Victor not having approached Hermione yet, the only logical choice for a hostage would be Hermione for Harry and a classmate/family member for Victor.

This could effect Harry's reconciliation with Ron (and be an opening for Harmony shipping, if you're into that) as well as potentially mean Victor won't pursue Hermione. He didn't at Bill and Fleur's wedding, when she was seemingly "taken", and (combined with a Rita Skeeter article) he may just assume Harry and Hermione ARE dating and leave her alone.

The Second Task is far more interesting, as (if Voldemort is in character AND there is something for the Champions to touch/collect at the center of the maze) he may stick to the canon plan and kidnap Harry FAR earlier than in canon. This could also mean Cedric survives the year and/or the real Moody is discovered sooner and goes on to teach the rest of the year.

If he isn't taken, then, Harry would still face the Horntail at the back end of the year. Leading to a potentially different approach to fending off the dragon and Cedric absolutely surviving, as he wouldn't be in graveyard. Also, if Harry uses the same tactic as in canon, he would arrive in Little Hangleton with his broomstick (which would give writers the option for Harry to escape without the ritual being completed).


** Love this idea, especially the last part:

** Not as deep a thought as the others I see here, but...

It would also start the Tournament with the most boring task (for the spectators) EVER: one hour of watching the lake, waiting for somebody's head to pop back up. How will that effect public opinion of the tournament in general, the organizing committee, and the forced inclusion of a boy sent to do a man's job?

*** It's not my fault Rowling came up with a boring ass task with the Lake. And, if you go by the idea of the dragons being delayed (and the maze clearly taking weeks to grow) there isn't really another option.

Though I didn't consider what public opinion may be of Harry as a result of doing the Lake task first...

**** Oh no, definitely not your fault. I love fourth-year fics where they point out how badly-planned that task is because of that. I'm just saying that starting out with that one rather than the dragon spectacle might make people reconsider whether this is worth the huge expense.

***** Ah! Sorry for misinterpreting.

That's an interesting thing to explore, and possibly a good excuse to potentially change the Tasks to be more exciting. Though, I imagine any expenses would have been paid in advance, and with the contract on the Champions they can't exactly cancel it.

** Well regardless of whether the lake was the first or the second task, at least in GoF (assuming all things before remain canon), Harry still treasures Ron more than Hermione even after their quarrel. It would be though really cool for character development for Harry to be put at odds with whether he should rescue Ron or let him rot at the bottom of the lake out of spite and rescue Hermione (who for whatever reason ended up there as well instead).

If the maze was the second task, I'm pretty sure Voldemort would have made use of it... but then OotP would be vastly different. It's stated that the main reason for which Hogwarts students were wary of Harry was because Dumbledore had so little time to explain what went on. I think that by then Rita wouldn't have had the article deeming him crazy to turn the public opinion against him and Harry still being in the magical world would have had the chance to explain himself.

However if the trophy-portkey was the prize you had to get from the dragons, then Harry would have gone by himself and Cedric would still be alive.... probably to fight the Battle of Hogwarts.

Whoever picked the hostages chose Ron for Harry. It's not necessarily true that he treasures Ron more. And the clue didn't say "the person you treasure the most." It said "what you'll surely miss." Harry would definitely miss either Ron or Hermione. (Although I think he'd miss Hedwig before either of them, but the organizers were stuck on the idea of a person.)

Let's face it, what are the odds that Hermione is actually the person that Victor treasures above all others? I think they picked Hermione for Victor because she's the person he's closest to AT HOGWARTS, leaving Ron to be Harry's hostage. If they'd picked Hermione for Harry, then there wouldn't have been anybody for Victor.

**** Well I went by the fact that when Harry and Ron have their quarrel, Harry thinks that while he appreciates Hermione, he doesn't enjoy her company as much as Ron's. Regarding Hedwig... I don't know what to say... Harry spends like two paragraphs moping about her when she's killed and then he kind of moves on. When he fights with Ron and Ron leaves, he thinks about him for chapters.

*** My reasoning for the lake is mostly to do with how they chose the Champions hostages. I don't think it was a magical method, as I sincerely doubt Cho and Hermione were truly the people Cedric and Victor valued most in the world, and more chosen due to proximity and how they clearly cared enough about them to be motivated to rescue them. Meaning that it is likely that observers may stick with Ron (which could be where they reconcile) but would more than likely go with Hermione, who has been by his side regardless of the schools opinion of him.

And the second task thing is exactly what I was thinking, it could also lead to some proto-DA movement in the latter half of Fourth year, though I wonder how much in the way of interest people would have when Harry returns alone (as Cedric's death is no longer a factor that further muddies the waters).

**** Maybe not magical in nature and absolutely Harry would have saved her, at that point Harry preferred Ron's company over Hermione's (from the book). Saving someone's life didn't ensure that a romantic relation would develop between the captive and the rescuer. Harry didn't fall in love with Ron, Hermione and Viktor never happened and while Gabrielle got a hero/celebrity crush on Harry, her feelings were not reciprocated.

** I would think Ron would still be Harry's most treasured person. Something like that doesn't change just because of a fight.

*** I don't think the judges actually picked their most precious person (see Victor and Cedric, who likely have friends and/or family members they love more than Hermione and Cho) and likely picked people they clearly cared for and were easy/willing to get under the water.

Hence, with Ron and Harry visibly at odds (something teachers would not miss, since they'd been inseparable since they'd arrived), they'd consider choosing Harry's OTHER best friend. The girl who was seemingly his only friend at that point in time.

I'm not saying he suddenly values Hermione over Ron, more that I think the judges would make a different choice in hostage considering the circumstances.

**** Well it could depend on who actually was the person to choose the champion's most treasured person. Because if Dumbledore or McGonagall had any say in it, I think it would be pretty likely that they would still chose Ron, if only because they would see it as an opportunity for Harry and Ron to reconcile.

It would also be interesting to see Ron's reaction to being Harry's most treasured person when they were previously fighting. He would for one, probably feel more guilty about the fight than he already did.
