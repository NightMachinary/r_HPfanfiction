At the top of the viel of death in harry potter, there is a distinct symbol at the top. Delta, the sign of the labyrinth. This can be used in anyway crossing over the harry pottwr and percy jackson fandom.


** Your idea doesn't really have a plot - you're basically asking for a Percy Jackson/Harry Potter crossover without any detail.

What does the veil add? It has has been used as a "gateway to another dimension" in a lot of stories.

What is the plot? Invasion by a faction of either side? Does one verse need something from the other? Some lost artifact? Or do you want the Ministry Six end up in Percy Jackson's world, needing a way back?

What is your plot idea?

*** OP's plot is Sirius gets thrown into the PJO Labyrinth while Percy and Co are exploring it.

...is what I gather.

**** He said "this can be used in any way", so he wasn't quite specific. But even so - "Percy and Co. meet Sirius" isn't a plot idea. It's a single scene.
