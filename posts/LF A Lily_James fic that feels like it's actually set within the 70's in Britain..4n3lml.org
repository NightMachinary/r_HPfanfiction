I've been having trouble reading some I've come across simply because (excluding most scenes in Hogwarts) it feels like I'm in modern day America when I'm reading them and it just takes me out of the story. I know it's fanfiction, but I'm more inclined to stories that are more accurate with the setting, unless it's AU.

*** They died in 1981, so you wouldn't get much except them being in hiding and playing with a baby :P
