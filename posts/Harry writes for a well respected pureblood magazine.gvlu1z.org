:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I believe it was a sixth year fic. It's not Poison Pen. One key detail I remember is that he set up a study comparing magical power between purebloods, half-bloods, and muggleborns after calling them out in an essay.


** Not sixth year but it has the study you mentioned.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
