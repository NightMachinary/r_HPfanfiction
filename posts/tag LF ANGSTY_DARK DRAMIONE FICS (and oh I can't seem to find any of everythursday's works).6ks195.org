I'm new to the fanfiction world (you could say I'm a fanfic virgin ;) /wink/ /wink/) and all I've ever read is Draconian by hepburnettes and that was from Wattpad. See I've never even ventured out to fanfiction.net until now, I was always afraid of reading fanfics (because of stereotypes and such I've heard) and now I've read Draconian and my life was never the same again. I'm really looking for well-written angsty and dark dramione fanfics, post-war/during war mostly, I just really wanted to be introduced properly to this HP fanfiction world, and well I'm open to Harmione as long as it's gripping. And I desperately am an offline reader (I know such a shame) so if you could also provide an ebook for them I MOST ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE IT :) And I can't seem to find any of Sage's (everythursday) works wherever, even in hawthorn & vine/dramione.org I really would love to read Sage's work, especially When The Bell Tolls and Parade of the Sun, if anyone could provide me an ebook to those I will *ugly cry* with my heart out for gratefulness! :)


** One of my Dramione favorites is definitely /Isolation/. It's not dark but it takes place during the war and I think Bex-Chan does a great job with characterizations.

You can find links for Everythursday's fics on [[https://dramioneasks.tumblr.com/post/140227476527/are-and-other-pdfs-floating-around-for][this page]]. The Fallout is the fic that everyone loves. Personally I didn't care for it but I'm in the minority there. :)

*** Thank you so much! You just saved my Dramione soul! Bless this fanfic community :) I just finished Isolation and it was definitely a page-turner and worth the read! And I see you're a hufflepuff too!

*** I also didn't like the Fallout! What didn't you like? It seems like everyone else LOVED it! I thought I was the only one who didn't.

**** It seems like that The Fallout was the most requested, well my copy of The Fallout remains unopened up to this day, I don't find it much gripping but we'll see after I've read it. I think, the best will always stick to you as the first fanfic you've read :)

**** While it was beautifully written, The Fallout was just too angsty for me to remotely enjoy, honestly.

The story takes place over a series of numbered days and Draco and Hermione start a physical relationship sometime during the story. I counted three years into the story's timeline and Hermione and Draco's relationship was still, I dunno...angry? Their relationship growth was very stagnant for them to have been intimately involved for that length of time. They were still calling each other Malfoy and Granger for YEARS after they started sleeping with each other and they never even really even seemed to care for each other after all of that time. That level of angst just felt unnecessary and it just really rubbed me the wrong way.

Also, during those three years of the story time that I read, their characters didn't grow AT ALL, meaning they acted exactly the same as they did at the beginning of the fic as they did 3 years later. I'm not sure about anyone else but I sure as heck didn't act the same way at 20-21 as I did at 17. It was such a heavy story and I felt that their experiences didn't bring about any character growth or development. I just gave up and found something else to read.

What about you?

***** All the things that bothered you bothered me too, but actually the angst etc wasn't the main reason I didn't like it. For me it was the magic (of lack there of).

The vast majority of the fic they basically had to live as muggles (that was explained bc of the trace) but there could have been so many more clever uses of magic to win the war that were never explored (like some kind of charm so that they would know who was on their side). It seemed like the author wanted to do wartime fiction and forced it into the HP universe without much thought given to magic and magical solutions. I mean in a world where the fidelus exists, why would they live in (basically) unprotected, rundown, shitty muggle safe houses?

Another thing I really hated was the numbering. It is hard to know what is going on a lot of the time and the listing of the days makes it feel disjointed. Also every little vignette starts out without any setting of the scene or descriptions really. I think it was meant to be a literary technique that made us as the readers feel as confused as the characters BUT it just made me annoyed and took me out of the story. Every time I was like "wait what!?"

I really wanted to like this fic and to root for these characters but even though it was 300k words, I never felt like I knew any of them enough.

Also, as an aside, one of the best AU war fics I've read is the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/28580][Thousand Beautiful Things universe]]. If you liked the guerrilla warfare parts of the fallout, you'll like this. Also it's just great fic in general if you read slash, which iirc you do.

** I LOVE writing dark/angsty dramione. It's h lifeblood.

THIS one is the first of a series. Pretty damn dark but it's my most popular fic, go figure.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7550124/1/His-Little-Bird]]

And THIS one is a shorter fic that leads to its sequel, where a slowburn starts happening. It's also dark but not on the same level as the one I already linked to. The sequel will be dealing with the war, too, but it's still in progress.

The first:

The Sequel:
