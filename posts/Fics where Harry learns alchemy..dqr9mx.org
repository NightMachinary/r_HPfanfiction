Just what the title says.

Preferably no Slash, and I would like it to be complete.


** Linkffn(9578599) has some of this, but not much and it's incomplete.

I found linkffn(12361379; 12098529) from a "Harry learns alchemy fanfiction" Google search. They aren't crossovers with Full Metal Alchemist, and neither of them are complete. Sorry. There's other results in the search that you can check out though!

  "Will you wield greatness gently?" Harry was told the truth of the strange events around him by Petunia at an early age. However, the result of him exploring his magic led to Dudley's tenth birthday ending rather differently. A near death experience leads to an encounter with a far more sinister Truth. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. Innocence is no exception.
