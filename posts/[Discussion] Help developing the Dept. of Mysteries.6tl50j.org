So I like the idea of some of the Unspeakables being a bit like the SCP, X Files or Men in Black but for magic... which leads me onto the problem of what exactly their purview is. I was thinking that they collect artifacts and knowledge which are dangerous not only to the Statute but are existential threats to Wizardkind. I'm having trouble reconciling why they wouldn't be suitable for chasing down Death Eaters, though. The only examples of things I've thought should be kept by them are the origins of the Dementors, the original Lycanthropy curse and the cause of the Black Plague.

So questions up for discussion:

- why can't/don't they go after Death Eaters/Voldemort?

- what are examples of dangerous magic they contain?

- suggestions for other details, such as their methods or tools are welcome.

Oh and if anyone knows of fic recs which have covered this already, that would be very helpful!

** If you look at what they studied its all really vague. Love, time, death, thoughts, all concepts rather than things. They're searching for higher understanding of magic far beyond the comprehension of the average wizard. Far beyond any practical use. You could just say Voldemort is beneath them. They care not who is in charge, they don't care what people get up to when they're dealing with magic beyond all of that. Voldemort is a domestic political threat. He's a violent alternative politician as far as they care, so long as he doesn't interfere with them they don't care.

Things they would deal with would be keeping the dead dead. They guard the veil and hunt necromancers above all. They are behind the original love potions as they attempt to replicate the power that they have to keep locked away. Love is the only room they say is kept locked. They are the guardians of time. They ensure that time travel is never used in war. With the existence of prophecies they might believe in a pre-determined timeline and do their best to ensure it stays on course. They created the memory charm and legilimency as they attempt to work out ways to transfer thoughts and knowledge so as to be able to teach instantly. Unless Voldemort tried to war against magic itself they wouldn't interfere.

** I think that the Aurors are actually capable of handling Death Eaters, so it wouldn't matter how powerful or dark your magical artifacts are. The difficulty is in catching them. Even caught red handed, they can claim to have been under the imperio curse, so your unspeakables would have just released the bubonic plague on upstanding members of society.

That being said, I don't think they exclusively keep dark artifacts. They probably have things from muggle legends. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mythological_objects]]. There's more in that list than I could possibly imagine myself. Some may be suitable. As an example, there's a Welsh myth of a chess set which can play itself, which may have been developed into Wizard's Chess.

They also might have items with various curses and charms on them, either of unknown origin or to help understand and counter them.

*** I was looking through that same list just a few days ago! Great minds, eh? ;)

I meant containing the knowledge rather than using it, so they would have wiped all other records of the Plague curse from existence apart from the one in their archive.

If you've read Lirael I imagine their archive to be a little like the Library in the Clayr's Glacier, with lots of dangerous things locked away.

** Do you want a reason as to why they weren't involved in the canon fight against Voldemort? Or do you just want to write about something else and be able to give a reason as to why they're ignoring Voldemort?

Eitherway, most simply, the Aurors already exist. They deal with 'common' dark threats who don't deal in the secrets the DoM protect, so it would be a waste of resources to lower themselves to fighting the Death Eaters when their specialist skills weren't needed there, but were in fact needed elsewhere. It's the Aurors' jobs, so let them do it.

So that does all of the Death Eaters. Maybe they might be seconded onto an Auror team when occasionally a Death Eater gets their hands on something more powerful than normal.

Voldemort is a little more tricky. I would assume Horcurxes and his resurrection ritual would probably fall under their remit (though maybe just barely, so he slips under their radar as 'something we should get around to dealing with when we have the manpower). But maybe they could overlook him during the first war as he doesn't seem to rely on anything more experimental than Avada Kedava-ing lots of people, so they book him as nothing more than a more-annoying-than-usual-but-still-ordinary-mass-murdering-dark-wizard.

Basically develop threats that they specifically have to deal with and they'll not have any interest in going after people that the Aurors should be dealing with.

**** Ah right. And thanks.

Have you read linkao3(Shades of Green by Renaissance) by any chance? It's more about a team of thieves stealing artefacts the DoM is interested in, but it does cover the idea of the DoM having a watch list of potential world-ending items to keep an eye on that might be useful.

** I would not count Dementor's origin in their area of expertise, as for me Dementors are just another magical sapient species just like Goblins and Veela. They /would/ be studying their abilities, though.

Generally, I think Unspeakables are the scientists of magic, trying to understand exactly how and why it works, and occasionally build some neat stuff based on what they find. The Department is home both to powerful artifacts they tracked down and are now studying, and to objects they made themselves, like the Time-Turners, for the sake of experiment.

However, the terrifying truth is that most magic is only limited by how good the wizard is. The power an Unspeakable could wield is terrifying, and thus they keep their knowledge locked away, only releasing a finding when they're /really/, /really/ sure it's not going to blow up the Earth or something if it falls in the wrong hands.

An interesting tidbit: because of this approach to knowledge, the Unspeakables both admire and /hate/ wizards who had the talent to become Unspeakables but work solo instead and release their findings. On their "blacklist" are, among others, Nicolas Flamel, Dumbledore, and Herpo the Foul. On a related note, they also hate the Goblins of Gringotts for withholding dangerous artifacts as part of their Goblin ownership laws.

The Unspeakables, as herO_wraith suggests, probably don't care very strongly about Voldemort, or at least didn't before they learnt he had Horcruxes. I imagine with his talent he /would/ be on their "dammit, why isn't he on our side" list, (they'd doubtless be aware of his identity as Tom Riddle, I mean come on), but it's not like he's actually /done/ anything of interest to them with it. His only true creations we know of are the bad-memories-potion, and unsupported flight, and I have a hunch the Unspeakables already knew about the latter.

** I imagine Unspeakables are a little like the cast of Warehouse 13, in that they track down specific world breaking artefacts and solve spells that have more unusual than normal effects.

As for why the unspeakables were not involved in the Voldemort issues, my head cannon is that Horcrux tie you to the earth for your natural lifespan, for wizards that's about 200 years max without outside interference. It may seem heartless, but they might have a 'this too shall pass' sort of mentality when it comes to him.

  and how there's nobody still kept alive by horcruxes despite of how easy it should be to keep one hidden.
#+end_quote

And how do you know that, pray tell? There could very well be some Polynesian Dark Lord or whatnot who's been around for 300 years, and we wouldn't know. More plausible still, there may be several Dark Wizards who have been stuck in "flying spirit" mode for centuries, because after all this time they have no minions left willing to do the "flesh of the servant" ritual; this is in fact my headcanon for the fate of the original creator of Horcruxes, Herpo the Foul, whom I imagine as still being locked up somewhere by the Greek Department of Mysteries, stubbornly refusing to give up the location of his Horcrux despite his abysmal state.

*** Ha! I knew I'd heard the term 'Warehouse 13' somewhere but I couldn't remember what it was referring to. I decided to name the Field team 'Section 13' for my fic. Thanks, I'll look the series up now.

I guess my headcanon where the horcruxes are concerned is that the items have a singular purpose and don't really get out into the wider world once made. On its own, the existence of horcruxes isn't particularly worldbreaking.

** The hall of prophecies is in the department of mysteries and the Unspeakables wrote the convenient signs of whom those prophecies speak of. So even if Unspeakables are anything more than scientists, they would know that Potter must have a go at Voldemort first. And if Potter fails, well i'm sure people have tripped through the veil of death before, provided The Unspeakables even have any real issues with Voldemorts agenda. For all we know they are all purebloods.
