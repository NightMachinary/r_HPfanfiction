Hey all,

Looking for a specific fanfiction that I remembered if anyone could help:

- Harry has somehow broken away from Dumbledore/Weasleys/Hermione
- Hermione writes to her mother thinking that her mother would support her way of thinking on how Harry was doing the wrong thing
- Her mother instead writes back scolding Hermione, telling her that Harry had no reason to listen to Dumbledore, who is just his Headmaster, not his guardian or parent. Her mother then writes that she doesn't even know who Hermione is anymore and that she didn't raise Hermione this way.

There's also a second fanfiction from a long time ago that I would like to find if anyone can help:

- Harry and Hermione get together during the Horcrux hunt.
- They make love on a hill (overlooking Ottery St. Catchpole?)
- Hermione becomes pregnant, so doesn't participate in the final battle.
- Hermione stays at Shell Cottage. Sometime (after final battle? after she's given birth?), Ginny slips into Hermione's room and tells Hermione that she didn't even see her coming (i.e. taking Harry away from her).

Thanks!
