So I came across this fem tomarry fan fiction on ffnet. The premise is very unique, along with a surprisingly sane fem voldemort. The slow corruption of Harry is very fun to read. I was wondering if anyone can recommend fan fictions similar to this. And also does anyone know if aelur is on permanent hiatus? I'm hoping that this is gonna get continued but don't know what's gonna happen since there are no such announcements on his profile.

Thanks.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19028845/chapters/45193261]]) When it comes to Fem!Tom/Harry this is the best written one I've found to date. It is not finished and their relationship is a friendship at this point in the story but it gets updated regularly.

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.

*** I've read up to the 8th chapter on this. I was waiting for a number of updates in order to binge them. Thanks though.

Also do you have any idea if aelur is gonna come back ever? Thanks.
