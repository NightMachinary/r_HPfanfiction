Preferably not one-shots and nothing from James Spookie, I've already read it all apart from the 5th yr marriage contract one (Waiting for it to update).


** This is probably the single best Harry/Daphne I've ever read: linkffn(8262940)

It's a Harry Potter Noir story with the most professional writing I've seen in the fandom. It has excellent characterization, pacing, dialogue, and overall masterful writing. It may not be the favorite type of story for some people, but the quality is undeniable. I highly, highly recommend that you read it.

  Secrets of the war, a murder and a fatal attraction: After his victory over Voldemort, Harry became an Auror, and realised quickly that it wasn't at all like he had imagined. Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG

If you like Harry/Fleur, I also recommend his other story: linkffn(4525701)

Unfortunately, it's incomplete and I'm not sure if the author will continue it. Still, it's 45k words of great writing!

** Pureblood Princess, Unatoned, and To Be Loved are all pretty darn good (and linked already).

linkffn(Ice Princess by Luan Mao). This one has a Daphne that doesn't match up to the usual fanon.

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/][Perfect Situations]] and its sequel [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Matryoshka_Vignettes/Introduction/][Matryoshka Vignettes]] are both very good as well.

linkffn(The After Years). This one is not purely HP/DG, but it is not a multi/harem fic either. Hopefully it's within the realm of what you're looking for.

Partners is also good, but there's little conflict or build up in the relationship. It's more of an almost unbelievable "whirlwind" romance. I still enjoyed it, though not as much as some others.

Some very good one-shots linkffn(Case 129; Ruthless Revenge).

linkffn(Runic Animagi). Not my favorite but liked it well enough to recommend, and I hadn't seen it mentioned here yet.

EDIT: Intoxication (can't remember the author) is very good, too, but I can't seem to find it up anywhere. The author must have taken it down :/

EDITx2: Found it! But you have to have a DLP forum account. [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=15341][DLP Library Link]], it will ask you to sign in before you can read it. I wouldn't skim the thread too much (to avoid spoilers). It is somewhat...graphic, too. I didn't remember that. NSFW probably.

** Bonfires at Midnight linkffn(9652275) :

The story begins with the simple change in canon where instead of meeting Ron Weasley in the train, Harry Potter meets Daphne Greengrass instead. That cliche said, the story makes sure to handle the growth and characterization of both Daphne and Harry extremely well. The story avoids the usual cliches ends up being a well written piece of fanfiction.

linkffn( To be loved by silentclock)

These are 4 stars:

linkffn( Harry potter and the marriage contracts by chell65619)

I have around five 3 stars or ones I read before instituting a rating policy if you are interested. My ratings:

1*: couldn't finish, it's that bad

2*: finished, but only since it was short/I was bored. Kinda wish I hadn't wasted my time on it

3*: decent, but won't reread

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9415372/1/Beltane-Child][Beltane Child]]: Harry needs some time to let his guard down in the war. So he goes to a celebration just before he, Ron and Hermione plan to get Hufflepuff's Cup from Bellatrix Lestrange's vault. Who could have guessed what the consequences would be?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9750991/1/Angry-Harry-and-the-Seven][Angry Harry and the Seven]]: Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4334542/1/The-Grass-Is-Always-Greener][The Grass is Always Greener]]: During the second term of Harry's sixth year, he ends up saving Daphne Greengrass from a fate worse than death. To repay him, she teaches him Occlumency and they get to know each other well enough to learn that labels are not always useful... HP/DG

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5012016/1/Partners][Partners]]: Having the right partner can make life much smoother. The right persons can complement each other's strengths and support each other's weakness. Love really does make the world go 'round, especially with a Dark Lord after your blood. HP/DG

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7419421/1/Harry-Potter-Wizarding-Savior][Harry Potter, Wizarding Savior?]]: Harry in his anger at the Headmaster after the death of Sirius finally burns through the Memory Charm that the Headmaster cast on him just before third year and comes to some surprising revelations

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7508571/1/The-Fall-of-the-house-of-Potter][The Fall of the House of Potter]]: AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks. (Note: This is technically a one-shot, but it's long enough that it doesn't feel like one. Plus, it's very good.)
