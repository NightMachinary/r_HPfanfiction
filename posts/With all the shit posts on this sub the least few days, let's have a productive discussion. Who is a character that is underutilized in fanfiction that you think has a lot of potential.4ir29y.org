** Percy. He's involved at Hogwarts, at the ministry and is part of the Weasley family, all of which can be used to give him a big role. He's almost always skimmed over though, and instead I see far more of Fred and George than I would like.

*** There was a great one where he was recruited by Amelia Bones for the DMLE as some kind of red tape savant (after being fired by/with Fudge). Like, she asked him what ministry forms were needed for certain situations and he knew off the top of his head and she snapped him up for the administrative side. Unfortunately, I have no idea what fic it was, I'd love to read it again.

** GILDEROY LOCKHART.

I could scream his name from the rooftops, honestly, like... Yes. Yes, he's a bit of a twat. Yes, he's self-absorbed, and focused on himself, but he isn't a completely incompetent jellyfish who has no idea how to do anything. He's intelligent; he can focus himself on tasks; he's very cunning and manipulative.

It just makes me so upset when people write Lockhart as some sort of utterly useless blob who never managed to do anything except glance in the mirror.

And the same for Peter Pettigrew, who is disgustingly underutilised because people don't seem to be able to realize that yes, Peter WAS friends with Sirius, James and Remus pre-war. Literally, the decision to rat them out was a logical one in Peter's mind. He thought "inevitably, my friends will die, therefore I should just go the shortest route and help that along so that I can survive".

Was that wrong? Yeah. Was that really selfish and self-centred of him? Of course. Does that mean Peter is incompetent/entirely evil/incapable of anything? No. No, no, no.

Peter crawled into Albania, found Voldemort, transported Voldemort back the UK, cared for him, attacked people here and there, cast various spells wandlessly, went through this entire ritual... Not to mention becoming an Animagus at like FIFTEEN, along with James and Sirius.

He was a capable wizard! He was friends with James, Sirius and Remus at school. He's a fascinating character, and reducing him to "fat ugly dude nobody ever liked" deeply angers and upsets me.

** The sheer dearth of Ron-focused adventure fics makes me sad. Ron's easily the most fun character of the trio: he's quippy, he knows how to have a good time, and above all, he's far more /relateable/ than Harry or Hermione. He's just a normal lad going to school and hanging out with his two best friends, and when he's dragged into life or death situations with them, he reacts as any normal kid would, but eventually does what needs to be done. Ron is the everyman we wish we could be, yet somehow he keeps being ignored. He's the perfect protagonist an adventure-comedy or an Indiana Jones-style romp, but people keep doffing the role onto Harry, who's cool, but is also kind of a depressive tosser not fit for that type of fic, you know?

Hermione isn't underutilised so much as simply mis-utilised. She's a fantastic character in canon: brilliant, but also a bit of retard when it comes to socialising with others. Pretty, but not a supermodel. She has a strong personality, but it can come off as overbearing and somewhat arrogant. Generally kind, but has a massive mean-streak and takes retribution a bit too seriously. Most fics completely erase her flaws to make her a perfect Mary Sue(a la the numerous Hermione-wank fics out there), or she becomes this gorgeous, horny, sex-kitten librarian who spends most of her time alternately fucking and being submissive to whoever she's paired with, because whoever she's paired with is a stand-in for the author and the author wants very badly to have a shag with Emma Watson. If you do this, stop. Please.

Moody would be amazing in a cold-war era Auror fic, like something with a John Le Carré bent to it; and any number of Slytherin graduates would make a decent protagonist for a political fic in the vein of House of Cards.

Also, I've always wanted to see someone write a fic from the perspective of Ginny writing a memoir about her years in Quidditch.

** Hagrid - He just disappears in Fanfiction. I don't write him because I just can't get his accent right, and I think many authors have the same reason. But I also have the impression that many fanfic authors share Malfoy's views about Hagrid, and that's quite a shame.

Mundungus Fletcher - He was never my favourite character in the books, but I'm sure there are some fascinating stories to tell. I have this plot bunny in my head that he's sitting drunken in some pub and tells exaggerated stories about his exploits.

** The other muggleborns. I've always wanted to read a muggleborn-centric fic, especially during the DH period. Was anyone organizing safehouses? An underground-railroad? Was anyone targeting the families? Did anyone go abroad? What about the (presumably) upper-class Finch-Fletchleys - did they have other connections in the know? How was the muggle government reacting to the crisis? How were foreign governments reacting to the crisis?

I was always a little disappointed in how HBP & DH were basically quests. I was hoping with OoTP that the succeeding plots would involve the rest of the magical community. But I do understand that writing about everything might make the storyline weaker. I think it would make a great TV series though, :D.

I also second the Percy posts before this. I loved that story where he basically fights by burying the death eater government officials in tedious paperwork.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Charlie. He's got a career in a field that is actually relevant within the story, he's nearly forgotten about by so many authors, even when the protagonist is Ron or Ginny. He's been stated to be more interested in dragons than women (in a comment that may or may not have been a joke) and that could lend itself to /so many/ different drama/romance storylines.

How did he react to becoming a big brother? Again and again? Was he overprotective of his only baby sister? How'd he react to the events of 1992/1993? Was he friends with Tonks when they were in Hogwarts together? Did he hate 'just missing' going to school with Harry? How'd he even get into being a dragon handler? What's the wizarding culture like in Romania?

But no. He's often just used as a tool if a dragon is involved, or a background piece when there's Weasley family interactions, given maybe a line or two. (PS, link me some good 60k+ Charlie fics!)

** Everyone's parents.

They never /do/ anything in the story unless the /entire story is focused on just that subject/.

I almost never see stories where the parents are just...there. Being parents. They are either full-on deus ex machina or endless drama factories. Which yes, parents are, but not most of the time.

None of the adults in canon have lives. No goals, dreams, careers, or even implied personal lives. Nothing. None of the adults (except Dumbledore, sorta) ever plan or plot or act /proactively/ to affect the lives of their children or students.

That's all most parents do in real life.

Fanfiction doesn't treat them much better, though they do usually get more action. It's just usually pointless, unexplained /reaction/ to things happening already.

** *Aberforth Dumbledore* was powerful, as shown in the final battle. *Patron*, linkffn(11080542), is pretty much the only decent fic that put him in a major role.

*Cho Chang* generally gets a bad rep in the fandom, but she was still a founding member of the DA and returned to fight in the final battle, even though she already graduated by that time. That fact alone should deserve some respect and a better treatment in fanfics.

*Lavender Brown* is also subject to lots of ridicule. Despite being dumped quite unceremoniously by Ron, she held no grudge against the Trio, stayed true to their cause, and was a key DA member during the year 7. She had to have suffer numerous tortures as a result, and perhaps gave up her life in the final battle. Lavender definitely deserves a better treatment in postwar stores, but I found that so far only [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] gave her the due respect.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Gellert Grindelwald

I've only seen him in action in one fic. He has been named in more, but he never actually enters the stage.

I always imagine him breaking out of Nurmengard and then engaging in battle with Voldemort for some reason, putting the little upstart in his place. Or, heres one: When Voldemort takes over the Ministry, the other nations get nervous. Their solution: Make Grindelwald take on an Unbreakable Vow and rally behind their own heavy hitter. Something like that...

Anyway, I've read one fic where Grindelwald raises Harry in Godrics Hollow, but dies protecting him. The character has a lot of potential in the "mentor" department. He is not above killing to reach his goal and he is clearly in favor of anything wizard above muggle. But his endeavor is not to kill the muggles, but to rule them. He is the middle ground between Voldemort and Dumbledore. Ruthless, violent, but sane and measured.

Dumbledore would be his second and known as Großkanzler (High Chancellor) Dumbledore while Tom Riddle became an apprentice to Grindelwald and when the story begins, is infamous as the ruthless Director of the Schutzstaffel (SS).

Harry Potter is born to Rittmeister James Potter, stationed at the Canadian Frontline and his mother, Lily Potter, "cleansed Impurity" and upstarting Charms Mistress at the Berlin Ziggurat. He grows up to become apprentice to Bellatrix Grindelwald, sixth wife of the Emperor, and is on the best way to start his carreer among the officers of the Schutzstaffel when he gains knowledge of a plot to overthrow the Emperor by the Chancellors and the High Chancellor himself. He reports this to his mistress, but when he does so, he gets sucked into the middle of a budding revolution that should shake the foundation of the Great Magical European Empire.

******** Her grandparents fled to the USA during the Uprising (the Wizards vs Muggles war following the second WW). Hermione Jean Granger is born in New York City and was captured during the Battle of Manhattan when she was six years old. She then grew up in a Cleansing Camp at the Siberian Front where she was quickly discovered to be a bright mind by a group called the "Sons of Loki". The Sons are a loose part of the revolutionary forces in the Empire, but heavily influenced by more druidic practices. When Hermione gets punished for "seducing men above her stand" (aka. kicking a warden in the balls when he wanted to force her to sex), she is thrown out into the tundra to die. She stumbles through the wilderness, accidental magic helping her survive longer than she should, before she fell down at the edge of a forest.

She gets picked up by the mirror-organisation of the Sons, the Daughters of Hecate and joins them eventually. After the rite that made her a Daughter, she begins a apprenticeship. Testing way over any other applicant, she is granted the privilege of learning from Baba Yaga.

Hermione enters the stage of the story during the middle act when she is tasked with meeting the group of Harry, Bellatrix and Sirius after Lily's lover ratted them out, at the safehouse at the shores of the Adria.

Hermione is still bookish to some degree, but my character sheet for her in this story heavily emphasizes her mean streak. As the apprentice of Baba Yaga she delved into some fucked up shit. Also her high morals in canon become straight up fanaticism in this story.

** Sprout, Vector, Sinistra, and Rosmerta.

Sure, Rosmerta owns a bar and is relatively young but that doesn't mean she couldn't have a particularly awesome past.

Sprout, while an herbology professor, could have some intriguing backstory, especially since she could be an incredible poisoner, a master assassin, Dumbledore's red--or green--right hand.

Vector could be written as a much more impressive divinations expert, often at odds with Trelawney. She could do another prophecy more likely than Trelawney. Actually, since Trelawney knows the prophecy but in canon it's shown that a seer doesn't remember, it could be that Sinistra gave the prophecy and Trelawney stole the credit with only minimal deviation from canon.

Sinistra's actress was rather attractive. I've not noticed much in the way of her usage. It could be interesting to see her as a sexual predator preying on students. /tugs on collar/ "Hawt!"

**** Really? Because snape preying on hermione or harry seems to be pretty bloody popular.

Edit: just because a relationship is "consensual" if one is in a position of power over the other it's not a good relationship.

***** Generally Snape/Hermione (or whatever pairing) is a one-off relationship and not indicative of a pattern. Usually no one outside of the relationship knows about it or actually oppose it if they do. If Sinistra is continuing to prey on strudents, then people (professors, Dumbledore, and/or strudents) know about it and nothing is being done to stop it. Also, to me, it plays into the idea that men/boys can't be raped and that women/girls can't be rapists.

****** Considering how verbally abusive Snape is to students not in Slytherin and Umbridge torturing students I rather doubt Dumbledore would stop another staff member abusing other students. Precedent set.

And I never said she would be a serial abuser everyone knows about, perhaps until then she's only used charms to ogle students in the showers or is an illegal animagus who hides in the quidditch locker rooms to watch the twins. It could be her first time with a character plotwise but for years she's fantasized. It could be that she and the character are in a committed loving relationship like those gross hermione/snape stories people tout but it's still predation. I never said it wasn't rape. But it is fiction. And sometimes one wants to read Lolita, or Annabelle, or the Duke of Burgundy instead of pokemon novels.

There are a number of hermione/(professors) I've skimmed that I never finished, usually because they were nonconsensual. And gross. And while, yes, hot older woman and younger man does play into that stereotype, i dont believe that to be true(that women can't rape). But in fiction, it's a fun fantasy. Like fantasizing about mrs. P when i was in sixth grade. Had she actually slept with me, i'm sure I'd be traumatized.
