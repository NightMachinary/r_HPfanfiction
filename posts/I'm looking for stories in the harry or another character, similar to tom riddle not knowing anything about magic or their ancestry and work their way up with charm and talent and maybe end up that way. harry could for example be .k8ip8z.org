** Linkffn(Monster by Phoenyx634) OC studies magic using a time-turner before accepting Hogwarts invitation. Said OC is as charming and powerful as Riddle. Figuring out her lineage and history is a major plot.

  What if Tom met his match in his fifth year at Hogwarts? What if someone upset the power balance before he became The Dark Lord... And changed the trajectory of history? That person is Amalia Gray. (NOT a time-travel fic!) [Awesome]Fem OC x [Evil]Tom Riddle
