It was a harry/multi where Harry inherited the Black/potter/Gryffendor name plus I think one more. Where he had to marry one wife for each last name.

What is the name of that fic!?!?!? Its driving me nuts.


** I've read a few of these of varying quality, but I'm going to need a little more detail before I am able to figure out which one you're talking about. Do you remember anything else about the story? Who was in his "harem"? Do you remember who the "primary wife" was? Was the plot driven by the inheritance or was it just a side-show to whatever else Harry has to do to defeat Voldemort?

** Not sure about Gryffindor, but Harem Wars started out on that premise. It's kind of awful in every respect though - I couldn't get in it past a few chapters. He might inherit Griffindor later on in the plot.
