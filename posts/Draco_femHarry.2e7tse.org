Just wondering if there are any good fics with this pairing. Any recommendations would be great!

*** Thanks for the suggestion! I tried one of that author's fics before but the grammar kind of killed me haha. I'll take another look though!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The Pureblood Pretense]] series is heading that way (though Harry is disguised as a boy for now), but there hasn't been any romance yet in the series. Should come later in the current book if author notes are any indication.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/422080/chapters/704262][Girl in the War]] by astridfire. "Who says you can't fight evil and be pretty? A Girl!Harry AU, starting with Rose Potter's first year at Hogwarts."

It's a WIP but was very recently updated. Also, there is some George Weasley/fem!Harry and Cedric Diggory/fem!Harry but it's pretty clear that it will end up Draco/fem!Harry.

** You could give my fem!Harry story a try; it is complete and a Harry is transformed story. I did write it a little while back now so the grammar isn't quite up to my current standard but I don't believe it is too terrible, but admittedly I haven't looked at it in a while. Not everyone's cup of tea but here is the link anyway. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/790721/chapters/1493924]]
