** Maybe not the most hurtful, but the most memorable negative review I've ever gotten sort of boiled down to â€˜needs more rape.' Which is... certainly a take.

(The fic in question is legit trite, rushed, and logically vacuous, but I'm 100% confident in my assessment that more sexual assault would not have solved its problems.)

** I can't really say which was the most hurtful in terms of content, they all sort of blur together into one generic, unreasonable complaint. But the time I have been most hurt was when I had deliberately avoided fanfic for a while to avoid feedback as I didn't feel in the right frame of mind for it. I was getting out of the car in a hospital car park when this random review on an old fanfic came through.

I know my humour isn't for everyone. I wrote one dumb fic when I was drunk, totally embracing childish humour and not at all intending to be clever. The other humour fix is unashamedly British in it's humour, a tribute to Sue Townsend, meant to mock the self centred awkwardness of teenage boys. I completely understand that humour is subjective, so usually when I see people criticising them I honestly don't mind or care.

But this review, that I got in the hospital car park? It was just kicking me while I was trying to hold it together, and it just seemed so vicious and personal. It was clear the person who wrote it had no suggestions for improvement, they just didn't find me funny. Fair enough, but there's a bunch of stuff I don't find funny. I just stop reading them and move on.

Obviously that person couldn't have known I would open it then, but I'm always surprised by how often people feel justified in leaving really negative stuff when it essentially boils down to a matter of taste.

** Eh, I delete all the flames. I don't really get them as much as my writing improves.

** Usually I would say 90% of my reviews are positive (nearly 400 reviews) However today I just received a string of negative comments. I can tell the trolly ones - however I got one that I'm not sure of. The questioned the readability and grammar. I usually do 3 days of editing and use Grammarly. I wish they weren't guests so I could ask specifically what they had issues with.

*** I agree, people who point out all your little grammar errors can be annoying, but people who question your grammar and /don't/ specify any errors are infuriating.

You can never be sure: maybe /they're/ the ones bad at grammar.
