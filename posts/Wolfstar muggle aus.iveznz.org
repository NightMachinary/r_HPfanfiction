Does anyone have some soft short (ish) wolfstar muggle AUs. Basically any au is fine, but things like coffee shop and texting ones are my comfort fic lol A little bit of angst is ok to give it a story but nothing to make me tear my head out I would prefer ao3 but anything's fine

Idk why this is marked as nsfw lmao I want fluff fics???

Most of the Wolfstar muggle AUs I've read are slightly more on the angsty side but with plenty of cute moments as well. If none of the ones listed below are your cup of tea no worries, but here's a few more that I've enjoyed.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284141][The Northern Line]] - Sirius deals with his family while falling in love.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4787432/chapters/10954928][Fractured Skies]] - Deaf Sirius, epiliptic Remus. Coffee shop fic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6145495][Without Translation]] - Deaf Sirius, disabled Remus. Shorter, fluff.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8829697/chapters/20243443][Discards]] - this one's not short, and there's some angst for sure. Sirius works at a library, Remus is a collage student.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10350781/1/The-Sickness-Unto-Death][The Sickness Unto Death]] - University AU, Gender Studies class.
