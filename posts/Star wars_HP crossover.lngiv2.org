Literally anything except dark/sith harry, slash, other HP characters than harry, HP world, or the following fics:

The Kyle Side, Havoc of the force, Revenge of the wizard, Whats a gungan, I still havent found what im looking for, magic of the force, the entire "in all things balance" series.

I probablt forgot some of the commonly reccomended ones, but i doubt there is anything else of quality,


** I was about to link the Kyle side of the force until I saw that you had already read it

  A small change had Harry slowly absorbing memories from Voldemort's soul shard in his head after the battle in the Chamber of Secrets. Follow him as those memories lead him to an escape from the Wizarding World and an adventure in a whole new reality with spaceships and space wizards. Grey/Smart/Powerful Harry. Slow Build Up.
