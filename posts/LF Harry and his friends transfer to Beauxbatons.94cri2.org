Is there a Fanfiction where Harry decides he doesn't like Hogwarts and decides to go transfer to Beauxbatons? I would also like Ron and Hermione to go with him as well preferably.


** Well I think he transfers in The Accidental Bond. Downside is it's a soul bond fic and has bashing.

*** The harem doc by kb0? Reading it right now. Kinda worried if Hermione is included in the harem, not a huge fan of that pairing so I'm hoping Harry and Hermione just stay as friends =P

*** Aww, that's too bad. I think Harry in Beauxbatons would so cool. But bashing and soul bonds aren't. :(
