Whoo, sticking to a commitment. Links to part [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g36qcf/a_subjective_review_of_partially_kissed_hero_ch1/][1]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g3ujqr/a_subjective_review_of_partially_kissed_hero_ch2/][2]] here.

Let's start with something I maybe should have pointed out before: every chapter up to now starts with the same sentence - not part of the fic, more like a statement of intent from PL. It says, and I quote verbatim, "Every so often the entire Harry Potter universe offends me so deeply that I just have to react by folding, spindling and mutilating it. "

Congrats, you did it. Kudos for being honest about it.

More seriously, I kind of vaguely get the sentiment. I read once that people write fanfiction because they are, in some way, not satisfied with the source material - a ship that didn't pan, a moment where you went "it would have been awesome if it went like /that/ instead". PL's statement is a pretty extreme version of that. Though 'mutilate' is a pretty strong word for a setting you claim to like.

Now, the customary summary of this chapter - Harry spends the rest of the day going over Voldemort's memories in detail, noting his new knowledge about Hogwarts' nooks and crannies (including the Room of Requirement and passage to all four common rooms), Tom's travels around Europe looking for dark lore, the few times he encountered Lily and James on the battlefield, Sirius and Pettigrew's status as respectively not and totally a death eater, Snape and the prophecy, and the horcruxes. He uses the time turner to go back half a day, and goes to the Chamber of Secrets where he puts that safari kit he totally needed to use in rendering the Basilisk while he plots against Dumbledore. The next day at breakfast, Ron is angry with him because his kneazle tried to eat Scabbers - Harry takes the opportunity to buy the rat for 4 galleons, waves at his time duplicate, and then manipulates McGonagall so that he can get permission to go to the Ministry to get his new 'pet' checked out before it's given up for adoption. At the Ministry, first of all he travels back in time 2 hours. Then he blows the whistle on the Dursley's abuse to the aurors, while ruminating on how he can't pin anything on Dumbledore because he's too savvy. Then he gets Pettigrew checked out, he's discovered to be an animagus, and when he tries to run for it Harry blows out his legs with blasting curses and confunds the two witnesses (an auror and a clerk) into thinking they were the ones who fired them.

Yeah, it's pretty bad. Quite a lot of this chapter is taken up with exposition on Harry's mentality and thoughts, which is so riveting I couldn't wait to know more.

We see something I wasn't actually expecting, though I probably should have. Harry bashing. Not PL!Harry, just regular Harry. He's a wimp, he would never have survived the soul fighting and stuff. Thank god PL descended and remade Harry in his image, I don't know how he could have went on with that weak mentality of his.

There is an interesting part while he thinks of Snape - though it probably says more about PL than anything. I'm quoting here

#+begin_quote
  [...] and the bastard had even had the GALL to ask for Lily to be preserved and bound to him as a sex slave for his reward!
#+end_quote

I was expecting this kind of stuff to show up way later, but apparently we get a taste now. I know some little details from further in (nothing much, just spoilers I picked up over time), and apparently sexual slavery features pretty prominently.

The part with McGonagall struck me as really strange. We have an expression here in Italy, /sega mentale/ (loosely translated as 'mental fapping'), that I think applies pretty well. It means thinking about something to such an extent that it degenerates into nonsensical flights of fancy. Specifically, I'm talking about the portion where Harry is thinking about straight up casting a diffindo on Pettigrew in front of her - either he'll dodge, prompting him to cast again and again until McGonagall stops him, punishes him and eventually frees Pettigrew to go in the forbidden forest, or he'll hit him, making him transform back to human to staunch the bleeding, which means McGonagall would see Pettigrew as a hero that has come back from the dead, get him medical attention, completely ignore Harry, and then he would escape. All of this is purely hypothetical and only plays in Harry's mind of course. Instead he manipulates her like only a true sociopath could, letting her think what he wanted (going to the Ministry) was the best path, and even one she proposed herself! Such a mastermind.

Some less important stuff...

Once again, the timeline is out of whack - PL says Harry spends an afternoon and evening ruminating about Voldemort's memories, but as soon as that part is over he also says the first thing he does after Dumbledore's meeting is go back in time 12 hours and go to the Chamber. Either that or I've already completely lost track of time in this fic, which will probably happen soon considering how much he uses that goddamn time turner.

I'm pretty sure he already used the "Snape is a death eater" card when he was confronting Dumbledore (yep, straight up calls him a death eater), so thinking about it the second time falls even flatter than it already would have.

Apparently, Salazar Slytherin prized rule breaking in his students/heirs. I'm assuming that's why the entrance to the chamber is in the girls' bathroom, you must be a true hooligan to defy gender norms. Or a woman, but don't be silly, women can't be heirs.

A bit more overt on the Ron bashing, but still nothing too bad. Harry says he doesn't want to subject himself to looking at Ron eating, but then still calls him a friend (it sounds like lip service, and it totally is. PL is just waiting until he can get rid of him). On the other hand, the part where he buys Scabbers sounds... unhinged is probably not the right word. Out of touch with how normal people and social norms work.

#+begin_quote
  "Your cat tried to eat my rat, I'll have you know."

  'Ah! An opportunity! I was wondering when I'd get to bring that up,' Harry thought, before reaching into his belt pouch and producing four coins left over from his spending spree at the Alley that summer.
#+end_quote

Oh, one thing I missed last chapter - when Dumbledore gave Harry the time turner, apparently that also means Harry has to take the same classes as Hermione for some reason. That begs the question of why the hell you would give him a time turner when she's the more (apparently at least) responsible of the two, and they could easily share it.

I'm going to end it here. From now on I'll try to write these reviews in the morning rather than the evenings so that I'm a bit more lucid. See ya.

My headcanon for this (disregarding the dumb fucking "oh yeh they shit on the floor for 900 years" comment by JKR because the chamber is connected to the plumbing and I doubt some random plumber just wouldn't say anything when stumbling across a large cave carved in a snake motif with bones all over) was that Salazar had a little daughter when he was still at Hogwarts, and she thought putting a super secret entrance to the snakeden into a toilet was the funniest thing she'd ever seen.

#+begin_quote
  time turner
#+end_quote

I still don't understand /why/ he got one. He switched his electives, didn't he? two to three electives is normal and possible, but /all of them/ is what causes the conflict.

Also, I refuse to believe that the Ministry (or at least the unspeakables) give out pocket-sized time machines that can actually alter the timeline (early versions could make people disappear) and destroy the universe if misused without having some method of controlling their use. Like, time agents that break your knees if you try to alter history. A large nexus that reroutes any travels longer than 24 hours into DoM containment until the timestream normalizes. An arcane tether that pulls you back to the present if you fuck with your time-turner.

Why? They did that in canon with Hermione. She just /has/ a time machine.

I did address this, since I thought he was just switching electives too. But apparently he literally has the same schedule as Hermione for some godforsaken reason.

***** I mean, I didn't get it from his conversation with Dumbledore, so it came as a surprise to me too.

I went and checked, Dumbledore pulls out the time turner and asks him if he wants a 'similar setup' to Hermione. I took that to mean just the time turner, but apparently the extra classes were included in that.

** I reread chapter 3 out of curiosity and I just have to comment on this:

#+begin_example
       "Although why anyone would want... I mean, rats pee over EVERYTHING! Even your hands if you pick them up! Which, if you think about it, Ron was handling him all of the time, and NEVER washed his hands before eating, and didn't use utensils much, just grabbing things to put on his plate or into his mouth..."
#+end_example

Harry makes this comment after he's done talking to professor McGonagall, and I just found out it infuriatingly blatant.

First of all, rats can be litter trained and I'm pretty sure one that lives with Molly Weasley would be.

Secondly, we don't actually know when Ron washed his hands in canon, but you're not being subtle PL, quit making Ron out as a disgusting slob who eats rat piss.

*** Let me see what I can rummage through my list, though I tend to focus on very narrow parameters when I call something 'good'. Taking SPS as an example, the story has its problems - it treads way too close to the stations of canon at times, for my liking at least, and sometimes I find Hermione's angst a bit excessive. The reason I exalt it as much as I do is because it's literally the best fic I've every read, from a purely technical standpoint. The kind of prose I would want from a published work, and a really good one at that.

That said, let's see... Swords and Sorcery is the best example of Fem!Harry I've found, though the crossover aspects of it (with Fate/stay Night) can be a turn off for some people. I would still recommend it, though the focus tends more towards the crossover character rather than Iris for the first few chapters, before it settles into a more mentor-apprentice relationship.

Another crossover, this time with the Elder Scrolls, is Knowledge Comes at a Price. The basic premise is that various Daedric Princes (think eldritch abomination) make contact with Harry Potter's world - Lily makes a contract to save Harry with Hermaeus Mora, prince of knowledge, fate and other miscellaneous stuffs, and throughout the fic he makes a series of deals with him for knowledge. Despite my lacking description, it has more of a comedic slant to it than a grimdark cosmic horrory one. I especially enjoy Cedric's adventures as a thief/antihero figure. I would recommend this even without knowledge of TES.

The Mind Arts is a fic I enjoy more for the magic in it than the actual plot, though that's not to say it's bad. It has a very interesting dynamic between Harry and Dumbledore, where the more you read the more apparent his similarity to Riddle becomes, and since he's aware of it a lot of time is spent wondering how much this colors Dumbledore's own thoughts about it. It has some pretty iffy parts to it, especially considering Harry's own magical focus on Legilimancy and the mind arts in general, but it's of generally good quality and the action is quite vivid.

Democracy is a pretty short fic, but a very interesting one. It's a Neville PoV, set after the war, and it's based around the conflict between the traditional oligarchy of the old families and the progressive democracy proposed by Hermione and supported by the minister.
