I was wondering if anyone has come up with a way to take a list of ffnet stories (either links, or title/author type list) and auto search AO3 to see if those stories exist on the other site and provide links?


** I'm pretty sure ffnbot could do it.

For example, let's try linkao3(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes). If it exists, it should show up.

**** I believe anyone who's indexed the various sites could do it, but some of the stories get uploaded under different names. You should be able to use Google as well?
