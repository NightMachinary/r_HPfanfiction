thought of this randomly, ever seen any fanfics where harry is good at talking out problems or using his words and psychology to deal with problems and people? I always thought it would be interesting if harry when he was young instead read psychologist books and learned how to discuss problems


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11443239/1/So-Spoke-the-Idol-God][this]] one Harry is a shrink but it's only three chapters in so it's not had chance to be explored yet. I'm not sure how much it will be because it's shaping up to be quite an exciting fic.

#+begin_quote
  The Sorting Hat was feeling fickle the night of the 1991 sorting, and that night saw the trio sent to different houses. In late December, 2001, a prophecy is stolen from the Department of Mysteries, and Junior Unspeakable Granger is dispatched to find the thief. What she uncovers leads herself, Harry, and Ron, on a globetrotting journey to stop an evil once thought dead.
