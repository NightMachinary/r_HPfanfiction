Title says all. Recently I've been looking into Harry Potter fanfics (and I must say I haven't found anything really good) and I keep on running into Daphne Greengrass, which seems to always be a "good pureblood Slytherin", "abused and made fun of by her peers because she isn't conventionnaly Slytherin", and in general being like the god awful OCs that are all the same. Now at first I thought it was, indeed, an OC, since it didn't ring any bells, but the more I looked, the more she appeared, so my question is: who is this character? Why is she always the depressed and outcasted one? Was there a secret world-wide meeting or something in which everyone agreed to replace their OCs with her?


** u/SerCoat:

  Hermione's name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle and Daphne Greengrass.
#+end_quote

That is the sole mention of Daphne Greengrass in all seven books. Extra-canon sources tell us that her younger sister married Draco Malfoy.

And honestly, she's a popular character because's that's all she is - a name. We know nothing about her, bad or good, so people can make up whatever they want about her. But it avoids the HP/OC tag that means a good chunk of people (myself included) are simply not going to click on the fic.

My guess is that she's portrayed as an outcast in Slytherin /because/ that's the only time we see her. There's no mention of her hanging around with Pansy and being mean in any of the books so people assume that she must have disagreed with the prevailing Slytherin politics.

IIRC, Blaise Zabini filled a similar slot before Half-Blood Prince came out and it was confirmed that he was a boy. Prior to that, we had no idea whether Blaise was male or female and so people would use fem-Blaise as their designated-good-Slytherin-pretty-much-OC.

*** To add to that, she's also the only option for a good pureblood girl in Harry's year - Tracey is a half-blood, and all the others are more explicitly like Pansy.

So if someone likes/wants the dynamic of a non-evil Slytherin romantic partner, or one that explores pureblood culture, she's the only real choice. Add to that at least somewhat of a canon backstory (with her little sister marrying Draco and having the blood curse), and it gives her a little bit of character.

** Thought this was a troll post. Haven't seen a question like this in a while.

And [[/u/Sercoat][u/Sercoat]] is a tad incorrect. While it's true there's nothing in the books, JKR tells us she was part of Pansy's gang.

To add on to what others have said, Daphne is pureblood and potentially rich and that fits in well with the stories the fandom favors. That her sister marries Draco adds a little spice. She also has a really good name.

**** Probably, someone used her for some fic, someone's else read, liked the idea and tried something similar and from there it took of.

Nowadays she is the go to het pairing if you are doing a fic where Harry pays more attention to the magical world at large. There is the pairing him with a possible enemy, since one member of her family married into the Malfoy family, then the Greengrass are probably some traditional poreblood family and shares the same prejudices.

**** Previously Blaise Zabini was used as primary female slytherin paring, but then Half-Blood-Prince came out and we found out Blaise is a boy, so fanfic writer had to choose another Slytherin Pureblood girl in Harry's year.

The problem was that Pansy was a bitch and described unflattering by Harry, the same for Millicent in addition to Rowlings notes showing her as a half-blood, Tracey Davis was only named in Rowlings notes and was also noted to be a half-blood. In the end Daphne was chosen because she had a nice name, was mentioned briefly in the books and was a Slytherin Pureblood.

The thing is, it works. Tons of fandoms have blank slate characters or characters who basically existed for like one or two chapters and were totally unimportant.

Stories using those characters instead of just using OCs pretty much always do better. Many people refuse to read OCs and it shows. It's the reason the trope [character] in name only exists, turns out people avoid OCs like the plague, but they'll happily read a story where you completely changed the personality, appearance, backstory, familial history, and name of the original main character.

*** "She's just an excuse to shoehorn OCs, wah wah wah." That's you. That's how you sound.

Why not read more fics? You may find that she is the perfect candidate to remove or give understanding to a lot of the stigma of Slytherin and pureblood culture, without having the baggage of a Sirius, Weasley or Malfoy in showing the reader the world according to the author. Which is, you know, the reason for fanfiction.

**** Please read my comment a second time. Nowhere do I criticise the act of making Greengrass an OC. I only said, “It gives your story legitimacy.” As for the “it's mostly done by amateur writers”, that's not necessarily a bad thing either. I'm one such amateur writer and have used Greengrass productively in my own fic. In fact, my entire comment is neutral in tone.

From what I can infer from your comment, your English skills are not so bad. I believe your reading comprehension should be sufficient to comprehend my statement if you actually bothered to read it instead of skimming over it before slamming out an incensed response.

I personally feel it's a product the mindset and stigma that lead to things like the last 10 or so threads of people asking the subreddit if it's okay to deviate from cannon, or the last 5 or so asking about why aren't there any "good fics" left/why aren't people writing more?

****** If you have read either of my statements in this comment chain, you will note that I have never once mentioned that I think that OCs are a bad thing or require validation from the community.

My statement, “It gives your story legitimacy,” is true whether you like it or not. And even though OCs don't need validation from the community, writers do. And again, nowhere do I criticise the act of giving your story legitimacy. As said prior, I myself have substituted Greengrass with an OC to productive ends.

Once again, if you a actually bothered to read my comment instead of slamming your keyboard after your hair-trigger's been pulled, you would understand this.

And yes, I believe that it is complete fine to deviate from Canon and that there's still hundreds of new fics every week.

** Well, people have answered already, but I just wanted to add that the Daphne in the fanfics I've read is always pretty much a Bitch(which makes sense since she's part of Pansy's group). Astoria seems to be the depressed and "good" one. However it really depends on the pairing or pov of the fanfic. There were a few where Daphne is good and all that jazz... but however she is portrayed, I really like her character and the Greengrass family.

**** Yes, that's true too. That's fault of Pottermore Sorting. Before that most readers were more or less happy with all Slytherins being evil, but suddenly there is like one quarter of readers (if the distribution of Sorted users of Pottermore is equal), who are labelled as such. Thus huge group of “not all Slytherins are evil”, or Slytherin!Harry stories happened. Haphne is in the similar spirit.

** She's a very minor character, mentioned once across all 7 books, and never in more than a "She's just /there/" kind of way. From the books, all we know of her is:

- Her name (duh).
- She's in the same year as Harry as per OotP.

Even her being in Slytherin is found out via auxilliary material - the documentary Harry Potter and Me shows Rowling's notes on Harry's classmates, including a Greengrass in Slytherin. Then there's an interview in TIME that puts her in Pansy's Posse - but magazine interviews are pretty easy for fanfic writers to not come across.

Essentially, she's a ready-made stand in for an Original Character who's the Token Good Slytherin.

**** Daphne only actually comes up in the /books/ during Order of the Phoenix, during the O.W.L exams.

The rest, amusingly, is /all/ Word of Rowling. We see her notes for Harry's classmates in an early documentary (Harry Potter and Me, from 2001) - there's mention of a Queenie Greengrass in Slytherin ([[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_Me?file=Pagenotes.jpg][Screenshot]]). The safe assumption is the first name back then wasn't final, and in OotP Rowling changed it to Daphne (And not gonna lie, Daphne Greengrass does make for a better name).

In 2007, in an interview for TIME, she mentions Daphne as both being in Slytherin and in Parkinson's posse - [[http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/0,28804,1690753_1695388_1695569,00.html][Link here]]. Note that, while there's another source for "the Greengrass in Harry's year is a Slytherin", this is the /only/ actual source for her being in Pansy's gang. As such, it's relatively easy to /not/ put her in that posse.

Pottermore puts the Greengrass family in the Sacred Twenty-Eight ([[https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/who-are-the-sacred-twenty-eight][Link]]), which while it's not proof of where they'd be Sorted, it does serve the purpose of making her a pureblood at the very least.
