Is there a fanfic where Harry goes to the french or an American school? Like Beauxbatons or ilvermorny


** Some Ilvermorny fics:

The Fourth Champion by JamesSpookie, The Ilvermorny Champion by... someone (didn't read it), A Simple Act of Vengeance by Frickles.

I would link them, but the bot they use on this sub sucks harder than a commercial strength shop-vac, so there's not really a point. Just have to use google, unfortunately.

** I have seen a few but none of them ever discusses the schools themselves in detail. Mostly they are just plot backgrounds to justify pairings.

**** Sorry, it's been a while. One of them was about Harry being secret ninja or some shit that protects Delacour family.
