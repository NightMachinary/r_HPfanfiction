So I'm in search of fics where Lucius:

1. Has an interest in horses & horse riding. 1.A. Likes / has a soft spot for animals. I know I read one where he took part in fox hunts with the local upper class Muggles but the host insists on using live foxes which Lucius smugglers out and releases, replacing them with transfigured ones.

2. Has a career beyond being Lord Malfoy of the Malfoy Estate and all that's incurred in running the estate plus the Wizengamot. I've read one's where he's a lawyer/barrister or another where he was a healer who specialises in eyes.

So Lucius doesn't have to be a main character but I'd like if he was a rather active side character. And the things I want don't have to be a main plot point but even just mentioned/featured once or twice. While I prefer slash I don't mind her, however I don't like Ginny/Harry. Since this also has the effect of being a search for random fics, I love when Dark =/= Evil, and they help/support Harry.

Thanking you all in advance
