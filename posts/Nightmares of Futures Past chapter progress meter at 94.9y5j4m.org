Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past remains the most favourited HP story on fanfiction.net, but has been on medical hiatus since 2015. Now, the next chapter may be in sight.

The chapter 43 progress meter has been updating every six months or so, but now, in less than two weeks, it has jumped twice and is sitting at 94%.

(Am I doing a full reread at the moment, you ask? Whyever would I be doing that? ;) )


** Wow this is a blast from the past. I didn't start reading fics until 2015; I when I started, this fic was recommended to me. I'm pretty sure it's the second fic I ever read. And then when it went on hiatus, it was like, well, welcome to fanfiction . . .

In the interim, he's been releasing to his Patrons chapters of an original work he is also writing, and those have been coming pretty regularly.

I'm impressed he was able to pick it back up at all!

Over and over again, he's insisted that he's not abandoning it. And now it's just around the corner :). Within a few weeks, at this rate, his promise will be fulfilled. That's some commitment right there.

** Woha, after such a long time I seriously didn't expect this. But it's great news.

NoFP might be old, but I still consider easily consider it the best time travel fic that I've read so far that I would consider mostly canon compliant.

Usually, Harry either makes far too few changes and everything is predictable, or so many changes that it no longer feels like HP, or there are far too many weird magic rules and pureblood laws that feel pretty out of place in canon, or Harry acts far more ruthless and cold than I could ever imagine canon Harry become, or the author needlessly bashed so major characters.

Some time travel fics are of course great despite major changes to canon. but Nightmares of Futures Past is pretty much the only story in this genre that I can read and say "Yes, this is how I can imagine Harry's actions to affect the timeline in a canon-compliant breathing HP universe, these are choices that I can imagine Harry making, and this is how I can imagine the other characters to develop in response to his changed behavior."

*** Actually, what annoys me more is stories where Harry makes big changes that ought to disrupt the stations of canon, and yet canon happens. I've even read one involving an extensive, and imo frankly stupid, plot to free Wormtail after capturing him, so that he could resurrect Moldyshorts so that Harry could finish him properly. The timeline was waaay off at this point, yet Harry and co still clung to that specific point.

NoFP has a really interesting take on this. Little things often do turn out differently. The Weasleys don't win the Daily Prophet lottery and go to Egypt, for example. But often, when Harry changes things up, the thing he was trying to avoid will still sort of happen in some other way, and by now it seriously freaks him out and makes him fear for the overall success of his quest.

It's true that like amount is no /guarantee/ of quality, but it does mean that rather a lot of people may want to know whether or not it's something they'll probably like. So, again: what specifically is "dated" in NoFP? Because when I read it, I can see grammar and punctuation errors, and some mild plot holes (probably fixable with an author note), but I don't feel "this is out of date." Can you be specific?

  So, again: what specifically is "dated" in NoFP
#+end_quote

I am not the one you wrote with above. I have never read NoFP. But from the description alone it seems like one of those generic "time travel fix it" where the MC gets in his childhood body and then has to go through Hogwarts again.

So let's have a look at the first chapter and the description/tags.

It obviously has some issues with sexuality (the MC is suddenly in the body of an 11-year-old) and apparently dates a child (I would find time-traveller/18-year-old a lot less disturbing). That edges the line to grooming even with the best intentions (which I assume here since we are talking about Harry and not Snape/Harry or Snape/Hermione).

The whole "the cost of the war was too high" thing has been around for a long time. Especially the "sole survivor" aspect. The "Dumbledore advisor portrait" thing has been done to death. The "ten dark years" confession remains inconsequential. It also has "friendly goblins" and "buy Vernon's company".

Perhaps its worst (hinted at) sin is "shipping people based on the other timeline", which feels a lot like /playing god/, which seems to be a common thing in H/G time travel (mostly Ron/Hermione and the occasional Tonks/Lupin). And "let's befriend children even though I am an adult" is kinda odd as well. Have you ever heard how 11-year-olds talk? Their conversation topics, interests, worldviews and so on? It would be utterly mind-numbing for any adult over a longer amount of time. Even someone like Penelope Clearwater (15/16 at that time) or Tonks (18) would be difficult to connect with, especially given the PTSD Harry would/seems to have after the war.

At this point, I am halfway through chapter 2 and lost any and all interest in the story.

If you want an example for a more "modern" time-travel story, it would be something like "Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass"

******* > It obviously has some issues with sexuality

Well, Harry didn't get to date much before he spent 13 years fighting a horrific war, so there's some arrested development there. And then he didn't actually /replace/ his 11-year-old self, but /merged/, so he doesn't exactly map to any regular age. And by now he's spent several years in the new timeline, acting like a (precocious, troubled, unusually mature) child and being treated like a child and having no intention (or method) of ever returning to the old timeline, so he's identifying more and more with his physical age.

> and apparently dates a child

Nope, not thus far. He and Ginny are both very aware that it could go that way in the future and she knows that in the previous timeline it did but he wouldn't let it currently, for exactly the kinds of reasons you cite. He might have kept his distance from her, if he didn't know that feeling lonely and isolated literally /endangered her life/ by making her more susceptible to the Diary Horcrux.

> The whole "the cost of the war was too high" thing has been around for a long time.

Well, yes. It certainly wouldn't be innovative to write a story based on that premise now. Given that NoFP has been around since 2005, though, I'd imagine that it was fresh at the time. If you're bored with the concept, OK, that makes sense. For myself, it's not an issue if it's well done.

> it seems like one of those generic "time travel fix it" where the MC gets in his childhood body and then has to go through Hogwarts again.

It is indeed in that genre, but it's (IMO) a very well executed example. Harry is not playing on God Mode. He's done lots of small things better, but there are also some big potential storms brewing compared to canon such as the departure of Professor Snape from Hogwarts, and the unknown forces that intervened to secretly release Wormtail

******* Not sticking up for NoFP here. I've read it twice and it was decent. I may read it again when its finished but not before then. But I have been around fanfiction for a LONG time. I would be willing to bet longer than most everyone in this subreddit. I read my first one in 2001, Draco Dormiens... before it was a trilogy. I say all of this to show that I've seen a lot in the HP fanfiction world and how its evolved and changed over the years. When people call out fics like NoFP for all of the tropes and things being done to death in them it really annoys me. NoFP pioneered some of those ideas, it might be done to death now but it was one of the first fics to do a lot of it and all the newer fics that have come out since are taking their ideas for it.

It's the same story with the tragically unfinished Power of Time by Rosswrock. That story was... groundbreaking for it's time. 90% of what is in that fic that we would now consider tropes or tired plot points were first written by that author in that story. Harry's whirlwind shopping trip, him buying a huge multi compartment trunk, emancipation at an early age, potter family vaults. All of that was first written by Rosswrock in Power of Time. So yeah, it might be old and outdated now, but you have to read some fics from the perspective in which they were written. NoFP is in this category, it was pretty groundbreaking st the time it was first written, it might seem old and tired now but the ideas in it are the first iteration of them.

I loved this story mainly because the quality of the writing is really high; the characters are all well-rounded and unique; and because some of the individual scenes were incredibly moving. When I first read it, there were only a couple of other stories that could compare (that I knew about). Now I could list at least two dozen without really having to think very hard.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

******* Hmm, I recognise a couple. I've read about half of The Changeling and didn't mind it, though I didn't love it enough to finish; it felt a bit long. I did finish Blindness, which I liked, but didn't enjoy nearly as much as NoFP.

Starfox...I started reading the one about the muggleborn resistance, and was surprised by how well done it was. Very grim though; it's a well done depiction of /war/. If the others are on lighter topics, I'll definitely give them a try, thanks.

And yes, Backwards With Purpose is the "always and always" fic. The first book didn't wow me, though I found it tolerable. It was the second book that I really liked.

NoFP does have the advantage, for someone new to fanfic, that it respects a lot of canon. There's no Hermione x Snape here, no "Lockhart picked up Harry from the doorstep and raised him as a celebrity." Not that those things can't be done well, but walking before running and all that.

There's one that's quite divisive (many love it, many hate it), but I do recommend trying it out to see what you personally think: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality). Harry starts off a bit rude and unlikable, though funny, and he is certainly arrogant. Then he shows a different side, able to be loyal and selfless to his friends. And his flaws turn up to kick him in the backside, not once but many times. And he has to grapple with what it really means to be a hero, a friend, a leader, or for that matter a villain, what it really takes to be on the light side. And he comes within a hair's breadth of literally destroying the planet by accident, because combining Rowling magic with quantum physics is a scary thing.

Because Harry is quite aware of the ethical dilemma, and as far as I've seen his actions have been honorable. Yes, he's very emotionally invested in Ginny, but that's also true of Ron, of Hermione, of Mr and Mrs Weasley, of Sirius. He has made sure to befriend Ginny, because he knows that she was desperately lonely the first time, and it made her more vulnerable to the diary. But they're not dating, and they could be if he had chosen it.

Aw, come on, even if you count him as the full 30 years old, his half+7 only requires her to be 22. And he went back to a prepubescent body, so I think he should get some extra leeway there.

I'd have concerns, definitely. I'd have a lot of food for thought. But there are a whole heap of unique extenuating circumstances here. Harry could hardly have been expected to avoid making friends with all his school peers just because his mental age is higher. He first got to know Ron and Ginny when he was their own age. He came back to literally save the lives of the entire family. He has spent years being closely observed by one or more of the Weasleys, and their judgment of his character is that he's honest and loyal. I think he deserves a pass on /befriending/ Ginny.

If a 30-year-old man had proved to me, over the space of years, that he was honestly devoted to my 18-year-old daughter through thick and thin, that if necessary he would unhesitatingly lay down his life for her sake - I don't think his age would be an impossible obstacle. Unusual, cause for concern, sure, but significantly closer to normal than "Harry lost everyone he cared about, killed a dark wizard thought to be immortal, then travelled back in time 19 years by committing suicide to alter the timeline and save everyone." Relationship age gaps are pretty small by comparison.

***** Incidentally, you might be interested in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/40/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][chapter 40]] where Charlie, after learning about the time jump, expresses similar concerns about Harry's friendship with his little sister. He suggests that Harry is perhaps too old for her, plus "You hurt her, I can hold a human-to-beef transfiguration long enough for a Horntail to digest the evidence." And Harry thinks his attitude is fair, although he's confident that Ginny would whack him first if he deserved it. Ginny herself, who has indeed known all about what's going on for over a year, does not much appreciate Charlie's attitude, though I'll grant that she's still a minor and thus her opinion is of less weight. Still, she's not the kind of girl to be easily cowed and dominated, and indeed, if anything, Harry's changes have given her more self-confidence than ever.
