Hi

I am looking for fanfictions with an Independant Harry and Competent Harry (who knows more than Stupefx et Expelliarmus in combative magic and more battle magic and maybe even some dark arts ) that is the Lord of his houses and is forced by the ministry interference (violation by the ministry of Hogwarts sovereignty as Hogwarts predate the Ministry and the Lords Gatherings of the Wizard Council ) and by Dumbledore incompetency to select Good teachers


** I dont think there is one like that.

You should try to write it

*** Actually there is a fanfiction that fit within the criteria , it is the story that inspired me to search something similar : /Basilisk-born/ by *Ebenbild* linkffn(10709411)

In this fanfiction even with Time-Travel and several names due to extreme longevity, Harry is Independant , Competent, interested in the dark arts and finally owner of Hogwarts by being who he is and very ancient laws that predates the ministry, the wizengamot and the lord gatherings. The rest is 5 year Canon situation in the school with Fudge violation of the Soveraintety of Hogwarts.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
