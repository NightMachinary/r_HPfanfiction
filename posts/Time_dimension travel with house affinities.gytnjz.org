:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all, I'm searching a time travel fic I read a few months ago. Harry either time travels or dimension hops, landing in a world where family means a great deal. He uses a magical public library with a magical pedastal family tree to find a small branch of the Potter family tree from whom he can claim lineage, since this world's Harry still exists (and also has siblings?). He ends up having to find another woman who could have been his "mother", and has to use newspapers to narrow down the possibilites. I think he lands on someone named Evangeline? In addition to family rivalries (your great-aunt started a feud at this wedding, kind of thing) being common arguments among students, families also have affinities, or special skills that set them apart. Our Harry becomes good friends with Blaise.

Any thoughts? Thanks, I appreciate it.

#+begin_quote
  Magic is an eco-system, and the magical world has been culling magical people and creatures for generations. It has finally gone too far - and the collective consequences are finally being felt. When magic starts disappearing, crumbling quietly in post-war Britain, it causes a cascade effect across the wizarding world. Not a single magical child has been born in almost a decade.Twenty-three-year-old Harry Potter discovers this when the wards of Diagon Alley literally come crashing down on top of him. So ends the life of the Boy-Who-Lived. Yet again, he returns to the station between life and death.With a new chance in a new world, Harry - now eleven-year-old Harry Fleamont - is given a chance to figure out how to save his dying world. In a new world that seems much more perfect in every sense of the word, Harry is faced with a growing threat from a much more dangerous Voldemort, and the reality that jumping universes just makes vulnerable and poor wizards who just want to eat a regular meal and afford to buy a pair of Merlin-damned socks.

** I don't have a problem with the helpful goblins trope, but I like the idea of having to physically research the family tree.
