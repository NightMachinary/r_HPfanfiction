I always love those stories where a man or woman falls in love with a single parent, but they have to win over the kids first. Often times, the single parent will have to run out of town for some reason, and while they're away, the bf/gf has to watch the kids. Of course, usually there are all kinds of antics and stuff to go along with it.


** I would love to read one of these, but in a reverse linkffn(Grow Young with Me) has single father Harry grow close to a muggle girl. It's in progress but so far its been really sweet and touching, I cried quite a few times reading it.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

*** I tried reading the first chapter but the girl is already annoying me. Does she tone down her energetic personality later on ?

  Harry's twin brother is regarded as the Boy-Who-Lived. No one is aware of Harry, whose very existence has been forgotten, except by the Potter house elves. When Severus Snape finds out about Harry, he sees this as a chance to escape Dumbledore's control. Captivated by the little boy, he takes it upon himself to give Harry the father he needs. SS/HP father/son relationship.
