** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2567419/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Summer-Of-Change]] I very much enjoyed reading this fanfic, even though it contained too many cliches.

The R-Series is pretty good from what I remember.

*** It was really good.....right up until the departure from canon plotlines at which point it gets really weird really quickly. I also really hated the vampire character inserted for no reason. And the fact that Tonks was Harry's age was bizarre, but tolerable.

I liked the beginning, so I just stopped reading when I couldn't tolerate it any longer and pretended it was unfinished.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7746111/1/Harry-Potter-the-Halfblood-Auror][Harry Potter & the Halfblood Auror]] is my favourite Harry/Tonks fic, and is still being regularly updated, but the R-Series is also a very good read.
