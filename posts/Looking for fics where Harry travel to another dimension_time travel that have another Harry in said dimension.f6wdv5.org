Take the fic I just read today for example: it involves an adult Harry Potter who got put into a dimension where he is a 4 year Hufflepuff orphan. The fic also has Boy-Who-Lived Neville, and a Harry with alive parents. The interaction between Harry and the other Harry is really amusing, so Im looking for fics with similar concept. Much thanks!


** /Echoes in the Fog/ qualifies. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13165325/1/Echoes-in-the-Fog]]) Grey!Harry and Canon!Harry, plus friends, end up in a world where Voldemort won and Evil!Harry is his second in command. I'd recommend reading the author's short (35k words) fic /For Lack of a Bezoar/ to better understand the background of Grey!Harry. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13108396/1/For-Lack-of-a-Bezoar]])

Both are really good works.

  Our choices define us. When Harry and his closest friends are transported to an alternate dimension, thirty years after the war's end, and forced to face the results of what would have been if only they had chosen differently, he will discover just how true this is. Features H/G, H/Hr, H/DG. Not multi.

linkffn(the games they play) and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1127441][Step back in time series]] ^{linkao3(Step back in time - Part One}) are snarry. The first one is quite slow-burn though, so it's safe to read even if you don't like snarry.

They all are time-travel.
