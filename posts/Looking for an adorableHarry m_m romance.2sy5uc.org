I know. Shame on me. This is my guilty pleasure. I'm in the mood for some slash where Harry is innocent/oblivious/naive. Any well-written recs? Any rating is fine. Any length is fine (/cough/). Crossovers are welcome.

Gosh.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5783269/1/World-Enough-and-Time][World Enough and Time]] is a Viktor/Harry romance with a pretty adorable Harry. It has quite a bit of Britain!bashing, but if you can overlook that it's a cute little romance (albeit a bit on the shorter side with 31k words).

** If you haven't already you need to read Draco Malfoy: Toilet Supremo. It's on AO3 and is absolutely hilarious, Harry and Draco are both adorable in it :)

**** If you're interested I have a ton of bookmarks on my AO3 and they're all Harry centric, mostly Drarry with some Snarry and a couple other pairings. [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Fionaxyz/bookmarks][Link here.]]

** It's been a while since I read it, but I greatly enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/798255/1/Checkmate][Checkmate]]. I thought some of the Harry / Draco moments were absolutely adorable.
