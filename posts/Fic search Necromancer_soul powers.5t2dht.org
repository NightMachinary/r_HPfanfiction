  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy. Oh, and everyone thinks he's a squib. When it comes to Harry, however, all bets are off and nothing is entirely certain.

  The blood wards hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

** linkffn(9057950) Too Young to die is honestly one of the best dark!harry I've ever read. Harry in there is young, sometimes foolish and irrational and a very picture of what a psychopathic child is. The plot revolves around Harry trying to resurrect his dead sister. There are also overused bad!Potters and a twin boy-who-lived, but I promise you, it's not what it looks like.

** linkffn(Blindness) has him see souls (but be blind to all else) and magic, and work on resurrection. The Deathly Hallows, the Veil and vampires come into play later. It's truly rather good, but has a couple of things some people might not like: namely, it has a Harry/Hermione pairing, an arguably OP Harry, and an afterlife system that the author thinks is perfectly OK but not everyboyd would (I, for one, think it's rather horrific).

In linkffn(Core Threads), Harry manipulares peoples' magical cores and later discovers that cores and souls are the same thing. He's a bit put off, seeing how lightly he was twisting them around earlier. Anyway, he ends up having a few hundred thousand souls to himself. (It makes some sense in context.) All this textually fits your request, but has none of the 'dark' undertones your 'Necromancer' term implied.
