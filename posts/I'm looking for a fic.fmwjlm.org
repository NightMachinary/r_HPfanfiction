HI! I'm looking for any fanfiction that has the golden trio being very close. I want them to be inseparable and to trust each other with everything. I would also like to see Ron and Hermione being very protective of Harry. Thank you!

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** If you haven't read it, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11949173/1/Improbable-Foundations][this]] seems to fit. It's a post-DH fic in which the trio goes back to Hogwarts to repeat their 7th year. The three of them are very close and protective of each other as a result of their experiences in the war. It's a WIP but updated pretty regularly.

  Harry gets his magical inheritance as a Necromancer on his 16th birthday, the first in centuries. Unsure of his future or even who to trust after the Light shuns him, Harry turns to the Dark, the only other side that can assist him in seeking his revenge. However, it's all just temporary. It's just an alliance until his goals are met and then that's it. Just temporary...right?Slight Dumbledore and some Order member bashing. Sane Voldemort but Horcruxes do exist. Pairings are still undetermined, but leaning to a Harry/Voldemort but not definite and won't be for a bit anyway. Not really graphic in deaths at least not yet. If that changes the rating will change.

  Set the summer after OOTP. Hermione gets struck by Dolohov's Curse in the Department of Mysteries and that sparks a change in the relationship between Harry and Hermione. They help each other deal with the grief, finding solace in each other and, eventually, love. Rated M for mentions of child abuse, some swearing and mild adult situations.
