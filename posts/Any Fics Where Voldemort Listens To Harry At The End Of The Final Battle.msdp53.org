I'm sure everyone remembers the infamous final conversation...

(Specifically this extract)

----

"Yeah, it did." said Harry. "You're right. But before you try to kill me, I'd advise you think about what you've done.... Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle...."

"What is this?"

Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this. Harry saw his pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten.

"It's your one last chance," said Harry, "it's all you've got left.... I've seen what you'll be otherwise.... Be a man...try... Try for some remorse..."

"You dare--?" said Voldemort again.

"Yes, I dare," said Harry, "because Dumbledore's last plan hasn't backfired on me at all. It's backfired on you, Riddle."

----

Of course, now I'm curious; what if Voldy reacted differently?

So, are there any Fics where Riddle (for any reason) accepts Harry's “second chance” offering, feels remorse/doubt/guilt or just does something other than childishly denying the truth and being an arrogant prat?


** I would love to see that. However, Hermione mentioned before that the remorse would probably kill anybody who would go that way.

*** Hah, so Voldemort was screwed either way. Good on him for going out fighting, then.

**** Well, I still think that the remorse would be better. It is still true what Dumbledore said that there were worse things than dying. Actions have consequences, and sometimes a redemption means to die well (or to go to jail for all post-HBP Draco lovers).

***** Heh, I may just have a problem with “empathising with the villain” but this always struck me as odd. Dumbledore was always preaching the idea of how “Love conquers Death” and how Love was the most powerful force in existence. (Even the DoM believes so. Remember the sealed off room?) Anyway, Voldemort; the person who probably needed Love the most (especially as a child) was literally the one person Dumbledore shunned and truly hated. Grindellwald-left to live, but in prison. Snape-pretty much pardoned and entrusted. Draco-sympathised with. Fudge-pitied and indirectly mocked. Tom Riddle-neglected, distrusted almost IMMEDIATELY for no reason and never shown Love.

See? Well this definitely raises more questions. (I'll end this here as it's getting kinda long but I'd love to discuss!)

****** Stupidity of youth? Otherwise, there was a story where Harry (in HBP context, when Dumbledore has shown him the memory of Tom Riddle in the orphanage) shouted at Dumbledore exactly because of this: what did he think, that an orphan terrorizing his orphanage-mates because he feels powerless will be turned to The Right Way™ by being terrorized into submission? Unfortunately, I cannot find it at the moment.

  Lily's sacrifice did a lot more for Harry than protect him from Voldemort. It protected him from the worst of his relatives' abuse, too. But when Dumbledore tells him the whole story, he decides he's had enough and takes control of his life. Set in sixth year.
