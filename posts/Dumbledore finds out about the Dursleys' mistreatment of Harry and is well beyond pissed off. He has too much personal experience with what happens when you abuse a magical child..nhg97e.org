Ariana. His father and eventually, his mother. His relationship with his brother. Credence, Gellert's "weapon" of choice. Tom Riddle, better known as Voldemort, although Albus honestly wasn't certain about how much the bullying and isolation had affected him. All of these people, as well as countless others, swirled through his mind as he beheld the medical report Poppy had just dropped on his desk like the terrifying Muggle atomic weapons that were unleashed on Hiroshima and Nagasaki; at the top of the seemingly mundane file, was written Patient: Potter, Harry James. A bone deep rage stole over him like an oily tide, stifling all but one thought that he whispered under his breath.

"Not again."


** What SHOULD have happened. Yes.

Raise him at Hogwarts, he can stay at the Gryffindor Tower during the Summer Holidays, and meet Professor Dumbledore for meals and other ways.

Or: Have Dumbledore find someone suitable to raise him. He can ask Andromeda and Ted, he can ask Kingsley, Nymphadora Tonks, he can ask Bill since Bill would be of age to take Harry at this point and time, (well, depending on when Albus finds out).

The Ministry wouldn't let Remus take Harry in, BUT! There are other people who would take him.

Heck, I could see even the Weasley's being able to move away from their home, if that meant that Harry was somewhere safe and where the bad guys couldn't find him.

Heck! Albus could beg Abeforth to take Harry. Albus could ask Poppy to take in Harry, etc.

There ARE options. Again, depending on how old Harry is when Albus finds out, and how old Bill is and when he trains for cursebreaking, he can protect the houses from potential invaders.

Dumbledore himself, could protect the house from potential invaders.

Heck! Have others assume Harry is still staying at the Dursley's, let Harry make a few remarks about being upset about going back, so anyone who overhears thinks he's at the Dursley's, and then he ends up somewhere else instead . SO many options that Dumbledore could have done but simply didn't, just because the protection spells protected Harry from the Death Eaters, didn't mean that they protect him from the Dursley's. While he isn't as abused as Fanon likes to portray

He was abused! No matter what others say, he was.

They put under the cupboard under the stairs, when the Dursley's had two other bedrooms. Fed him just enough food to keep him alive (The Weasley's ended up giving Harry food during the Summer)

Harry seemed to know to stay away from Vernon's fist, when Harry was listening to the news outside, under the window.

Didn't buy him new clothes. Didn't even buy him his own hand me down clothes that would fit him better, but instead gave him Dursley's old hand me down clothes that were way too big.

Harry ducked with seemingly a lot of practice, when Petunia threw a pan at his head. There were no photos of Harry throughout the house. Harry didn't get presents from the Dursley's, but Dudley was spoiled.

The Dursley's put a freaking cat flap, lock on his door, and bars on his freaking window! like he was a prisoner instead of a family member. If you don't consider that abuse/neglect, you need to rethink that.

Sorry for the long rant. I just HATE when people say Harry wasn't abused or neglected. He was. Not to the extent that Fanon likes to say, but he was.

But even moreso, they neglected him and MASSIVELY emotionally abused him to the point where I'm surprised Rowling depicts him as well-adjusted as he is, and I can see major signs of badness in spite of that.

Harry definitely shows signs of not trusting adults. He doesn't tell Dumbledore about writing in the diary, he tells McGonagall about the stone, but when she doesn't do anything, he learns to do things for himself. Which probably validates that adults just don't care what happens to kids.

He probably told little tidbits about the Dursley's "off screen" so to speak, to Ron and Hermione, I don't see someone like Hermione letting go the fact that Harry doesn't buy the Dursley's presents for Christmas, for example. So I can see him telling them a few things, but I bet you anything, he has kept them in the dark about a LOT of stuff.

Besides the fact that Rowling just wanted Harry to stay at the Dursley's, I like to think that Molly just assumed Fred and George were exaggerating in order to get out of trouble when they told her about the bars and door, otherwise I don't see her ignoring that information. Again, outside of Rowling wanting Harry to stay at the Dursley's for stupid petty drama that could have been avoided.

Heck! When Ron and Hermione couldn't write him proper letters because of the Order, they could have written him letters about other things instead, or coming up with a code or something, which again, just shows that Rowling just wanted some stupid drama when Harry met with Ron and Hermione again. Which, I totally understand why Harry got so mad at them for not telling him anything.

I can only see himself or McGonagall, but they'd both be far too busy. And Dumbledore makes it explicitly clear in canon that he believed Voldemort would be able to bypass any other protection.

Dumbledore also didn't have the hindsight of knowing when Voldemort would come back. Putting Harry at the Dursleys was his way of making sure Harry didn't get tortured into insanity or killed.

***** People get all so hung up on the whole Fidelius thing.

That wasn't the main reason why Sirius went to Azkaban - the reason were the thirteen murdered people. Even if Dumbledore believed out of the fullest of his heart that Sirius wasn't a Death Eater and wasn't responsible for the Potter's death he couldn't have helped him getting out of Azkaban - and at this point of time Dumbledore thought that Sirius actually betrayed the Potters and was a Death Eater because James and Lily told everyone that Sirius was the Secret Keeper - and Dumbledore didn't have any reason to believe that they lied about that.

But even that weren't the point. Say, Dumbledore doubted the Potters and knew that Sirius wouldn't betray them... he still couldn't have helped Sirius. Even the chief warlock can't ignore 13 murders. And to be honest, I believe that Dumbledore thought Sirius actually able to comit the murders. Sirius may have fought for the right side but his moral compass wasn't the best. He thought of sending another student to a werewolf as a prank.

And while there wasn't a trial, there was an investigation. Dumbledore said he stated in front of the Ministry that Sirius was the Potters Secret Keeper. And this investigation, while reading the evidence wrong, found Sirius guilty.

So there wasn't really a reason for Dumbledore to doubt Sirius fault and no reason to talk to him and defend him.

Yeah, I'm going to have to step in right there and say that doesn't excuse the matter. Even Bellatrix got a damn trial. Sirius didn't and that is a breach of rights. It just goes to show that either A. Rowling didn't think, or B. It's part of her world that everyone in a position of power (including Dumbledore) is corrupt enough to ignore that fact.

I don't think it's ever really explained fully, but IIRC Sirius is taken directly to Azkaban by Crouch, and since Sirius seemingly admitted to the crime, it was like "welp, straight to jail with you!" They weren't letting any potential Death Eaters just walk away. Dumbledore /could/ have gone to bat for Sirius, but that's assuming Dumbledore knew the circumstances and believed Sirius' side.

This is also taking into account that Dumbledore, Sirius, and the supposedly dead Peter Pettigrew are the only ones who knew about the Fidelius. It isn't immediately public knowledge.

Snape went to Dumbledore first, which is why Dumbledore made him his spy. If Sirius had gone straight to Dumbledore instead of immediately going after Peter, things would probably be different.

Even if Dumbledore thinks Sirius is a Death Eater, Sirius could just lie. There's nothing really contingent on interrogating Death Eaters about Voldemort's plans and whereabouts when the man is probably crazy / delusional / distraught. Should he have followed up? Sure, but we only know this with hindsight.

And dumbledore and McG couldn't raise him - they both have 3 jobs and cannonicly, Dumbledore isn't usually around Hogwarts, and McG isn't around for her Gryfondors(as far as we know).

He wasn't aware of it "all." He was aware Harry would have a dark and difficult time. This doesn't mean he knew Harry would live in the cupboard or whatever.

Dumbledore knew Harry would be neglected at the very least. But the alternative was with someone else who might be loyal to Voldemort and without the protection of the bond of blood charm.

Dumbledore makes it clear that Voldemort would have eventually bypassed any other enchantment, and the bond of blood charm was the only one Voldemort likely wouldn't be able to figure out. He had no idea when Voldemort would be back. He had no idea who he could trust.

The terror of Voldemort was that he turned family and best friends against each other. And to Dumbledore, that had been proven with Sirius Black.

So he had a choice. Risk leaving Harry with a follower of Voldemort and having him killed or tortured into insanity, or leave him in a likely abusive home where he would at least survive.

The criticism therefore should be aimed at whether he could have at least intervened in the Dursleys home. Could he have? Maybe. Or maybe trying it would have caused Petunia to kick Harry out.

If she hadn't gotten that reminder, do you really think she would have argued in favor of Harry's continued presence at #4?

That howler was proof that he didn't need to physically check on Harry to alert the Dursleys to the fact that he was watching them. Periodic reminders of that sort might have made living there more bearable for Harry growing up. Considering the Dursleys' obsession with appearances and reputation, I would think periodic reminders of that sort, rather than in-person visits, which allowed them to keep up the appearance of normality, would have kept Petunia from kicking Harry out and made Harry's life there more tolerable in the process.

The fact that Dumbledore left Harry there despite knowing it would be "dark and difficult" for him leads me to believe that Dumbledore either forgot or underestimated just how dark muggles could get with kids and thought McGonagall's description of the Dursleys as the "worst sort of muggles" was an exaggeration on her part. He gambled Harry's life and well-being, as well as the fate of wizarding Britain, on the assumption that nothing could be as bad as or worse than Harry ending up in the hands of death eaters/Voldemort.

*** Voldemort could have easily broken past any magical protection.

This was a protection he could not understand and hence could not overcome.

Even when he thought he beat it,(in GoF), he actuall gave Harry a ticket to life.

But-letting a child suffer through abuse-was not cool.

The out-of-universe explanation is that JKR wanted him to come from that sort of background. She didn't realize her poor planning would backfire on Dumbledore like this. She could have constructed a more genuine explanation for why he had to stay at the Dursleys, or better yet, shown us that no other protection was truly safe. Ie have Dumbledore try alternative arrangements but have them fail. The in-universe one-wizards don't have a lot of logic, not even great ones like Dumbledore? I mean, from the Sorcerer's Stone to a student dying in the castle to the Ministry's ridiculuous attitude in OoTP to the insane 7 Potters plan-yeah, they aren't very logical. Not to mention the way they approached the Horcrux Hunt. Not to sound too critical, but ignoring these slight lapses of logic and treating the series like a pseudo-fairytale will perhaps help. In some ways, the magic is the least normal thing in the Wizarding World.

But while almost every point you made was bang-on, I don't think he should have stayed at Hogwarts. Albus could not have defended Harry himself all the time and Harry was attacked by Voldy multiple times in the books in Hogwarts itself. With so many students to look after in a highly sentient magical castle next to a Forbidden Forest filled with dark creatures, the castle itself having a poltergeist-I mean Hogwarts itself is very unsafe.

But other thn that, you're right, he shouldn't have suffered like this.

*** I really hope he isn't Dumbledore's brother. The only way they could make that fit would be retconning everything we know about the Dumbledores:

Kendra died in 1899, Credence is to young to be her son.

Percival was in Azkaban since 1890 and died there some time after that.

It' not possible for Albus and Credence to share parents without retconning the etablished backstory.

Him being a secret Dumbledore could still be possible - through Aberforth. We now that Ariana died to young for being Credences mother. Albus is gay, so he probably wouldn't have fathered a child unknowingly. That leaves Aberforth. For all we know he could have had sex with a woman and didn't know she got pregnant. Or he didn't care (but seeing how caring he was with Ariana, I wouldn't think that could be the case). That would be even more interesting than Credence being Albus' brother.

Aberforth already lost Ariana because of Albus and Grindelwald. His child being used against them would be really interesting.

That wouldn't fit the timeline. Percival killed the muggles before Albus went to Hogwarts. Being the son of a mugglemurder effected young Albus - that's the reason he befriended Elphias Doge in his first year. They were both outsiders at Hogwarts.

Ariana was younger that Albus and Aberforth. So she was around six when the attack happened.

Percival was in azkaban before credence can be conceived. If we believe the time line as we know it is correct then it can only be a child of Albus or Aberforth (or a cousin)

Because unless he is a half brother and the family name is in the female line then it doesn't make sense to be Ablus's brother.

*** When I think of Grindelwald and his, from what we were able to see in his initial interaction with Credence, "Magic is Might" mentality, I expect in the end it won't have much to do with Credence at all.

I believe the obscurius that's attached itself to Credence was the one that got created by Ariana. (Depending on the mechanics behind how obscurials work.) Whether it created a body "aka Credence" or attached to a squid who felt familiar to Ariana.

That would explain the Dumbledore link for me.

Whatever happened in the duel between the Dumbledores and Grindelwald, whether it was because of Ariana being an obscurial / Grindelwald wanting the obscurius for whatever reason / just them fighting, Ariana's death might have been none of them, but the obscurius overwhelming her and escaping.

Que, Grindelwald sees the powerful entity as the real Ariana, Albus sees it as ultimate punishment or 'cost' for trying to achieve too much personal power and tempers himself (become a school teacher), and Abberforth (who we see has a portrait of Ariana) is the one actually looking for the obscurius to put it to rest, not Albus.

Probably just mental gymnastics to have something more substantial than "secret subling shows up" shenanigans. :D

Book 5 (OOTP) chapter 37 explained that Dumbledore placed a charm on Harry to shield him, but Petunia has to take Harry in order to seal the charm because, as Dumbledore said to Harry, "Where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort."

So, to get around this, I found some other previously-unknown relative of Lily's who could take Harry in. Hey, no one said the one with his "mother's blood" has to be Petunia. It could be one of Lily's long, lost cousin or brother or something. As long as they're directly related to Lily, it should work. So, blood wards solved. And Harry's no longer abused.

It would be interesting to see a fic where Dumbledore left Harry at the Dursley's with the intent of him becoming an Obscurus because he has personal experience with what happens when a magical child is abused.

** Linkffn(12740667) This isn't the central focus of the fic, but Dumbledore rescues Harry from the Dursleys after he doesn't respond to his Hogwarts letter. The author likes to emphasize that while Harry was physically abused, the worst affects doesn't come from injuries that can be healed by magic, but by the isolation(the cupboard) and lack of emotional development that being raised by the Dursleys left Harry with. Features a mentor!Dumbledore that is genuinely concerned for Harry's wellbeing and his similarities to Tom Riddle and Grindelwald. As the story goes on, Harry gets darker and darker, but dark isn't evil. In the end, he's still trying to defeat Voldemort and doing the right thing, even if he is pretty creepy. Unfortunately abandoned, but I still recommend it. Other than that, you could probably google ‚ÄúDumbledore rescues Harry from the Dursleys Fanfiction‚Äù and find results for what you're looking for.

Essentially he was the general put between a rock, and a hard place.

Sure raising Harry like a pig to slaughter to paraphrase is horrible, but holding that one life above everyone's is worse. We see the story through Harry's eyes, so we are usually on his side, but can you imagine looking at it from Dumbledore's POV? Imagine that you have all this dangerous information, information that you can't really trust others to have, because imagine either someone somehow taking it from them, or how much weight it could put on another's shoulders.

I honestly feel bad for Dumbledore, in a world of magic it's hard to trust others, because what about Polyjuice? Imperius? Compulsions? Etc... He knows there's only one person who can defeat this monster, and the strongest protection for him is also in a house with a bad family.

  Second, yes it was Lily's sacrifice, but living where her blood dwell is what allowed to continue having that protection.

This is not at all true.

********* Elaborate on your belief that Harry didn't need to stay at the Dursley's. I hate them as much as the next guy, but without that protection he dies by the end of the first movie alone.

********** I mean, there is literally /zero/ evidence that Lily's sacrificial magic can only work if Harry stays at the Dursleys. The Bond of Blood Charm is what works if Harry stays with Petunia, but that is not the same magic that Lily invoked which saved Harry from the Killing Curse. They are two separate pieces of magic, and Lily's does not need Petunia's to work. Petunia's doesn't need Lily's, even, not after it's been cast.

*********** Explain why Dumbledore would place him there. One of the most knowledgeable Wizards on magic period. Lily sacrificing herself to save Harry is what essentially triggered the Charm to take hold just like Harry sacrificing himself did the same. That was the casting of it though. Unless you can explain to me how the charm could stay powered for over a decade without the bond of blood(blood wards), than it's pretty obvious. Essentially back up your point with what you know before trying to decunstruct an argument.

We know one of the most knowledgeable people of that universe thought it necessary to protect him, whatever his faults. We know that after over a decade of the Charm being cast, Harry still carried such protections. We know such protections to protect you from the literal Killing Curse requires power, a lot of power. The most likely solution to this than is that what was started by blood could be powered by blood. Harry being the target for a sacrificial piece of magic means he can't likely power it himself. Him powering a sacrificial piece of magic to protect just wouldn't work, because of how the charm itself works.

************ Dude, this isn't even debatable. Go reread the books. Dumbledore placed Harry there for the protection that place granted him from Voldemort and his followers. Dumbledore literally explains this. Dumbledore at NO POINT says Petunia's protection recharges Lily's. Literally never even implies it.

It doesn't even make sense! Why would Harry go back to Petunia after Voldemort bypassed Lily's protection?

No we don't? All we're told is that it required Lily's sacrifice. We are never /ever/ told it requires a lot of power for it to stick around. You're literally making shit up.

It stays powered because it stays powered. There is absolutely no reason to believe Lily's magic needs to be recharged. Hogwarts enchantments stayed up for centuries.

This is ridiculous. Go reread the books and stop wasting my time with nonsense. I'm not wasting my time with a user so a stubborn they're arguing against basic canon. Wtf.

************* So your rebuttals are, "it stays powered because it stays powered," and that a piece of magic literally requiring sacrifice does not need much power to block a killing curse. Yeah, sure, alright. Whatever you say mate. I'm just gonna be here laughing my ass off at your "response."

Also your argument about him not needing to go there to recharge Lily's protection, why does he say that Harry must go back every year for I believe two weeks for his own safety. Why must he go there if he can leave after two weeks without Dumbledore worrying about his safety. It's as if he has some kind of protection that requires close contact with that of a blood relative to stay active. Hmmmmmm.

************** /No/, my rebuttal is that you have zero evidence of your claims, and that the "power" needed /is/ Lily's sacrifice. That alone is what fuels the magic, and there is, /again/, zero evidence that it needs further fueling.

Go ahead. Provide a single quote from the books where we're told /Lily's/ spell needs to be powered repeatedly. Not Dumbledore's spell on Privet Drive, that's a separate spell. I mean /Lily's./

#+begin_quote
  why does he say that Harry must go back every year for I believe two weeks for his own safety.
#+end_quote

So he has a safe haven! So he can be absolutely safe from Voldemort /and/ his followers. Lily's protection only protects him from Voldemort, and that protection could be bypassed, /as we saw/ in the fourth book.

But Privet Drive's protection stayed even when Lily's was cancelled out when Voldemort took Harry's blood. Why? If the Privet Drive spell is meant to only fuel Lily's spell, why the fuck does Harry go back there after Lily's magic is gone? You completely ignored that on my last comment.

I've never met someone so confident despite adamantly refusing to provide a single shred of evidence.

Provide evidence in your next comment or I'm blocking you.

***** The explanation for this is made explicitly clear in canon. Dumbledore knew Voldemort would come back, and possibly very soon. He believed any other normal protection would not work. What is Voldemort came back and he didn't know? And Voldemort slowly worked past the protections of another home? The protection over Privet Drive was magic Voldemort didn't understand.

Your solution would have resulted in a dead kid. If not worse.
