I'm talking about Harry becoming a "dark lord" for a morally good reason.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  He's not the Boy-Who-Lived. He's not the Chosen One. He's not even a hero. Quite the opposite in fact. He's a being of such terrible greatness that at one point, those who were hated as devils and worshiped as deities, saw fit to seal him away. Now he's back and he wants his throne. Let Order reign...

** Unfortunately, no.

The closest is *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185): he had a good vision, but to get there, thousands, if not millions, had to die first.

I disagree. There are some, but I honestly cant remember them off the top of my head. Would have to spend some time wracking my brain or doing research to remember the ones I have read/seen.

Also for the OP: Emperor is a VERY good fic, but be warned, its so AU that it almost doesn't count as HPFF in my view. And as Inquisitor said, it does not really fit the "dark lord" aspect.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
