This might be a long shot, but after reading 'Perfect Slytherins' by Jeconais I'm hooked and I need more! Does anybody know anything like this?

#+begin_quote
  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

*** The 'perfect slytherins' is a series. Tales from the first year, tales from the second year etc.

He/She has written heaps of other harry potter fan fics as well. One I've already read is 'this means war'

A lot of the story is written via wizarding emails, and the wizarding internet. It sounds strange, (and tbf it is) but I super enjoyed it.

Its a Harry/Ginny pairing with Snape being more good than bad. I thought it was quite funny.

I also have Harveste Addams bookmarked, but someone else has linked that already, so I won't duplicate. I went through a phase a couple months ago of looking for addams family/harry potter crossovers. FFN has 70 works marked as crossovers between the two, if you want to browse.

** Ishtar on the same site (ffa) had a HP/Addams Family fic /Family Values/, but I recall it being a bit weak on the Addams Family characterization (and I don't remember a pairing). Also, Tenhawk's /Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council/ is a Buffy/HP/Addams Family multi-cross. (There's a bit of Tomb Raider later on as well.)

** I can't think of any that are complete off the top of my head but linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11623578/1/Absinthe-Addams-and-the-forgotten-identity]]) for a while was considered a spiritual successor to harveste Addams because it has a similar feel, and was being regularly updated. It hasn't had an update in a while, but it's still quite good. If you enjoy this I know of at least one good Harry-Potter/Munsters crossover, but I don't want to add it here and clutter this thread.

  Summary: Dumbledore should have never left Harry on the front steps for so long unattended, especially on Samhain. What if a certain enchantress from one of the darkest pureblood families known to date found him and decided to raise him as one of her own? What would happen to the Wizarding world? The answer: Pure chaos. Dark!Powerful!harry Crossdressing! Dumbles/Ron/Ginny bashing!

*** Thanks a lot, i'll read that one as well. I didn't think there would be any, so i'm super glad I asked. Lots of people have given me good fics to read!

Would you mind linking the Munster one as well? Or PM'ing me it?

**** Here it is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9136440/1/Dodgers-Dresses-Teddy-Bears-and-Spot]]) fair warning it's a bit of a crack fic, but it's still really good.

I definitely suggest you look in the Harry Potter / Addams family crossovers on fanfiction.net. There are 70 with I believe 65 being English. You will have to change the rating search to all to see everything. This crossover tends to have at least a few dark undertones and so is often marked M. The only other story I can think of is a Harry/Snape post Deathly Hallows. It's not on fanfiction.net, and I can't find my link. I hope it's not dead, but I honestly don't know. The idea is that Harry can't die and Snape is an Addams. It's.... Well unique is probably the best way to describe it.

  Sometimes, an average family has secrets. The residents of 1313 Mockingbird Lane have more secrets than most. Perhaps their biggest secret is how family comes first and foremost. Once he turns 11, young Harry Munster is offered a place at the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, but he isn't interested, for four reasons. Dodgers, Dresses, Teddy bears, and Spot.
