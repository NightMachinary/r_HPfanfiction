Not necesarily incest if Hermione and Ron are divorced


** No, but I've read one with Ginny/Scorpius if you're interested in old gen/next gen ships.

***** This fic almost produced a visceral reaction me, goddamn. I haven't read one that's made me nearly as pissed off in a long time. Ginny cheats on Harry, gets mad at Harry when he finds out and says "Don't patronize me" and then Harry basically takes it like a spineless idiot.

Not only did she cheat on him, which is one of the worst things you can do in a marriage, but she cheated on him with her son's best friend. That's like a double whammy. Not only did she betray her husband, she betrayed her son. Then she insists on a divorce even when Harry says he's willing to work it out.

And everything turns out happy in the end with her still in the family smiling in a family photo. Fucking bullshit.

****** Yeah, that was a bit weird and when Harry's a little hard on Scorpius during Auror training when in all honesty Scorpius deserved worse, she's all "Can you please try to be an adult?" as if they both didn't hurt virtually everyone in their lives with their relationship and here she's calling out someone else for being unreasonable. O.o

I can't really fault her for this. I mean she had fallen in love with Scorpius and staying in that marriage would have been a lie. She was willing to take responsibility for it by divorcing. It did feel weird that she was forgiven so quickly but overall I liked the story. It would have been too easy to make Ginny some kind of pedophilic pervert but she was more complex than that, still wrong, but not a total bitch.

******* True enough with your second point, it just rubbed me the wrong way with all the other bullshit that had happened.

And then later on she has the nerve to go to him for advice and talks to him about her sex life with Scorpius and I'm just like "WHAT."

I don't think she's a complex character. In this story, I think she's truly just a bitch. She doesn't care what she's done to the family, what she's done to Harry, all she cares about is how she's the laughingstock of the wizarding world and how everyone in her life hates her. She's not taking responsibility in the slightest, but just wants to be comforted by the man she betrayed.

what the fuck

******** I'm a big H/G shipper so plots like this are just something I'll never enjoy. But the basic premise is pretty damn unrealistic to begin with. While I believe the couple work very well together, I could easily see a scenario or story where Ginny leaves Harry because she is an independent woman who speaks her mind and wouldn't put up with whatever Harry would do the make her want to leave. But Ginny wouldn't cheat. If we assume there is dissatisfaction in her marriage (which is a common reason people cheat), she would let Harry know and if nothing changes, then leave. She wouldn't betray Harry, the guy who has had a really crappy life before finding Ginny. There are a handful of characters that I just cannot for the life of me imagining cheating, and Harry and Ginny are both at the top of that list. For nothing else, cheating is a cowardly thing to do and neither are cowards. Remember Ginny didn't even cheat on Dean when she clearly started to realize Harry liked her in her 6th year.
