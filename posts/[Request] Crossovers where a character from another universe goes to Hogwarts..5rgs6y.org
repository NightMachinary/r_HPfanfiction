  Calvin's eleven years old - well, technically, anyways, but his shorts still reach his ankles - and not much has changed. Until the letter from Hogwarts, that is. *dramatic music* *sense of foreboding* *bloodcurdling screams echoing in the distance*

** Well, there's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/riding-acromantulas-and-understanding-magical-biology-harry-potter-worm.315253/][Riding Acromantulas and Understanding Magical Biology]] which is a crossover between Harry Potter and [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com][Worm]], but it seems abandoned though.

If you haven't read Worm, it's a web novel about realistic superpowers, and kinda dark. People die. Quite a lot of them to. They also have a large fan fiction on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/][reddit]] community, and it's where I started reading fan fiction.

  Ichigo's been ordered to go undercover at a magic school to bodyguard a kid named Harry Potter, and this would be fine, except that he's about as good at bodyguarding as he is at magic. And he considers it a good day, magic-wise, if he hasn't set anything on fire.

** If you liked The Family Name, you should really, really check out linkffn(King of Serpents). It's the first in a series; the author is currently working on the fifth one iirc.

It's the same premise, but I personally feel that King of Serpents executes the ideas much better.

** Linkffn(8096183) - Harry Potter and the Natural 20: It's a crossover with D&D, involving the surprisingly serious (considering the premise), yet still hilarious adventures of a metagaming wizard named Milo. He gets transported to the HPverse after a near TPK, in which something horrible goes wrong during a routine encounter with a recurring villain, and he switches places with Bellatrix Lestrange. It's all very tongue-in-cheek, but still tells a compelling story in between the comedic bits.
