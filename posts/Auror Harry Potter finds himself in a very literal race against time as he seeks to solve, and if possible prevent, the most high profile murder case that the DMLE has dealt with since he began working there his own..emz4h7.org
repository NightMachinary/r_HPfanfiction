Basically the story would begin with the (seemingly) dead body of Harry Potter materializing into existence in the Atrium of the Ministry of Magic one day, the only obvious clue as to what happened aside from the indicators of spell damage being the now broken remnants of a Time Turner clutched in his hand, with the living counterpart seeking to avert what everyone assures him is his now inevitable demise.

**** Well when I initially had the story idea come to me, I was toying with future Harry being not entirely dead when he goes back in time, and the whole thing being one massive ontological paradox with no properly explainable origin.

***** Process to avoid Death via Paradox:

1. Take “dead body” from Ministry; place in secure location only you know about.
2. Never look for it again.
3. Get a time turner
4. Get Draught if the Living Dead (dosage lasting a few hours)
5. Take it and quickly spin the time turner while standing in the atrium.
6. Wake up in your safe house.

Technically a paradox, but a survivable one.

** (It has been a long, LONG time since I have written anything, but a small time travel scene that popped into my head a week ago slammed into this prompt and I couldn't not write something out)

​

Eric Munch was a small, portly man who had spent far too many years sitting behind a desk. One would suspect that being the face of Ministry security front desk would add some spice to the job, being able to see new people from all walks of life, keeping the government safe from any and all that would seek to infiltrate or subjugate the facility. Behind the glamour and promises, however, it was nothing more than a simple, boring job, spent checking in the same people, day after day. Today was no different.

Absentmindedly, he scratched at the stubble that he had neglected to take care of since last week. “Thank you for coming to the Ministry of Magic,” he said dully, handing a thirteen-inch wand back to its owner. It was early in the morning, and the last trickle of those that worked the early shift were making their way through the lobby.

His eyes squinted through a pair of thick glasses and scanned the crowd, catching sight of the last few stragglers stumbling out of the fireplaces with a flash of green and a /fwomp/ of fire. They quickly brushed the soot from their robes, attempting to make themselves presentable before entering the workspace. Some of them nodded his way, throwing a wave or a disgruntled sound of acknowledgement. Most did not. It didn't take long for the morning rush to peter out, leaving him sitting alone in the quiet halls.

With a sigh that seemed to be a combination of disappointment, boredom, and contentment, Eric kicked back in his seat, pulling off his bowler hat and placing it on the desk. The majority of the actual work was done, and there would be little to do until the next shift began to come in, discounting any non-employees that decided to show up. Thus, it was time to relax. He reached into an inner pocket of his robes, pulling out a small, thin book, which he cracked open and began reading. He wasn't sure of how much time had passed since he began, but he was about thirty pages into /Men Who Love Dragons Too Much/ when things began to get odd.

The lights began flickering, the fireplaces that lined the hall flared to life, and a strange wind blew through the empty architecture. Eric, making sure to earmark his page, began to get up, pulling his wand from a pocket. His arm shook, and his breath began to quicken as he slowly rounded the edge of his desk. His wand was held out in front of him, a spell ready to be loosed from his lips at the slightest provocation.

Then a body fell from the ceiling.

It hit the stone floor with a sickening /crack/ and the sound of a watermelon splitting from the impact. A dark liquid, hard to discern in the dark lighting, splattered around its head, leaking into the flooring from various places on the person. The cloak that hid its features was dark and heavy with liquid.

Eric let out a swear, running up to the body, wand spitting out simple diagnostic spells. Cracked cranium, various broken ribs, cuts and bruises littered the flesh, and the amount of spell damage looked worrying. It didn't look good, and he followed those up with as many healing spells that he knew.

A scream cut through the air, and his head jerked up towards the fireplaces, wand following and a stunner starting to form on his lips, the point training upon a young woman that looked to had been in the middle of finding her footing when she had spotted him. Her blonde hair was pulled up into a bun, her eyes were wide, and her hands were clasped over her mouth in shock.

“Well don't just stand there!” he barked, hoping that he didn't look as panicked as he would swear he sounded. He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow. “Do you know any healing spells?” His wand spat out spells to stitch together cuts, set bones. “A-a few!” she squeaked out and raced over, drawing her wand and rattling off spells. With that taken care of, Eric swept his wand towards the desk, a sheet of parchment and a quill drifting towards him. He snatched them out of the air, scratched a quick message on it, dosed it with magic, and sent the ensuing airplane hurriedly towards the atrium.

“Is it safe to turn him over?” The woman looked up at the question, pausing in her casting for a moment to gnaw on her bottom lip, before nodding. “I'm not sure what spells he's been hit with, but most of the cuts have been closed.” A swish, flick, and /wingardium leviosa/ later, the body was carefully levitated into the air, turned around, and set back onto the floor.

They peered down at the unconscious form, taking in the face that was battered and broken, the skin that had been burnt off in patches, and the blood that had covered its face from lying in the pool that had spewed from its head wound. The bent and cracked round glasses, the dark hair color. The scar, struck through the skin of its forehead, small slashes forming a lightning bolt.

Eric and the woman's eyes met, both wide with disbelief.
