Perhaps 'Riddlesque' is the wrong term.

I'm craving a fic where Harry is able to control his powers at a young age, and is cunning enough to utilize them to his advantage. Harry may be sorted into any house. Dark!Harry is fine, but I prefer no Psychopath!Harry. Unless it's /really/ well-written.

Hem hem. And no harems.

Fics I've enjoyed (just the ones off the top of my head):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]]*

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him; and the damage done by the cursed scar across his face will not be easily dealt with.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]]*

#+begin_quote
  A young Harry Potter, abandoned on the streets, is taken in by a man with a mysterious motive. When his new muggle tattoo suddenly animates, he is soon learning forbidden magic and planning to infiltrate the wizarding world on behalf of the "ordinary" people. But nothing is ever that black and white. (Runes, Blood Magic, Parseltongue, Slytherin!Harry)
#+end_quote

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/689909][The Spellmaker]]*

#+begin_quote
  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable in the highly complicated and controversial subject of Spell Creation, a subject he soon becomes enamored with despite having to hide his interest from everyone. Besides, it's not like he's going Dark, after all.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8195669/1/The-Rise-of-a-Dark-Lord][Rise of a Dark Lord]]*

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy. SLASH.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8704528/1/Enveloped-in-the-Darkness][Enveloped in the Darkness]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry was left at an orphanage after his parents met their demise. There, he finds nothing but suffering until he rejoins the Wizarding World. Dumbledore may hope for Harry to be a kind soul, but he's made mistakes. And what he gets is a future Death Eater. Harry is Dark, Harry is ruthless, and he is siding with Voldemort.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8670912/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Gift-of-Memories][Harry Potter and the Gift of Memories]]

#+begin_quote
  Eidetic Memory, the ability to remember everything you have ever done, seen, smelled, tasted, and touched. To some it is a gift, to others a curse. For Harry Potter, it's both.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal-Harry][Brutal Harry]]

#+begin_quote
  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6180304/1/Prodigium][Prodigium]]

#+begin_quote
  Gen - There's a reason why Harry survived that night, and it wasn't due to Lily's love. What saves Harry becomes inextricably entwined with him, and greatly influences how the story unfolds and the person Harry becomes.
#+end_quote

*Incomplete!


** Thanks for suggesting /Blindness/. I hadn't seen it before, and it was a very good (if too short) read.

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years

See [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10267302/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Dark-s-Rise][HP & the Dark's Rise]] (203,172 & Complete). /(spoilers)/ Although I'd warn that 1. the story starts degrading after Harry makes his choice, and 2. you'll have to treat the text like a rough draft because of the amount of spelling mistakes in it.

  ◆ Harry is able to control his powers at a young age, ◆ is cunning enough to utilize them to his advantage. ◆ Dark!Harry is fine ◆ no Psychopath!Harry. Unless it's really well-written.

I'd recommend

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]] | Words: 194,707; Published: 1/3/2013 and Complete,

   - [dark!Harry] [manipulative!Harry] [Hufflepuff Harry]

2. +[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]]+ | Words^{T} : 384,990; Updated: ~20 days ago

   - [dark protagonist] [ruthless protagonist] [OC protagonist] [story has sex contamination]

3. [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sacrifices_Arc][The Sacrifices Arc]] | Words^{T} : ~3KK and Complete

   - Harry's magic is dark here, but Dark≠Evil in this story. Harry also often tries to keep the higher moral grounds, which may render this arc useless for your request.

*** Thanks! Too Young to Die seems promising :D

I've seen Princess of the Blacks a number of times, but OC! I haven't been able to get over that. Eh, eventually I'll read it.

Sacrifices... I read about 1/2 of it a while back. I don't remember why I stopped reading it. Huh, guess I'll give that a look.

Plus, linkssssss! Yay! I'll filter through that some other time.

**** My bad about the Blacks' Princess, sorry---kinda managed to miss the “Harry” part in your request. For the time when you'll be checking it, I'll advise making your way through the first several chapters, because they are not that good. It gets better later on.

It has some parts that wouldn't hurt to trim down, it also has a lot of soul-searching and slash. It's likely that you got bored of sifting through some of these parts and fishing out the good ones.

** I'll throw out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2869936/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Hero-s-Path][Harry Potter and the Hero's Path]]. It's very rough in places, and cranks up the "abused by Dursleys" pretty high. Harry definitely gets control over his powers at an early age, and uses them to his advantage, so it fits the bill in that department. The development of Harry's character in this one is a personal favorite - ruthless, but not heartless. Relatable and flawed but incredibly tough.

  The legacy
#+end_quote

Do you remember the writer's name? A cursory search for 'the legacy harry potter fanfiction' turned up the following:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8346742/1/The-Potter-Legacy][The Potter Legacy]]

#+begin_quote
  Lily and James survived that night at Godrics Hollow and Harry and his boy-who-lived brother Ed along with them. Harry is going to show the world that the Potters are not the lightest family by living out the true legacy of the Potters. Darker Harry, not super evil or anything, James/Ed bashing most likely also weasly and draco bashing. Harry will be strong deal. M for safety
#+end_quote

It seems to sort of fit my request, but it is somewhat poorly written.
