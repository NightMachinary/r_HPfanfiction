Hey, are there any fics where this happens? It doesn't have to be the main plot or main story point in the fic.

Bonus points if Harry is not even Lord Potter but just Harry :)


** In sadly incomplete linkffn(Mosaic by Larry Huss), Sirius makes a deal with Lucius Malfoy to adopt Draco as his heir, resign as head of the House of Black, and agree to Malfoys adopting Draco back, in order to get his day in court.

  Beginnings are delicate things; suppose Lucius Malfoy had been a little short of money...
