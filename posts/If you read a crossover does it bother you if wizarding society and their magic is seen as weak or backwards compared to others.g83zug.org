** Yes I read Crossovers because I LIKE both series, deeming one side of the Crossover as "Weak" then opens up the question, "If the Wizards and the Main Character sucks, why the fuck is This even a Crossover?" other than the author dancing on the grave of a series there is no real need to read it as the "Stronger" Heroes whether that's DC, Marvel, Buffy and the Scoobies, Camp Halfblood whoever solving all their original problems like in Canon and occasionally having curbstomp battles against Dark Wizards.

So you have no new conflicts of any note, a character and new set of characters who are a joke and a fanbase pissed off.

This goes either way, Harry shouldn't show up and make Thanos his bitch, nor should he kill Darkseid in 29 Seconds because the invasion spilled his beer.

Crossovers need to be balanced and thoughtful in how it's approached. Perhaps the crossed over character has their own private adventures or drag their new friends into a adventure they are more used to and comfortable with. Like in the MCU, Let's say Harry joins the Avengers. I doubt someone who's a hard core Avengers fan wants to read Tony Stark bumbling idiot and side kick to Sorcerer Supreme and Maester Wizzard Hadrian James Potter-Black-Gryffindor, as a Potter fan I do not want to read Harry Potter side kick. The Marvel Universe is enormous and wide, Giant Monsters, Werewolves, Vampires, Death Cults, Atlantis and Lemuria, Powerful dark magic users, Eldritch Horrors, Demon lords and plain old criminals ALL EXIST IN THIS UNIVERSE! Harry doesn't have to back up Thor with the Dark Elves or Tony in taking down AIM, he can be off dealing with a new problem, one not seen in the movies. Same thing with DC, Percy Jackson has TONS of Monsters and Magic to deal with, even Harry Potter has the ENTIRE World full of Trolls and Giants and Magical Beast and Werewolves and Vampires and the like. The Teen Titans don't have to go to Hogwarts to protect Harry to come in Contact with these things, they already exist AWAY from Hogwarts

*** This ^{.} Completely agree, you've gotta balance things out. But with the proviso that if you are going to have HP Magic be overly strong or weak in comparison to your cross-over, do it for a damn good narrative/worldbuilding reason. Nerfing or upgrading the magic is a big decision and like most big decisions, it should at least mildly help you tell your story.

**** I would say I rather see a character nerfed rather than the entire magic system

***** Fair, and character nerfs can have their place as well (eg. Faery Heroes has them less powerful after the time travel and needing to grow and re-tool up to reach their old powers again). But Rowling's Magic System is pretty OP sometimes, so a Nerf can provide some needed balance that lets the character grow in cunning or adaptability as they use strategy to fill the gap that the Nerf makes. Most of the big wizard-wizard battles in HP canon are virtually identical ("Latin yell!" - "Latin yell!") aside from location, so having to come up with creative solutions to conflict with a more powerful system can be interesting.

On the other hand, sometimes it's just a cheap way for the author to yell "Rowling is shit and here's why!" with a thin veil of narrative. It's not absolute one way or another for me, but to conclude before this becomes a massive page of rambling, in my opinion there is some interesting narrative merit to nerfing the system. :)

** For me? No, not really. What I saw in Harry Potter was how backwards society was, and their "If it works, why change it?" attitude to everything.

Them being considered weak or backwards isn't that big of a stretch, really. In most other fictions with a magic system, people are always researching and trying to perfect their craft.

*** Other magic systems was actually the thing I was thinking a out the most. I st least think that even if wizard magic is less potent than others it's still incredibly versatile.

**** It was not really weak. HP series is kids series so we saw lesser combat magic. I think wizards like Dumbledore can turn entire town in to dust within seconds. And you're right it was very versatile. You've dragons, werewolves, dementors and other dark creatures. In 6th book we learned that wizards created storms, uprooting trees and vanished bridges ...etc. They can raise dead like inferi. And most importantly mind magics in HP world are scary as fuck. We have imperius, confundus, compulsion, memory charms and muggle repelling charms. It's versatile and powerful.

***** With you on this one. Wizarding culture might be seen as a bit backwards compared to others, but the magic system itself has a lot to work with.

** On the strength of the magic, my feeling about it will rely on the intent of the author. Each fantasy World have different magic with different strenght and weaknesses, and are often hard to compare. To make an exemple with another universe that I love : take WoW, this World has far more different powers compared to Harry Potter, but there is no « Instakill » spell. You can however see warlocks summon demons, Paladins becoming immune to anything, necromancers bringing people back to unlife with new powers. So which one beats the other ? Well the one you want to, if any. There can be good excuses for such a take on those universes : if I were to pull a character from one world to put them in another, making this character magic weaker can help me create meaningfull struggles and avoid a full steamroll wish fullfilment fic. Some just want to be able to see a specific magic system dominate the other, it's a lot harder to make it interesting but can work.
