No judgment intended at all . I've read my fair share of both slash and het fics,but I was wondering what is it that draws a person to either type of realshonships?

Because it's not as simple as if your [Bi,Gay,Pan etc] then you should read slash fics

And that if your [Straight and anything else under this banner?] Then you can only read Het fics. I'm confused


** I guess it depends on the chemistry the characters have? I have only found a handful of slash fics I actually enjoy because the characters (in my opinion) fit well together. The same could also be said for het as well. If there isn't chemistry and the characters don't fit well, the ship will sink.

** I'm asexual and will read slash, het, or poly. For me it's all about the writing, the plot, and the characterizations. I rarely ship something until after I've read a good fic for the pairing.

** I'm gay, so my preference indeed leans towards femslash, but I've also read het fics, especially if the story is really well-written. Really, it is the way the writer portrays my favorite character that makes or breaks a fic for me. I've finished long-fics with pairings I hate because my fave was written well.

Also, since my favorite characters are often female, I don't read slashfic all that much. There is also a lot of uncomfortable fetishization and sexualization in slash. Het has a lot of gendered violence and weird sexism in it too. Really, the only perk of femslash being so unpopular is that it is often only gay women themselves that write it.

** My take.

If you are an [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jjjnml/can_we_fucking_cool_it_with_this_weird_painting/gadoh2f/][SI-type reader]] who merges their perspective into the protagonist as their avatar, and for whom the protagonist's experiences feel viscerally like you are performing those actions yourself:

- If you are attracted to men IRL, you will enjoy fics with a narrative focus on attraction to a man (either by a man or a woman).

- If you are attracted to women IRL, you will enjoy fics with a narrative focus on attraction to a woman (either by a man or a woman).

If you are a third-party type reader, who maintains their separate identity and does not merge their sense of self with the identity of the protagonist:

- You will enjoy reading any (well-written) relationship regardless of your own preferences.

** It's about whether I like the characters and whether I believe they would connect.

Harry/Ginny? Fine, I'm not going to stop reading a fic over the canon pairing. Harry/Hermione? Also fine, I could see them happening in a different situation and they already care deeply for one another. Harry/Cho? Poor grieving girl didn't get a fair shake in canon so give me the fanfic.

Harry/Ron? Wish there was more of it. Harry/Cedric? Practically canon. Harry/Draco? Not my instinctive favorite, but I've seen it done well and can't deny their canonical fixation on one another.

** Femslash and slash, I can't identify with (cis)hetero notions of love and sex. There is a lot of casual misogyny, homophobia and archaic gender roles in het fic and as a reader (and a human being lol) that puts me off immediately. I will however read het fics from writers who have written slash and/or femslash fic that I enjoy, they're always great and wonderful

** The main writers and readers of slash stories are straight women, for pretty much the same reason that the main consumers of lesbian porn are straight men. Straight women have build up such a culture of gay male fanfic, with so many inaccurate tropes, that actual gay men tend not to enjoy reading these stories. (Speaking in general terms of course. I'm sure there are some straight women who write gay men well.)

** I insert myself too much into the MC when I read a story and can only enjoy a pairing if I can see myself liking the other character. That basically means I'm unable to read most slash stories (there are none in this Fandom I enjoy), as well as some Het stories that include pairings like Hermione/Harry.

(Funny enough, I don't even dislike Hermione, I'm just unable to care about her character at all lol)

** Straight, mainly bc Christian. Otherwise, I prefer more crack fics where I don't really care either way.
