I'm in the mood for some good stories about quidditch. It doesn't have to be the main subject but I want it to have more quidditch than the average story.


** Alao, [[/u/TE7][u/TE7]], who writes as TheEndless7, has written several completed fics with descriptions implying quidditch is a big part of them. I haven't read any of those, but considering this is the author of Limpieza de Sangre I doubt they're bad

** It's not very long yet, but I'm really enjoying 150 Points by Empiricalis.

  Alistair Wood was flying high, fresh off yet another Quidditch League Cup win with the Montrose Magpies. After 22 years playing Seeker for the Magpies, he felt like he could do it for 22 more. But in 1969, the Magpies front office made a decision that radically altered the course of his career. Inspired by the classic baseball stories Ball Four, Bull Durham, and Major League, 150 Points follows Alistair Wood through the 1969 season of the British Quidditch League. Alistair explores the Quidditch culture of the United Kingdom and the lifestyle of magical athletes through the lens of a player that has seen just about everything there is to see - or so he thinks.

  Set right after 5th year. Harry becomes independent. No pairings, lots of Quidditch and some Ron&Ginny&Dumbledore&Etc bashing.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.
