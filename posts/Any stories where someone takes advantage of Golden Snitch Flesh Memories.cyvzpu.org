Like is being suggested in the [[http://www2.adult-fanfiction.org/forum/topic/68177-perveted-golden-snitches/?tab=comments#comment-425505][Perveted golden snitches]] Challenge on the adult fanfiction forums?

The idea of Someone deliberately taking advantage of the the a Golden Snitch's Flesh Memories is pretty interesting.and it something i don't think i have every seen done in the whole time I have been reasoning fanfiction.

I could see James Potter doing it to Lily, Playing with the Snitch with gloves so that when Lily confiscates it from him the Flesh memory's Key to her and then Putting Some "interesting" magic on it and then releasing it to follow her around.

I could see it happening accidentally like Sirius trying to Prank James because he thinks its keyed to him, thinking he will be able to just stop it when he sees James over the summer only to find out That the Snitch was keyed to Lily and by the Time they get back to school The snitch has developed a will of its own like like the Weasley family car.


** If Snitches have these amazing flesh memories why not just use them for ID? Like, have a flesh memory on a lock, once the owner unpacks and touches it it'll only open to them, perfect biometric ID system.

*** I agree I don't think J.K thought threw the Ramifications, after all why not use a snitch Keyed to someone to spy on them. sure you would have to add a bit of extra magic to help it hide but Snitch's are already pretty stealthy to begin with.

Or what about a Contact Poison on a Snitch.Add Poison and then just release the snitch in an area you know they are going to be.

**** Idk if Snitches actively follow the people they're keyed to, I thought they just only open if touched the same way they were caught?

If you can get a snitch to track and follow a specific person, then you have so many ways to track, kidnap or kill that person, it'd take years to list them all.

Although if owls can track anyone the same way, nobody would bother using a snitch when they could just owl the target a hand grenade.

***** Pretty sure the Opening when touched was Dumbledore addition. I don't Think normal Snitch's open like that. In my mind it more like the Dog test where they Put the Two seekers on opposite sides of the room and then let it fly to the person that it has a flesh memory of.

And Even If it doesn't work exactly that way in Canon whos to say that the Person using the Snitch couldn't modify it like Dumbledore did in canon just to different ends.

*** Flesh memory could be useful for things like helping prove that an ID card belongs to the person holding it, which would help a lot since you've got polyjuice and illusions and metamorphmagi around.

It would probably not be that useful for locks, because the confundus charm, at least not without combining it with a bunch of other measures to patch up the things each method can't account for.

**** Doesn't Confundus only work on intelligent beings and artefacts capable of complex decisions like the Goblet?

** Sirius black Sighed in relief as he caught the Special Snitch that he had Released at the End of six year it was supposed to be just a prank on James but it turned out that it was keyed to Evans. and it had managed to evade capture for the Whole summer but he has finally caught it.

Suddenly Lily appeared in from of him "what was that she asked" he caved quickly telling her what is was.

"give it to me"lily said and "teach me the spell you used to capture it.

"you want to keep it?" questioned Sirius in confusion

" Of course, because of the build up of Tantric energy it has been causeing my magic has never worked better"

Sirius sat there and watch stunned as Evans released the Snitch again and test the spell to make sure that she could catch its again before releasing it and going off to bed.

while Sirius fell back into the Couch he was on in Shock that Evans hadn't cursed or hexed him into oblivion.

Not knowing that he had started Lily Evans soon to be potter down the Path of Tantric and love based magic that would lead to the fall of the Dark Lord that was currently terrorizing the country.

I am not a very good writer and suck at dialog but thought I would have a go at my own prompt although I tried to also keep it SFW.

Edit: If Iwas a better writer I probably would have mention how Flushed Lily was from the Snitchs attention and that it couldn't follow her when she apparated places.
