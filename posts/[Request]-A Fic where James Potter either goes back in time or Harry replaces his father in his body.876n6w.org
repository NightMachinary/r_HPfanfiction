The title doesnt explain much but I want two different types of fics: 1. One where when James dies he goes back to the past 2. Somehow Harry gets involved in the Marauders Timeline and I dont want him to just be there and go back after. I once read a fic where Harry takes over James body. Would be cool if Harry gets together with Lily(dont see it as incest cause they are the same age)

I don't think that's how incest works

*** That is very much not how it works. If I'd fuck my cousin that is the same age as me, its still incest.

No, the only saving grace for this /specific/ constellation would be that Harry takes of James body, therefore also using Jame's genetic make-up. If its incest now... I don't know... no? Maybe?

Its definitely channeling Oedipus there, though.

**** Not incest in a medical sense. James and Lily do not share a close blood/DNA tie. From a social point of view, that is an entirely different question, but the sheer amount of incest porn makes me believe that this kind of story would have a decent-sized traget audience.

Also, banging cousins is not considered incest in most of the West (and is legal in most places).

**** It's not incest in a medical sense like Hellstrike said, but it's still VERY morally wrong.

***** Societally frowned upon, but morally, I don't see a problem with it. There needs to be a /morally/ relevant distinction between incest and no incest. The only moral arguments are those about procreation causing genetic abnormalities, but that isn't all incest.

I'm not saying I condone incest, I'm just saying moral â‰  social standards.

****** I guess so, and Harry has never met his mother so technically it wouldn't be that bad. Except for creating an unending time-loop where Harry is his own father...

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.

** That's still incest... at least mentally Harry is still her child. It might be James' body but if Harry's the one doing the do... ick. definitely incest.

** I read a One-shot, where Harry arrives on Halloween to save the day ( off-screen), but replaces James with his body, and only Harry/James and Lily know it, even Dumbledore does not find out. But the strange thing is, Lily sees him as James with green eyes, Harry sees her as Ginny with green eyes, and tries to forget reality.
