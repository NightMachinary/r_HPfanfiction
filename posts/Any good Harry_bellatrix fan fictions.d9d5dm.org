** Yes. In fact there are 3 complete fics with that pairing that are some of the more popular stories out there.

*** Delenda est had the potential to be an amazing timetravel story and ended up just being an ok time travel story but it's still worth the read if you've never read it. Just don't try to read the sequel

Earl of the north is pretty bad

Wind shear is very mediocre

**** Wind Shear is aggressively mediocre, and that's okay. I think aggressively mediocre was what the author was aiming for. Still a fun read.

***** I wouldn't call Wind Shear a Harry/Bellatrix fic. There isn't /any/ romance, and Bellatrix's 'screen time' is super low. I don't think it's even clear whether they actually end up together or not.

Bellatrix is basically obsessed with him (after he kills all her 'friends' in front of her, leaving only her alive to deliver a message to Voldemort; classic Bella there) and spends the whole fic trying to impress him, but nothing ever comes of it. /He/ is certainly not interested, rather amused by her (ridiculous) efforts.

****** I agree on that front. I think it's only ever heavily implied at the end of the last chapter when someone makes a crack about wanting at least some of his grandkids not to have green eyes

** The best harry/bellatrix fic would probably be linkffn(Stepping Back)

It's with a young and not overly skilled Bellatrix (compared to Harry), but still.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
