Astronomy, Herbology, Care of Magical Creatures, Potions, Arithmancy, Alchemy and Defence Against the Dark Arts all seems to be interconnected with each other threw Potions along with the magical Transportation classes Flying and Apparition that would also be useful for travelling to collect your own potions ingredients.

Of the remaining core classes Charms, History of Magic and Transfiguration what is the odd one out ? I would say that its Transfiguration which only is really interconnected with Arithmancy and Charms(but really the only thing they have in common is that they are both wand based subjects)

Of the electives Divination, Muggle Studies and Ancient Runes I would say that Ancient Runes is the Odd one out because from looking as the wiki it only really has some connection to Aithmancy because Divination and Muggle Studies could also both be important when trying to find a Potion ingredient with Muggle Studies being needed if you need to travel into the muggle world to find one and Divination in narrowing down were to find the potion ingredient by narrowing down were to look for it.

what do you think it the Odd class out at Hogwarts that stands out as being interconnected with the fewest classes?


** Well, not exactly what you were looking for, But

I read a fanfic where harry keeps mentioning that hogwarts is a school for teaching assasins.

Herbology- how to kill with plants

Potions - poisons

Transfiguration - hiding the body.

Charms - how to fram it as a suicide

History - learn from previous examples

Athrimancy - probability of an assaination succeeding

Those are the ones I remember The only one he didn't have one for was Astronomy.
