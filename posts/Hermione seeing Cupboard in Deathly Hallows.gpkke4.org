*** I know it's not in the books but I thought since they changed the timeline of the Dursleys leaving up a bit in the movie they may have included something that wasn't book canon. Guess I really did make it up then (or read it in a fanfic)...

**** The original post asked specifically if it happened in canon. It was later edited. At least you had the decency to tone down the dickishness of your original reply, but still somehow managed to keep some of it.

** It definitely doesn't happen in canon but there's a scene like that in chapter 38 of linkffn(Loose Cannon by manatee-vs-walrus).

  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.
