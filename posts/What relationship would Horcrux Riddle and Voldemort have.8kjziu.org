I would like to read a fic which explores this questions, so if you read some similar fics please give it to me!

In the last days I begin to think about what would happen if Riddle get body from one of the horcrux using somebody life force.

For example Lucius Malfoy realize what the journal/diary is and get some no name caracther and now we have a teenager Riddle. [Btw have he got every memory and knowledge which oldVoldemort has? Or is Ginny the only reason he knows that Harry destroyed him?]

What would he do? Seek out the other/real Voldemort and help him to get body? Get in to his own mission to change the Wizarding World? And if he choose the second option then what would be the relationship between horcrux Riddle and Voldemort? Would they fight with each other? (I would say that it is plausible given that how much self-love they have) Work together? What would the Death Eaters do?


** He seeks out the master soul and does a much better job than Pettigrew at resurrecting the real Voldemort.

Assorted rationales:

- JKR has referred to Voldemort as the master soul in interview.

- The fact that horcruxes are not equivalent to the master soul is shown by the fact that the horcruxes only anchor the master soul. Horcruxes don't anchor each other to life, nor does the master soul act as an anchor for the horcruxes. Horcruxes are fragments of the soul that have been splintered off from it, not independently existing beings.

- Further, Voldemort's ability to control the Nagini horcrux demonstrates that the master soul has the ability to command the others. Dumbledore states in HBP that Voldemort's control of Nagini is greater than you would expect, even from a parselmouth, and that this was evidence of Nagini being a horcrux, telling us that Dumbledore was of the belief that the master soul can control the horcruxes.

- It's important to fully appreciate the significance of what a soul is: a person's identity, their very being. Diary Riddle, being a part of the same soul, would not consider himself a separate entity from Voldemort. They would consider themselves the same person - which indeed we see in the interaction with Harry in the Chamber, where Riddle identifies with the achievements of the master soul and shares an identity with him. A horcrux isn't just a back-up of a person's memories. It is them: "Voldemort is my past, present and future."

Further, I am fundamentally opposed to the idea that Tom Riddle at age 16 was in some sense more reasonable or moderate than the Voldemort we know. This is a trope largely created by HP/TMR writers. In canon, Tom Riddle does not undergo some character change as he becomes Voldemort. He was /always/ that way.

*** I was under the impression that his having better control of Nagini was thanks to the mind-bond --- e.g. he didn't have to constantly tell her what to do aloud, but instead sent his orders telepathically, giving the appearance Nagini kept responding to his every whim before he even voiced them.

And I had a bit of a different interpretation of "Voldemort is my past, present, and future". Assuming he didn't just go seeking out the master-soul and resurrected him (and I admit that's a possibility), I was under the impression Diarymort would just keep the status quo of the original Voldemort being "gone" and /become/ the active Voldemort himself. "Voldemort is /my/ future." Now if Voldemort Prime did come back from Albania somehow, Diarymort might defer to him, but for now I thought he'd just become the Dark Lord himself.

*** Thank you the analysis it was really spot on! I also oppose the moderate idea, I cannot see the way to redeem himself and he doesn't want to either. My interest was more about the possibility of the three-side war but after your analysis I can see that this not plausible.

Now I want to see a fic where the horcruxes do anchor each other...

** I agree with the answer already given. I think a young Riddle would heed the warning his older self gave to him by his life choices and rethink his plans.

I once read a plotbunny where he took over Ginny's body and became part of the Order, eventually taking over the place of Dumbledore in which he then could establish a rule over Britain and with time magical Europe.

** I hate when they end up fighting each other with Tom being on Harry's (Dumbledore's) side. No, it won't work like that, they are the same person, and diary-Tom is not really a real person, his mind is restricted to that of 16 year old, he might be powerful in his own right but he is inferior to Voldemort and as they are the same soul they should have the same goal, or at least young Tom can somehow try to convince Voldemort that he made mistakes and then figure out what to do to fix things, but not straight up become his enemy. He will always have /his/ best interests in mind even if /he/ has another body.

My favourite trope is when they merge and Voldemort regains his sanity because of it, but otherwise he doesn't suddenly have another conscious in his head. And no, he doesn't suddenly become good either, just less mad, with more brilliant and clear mind that can come up with better strategies for world domination than chasing after the boy/prophecy/etc.

** My favourite version of this is Young!Riddle looking at what happened to Old!Riddle, treating it as an Awful Warning, and knobbing off to foreign parts to start a new life under an assumed name, resolved to remember the Lessons Learned.

** If we're lucky and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) continues being updated, we'll get to see this eventually there.

Edit: ooh, wait maybe I should have spoilered that. Whoops. Too late now, the bot's already replied.
