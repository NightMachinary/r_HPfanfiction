I've been helping beta for a friend who isn't on Reddit and thought I'd share. She's just published her first chapter, and #2 will be up on Wednesday's. If you love Harry Potter but want to transport it back in time to Jane Austen and throw in a little Bronte, you'll love The Slytherin Heart.

  Wilhelmina Gamp had no plans to one day become the grandmother of Gellert Grindelwald, but a Slytherin heart has a way of getting what it wants. Set against the political backdrop of revolutionary France and its wizarding backlash, the three heirs of Salazar Slytherin look to find their way in a changing world while remaining true to their hearts and keeping favor with Britain's most powerful man, Septimus Malfoy.\\
  A tale of ambition, cunning, pride, and above all love, this is the untold story of the strange events surrounding the 1792 Triwizard Tournament.
