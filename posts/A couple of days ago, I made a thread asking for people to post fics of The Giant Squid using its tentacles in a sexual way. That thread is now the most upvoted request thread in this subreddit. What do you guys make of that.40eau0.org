** That there are very few sexual taboos left that won't be upvoted by default. The only ones I could think of would be pedophilia and maybe necrophilia. Anyone brave enough to make a request thread about HP buggering children to test that theory?

**** I think it's people projecting adult characters onto their non-adult forms, because “they would be a couple in ten years so they clearly are perfect together and can always be a couple”. Admittedly that doesn't make it any less creepy, but I think in most cases it has nothing to do with pedophilia or whatever other age-related sexual issues there are.

Then regardless of what I want, the actor/actress and the voice take over how I perceive the story. Harry potter was that way, some great (snape, lucius, Hagrid, madeye ) , some slightly disappointing but ok overall (hermione, Dumbledore, the dursleys), and others horrible (Ginny, Ginny, ginny)

******* I think that's kind of not the point, really. Biologically speaking there is a difference, but let us be honest there and admit that people who are adult are expected to actually control themselves well enough that attraction or not they would still be able to not act on it.

I mean, yes, I do agree that the people who automatically assume that if you sleep with someone who is a day before their 18th birthday or even just feel lust for them it automatically makes you some sort of ultimate evil, are overdoing it (and greatly so) the other way, but their issues aside I don't think that teenagers' ability to bear children should be touched with a ten-foot pole as a justification (or anything near it) for this. Because the people who don't get it won't understand, and most people who do get it will say that one still has control over what they do, and the ones without the control yet are basically the low-teen-years people (so 11--14, mostly) for whom the definition matters because ... well, because they're that age so for them the blanket term is different from the age-specific one.

That being said, the latter one doesn't make sense for me either, unless those people are in it for screams of anguish (and isn't that a scary thought, huh), since one could probably buy a life-like sex doll of that side from Japan or some other weird place if they truly wanted that.

******** The subject does lend itself to severe overreaction from the general populous. But you are right, it's almost impossible to have a civil conversation about the subject without everyone losing their shit. I would love to read some studies on the behavior and motivation of pedophiles. Do they generally love children and get naughty thoughts when seeing them or is it just some wild fetish. I know of a case where "The sudden and uncontrollable paedophilia exhibited by a 40-year-old man was caused by an egg-sized brain tumour, his doctors have told a scientific conference. And once the tumour had been removed, his sex-obsession disappeared." Too bad people overreact to the subject so massively, it really hinders unbiased scientific research.

****** By itself, not really, but considering how many kids at around that age try to find titillation in stories, it gives us a clearer view of the situation in which at least some of the ones reading are simply looking for romance with people their own age---and many of the rest that remains simply forget about the characters' ages. As much of a pretentious act as it might be, that's something using age-specific terms has over just using a blanket term, because it's weird that people forget, at moments like this, that teenagers read fiction too; well, that and some people get really over the top when they hear the word “pedophile” and go on a hunt that defies common sense.

Regarding the question itself: while fanfiction makes it easy to find stories with a niche trope of interest, it also makes the reader vividly aware of how many other niche tropes there are in the community they essentially share (and how many of those are weird sexual fetishes).

To counter the uneasiness coming from that awareness and defend from outside criticism, I think readers try to demonstrate self-awareness by being the first to laugh at the situation themselves. They do this by often discussing and demonstrating interest in stories most badly written or with most absurd premises.
