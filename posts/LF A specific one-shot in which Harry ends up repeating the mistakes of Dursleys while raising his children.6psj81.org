I remember reading this fic a couple of months ago, but I couldn't find it since then, so I hope you can help me find it.

The main theme of the story was that Harry was basically repeating history with tragic consequences. Peer pressure made him marry Ginny and become an Auror. Also, since he grew up in a messed-up environment and had little idea of what real family looked like, he had trouble with raising his children. For instance, he remembered how he was treated badly by the Dursleys, so he overcompensated with pampering James Jr. When he realized that his son became kinda arrogant and jerkish, he had gone to the /other/ extreme and was really harsh/borderline abusive with Albus Severus. The parallels between himself, his parents, and the Dursleys were drawn a lot.

That's all I remember from it. I always thought that it was written by one of the prolific authors, but I searched everywhere and couldn't find it, so maybe it was deleted or something.


** That sounds super depressing. I applaud the author for writing it, but it's not something I'd ever want to read.

** I finally found it! (If this is the one)

I spent ages searching for it earlier today because I remembered reading it only a few weeks ago, so it was really annoying that I couldn't find it. Luckily I decided to have a final look :D

  You follow in your father's footsteps, but you aren't your father, never have been, and it doesn't take long to realize that this isn't the life you want. It's too late by then, of course.

*** /Yesss/. That's the one. It's a lot different than I remember - for one, I thought it was longer, but it does get its point across. And I was right that it was from one of the popular authors, but I never even thought to check Emerald Ashes!

**** Agreed! It's an interesting concept, I'd really like to read a longer fic on it as well, though perhaps not too long as it seems slightly depressing.

*** It was on fanfiction.net, definitely. I think I found it by scrolling through Favorite Stories tab on various authors' profiles, but my memory is fuzzy. It may have been recommended here or on DLP forums, too.

** I don't know the story, but it's very common for parents who were abused as children to abuse theirs. I'd imagine there's lots of them out there.
