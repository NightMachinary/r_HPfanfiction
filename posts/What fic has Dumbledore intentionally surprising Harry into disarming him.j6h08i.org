:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
All I really remember from this fic was that Harry was either training or talking to someone in an unused classroom and Dumbledore bursts in the door and Harry instinctively disarms him. After, Dumbledore just gets his wand back and leaves. It's either heavily implied or outright stated that he wanted to pass ownership of the Elder Wand on to Harry.

More speculation than anything but I think it's set in 6th year and is pseudo indy!Harry but with a decent Dumbledore. I don't remember the fic being that great but powerful Harry fics without a shitty Dumbledore is rare so any help with this would be appreciated.


** A Marauder's Plan maybe. Everything fits, except I don't think it was intentional on Dumbledore's part. But he wasn't all that upset either.

** A powerful Harry fic that doesn't bash Dumbledore? That is a treasurer rarer than gold.

*** Yeah that's why I'm not super convinced it's A Marauder's Plan like the other person said, I'm pretty sure that leaned heavily on Dumbledore bashing
