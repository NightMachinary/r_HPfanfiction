Basically somehow, at some point in time, one of the two gets their hands on a couple of decks of Yu-Gi-Oh cards, and challenges the other to a game. Bonus points if it becomes an +Ultra-+Shadow-Game.


** "I tribute my Vorse Raider and my Penguin soldier!" Harry said, as he tributed the only two two face-up monsters in his field.

"No! What are you summoning?!" Ron demanded.

"Oh, you'll find out, I'm about to summon it!" declared the Boy-Who-Lived. "Come forth, my Blue Eyes White Dragon! Attack Ron's life points directly with the rage of the Muggle variety!"

"Impossible!" Ron shouted. "Nobody has ever summoned a Blue Eyes White Dragon before!"

"And I'll also set this monster in face-down defense mode!"

"That's against the rules!"

"Screw the rules! I'm the Boy-Who-Lived!"
