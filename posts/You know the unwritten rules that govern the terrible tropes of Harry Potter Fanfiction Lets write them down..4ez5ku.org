So for example, every Indy!Harry Fic has Harry go on a shopping trip for things he will never use and won't appear again to facilitate the author rambling about inventions they came up with.

Also please reply to other comments that mention the trope you're talking about so this doesn't just turn into 100 comments about Harry Crow.

Can we at least try and relate the lists of complaints to the trope you're talking about?


** Also Indy!Harry - having Harry go to Gringotts where a goblin (Griphook) explains to him that Dumbledore controlled all his funds and some of it went monthly to the Dursleys, and Harry discovering a secret Dumbledore-bashing will from his parents.

***** Part of me always wondered why every fanfic and its mother that has a non-Harry!Harry, always incorporates Hadrian as Harry's... alter-ego... thing (/reincarnation/ cover while he travels back in time/to an alternate dimension/literally whatever). Maybe it's because I've unintentionally been on a time-travel craze as of late, but I literally see it everywhere. It's exasperating - and the name isn't even that cool anyway! Part of me wishes I knew who started the terrible thing so I could go back in time and make them choose a name like. Like not Hadrian, for sure.

Edit: fixed up terribly convoluted and rambling phrasing.

******* I completely understand where you're coming from, and I agree - to an extent. I guess the main reason that it bothered me so much was because it was so clearly unoriginal; it's such a widespread thing now that I feel like people just... pick it from fanfictions they've read which they feel follow the same premise, as opposed to actually doing research on it, which is your justification.

I've also seen it used in fanfics where it's clearly not necessary. I.E: fanfics where it's just a conglomeration of characters from all time-periods just to be interesting, and Harry is called Hadrian literally for no other reason than just for him to have a different name. It's not like we don't know who Mr. jet-black-and-messy-hair and emerald-green / avada-green (god that description makes me lol) eyes, is. I'd rather author's just come out and say: extremely OOC!Harry! It's not like that's not rare enough to do anyway.

But I think it very likely that travelling salesmen would indeed carry at least a stall inside a trunk.

I wonder if there are travelling salesmen in the magic world? I imagine busy housewives in wizard villages would appreciate an Avon witch, as would underage teen girls unable to just apparate out to buy acne and hair potions, and not allowed to use magic

***** Almost certainly. It could very well be that some of the Diagon Alley stalls are pulled out of a trunk and only remain there certain times of the year. There's not many places for a peddler to openly sell wares, but otherwise, the conditions are there.

I also suspect mail order is big in the magical world. The logistics of moving wares from place to place are far simpler than they are in the muggle world. Even getting things across the country would be easy by handing off packages between owls (assuming owls don't also have magical endurance). It'd also justify Gringotts existence outside of being a massive vault and economic gatekeeper, since obviously you wouldn't want to pay via owl-delivered cash.

I envision something like one/two bedroom apartments with separate kitchen/living/bathrooms fitting into what would normally be one of those postage stamp studio apartments - with sound charms and baby safe balconies, you can have lots of first homes fitted into a space that usually poor students cram into. A normal sized house could be a hotel. I don't know what the limits are, but refugees would surely be easily housed in safe and hygienic places. Overflowing prisons would be easy, and imagine the implications for homeless shelters, if someone qualified to do those sort of things was willing to volunteer, or even if the government funded it! Imagine if a wizard or two joined humanitarian aid organizations. Or even a free elf, they seem the type who'd be all into saving the world.

These are for Next-Gen Fics:

- Albus, Scorpius and Rose are just like Harry, Draco and Hermione, from appearance (except Rose, who's hair is red) to personality. (admittedly, canon does support that Scorpius and Albus look a lot like Draco and Harry)

- All of the Weasley-Potter cousins hang out together and seem to have no other friends, despite often being in separate years and houses. They seem to be their own happy little cult...

- If they do have friends, they are the sons and daughters of canon characters. There are rarely muggleborn friends or friends from unknown families.

- Neville has a daughter named Alice Longbottom. (I admit, I am guilty of doing this as well). He may or may not have a son named Frank.

- James Sirius is just like James Potter I. Fred Weasley II is just like Fred Weasley I. They are usually close friends and fellow pranksters. (admittedly, it seems supported by canon that James Sirius is a bit of a handful)

******* One common fanfiction trope is the use of Arithmancy for creating and analyzing spells. If this is presented well, it is both much more interesting than the canon subject, and also fills in a significant gap in the magic system.

Will the vast majority of wizards ever have to use it though? Probably not, after all magic has been around for thousands of years, and a magical solution has likely already been invented for any common problem. As long as the author does not turn this into a route to becoming ridiculously overpowered, it's just a significantly more interesting school subject that allows for some creativity with coming up with the occasional new spell.

I'd much rather read about this than Trelawney being crazy or Hagrid's problems with Skrewts for the umpteenth time.

******* The way you talk about those subjects is completely irrelevant because fanfic is from the perspective of the author. There is absolutely nothing stopping runes from being a key piece of the creation of magical objects and for arithmancy to be a mathematical science of sort behind magic.

Options classes are just that, optional. They can be important but are intentionally designed to cater specific individuals. Broader topics like Charms, Transfiguration, Potions, etc, are core subjects because every wizard can and will use them.

Except that Runes are never mentioned as necessary to create magical objects in the books themselves. Runes also seems to be a subject that one would normally have to be highly specialized [and knowledgeable of] in order to use Runes in a certain way to create said objects. Likewise, how are we to define "magical objects"? Any item that happens to be enchanted?

In that case, the books show that Runes are usually completely unnecessary (and redundant) for this purpose, as Charms are used mostly in the creation of magical objects.

********* Yo. I get it. They can come off as wank in most fics.

But in further defense of them the story is about Harry. And JKR has written him to be an average student that's taking classes to get by and isn't really seen challenging himself (as he gets older he sorta does but overall not).

Those two subjects sound like they could be electives in the vein Anatomy or Calculus are in high school. Not super important but maybe cool to take them if you want to.

He already has his electives and as a student doesn't seem interested in changing them per se. So here we are.

I can see why for the literal!wank ones, where it's a way for the author to write about how hot Emma Watson is without feeling as creepy, but for metaphorical!wank stories, I'm just left confused. She's already been powered up once, effectively, since she gets all her book stuff as well as some of Ron's, but it seems like the stronger a character, the more people have the urge to power them up even more.
