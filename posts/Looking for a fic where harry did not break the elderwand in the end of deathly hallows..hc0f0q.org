** Point of order: /Harry doesn't break the Elder Wand/ - he puts it back in Dumbledore's tomb (that must have been disturbing to do actually).

/Harry only breaks it in the movies/ for a quick jarring end to the whole issue, rather than a prolonged discussion à la Ch. 36.

As for Harry keeping the Elder Wand...there are an innumerable number of these fics, particularly crossover fics or non-happy ending Harry stories. Its not that common for time-travel fics, so don't bother looking for those though.

**** There's a big difference, for me, between a fanfic that takes the films as the /only/ source and one that adopts a few things from it - the changes from the films may be mostly-bad, but there's some gems in there that might be worth exploring in a fanfic.

One of the things that I can accept a fanfic adopting is the eventual snapping of the Elder Wand. It makes sense to do, if Harry just wants an immediate and permanent end to its bloody legacy - re-burying it means someone can find it again in the future, and keeping it is just an invitation to get attacked for it.

** Any fanfiction which author didn't loose last remnants of the common sense (as the authors of the films did).

We are just in the end of the civil war (Longbottoms send her regards) and Harry neither fixed his original wand, but now he makes himself essentially wandless (with only wandmaker still not fully functional)?

And no, time considerations don't explain it either. The scene could be essentially the same (Harry having speech about having too much trouble already, Ron being surprised, Hermione supporting Harry, and Harry acting on his speech), except it would be in the Headmaster's office and in the end Harry would restore his original wand (and promising returning the Death Stick to Dubmledore's grave) instead of breaking it.

When watching Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, I thought that nobody could screw up the end of series so much as Peter Jackson did. David Yates succeeded in this feat with a flair (missing scene: Harry running to the Great Hall, “I just killed Voldemort!”, “No, I cannot show you, he just somehow exploded and he was blown away by the wind, but I really killed him.” “No, I know, it never happened to any other cursed person” (crying) “Honestly!”; make somebody that fan video, please!).

** A Fearful Redux by Rorschach's Blot has Harry retain the Elder wand.

linkffn(13179863)

Harry Potter & Death's Ultimatum by White Angel of Auralon has harry becoming the Master of Death and possessing all three Hallows.

linkffn(8286141)

Search for stories that have Harry as the Master of Death as they usually have Harry keeping possession of all three Hallows. Also, several of the time travel out there only "succeeded" because they use the elder wand to do so.

** Ok so, this probably isn't what you had in mind, it's actually a first person Ron centric fic but there is a moment about Harry & his wand; basically this is the first thing that popped into my head when thinking about Harry keeping the elder wand. Also it's a complete one shot.
