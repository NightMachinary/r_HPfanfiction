In a long term war between mougles and wizards, who would win?


** Unless Muggles have breached the anti Muggle charm or have significant wizards on their side, various Ministries only need to use Imperius curse and memory charms to shut down Muggle chains of command. There wouldn't be a war in the first place.

*** Even if they have significant wizards on their side those wizards would be need to know how to duel aurors, who are trained to know the muggle world, and those wizards would need to be privy to all the eyes and ears wizards have in the muggle world.

There was a whole portrait in the Prime Minister's office and the MoM could Floo in at any time.

** *Muggles

If Muggleborns team up with the Muggles, the Muggles will win. If Muggles have full disclosure/information about wizards and play the "we're so ignorant about magic" card and build defenses against it, Muggles would win. If it's just clueless canon Muggles vs clueless canon wizards, wizards would win.

** Which sides are the muggle-borns fighting on? Overall I'd say muggles because wizards are super outnumbered and ridiculously ignorant about muggle technology and weapons.
