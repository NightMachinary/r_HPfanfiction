An example would be Bungle in the jungle. Any kind of training for the main character that happens outside Hogwarts.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][/Temporal Beacon/]] they use [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming][save scumming]] to get training from various masters. I can remember potions training and [[http://mikesrpgcenter.com/gothic/training.html][animal carving,]] at least.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** linkffn(11983735) is a bit whimsical and heavily AU, but very well written.

  She's a darling, she's a demon. Unable to concentrate in Hogwarts, Ginny Weasley is sent to Little Hangleton House to serve an apprenticeship with mysterious, handsome Tom Riddle. Tom's experiments in magic are like nothing Ginny's ever come across, and as she finds herself increasingly drawn to him she has to wonder: what does Tom Riddle want from her? *AU*
