I could easily imagine Walker being related to the Malfoys but how awesome would it be to have John fucking Taylor show up at Hogwarts to teach defense against the dark arts or maybe he raises Harry? It doesn't have to even be the Nightside because Harry could easily be related to The Droods from the Secret History series or even the ghost finders series.


** I'm not certain John Taylor would be the best choice for DADA teacher; just how many spells does he know? Off the top of my head, he's got that true-sight gift, that empty-out-guns trick...a cigarette-lighting-trick? And he's always armed with condiments.

I suppose that'd work for one or two scenes, I guess. John teaching about the barrier properties of a line of salt, or Harry using ordinary pepper to bypass someone's ultra-powerful unstoppable forgot-to-guard-against-the-basics shield.

Gee, I wonder what Harry could do with one of Ethel's torcs? Like those Iron Man crossover fics except more, I guess.
