Despite Dumbledore's protests, Harry is now being raised in the home of Britain's Muggle Prime Minister, Gordon Rollins. Rollins is determined to unleash a prepared Harry onto the wizarding world.

** Here's my top favorites. Not sure what you're into, but I'll try and cover a few things.

linkffn(Browncoat Green Eyes by nonjon) is one of my all-time favorites. I'm a huge fan of HP and Firefly, and this creates a wonderful blend of the two. Not the longest, but it's about 300k. Been around forever, so if you read crossovers, you might have read it already. Plenty of action and spacey things going on.

linkffn(A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold) is another of my favs. A "Hogwarts is rubbish, find a new school in books in the RoR" story, but that was a lot less cliche when the story was written. Also, it ditches that pretty quickly and creates a world of magic that is fantastic in my opinion. New races, new skills, and an entirely new blood magic system that in my opinion is the best I've seen. It's the start of a trilogy, but the final story was never finished. Between the first and second story, it's almost 600k words.

If you like Stargate, linkffn(Isis's Bane by althor42) is a good read. Reading it is a bit weird, as the linked story is only 11k words long, but the end of that story diverges. The author couldn't decide which way to take the story, so he wrote two paths. One path leads to HP going on a 200k word romp through the galaxy, the other with HP finding a new home in a 100k story.

linkffn(The Queen who fell to Earth by Bobmin356) and it's two sequels are another great read, and together are over 950k words. It's based on the Dragon Riders of Pern, but doesn't require any knowledge of Pern lore (I've never read the series). HP gets a Dragon! What's not to love? Lots of world building, fair amount of action. Sadly, it will never be finished, as Bobmin passed away before he finished. He's got a few other stories that are also worth a read.

linkffn(Harry Potter's Existence after Life by Cygnus Crux) is an oldie. Finished back in 2002. Another with great world building. HP ended the war, but left after a fall-out with the Weasleys. He's now a Ranger, an elite peace keeper force in the magical world. A lot less cliche than it sounds. Pretty good read. Also the start of a trilogy that was never finished. But the first two round out a pretty solid story on their own. About 500k words with the first two (and the short 50k fluff piece that sits after the first two and before the unfinished last story).

Bobmin had some great stories, it's definitely sad, but at least he's out of the pain now. There's some details in his FF bio, but he had Lung cancer, and it took him rather quickly.

I can actually recommend a crap ton more but it's all Dramione, so I'll stick with one for now. If you're curious, feel free to pm me. It's definitely an acquired taste, but once you find the good stuff it's hard to go back to anything else! :)

  It takes the unexpected engagement of their children to get Draco and Hermione in a room together, but only the selfish acts of their estranged spouses and a 300 Galleon bottle of firewhiskey will get them in a bedroom. What starts out as a one time mistake soon becomes a full-blown affair with a deadline; the day their children say 'I do'. But things rarely go according to plan.

  Inside this story you will find the chronicles of the 7 years of torture the staff of Hogwarts had to endure, from their point of view, due to 4 boys. That's right. None other than James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew.

  Last in the Promise series! The end is coming, and Harry and his friends are working hard in preparation. Of course, it's not easy when you feel like you're reading a book in which every other page is missing. How will they find the horcruxes? How can Harry hope to defeat Voldemort? Good thing he's got his friends. And Ginny. Don't forget about Ginny.
