you know, clichés everywhere, awful foreshadowing, characters' names misspelt all the time, the works.


** I'll run Philosopher's Stone through a bad translator immediately.

--------------

Actually, you got me thinking; what events would you have to remove from the plot to erase the foreshadowing? Make everything a plot twist or shocking swerve or ass pull or whatever troper terminology you'd prefer.

I started by listing Hagrid getting the Philosopher's Stone, how Hagrid got Norbert's egg, the newspaper on Hagrid's table that describes the Gringotts break-in, and the first encounter with Fluffy...

I know there's more, like the attempt by Quirrel to hex Harry's broom, the whole scar thing, etc, but the first few I came up with had me wondering; what if Hagrid weren't present in the series at all? Canon goes on as normal, people act according to normal...before realizing that the half-giant they're expecting or were talking to or his hut or such, isn't actually there.

*** Yes, just run the Books through Google Translate to a foreign language and back.

The result could be utterly hilarious.

  "Yes, I mean, Potter, Lupine made the professor think, you have to clear the Auror obvious sexuality -

  I forgot to use honey to tune Professor Umbndge coughing "My notes, or? Can not understand Minerva".

  "Of course I understand it," said Professor McGonagall. Her teeth are very firmly clenched, the word has gone a little bit.

  "Well, I'm confused ... I do not know what it is that you can give to Mr. Potter on how hopelessly false."

  hope? Repeated "fake McGonagall, but still refuses to look around to see Professor Umbridge." He excelled in all defenses to the test of the black magic.

  "You, but I'm sorry for the contradiction of Minerva, which can be seen from my notes, that Harry has achieved very poor results in my lessons.

  "I should have clarified it," said Professor McGonagall. He has a high reputation for being tested by a competent teacher who has gained all of the spells of setting up the Dark Magic.

  Xiaqiao Professor smile, suddenly disappearing a light bulb blow.

From English, to Japanese, to Chinese (Traditional), then back to English.

...You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to roll some dice, pick a book and chapter at random, select a paragraph from that chapter, then run it through a translator, pick whatever comprehensible sentences or phrases are left out of it, and put those in a prompt.

** It's interesting because I feel like it would be a different story altogether if the fanon concepts made it into the original story.

For example, James and Lily wouldn't have risked their lives with the Fidelius Charm, and instead would have done what any logical wizard would do, and put wards up. Hence, no betrayal.

Even if Sirius had been sent to Azkaban, it's just natural that a high security prison would have had wards on it so he couldn't break out and just swim away.

Why not just have Harry buy a magical trunk instead of using that smelly old tent in book 7? Could have led to different events if he could lock the trunk. To be fair I've never read a story with this trope, just heard about it, so no idea how it works.

And of course, Dumbledore, being the evil man he was, would have set up the sorcerer's stone as a trap to lure Harry to his death. Book end.

Maybe those weren't the cliches you meant, but still an interesting idea.

**** The cliché's, the awful foreshadowing. It's a wonder that the names are written correctly. Plus part of the series gets rewritten in such an awful way that it just hurts. And that Delphi character is the worst OC ever.

****** I am so terribly sorry. I didn't know you got up on the wrong side of the bed. No need to be snappish. Life's too short to be cantankerous, captain Grumpy (I used synonyms for cranky. If you hadn't noticed).

Well, good day to- oh. Probably wrong thing to say. Anyway, no need to be ornery. Have a perfectly ordinary day.
