It's a good fic with a good premise. Starting the DA in First Year, a solid group that all work together, and because of that, Harry doesn't suffer any nonsense from 1st, 2nd or 4th year. They knew he didn't enter his name in the cup, they knew he wasn't the heir, they didn't care about the Points from the Dragon (If it happened it was glossed over, not even sure it did happen). The DA WAS needed earlier given that the Teachers... Lupin mostly taught about creatures and Crouch Jr was nutso, and the other teachers were terrible, so the idea of the DA being formed in first year due to Quirrel being useless makes sense.


** I hope someone out there knows another fic that has the DA start-up early like this. It's a really good concept that I just haven't found another like it. I know a few stories breifly mention how students have been self studying due to terrible DA teachers but never a set study group.

** There is a one-shot by Jeconais called Motivations. It starts off as a Muggle Studies club, but they branch out to magical subjects.

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Motivations/Motivations/]]

Harry joins a new club, wanting to keep up with his Muggle subjects.  Having more friends leads him on the sort of path he had only dreamed about.
