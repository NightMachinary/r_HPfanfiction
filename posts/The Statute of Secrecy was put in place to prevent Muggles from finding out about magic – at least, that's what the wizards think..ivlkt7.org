In reality, it exists to discourage wizards from venturing into the Muggle world. The thing is, Harry Potter wasn't the only book series to come out about the magic universe. In fact, every few years, some Muggle will turn up with a "fiction" series describing wizards that exist in real life, often a few years before what's happening in the book actually happens. This phenomenon is being researched in the Department of Mysteries, and they believe it to be some form of time-travel which has not yet been discovered.


** Apparently there are seers with no other detectable magical abilities, and they're surprisingly common in the muggle world. An interesting quirk of magical genetics. All muggle fiction is now scanned for signs of subconscious divination by automated algorithms and works by know muggle seers are further examined for possible real predictions.
