You have received a letter from Hogwarts and you are now part of the most amazing School in the world.

The first thing you need to do, is present yourself in The Sorting Hat, and you'll be assigned to a House (unless you are a teacher, but that's a different story).

This is a RPG where we look for interaction between the people. Students and Teachers, all together.

And yes... this is Dark, it's only for 18+, so be sure to let people know about your kinks in private messages.

So write your story, and be sure of mentioning two things in the Sorting Hat. Your Mandatory House, if you just want one, or your preferred Houses if you are more open about it.

We are looking for:

*/Students: */ girls or guys that comes to Hogwarts. No real characters, all made up by you. Write at least a paragraph for background, your personality, Kinklist and a picture. Give the Sorting Hat something he can work with.

Teachers: We have positions for teachers, we want to be half male, half females (But for this position... you need to be BI)

- Headmaster (taken, by me)
- History of Magic (available)
- Muggles Studies (available)
- Dark Arts (taken)
- Potions & Herbology (taken)
- Transfiguration (available)
- Divination (taken)
- Charms (available)
- Care of Magical Creatures (taken)
- Flying/Quidditch Coach (taken but available)

Ask me for the link and information in a private message


** Hmm...'dark', you say? I assume that refers to themes of rape and violence, rather than sensory deprivation?

Might be a problem for me, 'affectionate and loving' is pretty much at the top of my kink list and 'rape/non-consensual slavery' is my biggest turn-off.

*** Dark means ... we allow any kinks

But we respect all kinks, and all nos.

If you don't like rape, of course no rape.

There are a lot of people going for romance, others going for pain... there's room for everyone :)

Are you interested?

**** Hmm...what species are allowed? Is being a student/teacher necessary, or are goblins, horny centaurs, sexy veela, mischievous house-elves, etc, allowed?
