What are the worst fix-it fanfic tropes? What instantly turns you off of a fix-it fic and why? What does a good fix-it fic look like to you? What's the worst fix-it you've ever read?

I'm not particularly well read in fix-its, but I'm instantly repelled when I'm reading a fic and one of the characters paraphrases a post I know is from tumblr. I can enjoy a trashy Dumbledore bash every now and then but not when it's just a blatant self insert. There are much better ways to avoid Dumbledore's manipulation than sassing him, I reckon.

I was curious about this because I read the term “mugglewank” for the first time today under a discussion about Muggle Studies and how some authors “fix” it. A lot of commenters seemed to be familiar with it, so I wonder what other common knowledge I'm ignorant to. I'm currently writing something that's kind of related to this genre so I'm eager to hear your thoughts!

I apologise if this has already been discussed, I'm relatively new to the sub and this is my first post here!

Edit: bad phrasing.


** I dislike curbstomping, where after seeing the light, teenage Harry clears Sirius name, gets one over the Ministry, defeats Voldemort and gets out from Dumbledore's thumb, all in the course of three weeks, not necessary in that order. Oh, and he has multiple animagus forms now.

But the worst fix-it trope for me is when time travel fix-it fics act like mental age gaps don't matter. Adult Harry (or any other time traveller) in his younger body having any romantic feelings towards a child/teenager is creepy. Adult Harry humiliating an eleven year old Malfoy and treating it as a huge victory is pathetic. Adult Harry spending his time with two thirteen year olds pranking other kids is fucking immature (although I can let this last one slide if the fic is on the cracky side).

** For me, the worst fix-it tropes are the convoluted fanon drivel people make up to portray the HP world as the best of all worlds.

- "Elves need to be slaves or they die so keeping them as slaves is the right and proper thing and totally not evil!"

- "Dementors cannot be stopped or contained, only bribed, so having them feed on prisoners is the only way to keep the rest of the world safe and therefore totally not evil! For the Greater Good!"

- "Voldemort and his followers are the only bad guys in HP. There are no other bigots in HP, and no unfair pro-pureblood laws even if Pottermore mentions them!"

- "Death Eaters are only extremists who want to defend their culture which is totally special and great, even if we never see anything very different from muggle culture, but it totally is!"

*** I'm torn on this - it's hard to have a character notice these things and be like "Well, on the one hand, I'm participating and benefiting from the enslavement and brainwashing of a race of sentient beings, but on the other hand, Malfoy is being a real dick and we really need to do something about it, so let's just prioritize that for the moment."

In general, if you're going to acknowledge how generally messed up the Wizarding World is, you either need to handwave it away, provide a GOOD reason for why your character isn't doing something about it now that it's been brought up, or make it the main focus of the fic.

I think the best option is to just not explicitly acknowledge it, but it's a hard line to walk if you still want to include those elements and not have you character address the elephant in the room.

This applies more to your first two examples than the last two

**** Except that they acknowledge it in canon. Like, you'd have to change Hermione's character pretty seriously to have her not take notice. It was an entire story arc, and a pretty major one at that.

So you now have to reconcile that:

1. Many or most of the wizards we see are not evil.

2. Slavery is evil.

3. The situation with House Elves is either explicitly or uncomfortably close to slavery.

4. At least one character explicitly recognizes 2 and 3, and draws attention to those facts.

5. Nobody ultimately does anything about 1-4, save Hermione (who eventually stops her campaign).

And preferably, you have to do it without it being a blatant Uncle Tom story.

***** House Elves are a tricky thing...

On one hand slavery is of course terrible and evil, but by just declaring to act for them without asking for their input is not the right way either. In canon house elves don't want to be freed, something that just doesn't exist in history and in a human concept.

That is why in one of my stories, the muggleborn MC is actual a bit disgusted by house elves that they lack the will to be free and in a way she sees what the more moderte pureblood bigots want muggleborns to be in them.That they accept purebloods as their betters and are grateful to be in servitute to them.

******* I actual never read the book and all I know about it, is that a slave explains that he iskind of ok with slavery.

So I can't say what is a Uncle Tom story in detail.

But what I meant to say that the whole house elve thing is something very difficult to understand if you look at canon.

The one peaceful example of a polite slave revolution of people that what to work that I ever read is the freeing of golems in the Discworld of Terry Pratchett. There it started with one free golem that worked and earned money and bought other golems, who worked to buy other golems as well

******** The idea is that in any acceptable moral system, slavery is wrong by virtue of it being slavery, regardless of what the slaves think of it. It's completely possible to write a universe in which there is a justification for it from a Watsonian perspective - like circumstances somehow requiring slavery to save the lives of both the slaves and the masters, without which they would be doomed to eternal torture and death - but since we live in a Doylist universe, it will always be viewed as an apology for real life slavery.

The golem revolution in Discworld is meant to examine the philosophy of people like Thurgood Marshall, who advocated for social revolution completely within the rules of the system, rather than MLK's civil disobedience. It has its pros and cons.

I really think that the house elves are a really difficult thing in the HP universe. and it is nearly impossible to deal with it in a 'good' way.

But ff characters don't have to be perfect in their reaction to this problem, (like the character in my story that is disgust by their lack of fight for freedom) it is just important not to present this point of view as the right one

That's because it already is an Uncle Tom story, and you're writing fanfiction of it. Either you go with it as presented and just say 'Look, I don't agree with this, I wouldn't have written it like this, but that's how it is in canon,' or you make part of your fic about changing it.

#+begin_quote

That's still an Uncle Tom sentiment. It's actually very, very close to the reasoning Holocaust deniers use to 'prove' that there couldn't have been a Holocaust - /surely/ the Jews/victims would have fought back, instead of being led into camps...

Basically, it's important to remember that victims don't have an obligation to fight their attacker. Your character is free to think that, of course, but it's a flaw that readers will be judging them for. That's not a bad thing to have in a character, of course. Plenty of famous protagonists have been headstrong and a little brutal or lacking in empathy.

******* Most people don't have a house-elf.

They're based on creatures that would get offended and leave if offered payment.

Unlike human slaves, house-elves crave work. They went on strike when Hermione started leaving clothes out for them.

Also, they consider it a matter of pride to not be seen doing their work.

Just like in real life, people tend to prefer not to think about uncomfortable truths. People didn't just decide to one day free the slaves in the west, perhaps they wouldn't have done either if they hadn't stood up for themselves.

Also, the house-elves speak volumes about the setting. They're an important part, and it is a drastic change to remove them or alter them to make people's decisions less morally grey.

******* I don't agree with all of [[/u/UbiquitousPanacea]]'s points, but the fact that most people don't have a House-Elf is a very good one. The Wizarding World is tiny, the pureblood (or wannabe-pureblood) section of the population is tinier, and the percentage of those who's rich enough to have an Elf is tinier still. Not counting the Hogwarts ones, I find it perfectly believable to think there's, like, fifty bound Elves in all of Britain.

I agree that if nothing is going to be done that it's best to generally avoid it, but I don't think that's particularly difficult to do.

It's not like you can just casually go and uplift the house elves. That sounds closer to a lifelong ambition - hell, it's probably more likely that you'd spend your entire life trying and only making a sliver of progress. I don't expect characters to drop everything and dedicate themselves to that, especially when they have their own problems.

** Wizards being unaware that muggles have landed on the moon. It played well in Snape Chronicles because Sev and Lily were living in the era and focused on the space program as young geeks would be, but this one has been misused to make wizards seem stupid for a while.

If anything, the average wizard is more in tune with celestial movements since they know it affects their work. I think the more likely scenario is that wizards had already made it to the moon and discovered it was nothing but rocks and hardly worth the trip. They set up a crystal ball to make remote observations, disguised it as a really unimpressive boulder and then went home.

*** I haven't read that one, I'll put it in my list! I haven't read many with this trope but I agree that they would certainly know about the moon. I'd love to hear if someone explored the logistics of a magical space expedition though.

In general I find the idea that most wizards don't know anything at all about advancements in science and technology quite strange though it does sort of originate in canon. Unless they exclusively use the Floo network, everyone in wizarding Britain is forced to be in Muggle Britain for at least a little bit. They all have to go to Kings Cross Station. They have to go through Muggles to reach the Leaky. I'm sure there are other small points of contact too. On top of that, the statute of secrecy almost legally obligates them to know the bare basics about how to act like a Muggle, ie Quidditch World Cup. Many of them have Muggle neighbours, and almost all of them have half-blood friends. It seems impossible to avoid the Muggle world altogether. You can visibly gauge the advancement of technology just by seeing people on the street using smart phones. Little things like rubber ducks and dentists make sense because they wouldn't necessarily have exposure to those little details in Muggle life, but they'd certainly know about the wars, the moon landing etc. That's one of my many issues with FB: CoG - there's no way all of those wizards at Grindelwald's rally would've been shocked or surprised about the Muggle wars. It would've disrupted their lives too, for heaven's sake.

To be fair, anyone in 1927 getting a vision of warfare in 1945 would be suitably impressed, unless they had been in the trenches in the Great War already, and those would be horrified that the muggles would make it that bad once more.

I'm with you that most wizards have to live with some muggle exposure in their daily lives, but I also think that the average wizard isn't keeping up with the pace of modernization. Specialists in the Ministry would be fully aware of muggle advances and for the sake of the Statute would have to work twice as hard planning how to keep magic hidden.

inb4 'but Arthur Weasley--' Look, I know it probably doesn't fit all of canon events, but my headcanon is that Arthur knows his muggle studies very well, and he knows how to pretend bumbling quirkiness to help muggles, muggleborns, and the muggle-raised to feel less overwhelmed, less threatened by their visit to the Wizarding side of the wall. He approached the Grangers to guide them during their visit, he chatted up Harry over silly topics to make him feel better about being brought into the man's house, and later he tried to distract Harry with his antics while they were on the way to Harry's trial. It wasn't as effective at calming the Dursleys when the Floo connection got complicated, but he still handled them well in the end, even with his sons trying to poison Dudley right behind his back.

***** Good point, I forgot it was a vision! Though I honestly don't think they would necessarily be THAT shocked about much, apart from the advancement in weapons. They already see Muggles as violent and dangerous people, especially in America. People are constantly fighting wars all over the world. Flavour of the month. Unless wizards also don't talk to wizards in other countries, I still find it implausible that they'd be surprised that Muggles fight lots of bloody wars. It just doesn't strike me as a thought that would be particularly new to people who are petrified of exposure. Especially in America, as in FB it seems Americans live and walk among muggles more often than we see in HP's Britain, though that might just be by virtue of the characters' occupational differences. The weapons would definitely shock though, I definitely overlooked a big one there!

On another note, this makes me wonder about the involvement of wizards in the world wars. Britain calls on every one of its colonies, would they try to use their magical population to their advantage too? Might be fun pureblood propaganda post-war if magical blood is spilled in muggle quarrels.

The muggle camp owner was complaining about people trying to pay with gold coins the size of hubcaps (galleons), and there was whats-his-face who thought a sundress was proper attire for a man. (And those are just the first two I can think of immediately; I'm sure a proper re-reading of the chapter would yield even more ridiculousness.) I'd say the world cup is evidence of the exact opposite -- there are plenty of wizards who don't know (or don't care) about fitting in with muggles at all.

If I remember it correctly, that dress-wizard you mentioned was protesting the limitations placed on the appropriate wear for the world cup to protect the statute. The rest was the case of stupidity of people in large numbers as they celebrate the final of a sport loved throughout the world.

The gold coins... Well, I once went to Italy without converting my money to Euro because of a sudden case of excitement. Shit happens.

The way I imagine it, an average wizard can blend in in the Muggle world easily but doing so when you are going to the Quidditch world cup, an event utterly magical, would feel stifling, would take away from the experience. The other instance of wizards collectively toying with the statute is on November 1, 1981 when Voldemort ''dies', for which I think they can be excused.

** Evil!Dumbledore, and any other trope that involves making evil something that wasn't evil in the books so that Harry can look awesome standing up for himself in the face of it (looking at you, love potion Ginny), is on top of the list for me too. How is it a "fix-it fic" if you're making up even more villains than Harry had to deal with in canon?

The other big problem in nominally fix-it fics, and kind of the counterpart to the above, if you will, is the Stations of Canon get respected anyway because the writers feel too insecure about letting go of the canon-plot handrail. If the entire point is that you're going to show things going right where they went wrong in canon to make the reader feel nice and fuzzy, then why on Earth would Sirius still die, the Triwizard Tournament still pick Harry, Voldemort pull off his rube-goldberg-esque resurrection scheme successfully, etc.? If you're going to show Harry winning, /show Harry winning/. Not winning new side-quests you're making up while he takes just as much abuse from the canon plotline as before. I mean /winning/.

Milder stuff: I don't mind it as much as some people, but while Neville's mismatched wand is clearly /at play/ in his failing school grades, that doesn't mean he'll instantly become top of the class if he gets a better one. He's also insecure and clumsy /aside/ from the wand thing. Also, if no Hogwarts Professors /noticed/ his wand was ill-matched and that was part of his problem, then your fix-it character better have a good explanation for why /they/ can notice at a glance so they can fix the problem for him.

Also:

#+begin_quote
  I was curious about this because I read the term “mugglewank” for the first time today in reference to fics in which Muggle Studies is “fixed”.
#+end_quote

That's not quite what the term means in its most common acception. Rather, it's any story which uniformly glorifies the Muggle world over the Wizarding World in every aspect, from "guns beat wands every time" to "the Muggle style of government/education/economy is obviously better than the Wizarding alternative and the only reason the wizards haven't tried the Muggle way is that they're stupid".

While it's often used as a plot device in fix-it-type fics (the fixing takes the form of Muggle-ization of the Wizarding World), Mugglewank isn't inherently a fixture of fix-it fics; I could name several severely Mugglewanky stories that are grim and gritty and depressing.

There's also some debate over to what extent Mugglewank is /right/; a cursory look through any /HP/ forum's archive (ours included) will reveal dozens of threads about "who would win in an all out Muggles vs. Wizards war?" and similar questions, and there's no consensus answer. Basically everyone decent agrees that extreme Mugglewank is a thing and probably wrong on /some/ things, but beyond that? Here there be flamewars.

Purebloods, in order to be portrayed as the bad guys in a story, are contrasted with muggle technology and culture and found to be incompetent or inferior in every way. Guns beat AKs, mortars beat Reductos, satellites and GPS beat Muggle Repelling Charms, modern genetics beat blood purist inbreeding.

My least liked Fix-It trope is Harry bringing in outside authorities, ICW or the muggle government, to reform the Ministry or Hogwarts. It's basically a justice wank with HP flavor, and follows the same "plot" as most other revengeboner fics.

In these stories:

- Dumbledore's incompetence and manipulation are brought up as reasons to dismiss him as Headmaster. "You kept a Cerberus in a room for a whole year under a door that could be unlocked by a Year 1 spell!?"

- Snape has his class inspected, and the authorities realize he has no teaching license.

- Umbridge is charged for her extreme discipline policies.

- Filch is fired.

- Draco and his bully friends are caught bullying and expelled or sent to wizard juvey.

- Muggle Studies curriculum is re-vamped and made mandatory from Year 1. All students take field trips to muggle cities and appreciate muggle culture.

- Optional: Harry inherits Hogwarts due to some obscure Gringotts inheritance, Harry becomes Headmaster, Remus and Sirius become teachers, and Voldemort is shot by a muggle gun.

****** I wouldn't rule it out, but if they did, they also escaped unharmed. For all that the Cerberus is a dangerous creature, it has a very good track record in the year it's there. People get more injuries in the ordinary course of classes or quidditch.

** I personally cant stand fic it fics where manipulative!Dumbledore is present and the only characters to 'realize' or 'wise up' to it are the authors fav characters. Best example is Escape. An h/hr marriage law fic. Currently reading accidental animagus where this trope seems to be present as well.

*** Hmm, yes I agree to some extent. It would make more sense for only a few, very observant and cynical characters to pick up on it, since nobody really did in canon except when D explicitly revealed his plans. So to me it would depend on which characters were their favs lol. But there are definitely characters who never would've woken up and I agree that it's so annoying when authors write someone like H or Hr realising without any catalyst for why their whole world view suddenly changed.

*** Hmmm, I think manipulative!dumbledore is handled rather well in there but I'm also not quite done with year one and he just got called on his shit. Which made me almost as happy as the Flitwick vs Dumbledore scene in the Claw of the Raven series.

Yeah, I had a similar impression fairly early in the story too: the mom writing out complaints in her notebook.

Mostly, to me it feels a lot more like just... distrust I guess? After all, their introduction to the wizarding world showcased some of it's major faults: they put Harry in a basket with a /letter/ and left him on the Dursley's porch overnight for crying out loud, then didn't check up on him at all. And this was done by somebody with a /lot/ of power and influence: the person that ran the only school in the country PLUS is a famous war hero, is in charge of the legislature, a counter-terrorism cell and is basically a sitting judge.

If an abused five year old kid with that history showed up on your doorstep, wouldn't you be a bit judgemental too?
