I've been meaning to make a list of all time favorites, and I would love some suggestions. A couple I have already are Stages of Hope and I Live and I Let Live: Yet I Live and I Love or something like that by billowsandsmoke. Cheers!


** I keep a fairly large library in Calibre of stories I've read, and five have managed to be filed under 'amazing'. One is Stages of Hope, and here are my other favourites:

- *Grey Space* - Hogwarts starts later and Harry goes to Stonewall High.

- *And The Wolves All Cry* - A bit of dystopian Jilly. Actual relationship that I don't hate. No pairings, no Boy Who Lived.

- *Steve and the Barkeep* - Probably the most famous/recc'd MCU crossover. Probably there's a reason for this.

- *The Man Who Lived* - Character study / Draco redemption arc. I was skeptical when I started this, but holy hell. Contains slash and a fair number of potential triggers (see a/n for details).

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  Draco breaks a cup, and one thing leads to another. A story of redemption, tattoos, dreams, mistakes, green eyes, long conversations, and copious amounts of coffee. Set in New York twelve years after the war.

#+begin_quote
  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.
