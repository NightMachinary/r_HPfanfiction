'Due to a botched ritual on the longest night of the year, Harry has become something unheard of in the wizarding world - a living vampire. Harry must now determine how to kill Tom Riddle, avoid a meddling Headmaster, and keep from going into blood lust all while dealing with a typical school year. And he can't seem to keep from watching his Defense Professor. He's not certain if it's just for the blood, or something more. Merlin help him'
