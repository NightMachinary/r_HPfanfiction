Instead of being born a wizard, Harry was born a sorcerer. With assumptions made to the contrary, no one figured it out until he made it to Hogwarts.

Which lead to a dilemma...

Subjects like Potions and History were without issue, but no teacher on staff had any idea how to teach a sorcerer how to do magic.

Meaning Professor McGonagall, Flitwick and Quirrell (and his many successors) had to find unique ways of teaching practical magic to a boy who isn't capable of learning the same magic as them.

▪︎▪︎▪︎

My idea is that Harry is encouraged to figure out ways to replicate the spells that the other students are learning, but they have to figure out... how to do that.

Meanwhile have Harry experimenting with magic, able to do certain things his peers can't due to his magic not functioning the same way theirs can, whilst being stumped at other points.

*E.g: Harry loves flying, thus he is easily able to teach himself how to float and fly. He is then able to apply that same principle to the floating charm in Flitwick's class, as it's something he is familiar with. But turning the matchstick into a needle utterly baffles him.*


** That sounds a little like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20), though not the same. Natural 20 has a Dungeons and Dragons wizard trying to adapt to Hogwarts classes.

**** If I may ask, why do you dislike it? I haven't read it yet and seeing as I have too many tabs to keep track of already, I don't want to add one with tropes, ships and ideas I dislike.

***** I read it a long time ago but I don't remember it having any bothersome tropes, in fact I quite enjoyed the story. I would add here that this was during the early part of my fanfiction reading career so it's possible that I flat out missed some tropes to being with.

The portrayal of the differences in the two magic systems was very interesting to read, especially how DnD focuses on the letter of the description rather than the spirit, and the DnD protagonist is always trying to min-max and generally "break the game" as much as he can.

Such a shame that it's still incomplete.

***** There's not really any shipping. (Hannah Abbott has an interest in Milo, but he's clueless.)

The biggest question is whether you'll like the humour. You don't have to know D&D in detail, but it helps to have a general idea of how games like that operate, in order to understand the cleverness of what Milo pulls off.

Harry Potter and the Superhero Origin Story also has Harry capable of a different system of magic but needing to learn how to use 'normal wizard' magic, but the story itself (Harry is an angry foster child) is perhaps not what you're after.

I know of another story where Harry does very unusual magic, but in that one he doesn't go to Hogwarts at all so it sort of defeats the premise.

  Harry Evans is a perfectly normal sixteen year old, thank you very much. Except that... he isn't. Not by anyone's standards. (Not when he can make things move with his mind). He tries not to let it bother him, but he's doing increasingly freakish things, and the world around him is getting stranger and stranger. People are following him, and speaking in metaphors, and somehow knowing his name. It's unnerving.He wonders when his life became this much of a fever dream. Or... Harry Potter somehow slipped under the radar, and now, 5 years after that first Hogwarts letter was sent out, they've finally found him. The world is darker, and more hopeless, and the Harry Potter they get seems like the furthest thing from a beacon of light. He's angry and reckless and world worn. But he's their only hope: the saviour of the Wizarding World. If only he gave a shit.
