** Most were taken down, but I've read only one called Discovering the Legend. It's not on FF.net so you'll have to Google it.

** The only thing I can think of is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Goblet's Surprise). Not complete, likely abandoned.

Also, A Dramatic Reading has a sequel linkffn(A Sensational Story) by a different author as well.

** There's a fair amount on Fictionhunt, give a google of â€˜fictionhunt reading the books' and I'm pretty sure a link to a reddit thread comes up that has a fair few on there
