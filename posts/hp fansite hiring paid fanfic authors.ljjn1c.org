** Just a doubt. Isn't paying fanfic writers for their fanfiction illegal?

** Paid-for fanfic is not okay.

So that's a solid 'no' from me.

** Definately illegal. Also no one would pay for HP fanfiction when Wattpad, Ffnet, Ao3 etc etc all exist for free...

** Unfortunately, very illegal. Hell, even Patreon support for authors dance around the line quite dangerously.

** Hey, this is going to very quickly get shut down. Intellectual property is fiercely protected, and by pushing the boundaries like this you run the risk of facing nasty legal action yourself and also ruining the fun for others as authors and publishers try to stop fanfic in general. Please please don't do this.

** Wonderful idea if it wasn't, unfortunately, absolutely illegal :(

** Since this is blatantly illegal, I assume wizardinglife exists to scam writers. There'll be some sort of “Give me all your bank info so I can transfer money into your account” deal, or “Whoops, I accidentally sent you too much money, so refund most of it,” thing.

** A solid no from me. This is the kind of thing that may destroy fanfiction eventually. You're supposedly going to be paying people to write fanfiction, to publish on a site that I assume will give you some revenues from advertising.

This is 100% illegal. I suggest you can this idea immediately, if only to save yourself the headache that will come your way, if you persist.

Having said that, I wonder if commissioning an artist to do a picture of your Harry, for example, which is then posted on their Deviant Art, would be considered the same thing?
