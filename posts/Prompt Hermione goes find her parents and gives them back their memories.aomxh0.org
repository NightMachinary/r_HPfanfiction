I always wondered how Hermione's parents felt, after getting their memories returned to them. Did they understand? Did they feel betrayed? How did they react to Hermione before she returned their memories and after? Any lasting affects afterward?

The few stories I've read seem to go for the Harry/Hermione or the Draco/Hermione route; and I don't like either pairing, really. Nothing wrong if someone else does, I just don't like the pairing.

And I'm not entirely interested in pairings for this story, I want to see how Hermione would react to traveling to locate her parents, who she might meet along the way, without Ron or Harry by her side. (I figured she would want to do this on her own).

I want the after affect to Hermione locating her parents and returning their memory, so not entirely happy; maybe they're disappointed in how she handled the situation? I don't really care; how you do it, just make it interesting.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione either. I'd rather it not focus on any pairing really, if there is a pairing let it be more of a minor part.

I'd like world building, though you don't have to do anything too crazy, just something would be nice.

Would rather it be a multichapter, but if you could do it as a long oneshot; that'd be fine as well.

No Perfect Hermione, Hermione isn't perfect and makes mistakes; I want to see her dwell in obliviating her parents memories, and returning her parents memories, I want to see distrust from her parents; not hate, that'd be too much, but just something than just oh as long as you're okay; it doesn't matter what you did to us! Kind of thing.

I'd like to see Australia; how different is magical Australia compared to magical Britain? And that kind of thing

Are there any lasting consequences? Maybe her parents adopt or even have a second child while Hermione was away? How would Hermione react to this?

Anything like that would be interesting to me.

If anyone feels up to the challenge of writing this, just say that you're in!

If you'd like any more info from me, just ask and I can help you with the story.

  Hermione goes to Australia to bring her parent home and gets a big surprise. It turns out her Memory Charm wasn't enough to fill the hole in their lives. Now, she has a new sister who will be starting at Hogwarts as she returns for her seventh year and deals with the aftermath of the war. Epilogue-compliant.

** My take:

- They will be very very angry, even if they understand Hermione's motivation.
- They will not go back to Britain anytime soon, considering Voldemort remnants are still many and Hermione is their enemy number 2. Better safe than sorry.
- They will not ever go back to Britain, if they have already established in Australia and like the weather there. They may visit Hermione perhaps from time to time. I live in the US, and know many immigrants from Britain just around my neighborhood. Hermione's parents could have perfectly decided to emigrate.
- Some fics make a big deal out of whether Hermione should go to Australia immediately or attend Fred's funeral first. Fucking stupid manufactured drama! Her parents are safe there, and a few more weeks won't hurt. But Fred is family too and his funeral can't wait. Besides, booking international flights requires a few weeks in advance anyway, or else pay an exorbitant fare.

That being said, I prefer alternative solutions of her parents's safety vs canon. For example in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], she came clean with them and persuaded them to leave, while planting a false trail at same time. In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/][Lady Archimedes]], linkffn(11463030), she had concocted a rather convoluted deception.

  Sequel to The Arithmancer. Years 5-7. Armed with a N.E.W.T. in Arithmancy after Voldemort's return, Hermione takes spellcrafting to new heights and must push the bounds of magic itself to help Harry defeat his enemy once and for all.

  A "Hermione Retrieves Her Parents" story. Harry and Ron tag along, and catch the interest of local witches who are dealing with the after-effects of a magical virus that has left most Aussie wizards casting blanks. Blissfully Molly-free; eventual H/Hr.

** Linkffn(12526865) would fit beautifully with what you're looking for. Perfectly, even.

Don't let the Draco/Hermione discourage you; there are hardly any interactions between them, and the few there are are pretty much canon compliant. It's very much a HERMIONE focused story. Theodore Nott has a big part in this fic; he becomes a good friend of Hermione during this story. I do think Dramione will eventually be the endgame, but with 56+ Dramione-less chapters you can safely enjoy the fic without that pairing.

*** Yes I was going to suggest this one. The way it dealt with Hermione's family issues stemming from her actions feels genuine and realistic. No Dramione yet so you can skip out before that starts to happen .

  "All her growth was the conveying of a corpse of hope." It was definitely the worst of times. Follow Hermione as she navigates through the quagmire: saving the world, getting top grades, falling in love, lust, and a whole lot of trouble; and comes out of it hopefully at least partially sane.
