Any fanfics where a muggleborn uses transfiguration or any magic really to get filthy stinking rich?

I mean you probably cant transfigure something into gold and silver for whatever reason. But platinum, iridium, palladium, rhodium? As far as I know transfiguration is permanent so that would work. Hell even if you can't transfigure really expensive metals like these, cobalt sells for $50/kg and that should be easy, nothing special about cobalt.

And what about real estate? Buy a decrepit old house and fix it with a few swishes of a wand , BAM, instant profit


** I suspect this is an easy way to earn yourself a ticket to Azkaban. Because supplying commodities to the Muggle world inevitably would lead to questions of "where does this come from?", which I think would amount to a breach of the Statute of Secrecy.

In my [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IhvQPOHtikvwiRsh_cQ9GAHI44UAuZ_f/view][headcanon Ministry of Magic]] there is an office within the Department of Magical Law Enforcement called the Office for Inexplicable Wealth which investigates any wizard who seems to come into a large amount of money without the source of that wealth being known.

That aside, having had some contact with the world of commodities trading, I think people vastly underestimate what goes into the process of buying and selling commodities. You can't just stroll up to someone and sell them a cargo of X. Trading is a risky business so credibility in the market is very important. Buyers go through commodities traders known to the market like Glencore, Cargill, etc.

And supposing you established a contact with a trading desk in one of those companies, there's still all the paperwork to overcome. Traders don't just buy a multi-million dollar cargo on your word. You're going to need certificates of quality, certificates of origin, customs clearance certificates, bills of lading, a letter of credit, etc.

Now, sure, you could always just confund them to bypass all that. But at that point you're basically committing fraud. And if you're willing to use magic to defraud Muggles of money, there are easier ways to do it than faking a commodities trade.

With real estate, you have a similar issue - it's probably against the Statute of Secrecy as it leads to questions of how you renovated the property so quickly and effectively. And if you've made changes to the structure you better be able to show Building Regulations approval/Planning Permission, else you will struggle to sell it...

Even if you manage to pull it off and get away with it, you still have the problem that your proceeds are in Muggle money. And while we know that the goblins are willing to exchange Muggle money for wizarding currency in small quantities, I doubt there's sufficient liquidity in the GBP-Galleon exchange market to fund a large trade of millions of pounds.

All this said, since this is a request thread, IIRC "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw" features a Harry who uses magic to sell drugs into the Muggle narcotics market in order to build up enough money to establish an identity as a rich pure-blood.

*** Ironically enough I think counterfeiting & money laundering would be the way to go. Just get a few thousand of legitimate cash, duplicate as needed. Deposit electronically. Say you're a stripper or fine dining server or bartender.

*** Who says you need to tell the Ministry anything? Cant you just live in the muggle world and occasionally sell some metals in the pawn shop?

And for the Galleon for GBP issue, you can use the money to buy gold in the muggle world to then sell to the goblins for Galleons

I think the implication here is that the Ministry is a lot more Orwellian than it appears to be at first glance.

*** I think in India, there's a law that politicians aren't allowed to live more richly than can reasonably be explained by their known income. The cops don't even bother figuring out how they got the mysterious extra money; just having it without having an explanation for it is a crime. I can see the Ministry having a law like that.

Or not. The Ministry might not care what you're doing to muggles as long as you're not being blatant about it. Salvaging broken muggle stuff, fixing it in the privacy of your own home, and selling it isn't exactly muggle-baiting. You wouldn't get filthy rich like that, but you'd be comfortable.

** I don't think a muggleborn could get super rich, but they could probably live quite comfortably by repairing things and selling them. They buy a few antique piece that are in disrepair and 'restore' them to like new condition. As long as the item wasn't bewitched to do anything magical they wouldn't be breaking any laws. Then once they had save up enough money they could do the same with houses.

Flipping a house would be easy. Purchase something super cheap and falling apart, set it up to look like a building site and then start magically repairing the place. They would have to do it slowly and with great care to avoid detection from curious muggles but so long as they followed both Muggle and wizarding law and paid their taxes they could live quite comfortably.

*** And augment that with magically altered paperwork+magically counterfeit cash. Yeah, I think something legitimate, but magically enhanced business would be the way to go.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12327848/1/A-Wizard-s-Guide-to-Banking]]) has the protagonists fixing up houses with magic, though it isn't the focus of the fix.

  The problem: muggleborns face terrible discrimination, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things are only getting worse. The solution: Find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them, even if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way!

** Sounds like an excellent place for world-building in your own story.

Is the ministry actually competent and efficient in catching savvy wizards from breaking dozens of laws in the muggle world? Is the ministry more like most governments in the world and underpaid/overworked and really cannot be bothered to care why there are suddenly 200 perfect copies of various extremely famous paintings and jewelry being sold at an antique shop outside of london?

Trading may not be required at all. The theoretical wizard could just cast a few spells to have rich muggles /give/ them all their money. The example I am think of here is from the Jessica Jones show where one of the villains decides to move in with a random family by convincing them he is now their best friend and they should serve his every whim.

I think the ministry would not bother to step in unless some wizard is breaking the statute of secrecy in obvious ways, like murder in front of witnesses.
