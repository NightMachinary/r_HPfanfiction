It's this really well written Drarry Fic on AO3 about how Harry and Draco get bound together by a spell or something. One of my favorites. Just curious as how you guys feel about it/have read it. I don't see it get discussed often.


** You'd probably be better off discussing this at [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] :)
