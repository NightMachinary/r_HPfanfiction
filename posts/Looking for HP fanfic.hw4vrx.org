:END:
Hi. I'm looking for a specific Harry Potter fanfiction I've been looking for. Harry gets blood adopted by Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange and he goes to durmstrang. Bellatrix becomes his teacher at one point while at durmstrang. I think his name is Hadrian Lestrange. He then goes to Hogwartz for the triwizard tournament where he has some tasks from Voldemort. I remember when he was going to Hogqartz he had to remove the position of his Dark Mark to his back instead. One of his tasks was to find the diadem, the other was to befriend powerful light families, like Neville. That's all I remember of the story, please help me find it.

Edit: Found it.


** Sounds awesome, I'd love to read it too
