** This is a serious question, not trying to hate, but I am baffled:

Why are Evil!Harry stories attractive to write/read?

With proper character development I can understand a Dark!Harry that cares more about results than methods, but straight Evil!Harry seems to me to be a complete contradiction of his character. If the main character needs to be evil, there are plenty of other well-known canon characters that are already evil or can be twisted to be. Why use Harry when the only thing about him that remains intact is his name?

*** Like Quoba said, it doesn't make sense for Harry to be good and naive after he grew up being abused and neglected by the Dursleys. I also just like reading about evil or ruthlessly pragmatic characters in general, always having the MC be predictably heroic and good gets really boring after a while.
