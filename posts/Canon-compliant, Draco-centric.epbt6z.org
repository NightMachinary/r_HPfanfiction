I'm looking for a Draco-centric/Draco-POV fic that's canon-compliant (so no Dramione or Drarry, please) that deals with his relationship with his family and how/when he became a Death Eater, if such a thing exists!

A HBP rewrite from Draco's POV would be perfect, but I'd welcome anything broader too. Thanks!


** linkffn(Exile) is pretty good

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
