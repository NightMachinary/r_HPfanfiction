** Some of its elements (the dragons, the island) sound like the “Island of Fire” series. That said, if all of it was in the story then it definitely is /not/ it ... hmm, there's a (somewhat “grey Harry, Dumb-ledore”) story called ... give me a moment ... Rocking the Boat, by DerLaCroix, which /may/ be what you are looking for but I have no idea (it features Harry being a pirate, though I don't recall if they actually stole a ship or anything, there was an island with some magical creatures so /maybe/ dragons, and I can't recall if it had anything about the founders or not).

*** I have tried and I remember that there are 4 dragons guarding Hogwarts and so attack Harry when he moves the castle. Then the founders try and attack him by giving power to dumbledoor bar Salazar who gives power to riddle. Then I know it starts Harry Ginny but Ginny betrays him by taking away his magic or something along those lines
