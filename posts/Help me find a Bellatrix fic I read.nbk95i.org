:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's one were teen Bellatrix travels to the future but the adult Bellatrix who followed Voldie & is now locked in Azkaban still exists in the timeline. I remember deities of Dark & Light. Bellatrix had pledged herself to Eris which was something of a taboo because of how much chaos & destruction followers of Eris usually leave. Luna was pledged to a Diety I think was related to light & innocence which is why she's so dreamy. The thing with Luna is that her mom pledged her & her mom did the same kinda like a never ending unfair cycle. (But that's not important to the story). I think Bella went to the future because her dad was going to kill her, & Artcurus Black is left trying to fix the family & make amends in the past timeline.

That's the most I remember. I've been hunting for it for ages & just can't seem to find it! Halp

#+begin_quote
  Thirteen year old Bella Black intended to go back in time to start a war in service to her patron Power. Ritual magic goes awry and she finds herself in 1993, faced with a failing House of Black, an insane alter ego, and a Dark Lord on the rise. Chaos ensues. (Title drop.)
