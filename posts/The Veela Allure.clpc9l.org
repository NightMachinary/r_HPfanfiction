I was thinking about it, and was wondering what everyone's favorite version of Fleur's allure. And maybe we can get some recommendations of different versions? I dunno.

The one that sticks in my mind the most is the version from Cadmean Victory, where she can direct it, as well as suppress it (to a degree). I like that version well enough, though I don't think it's my preferred version.

The allure is one of those things that isn't super well defined in canon, and as such, can be played with a bit.

​

What are your favorites?


** The, by all appearances, canonical version, that is to say, that Veelas' seductive effect is not some abstract thing but a product of a magical dance they can perform, is actually my favorite; it's much less mundane and sterile a notion than "magical lust pheromones" as it's usually presented.

I don't think Fleur should /quite/ have it, though, however you write it; or at least, not to the same extent as a full-blooded Veela. People always forget she's only /quarter/-Veela.

*** I'm not a fan of allure-as-an-aura either, but considering Ron's behavior in canon ("I don't know what came over me") some magic seems to be involved. Harry also mentions her "turning on the old charm" although admittedly he might not know much about veela.

**** I never said there was no magic involved; I just don't think it should be an /aura/, but rather a /technique/, the result of magical dances and songs that Veelas can produce.

*** Same. It's something they can choose to do, not something that happens to them. Much less "Woe is me, unwillingly reduce every man near me into a slovering boy" "angst" and no "Oh, you are immune to my allure - you must be a worthy mate!" clichée.

*** That is true. I did forget to mention that one thing I liked from Cadmean Victory is that someone is either Veela, or isn't.

I'd be really interested to see a fic where the quarter part is explored, and how it's different for her. I tend to prefer fics where it's a major part of her arc, though I wouldn't be against it being a more minor, nuanced part of the story.

**** I don't recall in which of the /Artihmancer/ or /Animagus/ stories it was, but White Squirrel has Fleur and Gabrielle having /weak/ Veela abilities, such that they can only /partially/ shift into bird forms (they get feathers and talons but can't fly), for example.

For my part, I dislike her Veelaness being too big a part of Fleur's arc. She's not a Veela, she's a witch who happens to have some Veela ancestry in much the same way that Hagrid is part-Giant. It gives them some convenient abilities, but only in Dolores Umbridge's mind does this define them.

*** We never see male Veela and if Veela are a female only species then Fleur would have to be a full Veela with just one Veela grandmother because you can't actually have half or quarter Veela without male ones.

**** Veela are based on the Slavic myth of the Vila, which are a kind of nature spirit. It's possible that like dementors, boggarts, and poltergeists, Veela simply come into being in certain circumstances (and thereafter can reproduce biologically with other species, resulting in hybrid offspring). It's also possible that house-elves come into being in this manner, given the way they are described as "coming with" old houses.

There is a fun reference to the vila myth in GoF, when Fleur references how her wand has a strand of her grandmother's hair. In the myths, plucking hair from a vila is fatal to the vila.

***** Hm... it's an interesting thought --- certainly, within the bounds of your symbolic magic system, it does make some sense --- but as usual, I think you're thinking up your own concepts in your own frame of mind, and projecting them onto Rowling's world in a way that chafes more than a bit.

In this case, I really don't think "fleshy" creatures like Elves and Veelas are of the same nature as the "ghostly" Dementors and Poltergeists.

Those seem like they are in a very real sense /made/ of magic, possessing an /appearance/ and the ability to influence their surroundings somewhat, but not necessarily actual substance. Muggles' inability to see Dementors /could/, I suppose, be their having some sort of invisibility powers, but especially given their nature as mental parasites, I find it more likely that they simply project an image of themselves, an illusion powered by the wizard's own magic, but don't /actually/ look like /anything/ in a physical sense.

(The same reasoning easily extents to Boggarts, of course; and the movies did a great job of visualizing them as a blur of dust and magical energy, which takes shapes but not substance and is never quite /there/. As for Poltergeists, one assumes they work like Ghosts in that those without magic cannot see them, so once more it would seem like a wizard's own power is required to give them a semblance of visual existence.)

So it /is/ quite plausible that such entities, which are more sentient magical phenomena than organic creatures, could just come into being as a result of magical forces keyed to certain emotions swirling in one place for long enough.

Whereas Veelas, Elves, Goblins --- those are actually /there/, clearly enough, or there wouldn't be any plucked hairs to be used as wand core or stuffed heads to be nailed to walls. They are "different breeds of being", whose members all happen to be magical rather than having both Muggles and Wizards as in humankind, but that is the extent of their difference.

I think you're probably making too much of the "coming with old houses" line; I'd say it's just meant to emphasize the extent to which they are treated as property by the old families, the way in which one expects the house to come furnished with an enslaved Elf servant just how much as with running water and a stove.

***** There's no hard evidence, it's just a theory (and one I dislike, myself). We just don't see any male Veelas in canon. But then, neither do we see any female Goblins, and yet you don't see anyone arguing Goblins are a one-gender species.

******* Sure, but that's a rather late addition. The one-gender-Veelas theory predates the /FB/ films, so if people were coherent about this, they might as well have come up with a one-gender-Goblins theory then, too. But they didn't.

** Rather than a single "allure", Veela seem to have two distinct (beauty-related) powers in canon.

1. An enchantment, cast by dancing and singing, which causes men to want to impress them via doing very stupid things.

2. Extreme physical beauty.

There's no evidence of any kind of general "field" surrounding Veela which exerts a direct magical effect - see, for example, the way in which Mr Weasley was immune to the Veelas' enchantment in GoF because he blocked his ears. Nonetheless, he still enjoyed the show, which would cement the idea that a Veela's extreme physical attractiveness is separate from her magical enchantment.

There are two further observations I would make:

A. It would seem likely that a Veela's regular voice and body movements are able to have an effect like a lesser form of the full enchantment. E.g. a veela tossing her hair is particularly eye-catching. This would be most obviously seen in GoF when Fleur is said to have charmed Cedric - which I interpret as her acting flirtatiously and those actions having a magical effect which is like a lesser form of the song and dance.

B. Men have been observed to say stupid things around Veela even when they are not singing and dancing, or indeed saying anything at all. I suspect this is supposed to simply be a (humorous) depiction of men's typical behaviour around very beautiful women and not any kind of magical power.

As regards Harry, it is interesting to note that he was completely vulnerable to the first power (and it was Harry, not Ron, who was going to jump off the balcony to impress the Veela, something which a lot of Harmony fanfic attributes to Ron), but that he does not seem particularly prone to saying stupid things to very beautiful women (whereas Ron is vulnerable to both).
