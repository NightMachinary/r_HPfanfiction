** Magic you say? Well, my house is gonna spotless (except my office, because I need my PC for work and I ain't waving a wand around that. Likewise my lawn won't ever get too shaggy again. Oh, and thanks to the joys of that repair spell I'll never have to adjust the valve lash on my motorcycles again, for surely shim under bucket valves are the work of the devil.

Not really interested in world domination. I'll just keep working and enjoy the extra free time the magic gives me.

** I don't know why people keep saying this, but this just isn't true. The vast majority of people don't want to be dictators or start wars or kill people.

Not to mention, why would we /win/? You say we're a muggleborn - so we learn magic like all the other kids, why would us being MB mean we're capable of taking over the world? We're just another wizard, not some supervillain. All our abilities will easily be countered.

** The only way I think this kind of character (being evil without cause) is possible is if they don't think that their world is real. I know that I would certainly try to "take over the world" if I found myself in Harry Potter /game/. Then it's not people you are dealing with bit just NPCs.

** Wow, I have magic! How awesome, guess I'll have to go kill and terrorise a bunch of people until they worship me now!

Yeah, no. The reason most baddies have a motivations, is because if they didn't, then they wouldn't do what they do. Of course, I suppose your MC could be insane or something, but that doesn't really make a sympathetic character.

*** In the anime Katekyo Hitman Reborn, the villain Byakuran it's pretty much this type of character, one of his quotes is:"Now that i found out about this machical item im going to make full use of it... hmmm maybe i will also cause a genocide or mass destruction or things nonsesnse like this.

Byakuran is very charismatic in this anime, he sees the world as just a great game, he does't have any faith in the reality and thinks himself as just an NPC or a character in a play.

I like characters like these, Byakuran is clearly insane he destroyed a great number of Earths (With his power to travel and absorb power from paralel dimensions) but building someone like this is a double edged sword.

As you said villains must have motivations, Byakuran was one of the best well written villains that i've ever seen, but he was the only one with this line of thinking that became a great character.

** Honestly? No, I wouldn't really want to conquer the world. And just curious, but what does it matter if it's a Muggleborn trying to do so or not?

I'd rather use magic for doing cleaning, helping with cooking. If I'm smarter than that, I'd like to try my hand at healing or with potions to help people, though I'm not that smart, so I don't think I would make it.

It depends on the type of person, some people can handle power, perfectly fine. But if magic was common enough for there to be a magical society like in Harry Potter, most would just live normal lives.

** Even if we understand, say, it's possible to transfigure air into explosives or chain-imperio the whole world from one single spell (and assuming purebloods are so backward they also can't deduce those), we're not going to try to conquer the world.

For your MC to plan world-conquest simply because of understanding the existence of magic means they're already fucked up long before they know magic. They're already planning to become a nasty politician/rogue general/televangelist/straight-up terrorist for their world domination dream, and their reasoning is so flat (for the evulz), I don't think even talented writers can build something interesting from it.

** This makes me think of that one novel I read, the guy has super powers but everything is so normal. No evil organization, no secret society, just plain old go to work, get paid, live a mundane life except he just apparently have superpowers. He ends up making an 'evil' organization and a 'criminal' empire. That and he joins the 'heroes' to stop the 'villains'. I believe that he once thought he can be something more but regardless of his ability he is still normal. a modern retelling of Don Quixote, I believe.

** As the entire Auror company was getting closer, he could finally see Harry Potter's face, filled with tears.

"Why ? Why did you have to kill so many innocents ? What were your reasons ? I throught ... We were friends ..."

He took a deep breath, and finally explained the reasoning behind his actions : the reasons as to why he decided to put Britain through the fires of war again.

"Mate. It was a Saturday evening, I was bored, and I realised I had magic. Why wouldn't I try to take over the world ?"

** I have to say, after reading the comments, I'm disappointed. Y'all are forgetting that you discover magic at ELEVEN! Or earlier, if you're lucky with accidental magic becoming a bit controllable.

As an ELEVEN YEAR OLD KID what would you do about the bully at school? The cute girl who seems to like you? The teacher that just won't leave you alone?

And puberty? What male kid in the midst of puberty wouldn't abuse the heck out of magic to get every girl that even looked close to pretty into bed with him.

Or for the girls, to get their crush to actually pay attention to them as they DESERVE!

If High School doesn't make you want to take over the world to get rid of all the stupid people, you have led a VERY sheltered life.
