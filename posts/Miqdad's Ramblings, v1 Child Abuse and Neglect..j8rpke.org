Ok, let me start by saying that I know that this is fanfiction and you can do whatever you want, but I want to talk about /canonical/ abuse in fics. By that I mean fics that have abuse and use the justification 'canon had it too, we just didn't see it'. I'm going over verbal/emotional abuse and neglect, physical abuse, and sexual abuse.

Let's start with child neglect and verbal and emotional abuse. Let no one tell you that canon Harry was /not/ neglected or abused at all, because the way the Dursleys treated him was most definitely abuse. No normal child is belittled, forced to cook and clean, kept with a cupboard for a bedroom, given oversized clothes when the family can very well afford new ones, or locked up starved as punishment for messing up a business deal. This was abuse and was all present in canon.

Physical abuse is where the main problem starts. Canon did not have physical abuse (that we saw). I've seen a lot of people use the time when Petunia aimed a frying pan at Harry's head as proof that, at the very least, they did not care for his safety. I suppose they were somewhat callous with his safety and they did nothing to stop Dudley and his 'friends' from beating Harry up. There's also the fact that it's easier to do something bad if you can't see the effect (like the starvation of CoS) than do to something that you /can/ see the effect of (like beating someone up). This is the main focus of the book-by-book 'analysis' that took me all of five minutes, so stay tuned.

Sexual abuse is just... no. If you think there was sexual abuse in canon, you're probably a flat earther and moon landing conspiracy theorist as well. Again, fanfic=do what you want, but canon=*/NO/*

/Book 1/

The biggest problem Harry had with the Dursleys in PS/SS was that they forced him to cook and that Dudley was a pig in a wig who enjoyed Harry Hunting. That and the fact that they're nasty to Harry.

/Book 2/

I'm not an expert on abuse ( why am I writing this again?) so I can't say if starvation falls under physical abuse or neglect, but that was sus. THEY LOCKED HIM IN HIS ROOM WITH JUST TWO CANS OF COLD SOUP A DAY! So yes, this worries me, and if they do this in canon, I can see you making a case for slightly harsher punishments in fanfic. Once again though, it's easier to do something bad if you can't see the effect than do to something that you /can/ see the effect of.

/Book 3/

Harry blows up Aunt Marge (^{the dementors come and take charge!}) and, reading this for the first time at 10, this was the first moment I was /really/ worried about Vernon. He tries to get Harry to fix Marge and he is */LIVID/*. I genuinely felt like the moment Marge was down, Vernon would scream Surrey down and maybe even hit Harry. Then he runs and I breathe a sigh of relief. After that, no one cares because (^{the man's a wolf, the rat's a man, the prisoner is at large!}).

/Book 4/

Sirius exists now, and so Durses are scared. No probs this year.

/Book 5/

Harry was mourning Ced and wanted news for Voldy revelations. Durse said no and was doing the usual screaming whale-rus thing. So, more verbal abuse?

Yeah, I remember nothing. But, oh! The order threatened Durses because Harry was angsty, moody teen.

/Book 6/

Dumbledore threatens Dursleys again and Harry is no longer angst. No more Dursleys for the rest of the book, so...

/Book 7/

It's crazy how much this post fell apart at the end. The Durses are packed off to a safe house and now they're gone. Also, side note, /Snape was not the impostor./

So, I guess I'm saying verbal is canon and physical is really up to your interpretation. And so I end with a quick tl;dr

Verbal/Emotional/Neglect=Canon; Physical=maybe; Sexual=no


** Vernon strangles Harry in Ootp in the first chapter and only releases him when he receives a shock (his magic protecting him). I also vaguely remember Harry thinking something along the lines of him having learned to stay out of the way of Vernon's reach, but I can't remember the exact wording or the book

*** I was just about to make this same point. And you're right, it says in Half Blood Prince, "Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm's reach of his uncle whenever possible." And be sure to note that Harry was still scared to stand too close to his Uncle while Dumbledore was standing in the doorway. I'm not saying Harry was physically abused, but Harry was physically abused.

**** exactly! and ty for finding the quote. I also remembered this other moment in ootp and looked it up:

“You don't seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles; all they want is an OWL in Muggle Studies: Much more important is your enthusiasm, patience and a good sense of fun!” “You'd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,” said Harry darkly. “Good sense of when to duck, more like.”

So you know, there is some definite canonical proof that Harry was physically abused aside from his uncle strangling him and his aunt swinging at him with a pan, you don't learn how to duck or stay out of reach for nothing obviously

*** He actually traps him in a window.

"But he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed it tightly around his throat."

**** "(...)but he had barely staggered upright again when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat.

"Get off me!" Harry gasped; for a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle's sausage-like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand. Then, as the pain in the top of Harry's head gave a particularly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an electric shock some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew, making him impossible to hold."

It actually describes how he can't hold him anymore after the shock, his uncle was choking him

****** of course, but I'm saying that there is explicit evidence of physical abuse in the books aside from neglect/starvation/verbal abuse

  The biggest problem Harry had with the Dursleys in PS/SS was that they forced him to cook
#+end_quote

I want to say something concerning Harry's chores. I know that some fanfics like to compare Harry to a House Elf, but it doesn't really seem to be the case. In PS, Petunia only ask him to "look after the bacon" (though he is also fryind the eggs) because she is busy organizing the gifts for Dudley birthday, it doesn't seem to be an "usual" chores. As for CoS, he is only given a long list of chore as a punishment for scaring Dudley with the "M-word". For their daily lives, the Dursley seem to follow the logic "Out of eyes, out of mind" and are perfectly happy to ignore Harry.

I also want to add that Harry was raised in the 80's, where standards were different. I'm not saying that the Dursley were good parents (cause they were not), or that they were not abusive (cause they were), I'm just saying that outside of the "sleeping in the cupboard", I'm not sure an agent of the Child Protection Service would have any motive to put the Dursley in trouble, legally speaking. It was still the time of the "boys will be boys" after all.

** I don't know if I understand your point. Are you upset about the type of abuse used by fics? Is it? I mean canonical abuse will rarely be used because it means that Harry's personality will be the same, so the Dursleys need to be better or much worse for the protagonist's future personality to make sense for the author's story.....
