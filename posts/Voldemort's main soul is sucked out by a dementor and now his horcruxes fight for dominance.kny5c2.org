We know that Voldemort will be mortal when all of his phylacteries are destroyed, but what if Voldemort's wraith is sucked up and his soul containers are left over? This fic would take place right after Harry kills Quirrell and Voldemort flees to Albania. On the way, he comes across a dementor horde who eat him.

Later on Regulus Black (not dead) does a ritual to find the remaining horcruxes and unknowingly shatters the vessels hosting the souls when he tries to destroy them and frees them causing each soul to leave and find a body. Every month Regulus finds a horcrux and every month a new Voldemort is reborn is some gruesome manor. The shards, being somewhat smart, find one Death Eater or another and get their help. Fragmented clips of his years are set upon the world. Each maniacle and dead set on destroying the world along with any competitors.

Harry's horcrux starts getting more violent and begins to influence Harry in ways. Causing him to be more like Riddle. He will use his newfound cunning and ruthlessness to destroy the shards once and for all.


** I read the "fight for dominance" part literally, and pictured the diary beating on the locket, while the locket chain strangles the diadem. The cup angrily jumps and stomps on the pile. The ring pings off of the cup lip. Nagini hisses and coils around the writhing mass of metal and paper, squeezing ever tighter.

Harry approaches. The horcruxed items all break apart and swivel towards him. There is an ominous silence. The calm before the storm.

** Something like the "Brother Gaunt" story here: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15271581/chapters/36212658]])? Starts with the other Hocruxes waking up after the diary is destroyed.

** I would assume the Diary would win since it contains half of his soul, while the rest of the Horcruxes contain 1/4, 1/8, etc.

**** No. The books only say that creating a Horcrux involves splitting your soul. Whether it's in equal parts or whether it's just a relatively small piece you take in order to anchor yourself to life, it's not stated and it's up to the authors.

**** I would assume so since the diary was his first Horcrux, so half his soul would go into it when it was made. Then half of the amount of soul he had left residing in his body would leave every time a new Horcrux is made.

***** Assumption then? Then wouldn't that mean Voldemort was operating on a half less of a soul? I'm not sure how it works, but I'm sure the dark magic involved wouldn't be so destructive and Voldemort wouldn't willingly hack off such large portions of himself just to be immortal. I'm not sure how the soul retains information. If Voldemort had much less soul after all his removals, his was he so powerful?

****** The idea that you can in any way quantify a soul is ridiculous, especially to that level.

** Yes! I was waiting for a story like this for some time.\\
With a couple of little notes:\\
- I don't care if it was Regulus - it would be even better without randomly resurrecting a dead man. The death of the main soul could trigger some safeguard that woke all the other souls.\\
- Not crack! Or maybe, there should be one short, humorous story. However, I'd love to see a long fic with Voldemort in an epic fight with his younger and saner/older and more knowledgeable clones, a story done completely seriously, showing his genius.\\
- Does Harry need to win? Is Potter even necessary for this story to work? I would prefer an epilogue, where one of the Horcruxes wins, but only because he was sane and in spite of being a psychopath, knowing his history, seeing defeats of his clones, he decided to do everything he needed to succeed, while more or less obeying the letter of law.
