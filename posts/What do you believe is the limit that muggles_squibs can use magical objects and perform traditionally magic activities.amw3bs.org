Essentially,could muggles brew potions use floo etc.

Potions:I would say they can to a degree.Some potions seemingly have no need for a wand as Snape says,but canonically at least some potions like Felix Felicis need spells.

Floo:I don't see why not.As kids and the elderly can use them why not muggles?

Brooms:This is a tough one.We never got confirmation if brooms were just enchanted or channeled magic.I'm leaning to no.

Thestrals:They most likely can't see them.It is specifically shown that squibs can see dementors while muggles can't.


** I've read some fics in which brewing any potion requires infusing the concoction with the brewers own magic while stirring in order to shape the reactions taking place. I like that fanon idea, so I'd say squibs/muggles can learn the process of brewing, but they can't personally make any potions.

I've seen some fics in which the Knight Bus exists because Squibs, the infirm, etc. /can't/ floo. I like that world-building idea, but I could see either possibility making sense.

Regarding brooms: I always got the impression that the enchantments on a broom tap into the rider's magic and intent, and that's why kids are taught to use the "Up" command in their first lesson. If that's the case then muggles wouldn't be able to use a broom at all, and maybe only 'easy' brooms would work for squibs.

I agree that muggles wouldn't be able to see thestrals, but do the books actually show that squibs can see dementors? In book 5 Mrs. Figg seemed to just be repeating a vague description that she'd heard/read.

*** Yeah as far as I can tell Mrs. Figg's visual description was not witnessed first-hand, but the sensation she described was real. Consistent with Mugges/Squibs not /seeing/, but still /feeling the effects of/ Dementors.

*** If squibs couldn't see dementors someone would probably contradict her.The minister of magic himself would most likely have someone check that fact if he himself did not know squibs could see dementors.

**** Judging by Fudge's actions in the books, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person who fact checks anything unless he is prompted to by his advisers.

In the books squibs seem to be viewed as something shameful that doesn't get talked about (Filch's attitude when he thinks he is found out). I wouldn't be surprised if most wizards and witches don't know how squibs are different and/or there is a lot of widely believed misinformation (Filch vainly trying to learn magic through the 'Kwikspell' course.)

  Arabella Figg never saw the Dementors that attacked Harry and Dudley, but she had enough magical knowledge to identify correctly the sensations they created in the alleyway.

JKR had this to say. This could mean she simply arrived too late to see them, but [[http://web.archive.org/web/20110713111531/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=19][given the context]], I think it means she just can't see them.

** Potions are a form of magic. Muggles cannot do magic. Therefore Muggles cannot make potions.

Muggles can chop and stir and follow instructions. Muggles may even be able to gain access to inherently magical ingredients if they know a wizard*.

But Muggles can also correctly pronounce incantations and make wand movements. They may even be able to gain access to an inherently magical wand, if they know a wizard. That does not mean they can cast spells.

As with spells, so too with potions. And while we're at it, so also with occlumency and apparition. Being able to go through the physical and mental motions of performing a piece of magic does not mean that a non-magical person can do magic.

*Though it's a common fanon error that potions are made from exclusively magical ingredients; in fact the vast majority of ingredients we see are ordinary plants/animal parts.

With respect to squibs, they are magically identical to Muggles. Mrs Figg wasn't able to see the Dementors; she lied in Harry's hearing. This was confirmed by JKR on her website, but in any event it was heavily implied from the text, as Harry himself notes that her description of a Dementor's appearance sounded like she'd got it from a book.

** In regards to travel, my headcanon has always been that floo/brooms/portkeys are all usable by muggles because the magic is in the object. Brooms are risky for muggles/squibs because they don't have that magical healing factor, but in my mind, parents of muggleborns use floo powder and portkeys without issue.

For potions, I could see simple potions getting all their magic for the ingredients, but I could also see an argument for any potion making requiring some innate magic that ties the ingredients' magic together
