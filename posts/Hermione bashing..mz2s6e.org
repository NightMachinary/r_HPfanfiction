I don't care what you give me I just want fics where hermione suffers, I don't redemption arcs or anything I just want to see her suffer.


** Suffer, or is her being relegated to a side character ok? I can't really read too much bashing with no basis in canon. This fic does have a very side character Hermione tho.

** Short but (un)sweet: Broken by StarsandSunkissed linkffn(13318530) Also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346][on AO3]].

The main story is slash in this one: The Games They Play by DebsTheSlytherinSnapeFan linkffn(11321032) Also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4167129][on AO3]].

She's an object of ridicule in For the Right Price by Hi Pot in Noose (sequel in progress). The other students literally scream and run away when they see her. linkffn(9894129) Also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2337458][on AO3]].

Do Not Meddle in the Affairs of Wizards by Corwalch, she won't keep her nose out of Harry's business and he extracts a price for it. linkffn(4816968)

Simple Words by JackPotr (one-shot). linkffn(9990409) The same author has another story called Too Late to Apologize that I thought would fit, but it turns out I remembered it as harsher than it is: she gets forgiven in that one (although she doesn't get Harry).

  Point of deviation: Harry's primary school taught Home Economics. Harry's not going to let the wonders of magic take away his common sense, and if he can get a good deal, he's going to take it. Meanwhile, money is fun, but magic is funner. AU

  Harry was sent to Azkaban after being framed for murder in the beginning of his 6th year at Hogwarts. While there, he unlocks the "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not". What will happen once his former friends know he's innocent? Watch the fun.
