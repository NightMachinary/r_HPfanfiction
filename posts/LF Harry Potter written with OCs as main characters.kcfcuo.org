I'm looking for any fics where the main character is an OC who is experiencing the 1991-1998 school year alongside Harry & co. They can be in any house, any pairing, etc. Thanks!

edit: no self insert/reader insert please


** Main character is an OC and there are several other supporting (and not so supporting) OC's. Story centers around OC's but intertwines nicely with the cannon story/characters and adds depth to several canon side characters.

Edit: oops, the ao3 link did the fourth book for some reason

  Emma was just a normal orphan living her life the best she could in an unassuming children's home. While she had her struggles nothing could have prepared her for the world she was about to enter. Will her new world give her the answers and life she's longed for, or will her mysterious past finally catch up with her and thrust her into a destiny years in the making?

** I don't know how much you'll like it but in my WIP there's two OCs that are very close to Harry, pretty much his surrogate family. You can check it out if you'll like and tell me what you think!

** The OC here is a bit older than Harry, she's in Fred and George's year but they develop a close relationship and it's written really well. Linkffn(So Close to Magic)

You could also try Linkao3(Rose Petal Red) which is sort of a SI/OC who is Ginny's twin and has all the knowledge from the books but it comes at a huge price. The writing is really good and the story is quite in depth, though it is on hiatus at the moment, though hopefully the writer will return to it soon.
