...But the female time-traveller is someone other than Hermione or fem!Harry. It can be to the future, to the past, have multiple time-travellers, I just want some good fics where female characters time-travel.

** The Best I've read that fits this is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5846417/1/Choices][Choices by Aebbe]]. It's a Lily Luna time travel fic and it's REALLY well done. Esp for a next gen fic which are usually not great imo. Linkffn(5846417)

  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out. (Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone)

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
