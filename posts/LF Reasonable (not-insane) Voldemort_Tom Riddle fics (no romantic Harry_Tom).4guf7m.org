  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** Prince of the Dark Kingdom by Mizuni-Sama. Voldemort wins, Harry ends up being his protege (but doesn't agree with him generally). Best characterization of Voldemort around, bar none.

Voldemort is still evil, but he's very reasonable, rational, and intelligent. He has his own ideology (which is a bit more than the standard one), and he's prepared to go to any ends to achieve it.

He selects Harry for his parselmouth abilities, and decides to take him as a protege partly as a propaganda piece. Harry has a complicated relationship with him, never fully agreeing with his ideals, but because of his position is targeted by anti-Voldemort wizards, which helps keep him apart from them ideologically.

Has some weird slashy undertones early on, but they never involve Voldemort (just Weasely twins/Harry, though it never goes far) and they disappear quickly.

As a Seven-book AU, it's quite long, but definitely worth it. There's a unique plot to each one, great development of OC's, a really interesting political situation, and a interesting magical setup.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest of places...even in your own head. Yes, Lord Voldemort killed his parents, but he was also Harry's first teacher, confidant, and friend - and you don't abandon your friends. A coming of age story that follows Harry from his cupboard under the stairs to...well, spoilers.

*** /Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of/ [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=malicious+obedience][*/Malicious Obedience/*]] :

--------------

#+begin_quote
  The Modus Operandi adopted by those who work for people convinced of their own infallible decision-making prowess, where one gleefully does what they're told, even though they know it's misguided, and waiting for the moment when it all blows up in their supervisor's face. The precursor to schadenfreude. Term introduced on the Handyman for the Common Man web-only TV show.

/Trev: âI have pledged them my full and complete malicious obedience. It'll be a disaster, fo' shizzle.â/
