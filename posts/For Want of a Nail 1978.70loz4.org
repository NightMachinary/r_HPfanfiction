It's a pretty simple premise! Instead of being born on July 31st in 1980, Harry's born on the same day in 1978. Instead of befriending Ron and Hermione, Harry instead becomes fast mates with the infamous twinly duo, Fred and Goerge, and oddly enough Cedric Diggory. Gifted with two years of peaceful learning and humorous adventures, Harry becomes his own type of wizard before ever being thrust into danger.

This little happening actually carries a good bit of complications when thought about. First, Neville's parents wouldn't be tortured - and Ron and Hermione wouldn't be all that close with Harry. Not only that, but Harry would have actual time to learn and explore his talents in magic like a proper student should whilst having fun with his three best friends who challenge him in their own unique ways.

Not only this, but the other students would actually get to know Harry before anything really went down - so there would be those stuck by his side when crap went down.

If anyone wants to write this, they could change events at their leisure! No need to write all through each year of school - or if they want, they could. It was just an interesting idea I thought up last night and figured I would share. Thought it might make a good story.


** linkffn(What You Leave Behind by Newcomb)

Probably the best example of this premise. Sadly hasn't been updated in two years (get off your ass Newcomb!)

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

** There are alot of those I think. They're mostly on WBWL(Wrong Boy-Who-Lived) stories. The closest I can think of is this:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7353678/1/Fraterculus][Fraterculus]] - bloodsox88 - Harry is not the BWL, his brother is. He's two years older. I can't remember if Nev's parents are alright but I remember Bellatrix is free here so they probably are. Harry also befriends the twins. And his brother, who is born in 1980, is friends with Hermione. linkffn(7353678)

** I don't want to read some WBWL - I would like it to be Harry - with caring friends who are intelligent and won't abandon him. I think it would be nice if Harry was actually a slightly normal kid, got to figure out who he was, and learn his place in the world.

I mean think about it - he was abused, then he learnt he was a wizard, his parents killed by an insane warlord, and the person who killed them is coming back - oh, and he kills a professor too, at ELEVEN. All within what, a year?

** Hmm... this raises the question of who Harry would have married, since Hermione, Ginny, and Luna would have all been out of his social circle. I'd say the prime candidates are probably Angelina, Fleur, or Cho.
