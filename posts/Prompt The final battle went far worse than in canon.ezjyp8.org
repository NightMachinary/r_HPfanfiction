It would be interesting to explore Harry post DH only in the final battle everything just goes to shit. Hermione and Ron are dead. So are Remus, Tonks, all the Weasleys, Neville, McGonagall, Dobby, Hedwig, a ton of named and unnamed characters. Plus about 1/4 of the human Death eaters were imperiused into helping. What would happen to Harry if when he returns from limbo to be with his friends and family he discovers that they are all dead?

Will he go dark? Will he get depressed and try to kill himself (turns out MoD can't die :/)? Will he become a Hermit in Albania? It's up to you.

*** Cheers.

Hey I'm really confused why my post got downvoted. Do you have any idea why it might?

**** No good reason, but it happens all the time here. This is honestly one of the most fickle subs that I follow. People downvote shit that they don't want to read rather than just ignoring it and moving on.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald
