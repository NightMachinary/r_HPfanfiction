I can totally see Xenophilius naming his werewolf daughter after the moon. And this ailment would certainly play into her loneliness and alienation from the rest of the school. Are there any decent fics exploring this?

If not, might have to write one myself....

*** I loved reading this! it really is a cool and flushed out AU. Poor harry in the middle of everything.

Luna is a werewolf, and the werewolf's in the story are really cool to read about.

*** For the OP's request I don't recall reading a story with Luna being a werewolf though I have read a story with her being a wolf animagus (Don't Look Back in Anger by Robst)

For your request try A Werewolf and A Veela Walk into a Pub by Ares.Granger where Harry protecting Hermione gets bitten by lupin.

Just for the reference it is linkffn(11279476). I was surprised how little is this idea used, it seems to me so obvious point of divergence that I am surprised more authors didn't try it.
