Are there any fanfics where harry becomes a dementor or half dementor? Thanks


** I played with an idea years ago where the trio use the cliche animagus potion only to realise the potion turns them into their antithesis. Harry becomes a Dementor, Hermoine a Basilisk, and Ron becomes an Acromantula. It never got anywhere because I'm not much of a writer.

*** Why would a Basilisk be antithesis-Hermione? Do the books turn into stone and crumble underneath her gaze?

**** It seems like they picked the creature that hurt or bothered each the most. Personally I would have turned her into a troll. Much better fit as her antithesis.

***** Antithesis probably isn't the correct word for what I was thinking of, and a Troll-Hermione is a great idea.

Some more idea's I was playing with:

- Harry becoming a Dementor changes his ability to draw people to him from charisma to literal soul sucking.

- Harry would develop an affinity for decay, particularly rotting curses which would lead him stealing a grimoire from the Greengrass Family, becoming nihilistic.

- The reason Harry would steal from the Greengrass Family is because they were known as the Gangrenous Family of dark wizards in the past.

- Hermione becoming a Basilisk makes her more cold blooded, more ruthless, and more vengeful. Heightening those aspects of her character until she resembles a Lawful Evil Dragon from D&D.

- Ron would become a /Chessmaster/, seeing people as pawns. to be used and discarded. Talk about everything with chess metaphors.

- Ron would eventually develop ambition, become a mob boss. Ron wouldn't loose his appetite and would eventually develop a taste for human flesh as a convenient way of disposing of bodies.

*** Interesting idea, but I don't think it's possible for an Animagus to have the form of another sapient creature.

**** Animagus forms also seem to be always non-magical. I figured gaining powerful forms would be part of why the trio would would use to potion. To gain power, not realising the consequences to there souls.
