For those of you who haven't seen the results of the Subreddit Survey linked by [[/u/Taure]] in the original thread, you can find the google generated results here: [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYMNDRP6c1RoIYjeyMnvmr6oDyAfKmTlrOMWtcWu-zkXJSHA/viewanalytics]]

Since [[/u/Taure]] was kind enough to send me a link to the dataset and it seems like the response rate for the survey has died down mostly, I put together and made charts of the results for each question grouped by gender along with a few other graphs here and there. The results are super interesting, there are some big differences between genders on some of the responses!

Some interesting observations on fanfiction questions:

- The [[http://imgur.com/yuqeZXx][favorite character]] table in particular has a lot of differences! It seems like guys are way more likely to have Harry as their favorite character (26% of men like Harry the most vs 9% of women), along with Dumbledore (11% vs. 2%) and Luna (17% vs 8%). Women are more likely to have Hermione as their favorite (22% vs 11%), Snape (15% vs. 3%) and Draco (8% vs 0%).

- For [[http://imgur.com/jIV2YKt][least favorite character]], while Umbridge is universally disliked (~50% did not like her), Snape and Draco are the least popular among males (9% of males had Snape as least favorite character vs 3% of females, 8% of males had Draco vs 2% of females). Umbridge and Ginny are slightly less popular among females (55% vs 46%, 5% vs 2%).

- As a bonus table, I also grouped [[http://imgur.com/7SaaXv1][favorite character graph by age]] to see if age affects people's favorite characters. Women older than 23 like Snape more than younger women (26%of older women like Snape the most vs of 12% of younger women). Dumbledore and Lord Voldemort are surprisingly more popular among both younger women and men. Ginny is slightly more popular with older women and slightly more popular with younger men.

- [[http://imgur.com/aCassiu][Slash fics]] are not surprisingly way more popular among females (71% vs 18%), with Draco being by far the most popular pairing among females, but femslash is equally popular among both genders (53% vs. 52%)! I separated the [[http://imgur.com/5Nl7SSC][results by sexual orientation]], 90% of straight guys do NOT read slash, while only 32% of straight women do NOT read slash. 50% of straight men read femslash vs. 35% of straight women read femslash.

- Some other big differences are in [[http://imgur.com/ZsXFC87][the pairing preferences:]] Harry-Ginny pairing is more popular among females (33% vs 18%), while guys seem to like Harry-Daphne (16% vs 3%) or Harry Fleur (14% vs 2%).

- Men are more likely to like Goblet of Fire book and women are more likely to accept things as canon.

Observations on the demographics questions:

- [[http://imgur.com/mZiPVHl][Age question]]. There are more women between 23 and 30 (48% of women are 23-30yrs vs. 36% of men), while there are slightly more men between 19 and 22 (40% vs. 33%). The difference of ages is less though when broken down by younger and older than 23yrs old. 56% of women are more than 23 years old vs. 47% of men.

- [[http://imgur.com/tj8F3IS][Relationship status.]] Women are more likely to be in a relationship (69% of men are single vs 40% of women)

- [[http://imgur.com/RszhgoB][Sexual orientation]]. 85% of men said they were straight vs. 62% of women

- [[http://imgur.com/iTZEFAD][Work industry]]. Men more likely to be working in IT, women more likely to be working in retail, education, health and arts.

Observations on the political questions:

- [[http://imgur.com/yfqb9z8][Feminist question]] 80% of women identify as a feminist vs 44% of men.

- [[http://imgur.com/JjYe0g6][Political position]]. Women are more left leaning (67% of women left/far left vs. 47% of men)

- [[http://imgur.com/p55SrcH][President question]]. Women more likely to vote for Clinton (66% of women vs. 49% of men)

*** I did click, but that is because the question said canon not headcanon. I can see why people have problems though

I think we should have had an option to not accept the epilogue, that would have made a huge difference. I know that the books, interviews and pottermore are canon according to Rowling, but at what point is the author dead? I can't agree with Hermione always being black, because that requires the sort of race blindness certain conservatives claim to possess. She could be, yes, but at no point does she feel like she's written that way.

Personally, I didn't like how the books went from 4 onwards, so books 1-3 are more canon for me than 4-7. If people dislike Cursed Child, I figure the others are fair game.

Voldemort was just not compelling enough for a seven book series, back then I was wishing he'd die and someone else would take over as the antagonist. The books just dragged, after PoA imo.

**** Cursed Child will likely be performed for years to come with multiple casts. Some of the Hermiones will be black, others won't. I don't think there was ever a serious claim that the actress being black meant Hermione was black. The claim made by supporters of the casting decision was simply that a character who was white in the books could be played without a problem by a black woman in a play.

***** My bad. You're right about that not being a serious claim, I just jumped to that conclusion.

She certainly can be played by actresses of other races, but saying the skin colour was never specified, and this means that she could be read as black is inadequate when the element of race is missing in the characterization. She can be interpreted as black, but the retroactive claims of Rowling in this case hold no more weight than that of anyone else.

  ‘One moment, please, Macnair,' came Dumbledore's voice. ‘You need to sign, too.' The footsteps stopped. Harry heaved on the rope. Buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little faster.

  Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree.

  ‘Harry, hurry!' she mouthed.
#+end_quote

There's a bunch of other circumstantial evidence that adds up to it being pretty strongly indicated that Hermione was written as white in the original books.

But of course none of this impacts on whether other interpretations of the character can be black.

I was shocked too. Finally, this proves what I was suspecting all along.. Just another form of secret patriarchy by males who completely dismiss JK Rowling's books as 'irrational'. Why , because you are creative enough to have created them yourself if she hadn't? Jesus Christ, have some respect or don't call yourself a fan. But apparently that is too difficult for 56% of men.

Its curious that many people sticking to the definition of feminism in their arguments, call themselves Equalists or Egalitarian. When asked why, they often say something along the line of "I really don't wanna be compared to Sarkeesian/Blogger X who said Y".

So, bottomline, many people /are/ feminists in the defined sense of the word, but people don't want to /identify/ with some of the feminists standing in the limelight. Which brings us back to the reason why many people said "no, I'm not a feminist" on the survey.

My kneejerk reaction to anyone saying "I am not a feminist" is basically to think of those crazies who want to repeal the 19th amendment or the ones who justify sexual harassment or rape as the victim "asking for it." So it's not just the extremist feminists who are tainting the argument. Times like that sticking to the official definition helps keep things simple.

If you answered 'yes' to both of those questions, you're a feminist. It doesn't have to be a bad thing, you know. The definition I posted here is the definition found in the dictionary. The question on the survey wasn't "Do you agree with the popular perception of feminism?" it was "are you a feminist."

***** Without trying to take a side, I'd like to add that dictionaries don't hold /definitions/ of words. Dictionary editors are historians, not arbitrators - they write down the way a word has been used recently, and track its changes over time (e.g. the misuse of the word 'literal' has now been added to some dictionaries as a valid use). If a word is used in a certain way, that's the word's meaning, and online (especially in some parts of the Internet, including a lot of reddit) the implicit meaning of 'feminist' is more than just the dictionary definition, even if irl it's still the same as the dictionary definition.

So, in the setting of 'online reddit questionnaire', asking whether someone self-identifies as a feminist /is/ a loaded question. Also, I recently read this really interesting essay called [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/04/the-ideology-is-not-the-movement/][The Ideology is not the Movement]] which, although it doesn't talk about feminism specifically, is a very thought-provoking discussion on how groups form around core beliefs. I think you might enjoy it.

That's not quite what the definition says, though. It doesn't just say "a belief in equality", it defines it as advocacy of *women's* rights as a result of that belief. If one believes that despite their many advantages over women, men also suffer in certain areas of life and deserve advocacy, then feminism is insufficient. Or at least, this definition of it is. It doesn't permit advocacy of both men's and women's rights in pursuit of equality, just women's.

** Some of the numbers surprise me - mainly the fact that it shows a majority of male HPFF fans, when in /every/ other HP forum I have used (apart from DLP which seems to be exclusively male) the bias is massively the other way. So I really think this survey is more a survey of reddit users who like to do reddit surveys than it is of HPFF fans.

That aside, I was surprised to see that most people say they positively like fics which aren't Harry-centric when the vast majority of recs on here are for exactly that. And are there really only three or four users between the age of 51 and 60?

So It doesn't really add up with what I can see for myself. These things are fun I suppose, but I wouldn't take it too seriously.

*** All of reddit is mostly full of guys. I'm actually surprised that there are even 40% or so women on this subreddit. The survey (as I understand it) is specifically about the subreddit members, not the HP fanfiction fandom as a whole, and so it's expected to have more guys than average.

The vast majority of fics are Harry-centric, ime. That those are then also the most recommended isn't surprising at all. I absolutely love very AU stories like linkffn(Wit of the Raven), but there are very few of them and so I'm more likely to post story links for fics that are more common, despite enjoying them less.

There are probably more than 3-4 users over 50. Normally a survey like this is useful as a sample, and you can scale up from the number of participants to the number of regular users to get a rough idea of how many people of which ages actually use the subreddit.

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

Now that's interesting. I had no idea, though admittedly I hadn't thought about it before. I suppose I had assumed that because HPFF generally is female-dominated, that this forum would be too. Perhaps that explains why it feels more confontational on here than on other forums. It's the testosterone.

** I don't find it surprising that men don't like Snape and Draco, but now it frustrates me that I do like Luna, Daphne and Fleur. Also interesting is how Daphne is barely a character at all, and Fleur a side character... No comment. I used to like Harry and I thought Dumbledore was an interesting character, but seeing as many use Harry as a blank slate anyway I guess I don't like his fanfiction version much... Oh and I don't care much about Dumbledore anymore either.
