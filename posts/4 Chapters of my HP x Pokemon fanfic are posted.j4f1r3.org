4 chapters are up. All of the pre-Hogwarts set up is done. Next chapter Harry goes to Hogwarts. It is a work in progress. I would be really grateful if you guys could read it and offer some suggestions. The link is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13707669]]


** Bro, I got to chapter 2 so far, and I found this quote:

#+begin_quote
  A five kg bag of regular pokemon food was 10 pounds
#+end_quote

And I gotta tell you, it's 11 pounds. 2.2 lbs / 1 kg.

Yes, yes, the british use pounds as money. But that one line just thwacked me in the funny bone and I had to comment.

*** LOL. I should fix the "pounds" with a £ sign. That is the correct way to do it anyways. It's just that searching for the £ symbol on the keyboard, breaks the flow of typing. I am glad someone enjoyed my inadvertent mistake.
