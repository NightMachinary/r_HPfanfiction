:FlairText: What's That Fic?

I posted this a while ago and actually got a step in the right direction, I figure everyone being home is a great time to get more.

  tl;dr They're playing like, truth or dare. I can't remember if it went around the circle or if it was more a spin the bottle type thing. I remember pairings were Harry + Hermione (sort of) and Neville + Hannah, and there was at least 1 other playing (Pretty sure it was Susan). Ron was ostracized. I might be confusing FF's but i think Ginny had given Harry a love potion and Ron and defended her so that was why both were out of the picture? It spent like, 1 sentence on it lol. IIRC Harry or Hermione sit in the others lap for a portion of it from a dare, and the final truth was either Hannah or Neville agreed to do it in the first place in order to admit to the other they were into bondage or something?

  It felt SUPER wholesome though, like an actual bunch of high school friends having fun on the nsfw side as opposed to a smut fic.

Here's the thing. Someone last thread recommended Spin by cannoncansodoff. This is definitely not it, there's a few events different, but primarily the writing is just more explicitly "this is a smut fic," and how the author writes is different enough even having not read the one I'm looking for in years i'm 100% confident it's not the one. BUT, general events mirroring it almost exactly aside, there's a few lines that are close enough there's no way that the one I'm looking for wasn't plagiarized from this or vice versa. So if you read Spin and think "Wow that sounds like this fic I read once" I'd appreciate you pointing me in that direction, cheers!

  She goes quite still, aware of every movement, of every breath. Everything hangs in the air for one soul-shattering second.She knows what will happen if she moves. She craves it. She fears it.

  Fed up with two of the Golden Trio stubbornness towards their feelings their fellow Years mates and a certain Ravenclaw hatch a plan to open their eyes. Get ready to join ten teens as they dare to play Eros and Psyche. Rated M for a reason. AU story. Light Ron and Ginny Bashing. Most likely Harry/Multi. Sexual situations, language, and other things.
