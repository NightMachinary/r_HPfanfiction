So this the First Fanfic I write, the idea came to me after watching DH Pt. 2 and looking for two hours [[http://lily-fox.deviantart.com/art/In-another-life-wake-up-243813421][at this picture]]

I wrote the prologue which doesn't make sense with the description but tomorrow i'll write the proper chapter one, which starts at Snape and Lily's sorting ceremony or maybe at the hogwarts express not sure yet.

the general idea is that Severus 'choses' to be in Gryffindor (just as Harry chose not to be in Slytherin) just to be with Lily he would of course crash with the marauders, in the begining but warm up to them after they change his attitude.

I would love to you guys to critique this tell me how much it sucks or something.

** At first i was like aww, then I got to the last panel and was like "what, pancakes? who has pancakes for breakfast?" immersion broken. I'll read your prologue, when i get home from work.

** Its a bit jumpy in places needs a bit of smoothing out. As a prologue theres not much of a 'hook' to get me reading, might have a look after a couple of chapters
