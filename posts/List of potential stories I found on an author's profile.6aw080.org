** The last one is similar to linkffn(The Art of Self Fashioning). Harry and Neville switched places and Harry is trying to give his parents sanity back.

Also similar to linkffn(Too young to die). WBwl dark Harry wants to resurrect his sister whose death he blames his parents for.

I've seen one like the betrothed Harry/Daphne but can't really recall anything from it, it was kinda terrible.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

** Not exactly anything new in there, though some of them have some detail that could make a story.

I can see the "Choose Lady Potter" to be a fun fic if handled right. I'd love to see it as a comedy bit. I only know of one fic where Harry gets told by Neville whats what with these contracts and it end up being a godawful "wizard-society" thing.

Harry / Voldemorts daughter... I'm sure this exists a thousandfold, but only as "My Immortal" bullshittery.

  â€¢Harry/Daphne AU where the Tri-Wizard Torunament is used to select apprentices for the Wizard Council that rules the wizarding world.
#+end_quote

This maybe without Daphne. Frankly, any half-decent worldbuilding/AU fic is good in my book.
