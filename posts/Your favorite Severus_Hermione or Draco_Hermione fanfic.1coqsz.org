I've read a ton of them and I'm looking for new ones to read. I would love to have your input on Severus/Hermione or Draco/Hermione fanfics that you have read and liked. Rating doesn't matter, although I do lean towards the more mature ratings.


** [[http://www.obscurusbooks.org/html/Hayseed/Thursdays/index.html][Getting the Hang of Thursdays]], by Hayseed (No rating provided; I think it was about a PG-13, though it's been a few years since I read it so could be a little more, but definitely not NC-17)

#+begin_quote
  A good day goes bad and then gets far worse than Severus could ever have imagined. Again and again and again.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/hayseed/OP.html][Ordinary People]], by Hayseed ([[http://www.obscurusbooks.org/html/Hayseed/OrdinaryPeople/index.html][Alternate Link]]) (PG-13)

#+begin_quote
  How do ordinary people cope with their extraordinary circumstances? A SS/HG romance that strives for realism.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2230284/1/][Unfinished Business]], by Ramos (M)

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger dies in a potions accident during her final year at Hogwarts. She's not thrilled when she comes back as a ghost, and really not happy at the idea of spending eternity haunting Severus Snape's classroom.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.witchfics.org/fr/index.html][The Fire and the Rose]], by MetroVampire & Rhosymedre (NC-17)

#+begin_quote
  A Snape/Hermione body-swap fic.

  #+begin_quote
    /Sorry that's all there is to give. It's been about eight years since I read it and it was only the once, but I recently came across it again and remembered really enjoying it so set it aside to read later, but I don't remember enough to give a more detailed summary and the author's don't provide much of one either unfortunately.)/

** I don't read D/H anymore, but SS/HG is my OTP, so I have quite a few to recommend:

[[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=2345][His Draught of Delicate Poison]] by Subversa (PG-13). I return to this fic time and time again. One of the few Marriage Law fics I like.

#+begin_quote
  In the wake of the Final Battle, the Order has opened Headquarters to house its youngest members during a summer of Ministry-sponsored social events. With Snape as a chaperone, and engaged to another woman, the advent of a busy Hermione, determined to see her friends in love-matches, can only be a recipe for disaster.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.scribd.com/doc/124084162/The-Lioness-Prophecies-by-AMR][The Lioness Prophecies]] by Amr. Not really much smut, but a really awesome story.

#+begin_quote
  On Valentine's Day of Harry Potter's sixth year, a new prophecy is heard which suggests that Severus Snape's marriage may offer great help in the war against Voldemort. Albus Dumbledore decides to take action to ensure that the prophecy comes about.
#+end_quote

Also by Amr, Snape's Boon. I can't find a link as the website it was on was deleted, but I'm sure someone somewhere has a copy if you request it.

If you like smut with really awesome plot, I'd really recommend [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=1480][In Annulo]] by ladyofthemasque (NC-17).

#+begin_quote
  It began with a letter, and a secret. Was it madness to trust? Was it a secret salvation? Or was it all just lying on a ring, in the end...?
#+end_quote

I also like Phantom of the Opera, and Good_Witch's [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=12772&i=1][Phantom of Hogwarts]] (NC-17) rather cleverly combines the two without making it a crossover.

#+begin_quote
  How in the world does Hogwarts come to be doing a performance of The Phantom of the Opera? And just why is Snape so pissed about it?
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1024910/1/][Hinge of Fate]] by Ramos (M) is the first SS/HG fic I read, and I remember liking it, but it's been years since I've read it.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione cannot remember, and Severus cannot forget.
#+end_quote

You can also find a huge reclist of SS/HG fics [[http://harmony-bites.livejournal.com/59308.html][here]].

Happy reading!

** Severus/Hermione is my favorite ever!!

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1839798/1/Kitten][Kitten]] - "Hermione is turned into a kitten with a potion gone wrong. What happens when Severus Snape finds her and not knowing that she really is a student keeps her as a pet?" cutsie and sweet

Heart over Mind([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1215092/1/Heart-over-Mind][www.fanfiction.net/s/1215092/1/Heart-over-Mind]]) - "Something odd about Hermione causes her to have unexpected reaction to a love potion. Only it's one which no one expected. How could a lack of reaction cause so much trouble?" i was obsessed with this one for the longest time, very well written. i love how their relationship and dialog develop throughout the story

Sweet Teeth[[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1063178/1/Sweet-Teeth]]] - an amazingly naughty, funny and sexy fic.

And some good Hermione/Draco

Brown Eyes Grey Eyes ([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1063718/1/Brown-Eyes-Gray-Eyes][www.fanfiction.net/s/1063718/1/Brown-Eyes-Gray-Eyes]]) - "Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy are asigned together for a Care of Magical Creatures project. The problem is, they can't stand each other. Or they think they can't..." very good, old school fan fic
