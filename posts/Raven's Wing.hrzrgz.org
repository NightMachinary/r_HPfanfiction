:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It isn't really a fic, per se. But it was a prompt somewhere. I think it was on Tumblr. I want to write a fic on it.

It goes something like this: Tom created an artificial, human-like being with a raven's wing and other things.

This being is emotionless, for a time, but does everything for Tom. And then Dumbledore comes in and finds the being---Harry---and takes him.

I want to write a fic on it (With a few differences), but I need the prompt. Any chance you know where it is?


** So, like the smurfs or something?

*** No. Harry was human in the prompt, he was just made rather than born.

***** It's like how you make a potion. You add seperate ingredients with their own qualities, use them, then create something entirely different.
