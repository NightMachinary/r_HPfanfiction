To the writers (or would-be writers) out there: how many of you get sidetracked by worldbuilding? And do you have any tips on focusing on the actual writing part? :')

It's just so much fun XD I must have reams upon reams of notes about my HP AU world at this point, but only about 10k words written down in story fashion. There's all sorts in there from a new political hierarchy of Wizarding Britain to the origins of Diagon Alley to a list of popular wizarding food and drink... I think I might have a bit of an obsession!


** When it comes to wanting to write an AU world, it might be useful to see the worldbuilding as just the premise of your story, not the plot itself. A good way to focus on the actual writing would be to try writing a plan, so you have a good order of events. You probably want to be showcasing your world through a good plot. I'd suggest keeping the plot fairly simple or not too dissimilar to canon allowing you to highlight the differences as a result of your AU world. It gives you a base to work from and then if your feeling confident you can begin to make it more complicated or more divergent form canon.

I'm just starting a story that's somewhat AU, and I find myself dwelling on some of the more irrelevant details so I'm not sure how good I'll be at actually making substantial progress but I'm trying to set myself reasonable targets.

*** I do have a general idea of where the plot is going :) I just get really into all the irrelevant details too, so it sounds like we have the same problem!

Tbh I was mainly curious about other people's experiences with worldbuilding vs writing and general thoughts, as it's really fun~

** Screw actual writing, worldbuilding is where it is at. I have a list of million books (esoterics, legends and myths, history) to read for my eternally-in-planning-phase fic. All for inspiration and research for something I probably won't actually write.

**** Storywise the main divergence is that Susan Bones was born on July 31st, and ended up being attacked by Voldemort on 1980 December 31st, and similarly to how it was with Harry in canon she survives, Voldemort "dies" and she gets a fancy nickname - Surviving Susan. That derails a ton of stuff (especially in connection with my setting changes) and thus when action of the fic proper starts in summer of the year 1991, it's a very different situation for Harry than it was in the original series.

Settingwise? I focus a lot of a concept-based nature of magic and how it shapes the magical world. Magicwise there was some rebalancing from canon, loose adaptation of some of fanon concepts, creating multiple available roads to a single goal.

I integrate a lot of random stuff. From popular in occult systems comes the theory of Seven Planes which is mixed with various other esoteric concepts.

There is a lot taken from an early version of Arthurian Legends (without French influences) and it visibly shapes the culture of contemporary Wizarding Britain as many believe that both Arthur and Merlin will return one day (Merlin returned and disappeared a few times already, the last one, being soon after the creation of a Sorting Hat, which according to the legend told him that he would be the best suited to Slytherin).

Hyperborea plays an important role in a political background because ICW created a program to forcibly sent most of the European giants there as a way of protecting ISOS.

Hogwarts subjects are different and so are rules regarding underage sorcery (many students leave after OWLs and they are permitted to use magic at home and at job, before reaching seventeen).

That's the tip of an iceberg, I'm generally setting-obsessed so I tweak, change and add stuff constantly.

***** My focus tends to be a lot later, as the main historical stuff I was looking into was the creation of the City of London (the Square Mile with the weird laws, not Greater London), Parliament and tying in big events from across British history (the Roman invasion bringing wands to the UK, etc). I did have some ideas regarding Merlin but I'm not familiar with the early mythology, so mine ties into how he accidentally invented time travel (in my AU he went to Hogwarts, then sent himself back to Arthurian Britain in a freak accident. His coded writings are later decrypted by the Dept. of Mysteries).

In terms of divergence mine is mainly around setting (read: history) and the nature of magic, but more directly I've changed the decisions of a small number of people closer to the canon timeline (Dumbledore and the Flamels).

Magic in my AU is a lot more "fluid" than in canon, with the short version being that abstract concepts "live" in a weird sense, with wizards using magic to "twist" the narrative of reality to their will.

******* I don't really know where the AU line goes, but figure it's better to err on that side of the line when describing a fic. I posted up the first couple of chapters just after I started writing a few months ago, before I got sidetracked by worldbuilding and more mundane complaints like cracking my ribs >_<

I'm afraid there isn't much of the changes present in the first two chapters, but they should be more obvious as time goes on. I'm hoping to post up ch3 in the next week or so as I started reading back through my writing and plot notes (as opposed to general setting and history) yesterday.

** If you got the itch, I say just give into it. Worldbuild ahead and keep it all noted down. I had this itch for a long time and just went ahead and linked up with like-minded people at [[/r/worldbuilding]] and its related subs.

Its not bad either. If you've thought about many details of your world, the chance to become inconsistent with it lessens considerably. Its one of the greatest points of criticism of Rowling's work that the worldbuilding around her story is incredibly inconsistent and shortsighted (examples are Wandlore only really becoming a thing in the last books when it is convenient. The Timeturners and their many implications and unanswered questions. The existence of Felix Felicis. ...) and I personally delight in reading fanfiction that tries hard to put all those pieces into a consistent whole, instead of just fanon-ing it away.

Its only important that when you get to writing, you write a plot, and not the world. It is very tempting to show off what you made. But a world is best enjoyed in small doses. Nobody likes to read an encyclopedia disguised as a fiction work. When it comes to adding to an existing world, you add the difficulty of having to explain how something fits into canon - without actually writing a paragraph of plain explanation.

To actually get to writing, I always try to see a bit of worldbuilding as a tool. Its worth nothing if I don't work with it. Most important is to just get to writing already, which means that you can just write a scene exploring some detail of your worldbuild. If it makes it in the story, doesn't matter. What matters is that you write as if it /could/ be part of the fiction you want to finish.

** I'd recommend you spend a bit more time working out exactly what you want to happen. Spend a bit of time refining what your story is about. World building can be its own thing but if you want it on a story then you have to work out how it is important. Is it background fluff that acts as fillers and details to slow your story at times or is it a constant distraction that adds little but makes you happy? Do your changes have a purpose or do you think they are 'cool'?

*** The worldbuilding certainly makes me happy! :D I mean I do think parts of it are cool, but tbh my main aim is to get it all to /work/ together in a way I find satisfying. As much as I love canon, there are too many holes and too many things that just scream out for development.

I have a reasonable idea of how I want First Year to run, and a very rough idea of how I want the overarching story to go... with lots of specific details to help me along with the bigger events.

I haven't seen Jim Butcher's writing tips, but having read the first few Dresden Files books I'm very glad you pointed them out. I'll take a look now, thanks!

** Worldbuilding is great fun.

What works for me is using a program called QuollWriter, which is quite similar to Scrivener (but it's free), and it can track mentions of certain things. As well as having entry options for chapters (with associated planning), you can write in little categories for character, object, location, et cetera. Then, the program tracks mentions of individual characters, objects or the like, so you can easily see where you've mentioned them, you know?

I work in a Harry Potter AU, using JKR's stuff as a sort of base framework, and then I build on it with more adult stuff and making sure that stuff is more complex in the areas it needs to be - like including branches off Diagon Alley and looking more at different magical businesses (like hairdressers, doctors, sex shops, apothecaries, etc.), at branches of magic that are more relevant (like herbology), and referencing stuff that has an effect, like fashion trends and the like.

Plan all you want, but the important thing is that you include what is RELEVANT right now. You shouldn't get sidetracked in listing off different cool ideas - the main people who are gonna enjoy that are like, twelve-year-olds or creeps who just want to read an encyclopaedia of headcanons, and lists of ideas... Those aren't stories.

If you really want to include your details, add them in an extraneous format or include footnotes as if you're writing a history and make it clear they ARE extra details - think about how Neil Gaiman & Terry Pratchett utilised footnotes in Good Omens.
