What is your favorite fic that comes from another fandom? I'm looking to get into other fandoms since I've read quite a bit of Harry Potter and Naruto.

  No. Fuck no. If my 'no' was a pokemon, it'd be a legendary, made entirely out of hyper beams and hate, annihilating entire regions at a time, leaving only blasted craters in its wake, all shaped like the word NO.

  There are many trainers in the world; they exist in degrees, from dabbler to legend. But only one can be the very best - one man, one Champion. I am that one. I am that man. My name? Red.

Probably the best one's out there. Although I hate pokemon fanfic romance so there's pretty much 0 of that in any of those if that's your thing. Personally i'd start with Traveller, it's unbelievable and the longest although incomplete the first region is finished so there's a satisfying end and it's still being updated!

**** It will, to some extent.

I have been spoiled with fanfiction, avoiding most of the 99% because I ended up following recommendations and sites very early on, discovering the repositories of the best.

That well is drying now, so it can be easy to compare lessors to the titans. It requires an attitude shift to avoid comparisons but managing that is extremely valuable in helping one appreciate each fic on its own merits.

Agreed. Traveler is completely amazing, and it's probably be the best fanfic I've ever read period. Seeing (well, reading) Ash grow from a little boy with a Nidoran to what he is right now is an incredible experience.

***** Oh yeah he's absolutely killing me, always has, but i think he's at least supposed to be annoying. Like it's not like Ash sticks with him for long (spoilers hope you've read most of it) and he rarely shows up other than to show what Ash isn't. Tbh he's basically Anime Ash with a slightly different personality.

Only pokemon fic i've read to come close to doing a good job of giving all of the pokemon distinct characters though.

****** Yeah, sure. It has a special place for me, because that is written with all of my favorite elements - unashamedly epic, clever fights, dark and gritty, introspective, a slowish pace and all splashed with philosophical reflections, and so on.

That, and more, is synthesized in TGoC, RotS, and, to a lesser extent, TNotW, which is why I mentioned them. It is unlikely to strike quite the same cord with others as it does with me, but I've yet to come up with a fic that can straight-out /excite/ me in the way that TGoC does.

At the same time...it really isn't fanfiction, and I think it should be avoided in this context, because it makes it seem more derivative than it is - it borrows as much from those as most fantasy does from Tolkien. It does have strong DnD-inspired elements but it isn't, say, HP and the Natural 20.

Fanfiction is built up in different ways by different authors, just as original fiction is. By its very nature fanfiction lacks a distinctive characterizing style.

******** It's rather hard to explain, but whenever I read MoL I'm thinking I'm reading a fanfiction. But that is probably due to the fact that what I usually read is time travel and AU fics, and they all tend to be constructed the same'ish way, and MoL is the same as those. Then there is the thing about episodic. MoL like fanfiction is uploaded in chapters, and this gives each chapter some stand alone power, unlike most books (that I've read recently) each chapter bleeds into the next much more fluidly.

But I guess it's mostly my personal opinion that I'm thinking fanfiction when I read MoL.

** My favourite Naruto fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5166693/1/Scorpion-s-Disciple][Scorpion's Disciple]], which features a deconstruction of the traditional "Naruto gets trained from a younger age and ends up totally awesome" trope. He still ends up pretty awesome, but it just feels right, and the consequences are explored. It never reaches Shippuden, unfortunately, but it's just utterly brilliant.

Other than Naruto, and probably my ultimate favourite fanfic... I can't decide.

Both are from [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]], though, so if you haven't done so already, /absolutely/ check that out. It's plain awesome. The two I cannot decide between are the Memorials series by Notes, which is exquisitely well-written and has often had aspects of itself mistaken for canon, while the other would be Dire Worm by Lost Demiurge, in which an incredibly hammy villain OC shows the world just what she's made of, which is a mix of distilled hilariousness and high-grade concentrated awesome.

** linkao3(1017744) Fall of the Fire Empire is a great Avatar the last airbender fic. It's a decent length, well written, and it's a story with a high amount of original content, which is all pretty well done, imo. All characters, bar historical ones, and Azula, are OC. This particular version does have some lengthy author notes - but they're actually commentaries on the story and some of his thoughts when writing, and I definitely suggest reading them, even if you normally bypass author's notes. Definitely one of my favourites from any universe (Though I'm a sucker for OCs)

Another one I've read that was pretty good, also from Avatar, is linkffn(8280375). Retroactive takes place after the end of the (first) series. It's also a pretty good story, with a pretty original idea behind it. Be warned though, that as part of the story, it ignores/gives it's own version of canon.

Also, I've wanted to get into Naruto fanfiction for a while, but I don't know anything about it. Do you have any suggestions about how I can get into it, other than watching the series?

#+end_quote

I've never watched or read Naruto either, but it's the fandom I've read the most fanfiction from after Harry Potter. I went for the brute force approach by plowing through the top-rated fanfics until I picked up the basic plot/setting details. Most fics follow the plot fairly closely until they hit their divergence point, so you can get a good feel for canon by what they have in common. ^{^{And}} ^{^{thanks}} ^{^{for}} ^{^{the}} ^{^{recommendations,}} ^{^{now}} ^{^{I}} ^{^{need}} ^{^{to}} ^{^{do}} ^{^{this}} ^{^{for}} ^{^{A:TLA.}} ^{^{:)}}

For me it wasn't until around the third fic that I had a general idea of the universe and what was going on in it, but it took several more before I understood it well enough to not get tripped up by any unexplained details. To speed the process up I'd advise consulting the wiki whenever you run into one of the basic universe details that most authors don't bother explaining (ex: ANBU, jinchuriki, the Kyuubi/Bijuu, kekkei genkai, dojutsu/the Sharingan/the Byakugan, the Uchiha Massacre) and wiki-walking from there.

A side benefit to this approach: almost all Naruto fics skip the filler (which I've heard makes up the vast majority of the anime), so you'll only get the good parts of the series.

*** I would recommend first wiki walking. Narutopedia is the most accurate. Also, i would recommend not the brute force approach but to read two major fanfics. linkffn(A Sealed Kunai) is one of the few naruto fic that feature limited bashing, and explores a darker more ANBU trained naruto. It also follows the canon timeline fairly closely. And second is a crossover. Its great to see the character of naruto in all his glory. He is more of post pain arc naruto without the want of peace but he isnt ooc. linkffn(NU:Red X Rising) it places naruto in the teen titans world. He steals the red x suit and there is some cheesey romance but there you go.

Finally some advice/disclaimer. Naruto is not like harry potter. In harry potter the most bloody act in the series is harry v draco in sixth year or snape cutting off georges ear. In naruto there is no such safe net. In the manga ten chapters in i believe naruto stabs himself. This is after two people are killed. Around five chapters later there are two more deaths. It doesn't help when you remember the children fighting are twelve. Naruto has been banned from some stores because of that small fact. Harry is about a hero who never wanted to be one. Naruto is about an abused kid becoming a child soldier and his quest for someone to care. That is the difference. Because of this difference.. I have not read a fanfiction that can be as dark as Naruto. Ive read harry being abused (in every way) by his relatives, his friends, ect. It still doesnt compare. I have read a story in which naruto was beaten sexually assualted and then left for dead because it was raining. And no one stopped it because no one cared. So when you read naruto be prepared for the fluctuating levels. Ive also read a story that had naruto live on the streets helping other orphans. Most heart warming story ive ever read. Just be prepared and do your research. Make sure you know what you want to read. Good luck. Ja Ne.

**** Never read any ATLA fanfiction, but from watching the series many many times, I've found myself wishing it was a Zuko Katara finish at least half the time (and my wife all the Times). Aang and Katara do work, but there are so many instances where their relationship is almost sibling like that it can be hard to see how they will survive the transition to bf/gf

Zuko has 2 major reasons to get paired with Katara in my mind:

1) he is a huge character in the series with almost as much screen time as the original trio, and arguably more character development than anyone else (including aang). Its a shame he got paired with an almost throwaway character in comparison.

2) in every scene they are alone together, they have great chemistry - by which I mean they draw out some of the most real reactions (both aggressive and empathetic) that we see from their characters. They forge real connections in the cave and on the hunt that show a relationship /could/ work between them. They spur growth in each other, which is one mark of a good relationship.

***** I agree with all of this. I felt like... Katara was more motherly to Aang. Watching my own mother trying to have a relationship with my father, an incredibly immature specimen of a man, I can tell you that being a mother hen to someone in a relationship just doesn't work. I know he matures, /eventually/, but..I dunno. It just feels icky to think that she basically had to raise him first.

In addition to the other reasons you mentioned, I feel that, based on their extreme circumstances growing up, Zuko and Katara are on a more even keel as far as maturity.

That and the whole "the hero gets the girl" trope was such a cop out. Lol

Nothing wrong with differing opinions though. Just like you think Z&K work better as friends and can't see the shipping, I see the same for Harry and Hermione (as friends is best). And just like I think ZK is a great ship idea, plenty of readers love them some HHr.

** Over the past several years I've read several hundred fanfics spanning a few dozen fandoms, and for non-HP fics there's absolutely no contest as to my favorite: the entire 'Broken' pentalogy by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2106674/LittleChicago][LittleChicago]], which splits off from the Dresden Files books after Turn Coat. I honestly prefer them to the last few books in the actual series.

Not only are they excellent and original stories, but they absolutely nail Jim Butcher's writing style, to the point where I probably wouldn't have noticed the switch if these fics had been released in place of the real books.

I read them all in one big clump a few months back when I found them, I just couldn't stop reading them they were all so good.

** [ADVENTURE, ROMANCE] This Sherlock BBC series is about Mycroft Holmes and his life with a female OC who is TERRIFIC. Each romance story covers a new phase in their relationship, combined with unique espionage stories. Mycroft's wife, Cate, is a polyglot English professor with a backbone of steel and a knack for trouble. Actually depicts brilliant people behaving intelligently and with great emotional depth, which can be rare to find in the Sherlock section. These stories could be published.

[HUMOR] If you've ever read Twilight and disliked it, you're going to pee yourself laughing at this spitefic. Leah Clearwater (with the help of Supernatural's Dean, Sam, and Castiel, though knowledge of SPN isn't needed) is summoned back to Forks to attend the wedding of Renesmee and Jacob. She decides to ruin the spoiled brat's big day instead.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/928015/]])

[ACTION] Crossover between Frozen and Wreck-It Ralph that requires no knowledge of either fandom. Tamora Calhoun, veteran lieutenant of the Cybug Wars, is assigned to guard a strange woman, Elsa, while Elsa experiments with using her ice powers to wipe out the aliens en masse. Mild romance, mild gore.

[ROMANCE] Don't write this fanfic off because it's a boyband AU. (Unless slash really isn't your thing.) It's amazing. --Louis is the concertmaster of the London Symphony Orchestra, Harry is the New! and Exciting! interim conductor/ex-cello prodigy who "has made Mozart cool again" according to Esquire Magazine (Louis hates him immediately, which is definitely why he internet stalked him in his dark bedroom late at night that one time). -- The prose is stunning. The author clearly loves classical music, and certain scenes never fail to make my spine tingle. ;)

[ACTION, FAMILY] This series continues where Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles left off. It centers around Savannah Weaver, the little redheaded girl whose mother was impersonated by a Terminator. Sarah Connor adopts her, and it spins out into another story of Skynet's rise- one in which John Connor is nowhere to be found.

Stolen Ice is a Frozen fanfic that leaves you raw. It's been months since I last read it and it still gives me goosebumps.

A Rose by Zealousprince is a Dragon Age 2 fic that I only just recently stumbled onto and I'm already planning on re-reading it. It does everything right, a hopeless romance without being sappy, suggestive without being porn and it stars Trans* characters without being a story about Trans* stuff. It wormed its way into my heart and I don't think I'll be able to let this one go.

  Sisters are orphaned, split at birth. One's a thief, the other a conwoman. There's paintings, diamond heists, forgotten identities, and an evil corporation. There's also a slow burn romance, which isn't the best when it's with your long-lost sister you never knew you had. So, accidental icest. Eventual Elsanna. Also a mAU, with electro/techno powers.

#+begin_quote
  A fast ship, a good crew, a treasure, a Clan to lead -- that's all Arthur Pendragon has ever wanted. He sits on the Council, he supports his father's kingship, and he keeps an eye on the Imperial Conglomerate when they come too close to Pirate space.One day the Conglomerate infiltrates the Clans and poisons the King. Arthur must search for a cure to keep his father alive and the Clans from civil war.An escape route, a sharp knife, a target, the shadows at his command -- that's all Merlin has ever needed. He fulfills his assignments, he uses the Sterling to sustain his once-royal House in their exile, and wages a private war against the Imperial Conglomerate.When he learns of an elaborate plot to assassinate him, Merlin does the opposite of what's expected. He flees onto a Pirate ship.There's a saying among the Pirates: that one's fate is written in the stars. Destiny will always set to rights what has been made wrong.Arthur and Merlin know that they were meant for the other from the moment they meet. They can feel it from across the galaxies separating them. Nothing can stop them from being together or from fulfilling an ancient prophecy.

      Months ago, I wrote a small random snippet about space pirates that somehow turned into space pirates and ninjas and became the basis of this 2013 submission to Paperlegends\.  It's now 170,000 words later, it's still about space pirates and ninjas, and I blame La\_Temperenza, who came up with this cracky pairing\.  The story, by the way, is not as cracky as it sounds\.  I promise\.When Mushroomtale asked if she could be my artist, I was over the moon\.  Not only did she trust me to write a story I can only hope is worthy of her art, she created so many beautiful pieces that made, and still make me gasp with awe\.  Every glimpse I got of her artwork in progress only pushed me to work harder and better to complement her talent\.  Mushroomtale, your work is always going to inspire me, and I can't thank you enough\.All the stars go to Castmeaway, who betaed 170,000 words in two weeks despite her hectic schedule and through a catastrophic computer failure at the 11th hour to return it to me in time to pretty it up for posting\.  Castmeaway, you're amazing, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise\.  There aren't enough ways for me to say thank you \-\- but here's one:  I owe you all the fic\.Along the way, there were many people who offered me encouragements and spontaneous cheerleading\.  I was \(and still am\) overwhelmed by all the support\.  There's too many people to list, but you know who you are\.  Thank you\!The\_Muppet, I will miss Paperlegends, but I am grateful that you hosted it one last time\.  Thank you for all your hard work \-\- you made an impact on the Merlin fandom that no one will forget\.  And, because it's the last one, Mushroom and I went all out\.  In addition to her gorgeous artwork, Mushroomtale put together a fanmix and a step\-by\-step cover art post\.  I wrote additional Bonus Material \-\- a full Cast of Characters, a Timeline, a Glossary, an Extra, and notes on Worldbuilding a Space AU\.

  Stiles's life was so much easier before his BFF got super powers. “But, so, werewolves have super strength, right? And super speed. And better vision, and better muscle control, and healing powers, and stuff. And some of that's probably, like, genetic, if you can be born a werewolf. Right?”   “Yeah,” Scott says. From the perplexed look on his face, he doesn't yet know where Stiles is going with this. “So?” “So what if you have condom-defeating supersperm?” Stiles has a lot of research to do. He decides Derek's kitchen is the place to do it. Derek probably regrets giving him a key.

  "So this is what Stiles does. He lies in Scott's bed and waits for Melissa to say she's found someone to get it out of him, to cure him of the wrongness and the bad, and he dreams. God, he dreams.He dreams of fire and swollen bellies and that scene in Alien, of giving birth to jackals through his urethra, the whole horrific nine yards. His head is a terrible place to be, he can't imagine his stomach is much better, why anyone would want to put a thing inside of it."

      I wrote this fic because I wanted to subvert a fluff trope by making it angsty, and as a bonus, write MPREG as more body horror than pregnancy? IDK if I succeeded, but here is the result of a year’s worth of hard work making fake people suffer so I could then make them… not suffer\.It’s only canon compliant up to the S2 finale\. This isn’t an AU where men are usually childbearing or anything, but a lot of this has been jossed pretty hard by 3A\. I did my own things with omegas and werewolf eye color\.Massive amounts of credit go to Einfach\_Mich and Chele, who read this is in its first incarnation\. AnnaLund gave me an AWESOME preliminary beta, but all remaining errors are a result of me adding/editing too much\. Also lots of appreciation for my fellow nonnies who encourage me in WIP threads, advise me on trigger warnings, and helped me research exactly how Stiles give birth to babby? Handwavey stuff I didn’t research nearly enough: College correspondence work \(pulled right from my ass\) and possibly some medical stuff \(I tried really hard, but men don’t actually have babies, so Google only got me so far\)\.I’ll dump complete warnings at the end for those who are interested\.Poem excerpts at the beginnings of chapters are from The House of Dust by Conrad Aiken\.

"Charles is the most competent deputy any headmaster could ask for, Erik, and he's been doing this for years..." He trailed off, as if finally noticing something odd in the way his Potions and Divination masters were staring at each other. "Of course," Charles said quickly, his voice only a little hoarse, and stuck out his hand. "Welcome back to Hogwarts, Erik."

  Erik Lehnsherr is a visiting professor at Columbia University, as well as an acclaimed and award winning poet. Charles Xavier is a lead researcher with the Genetics Department who is well on his way to tenure. But what happens when Charles has to cancel a class because half his students abandon him in favour of a mysterious new English Lit professor? Naturally he ends up sitting in in the class, where Professor Lehnsherr mistakes him for a student. It's really too bad Erik has such a strict policy against dating students. It's also too bad Erik doesn't seem to know how to use Google.

      nekosmuse wrote the prose, afrocurl wrote the poetry\.

Erik is the dream prof \-\- knowledgeable and enthusiastic with a dry sense of humour\. The only problem is, he's finding himself more and more attracted to one of his students, one Charles F\.

In addition to answering my many questions regarding both the city and Columbia, she also helped edit the New York details once the story was complete\.

I am both humbled an honoured\.palalife, for the beautiful art she drew \(it appears in the final chapter\) that made me cry uncontrollably for hours on end\.And last, but never least, afrocurl, whose poetry took this story in an entirely new direction, inspiring entire chapters with the sheer beauty of her words\.Opening poem by Elizabeth Barrett Browning\.

** Okay, I'm 3 days late to this thread, but I hadn't made an account when it was new, and I just can't resist.

My absolute favorite ff, from any fandom, has to be this 'The Patriot' fic: linkffn(The Loyal Daughter by DocM). It's so amazing - the sheer amount of research that had to have gone into it is just mind-blowing. I actually prefer it to the movie. It's technically incomplete (and honestly, probably abandoned), but it ends at such a place in the story that there is enough closure.
