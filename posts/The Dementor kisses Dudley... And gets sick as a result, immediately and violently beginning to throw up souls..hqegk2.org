*** Concept - the Dementors are sent to attack Harry at the train station after 4th year. The Dursleys are forced to wait on the magical side of 9 3/4 (because of Moody's insistence and severe paranoia after being stuck in his own trunk all year, he isn't letting the Order crew watching Harry take ANY chances).

The Dementors FEAST, sucking out so many souls - Harry's, Sirius, Remus, Hermione, Ginny, Fred, George, Draco Malfoy, Millicent, Romilda.

It's a disaster - until they go for Dudley. Both Dementors target him at once (because he's huge?). And he's so gross that with even half a soul each, they both vomit horribly.

The day is saved! Only a few problems, though... People have 'switched' bodies. When they all wake up in St. Mungo's (or maybe the Hogwarts infirmary, to keep the press away?) they find out that the switches are

Remus and Sirius - Now Remus is free from his curse, no more becoming a werewolf because that's a body thing, not a soul thing! BUT he's a wanted criminal now and has to stay hidden in Grimmauld Place. Will he do better than Sirius did in canon, as Remus is calmer and more level headed? On the flip side, Sirius lost his Animagus form (and is now a werewolf, but he may think that's awesome), BUT as 'Remus' he can go outside whenever and where ever he wants without fear (well, mostly, except for the ..lycanthrophobes?). And he can now be there for Harry a LOT more.

Hermione and Ginny - Hermione suddenly sees what it's like to have a HUGE family that's there for her when needed but also with so many people that she isn't constantly singled out, instead of her loving (but slightly overbearing and misunderstanding) parents. She also sees what it's like to go from a lowly Muggleborn to a Pureblood (because even blood traitors like the Weasleys are still slightly better treated than a mudblood in some circles). Also, Ginny is...well, sporty and the HAIR is something to get used to. Flipside, Ginny (in Hermione's body) finally has a nice, quiet, peaceful home with 2 parents that are actually able to pay attention to her! No explosions, no fights, no stinkbombs. But the Granger's also don't "get" her very well, and think her trying to get used to Hermione's hair, and her sudden 'personality' change, is all about a 'boy thing'. Maybe she misses her crazy huge family after all..

Fred and George - really, it's just for laughs. It doesn't change much at all - I mean come on, identical twins! Except when "Fred" is a little calmer and gentler, he finds "his" other best friend, Angelina, suddenly interested in him...And "George" doesn't get why Alicia is suddenly so cold to him. And maybe they're less alike than everyone, themselves included, thought. (or you know, maybe they're so identical that even THEY don't realize they were switched until they see their underwear or notice like, a little hidden freckle or something).

Harry and Dudley!! - Best if Vernon and Petunia don't know they were switched. Maybe either their memories were wiped and they weren't told about the switch, or they refused to go on the magical side of 9 3/4 and Dudley only went because their priority for his safety overrode their hatred of magic, but not enough to go with him. So they still think Dudley is Dudley and Harry is Harry. Now Duds is in Harry Potter's body, and he's gonna be RICH and FAMOUS, only...he has no magic/wayyyy too little residual magic from his mom's side of the family to do anything but take an oath. After he throws a hell of a tantrum, he ends up bound to secrecy from EVERYONE. He can't tell anyone, parents included, that there was a body swap or that he isn't really Harry Potter. He's stuck in Privet Drive, being treated like Harry is there, and if he tries to tell then it's the magical equivalent of a shock collar.

Harry, on the other hand, will eventually HAVE to tell people what happened - because wrong body or not, he's still the saviour of the wizarding world. In the mean time, he can enjoy being an 'anonymous' muggleborn transfer student, making friends and going places without being whispered about. He can't use the name 'Dudley Dursley' though - too many people know of his relatives, if not what they look like. So they make him up a fake name and enroll him as a transfer (he'll have to be Sorted again, wonder where he'll go) and it's pretty nice - except he's larger than Crabbe and Goyle together and so he can't really be a Seeker or maybe even fly anymore, and Cho absolutely will not look at him twice now even though he's got a huge thing for her still, and Umbridge, not knowing who he is, picks him as her favorite student..

Millicent and Romilda - a side quest. Vain, giggly, shallow Romilda has lost her good looks and is thrown a couple years ahead. She'll really have to work for things now, and either adapt to Slytherin and embrace her meaner side...or change because of how she's treated as 'Millicent', and stand out from the crowd and make a difference.

Millicent, meanwhile, is everything she'd secretly wanted but claimed she didn't care about - liked, pretty, popular, conventionally attractive. At first she flourishes under the positive attention, but then she's upset; "I'm still me, I'm the same as I always have been but just prettier now...they don't care about me, they care about how I look." Eventually maybe she realizes that yes, it's that to a degree, but also she's more outgoing and confident in Romilda's body, plus Romilda already had friends and wasn't known for being a bully like Millicent was.

Draco and (???) I don't know who would be funniest or best to have there to switch Draco with. I'm leaning towards Dean Thomas for a few reasons. He's got a bit of personality fleshed out in canon (unlike, say, Ice Queen Daphne), but he also isn't such a big character by book 5 that it limits things. We know relatively little about his personal life, except that he's a half-blood who thinks he's Muggleborn and has a stepdad and (according to the wiki) "several" half-siblings. He draws, he's sporty, he was a Chaser briefly, dated Ginny, and is a great artist. If he and Draco are swapped, then Dean is in a place to adapt to the Malfoys and become a little more cunning, but also seems to have good morals and values and wouldn't be swayed by them; he may even be in a position to fool them and spy on them. Meanwhile, Draco-as-Dean suddenly has loving, NORMAL parents who aren't magical Nazis. He also has a little sister who thinks he's the best thing in the whole world, and the two youngest, a boy and a girl, who he helps raise. Draco may be an asshole, but even he can't say no to the 12 year old and two 4 year olds looking at him with those big puppy dog eyes.

Also...Dean is black - Draco could go out in a Muggle town with the siblings and end up experiencing what it's like to be the one targeted, harassed, and abused by the racist jerks for once. Maybe he'll learn something from it.

In addition to all those hi-jinks, factor in: Tonks loves Remus, but Remus is now 'Sirius' and they're related, so...ick? And Hermione has feelings for Ron, but she's in his LITTLE SISTER'S BODY so that's not great. Meanwhile, Ginny still fancies Harry but now she's Hermione, and Dean fancies Ginny who's Hermione so just...what? And Draco does care for Pansy, but she won't have anything to do with 'Mudblood trash' Dean Thomas, and that's when it clicks for Draco that what Pansy and his old friends do to Muggleborns is what 'that guy' did to him and his siblings..

And Pansy likes "Draco" (who's actually Dean) but he's DISGUSTED by her and her attitude and finds himself still feeling for Ginny (who he knows is in Hermione?) and let's it slip around the Malfoys; they aren't thrilled about him fancying a blood traitor, but he's been the 'ideal' son this summer and 'really grown up' and at least she's a Pureblood and maybe he can convert her, so they give him permission to pursue her...Only, he likes Ginny the person, who is in Hermione's body, and he can't be seen pursuing a Muggleborn. So to keep the peace, he has to pursue "Ginny" who's actually Hermione. And maybe romance forms there, maybe not.

Ron meanwhile is on the sidelines normal and confused and trying to help (his two best friends, 2 brothers, and little sister are affected so of COURSE he's allowed to know the truth even though his parents can't yet). And he liked Hermione, but now every time he looks at her body, he knows his little sister is in there and just feels sick with himself. And when he talks to the actual Hermione, he can't feel much because he's staring into the face of his baby sister. Good way to kill a crush in it's tracks.

Now I really want someone to write something like this (but like, someone with actual talent, not me, because I will butcher it.)

** A series of shrill, retching sounds echoed through the abandoned tunnel. To anyone who would walk past, many would assume /something/ was being tortured. And in a way, they would be correct.

Harry was transfixed at the sight before him. Just now, a pair of dementors had ambushed him and Dudley within an old, abandoned tunnel. Before the crushingly depressive aura could further affect him, Harry had cast his patronus, with full intent to save his cousin, when he saw the 'kiss' that would drain Dudley's soul. For a brief moment, dread had gripped him, despite his feelings for the 'little' shit.

Only for the world to explode in colour... Literally! Every imaginable colour was vomited from the dementor's mouth -- he hoped it was from the thing's mouth, Harry thought to himself -- in the form of a sludge-like substance. It sprayed across the ground, the walls, and the unconscious Dudley. As it did so, the dementor wailed and flailed its arms in a maddened frenzy. Harry almost felt sorry for it.

/Almost/.

Before the dementor could regain its bearings, Harry directed his patronus at it. 'Prongs' collided with the ghastly creature and drove it away, before it faded into nothingness. Once he was reasonably sure that it wouldn't return, Harry rushed towards his cousin and frantically checked for a pulse, while trying to avoid touching any of the dementor vomit.

How the hell was he going to explain this?!

** Somewhat related since we're talking about Dudley's soul getting sucked out, I started to write a story about Dudley getting kissed by the dementor at the beginning of OotP and being basically braindead (from a muggle PoV) until Sirius's soul, newly liberated from its body thanks to the Veil, reaches Dudley's body. Sirius-Dudley then wakes up and Sirius does whatever in Dudley's body, including going (back?) to Hogwarts. It never really made it past the idea stage and Sirius-Dudley returning to Grimmauld Place much to Kreacher's confusion.

*** Screw it, here's what I have written:

*Prologue: Summer 1995*

Harry felt the cold surround him.

"Expecto Patronum," he finally yelled.

The dementors were forced back off Harry and his cousin. Dudley fell limp on to the alley.

Harry looked over at his cousin's face. Dudley's eyes were glazed over. Harry shook his cousin and received no response.

"Bugger," he swore under his breath. Harry had been too late and his cousin's soul had been consumed by the dementor.

Harry looked up from his cousin's body to discover his neighbor, Mrs. Figg.

"I've sent word to Dumbledore," she said. "He'll be here shortly."

Within a few minutes, there was a sound like that of a car backfiring. Albus Dumbledore had apparated right in front of him and Mrs. Figg.

Dumbledore examined Dudley's body, poking it with his wand. "Well, he isn't dead yet. He's in what muggles would call a vegetative state. He is essentially brain dead, but he can be kept alive. We'll take him to St. Mungo's immediately."

Harry took Dumbledore's arm and they disapparated with Dudley's body.

Harry watched as Dumbledore informed the healers of what had happened. A tawny owl swooped through the St Mungo's lobby and landed in front of Harry.

Harry looked at the seal. It read, "Improper Use of Magic Office."

"Damn."

Dumbledore's eyes hardened as they glanced at the letter.

"Harry, take my hand once again. Your cousin will be taken to a muggle hospital for his parents to decide what to do with him." For the second time that evening, Harry was forced through what felt like the world's smallest straw.

Harry looked over at a street lamp and read the street name, "Grimmauld Place."

£££££

*Chapter 1: Late Spring 1996*

Sirius Black was not having a good day. He had been called to the Department of Mysteries to save his godson from an ambush. His cousin had gotten the best of him and sent him through the Veil.

Sirius felt like all of his nerves were on fire for a split second. He looked around. He could see his cousin and her fellow Death Eaters fighting Harry, his classmates, and members of the Order of the Phoenix.

He looked down.

His entire body, head and all, was missing.

He found that he could turn around. Sirius willed himself forward. He moved forward.

Mystified, he began to rush around the chamber, but despite his loud cries, he could not get anyone's attention. He rushed up to his godson and brushed up against his head, but was repelled by several forces.

Sirius moved over to the fallen form of Hermione Granger, but was met with similar resistance from a single force.

He continued to rush around the room, but failed to make contact with anyone in the room.

Sirius moved towards the wall. He continued at full speed and found that he could go straight through the wall.

He continued to go through walls and then ceilings, reaching the atrium of the Ministry of Magic.

Sirius went up several more levels until he finally reached the roof.

He found himself looking over the evening skyline of London.

He wooshed down to the street level and found that he was even repelled by muggles. "Fuck," he thought.

He followed a rather attractive muggle woman to a large building. He followed her inside.

"Success," he said as she walked into the bathroom. The woman began to change into some loose fitting clothes that reminded Sirius of the robes worn by the healers of St. Mungo's. Perverted curiosities satisfied, Sirius wooshed through the ceiling.

He quickly wooshed into the hall upon finding that the room directly upstairs from the women's toilets were the men's toilets.

Sirius began to ponder his existence. He was no longer alive in the normal sense of the word. He wasn't a ghost either, or else he would have been seen by all of the witches and wizards in the Ministry of Magic and possibly the muggles as well.

He continued to probe the muggles on the current floor of the hospital and was still repelled by a single force from each one.

He reached the third floor and wooshed into yet another room. Inside this one, a beefy man with a large mustache and a horse faced blonde cried over a large blond teenager who wasn't moving at all.

He moved towards the two adults, probably that sorry specimen's parents, and was repelled as he had been hundreds of times before.

He turned to the large teenager laying on the bed. He felt a pain like what he had experienced a few hours before in the Department of Mysteries.

He blinked his eyes. He had been deaf for a moment and he once again began to hear sobbing from the thin blonde woman.

He attempted to woosh out of the room, but was stopped.

Sirius's thoughts stopped. He concentrated on moving one of his arms.

'Wait. His?'

His eyes shifted towards his arm, which began to move had he willed it to.

"Whoa," he said out loud.

The adults jumped back by two feet. The woman gasped, while the man ran out of the room, looking for a doctor.

"Diddydums?"

Sirius thought, 'Is that a name?'

"Dudley?" The woman asked again.

"Who are... Petunia?" Sirius looked at the woman carefully. She looked remarkably like Lily's bitch of a sister that he had encountered once.

The woman gasped again.

Sirius shifted his weight and threw his legs over the side of the hospital bed. He set them down on the ground and began to sit up.

He grabbed a hold of an IV cart and stood up. He unsteadily walked forward, all while Petunia continued with her hysterics.

He shuffled down the hall to a vacant room. Sirius promptly disapparated.

He looked around. All of his body parts were intact. He looked down at his feet and saw something else--a rather large belly. He felt at his thighs and realized that while he hadn't splinched his body, he had left his clothes in the hospital closet.

He opened the door to 12 Grimmauld Place and walked in the door. No protections prevented him from entering, but his mother's portrait began to rant about "muggle filth."

He walked, still rather unsteady on legs that hadn't walked for nearly a year, up the stairs.

He found his largest shirt and loosest pants and pulled them over himself.

He walked back downstairs and to the kitchen.

"Kreacher," he snapped

The disgruntled house elf appeared.

"Master? Kreacher doesn't recognize master's appearance. Is this a trick?"

"It isn't a bloody trick. Make me a sandwich now."

Kreacher stalked off, mumbling about blood traitors.

Innocent, guilty, I don't think the Dementors care, as long as their fed. Feeding guilty people to the Dementors is Wizarding Britain's deal with the devil, a way to placate the Dementors so they don't feed on the innocent all the time (whereas Voldemort was happy to unleash them on everyone, which is why Dumbledore says they'll join him instead of staying loyal to Fudge).
