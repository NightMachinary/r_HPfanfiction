In my mind, Harry does not look like Daniel Radcliffe. If I'm reading something like /Harry Potter Mercenary by DobbyElfLord/ linkffn(4544334), I find it impossible to picture that Harry with Radcliffe's face and voice. I think Radcliffe works fine for canon, but I just cannot picture him as a bada$$. If you cover his face with a [[http://cdn.minilua.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Beard-and-Moustache.jpg][beard]] and make him gargle some glass it could happen. But [[http://i.huffpost.com/gen/882130/images/o-DANIEL-RADCLIFFE-facebook.jpg][otherwise]]... I...[[http://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_640x430/public/dantop.png][just]]...[[http://assets-s3.usmagazine.com/uploads/assets/articles/68700-daniel-radcliffe-sports-long-hair-extensions-for-frankenstein-movie-role-picture/1386683993_daniel-radcliffe-zoom.jpg][cannot]]...[[http://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/legacy.images/smosh-pit/032011/frodo-brow.jpg][see it]].*

 

What do you think? And how did you picture him before the movies came out?

 

*That last image isn't fair to Radcliffe as someone stole his eyebrows. But it was to funny to leave out


** Brilliant wide green eyes and jet black hair that can never stay the same for a minute. It constantly looks like he's just gotten out of bed and it sticks up in funny places.

His face is plain and pale though charming - and his smile is perpetually boyish and teasing. His nose is a bit upturned and he's never without his round-glasses.

My Harry is a lanky, thin fellow of average height (5'10 or 5'11) with his wand jammed in his jeans pocket and an old pair of sneakers on.

He looks closest to 4, 5 and 6 years in this picture I've linked.

I can understand that. He is a good choice for the movies. Apparently [[https://www.google.com/search?q=liam+aiken&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMI4q6jv_q1xwIVAdWACh0soQOs&biw=743&bih=115&dpr=0.9][Liam Aiken]] almost got the role...so yea.

** I see him as the human version of the Mary Grandpre drawings. Not the overly stylized ones on the covers but the looser pencil drawings within. In Deathly Hallows I do see him as more Daniel Radcliffe though, I think his determination in that movie really kind of imprinted itself on my reading of the book. Some fanfiction where he's an adult Auror I also see Daniel Radcliffe, but when he's younger mostly not.

****** Harry is only ever said to be short relative to people who are established as tall, such as Ron, Dumbledore and Hagrid, or adults/older students in general. I think most of the impression of Harry as short comes from the latter: he's so often described as looking up at adults and older students that we get an impression of shortness in general, but of course it's just his age.

One interesting change of note is that Narcissa Malfoy is described as tall in GoF; in HBP Harry is said to be as tall as she is now.

******* mhm, i do think he is tall bc of james and the narcissa thing. my comment was more pedantic; he's described outright in the earlier books as short, and other characters are outright described as tall, harry isn't, iirc, outright called tall in the later books. his height is only described relative to his past height or others'. it's sort of the same with snape: he's never stated to be tall, though he has to look down at narcissa and harry in hbp, and is depicted by jkr as taller than minerva, all of whom are tall

I think at the start of the 7th book when the lot takes Polyjuice Potion to look like Harry, Fleur is said to shrink down a bit to meet Harry's size. I think Fleur has "model" proportions as she's always described as being tall. Probably 6 feet even. Harry's just under the height.
