I am looking for a Hermione/Snape story. I will try not to give to much away but Hermione plays the piano, and one night Snape's just happens to listen and falls a sleep for a good nights rest while still being a double agent. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

More detail, reason for edit> Albus is till alive and ask Hermione to help Snape with his sleeping, Hermione parents have passed due to Death Eater attacks. Hermione's friends don't get to hear her play the piano, Snape's over hears someone playing at first never knowing who it was until Albus tells him that she is willing to play for him. It is a friends to lover story and starts off very slowly. Author has created YouTube videos of the song that Hermione sings threw the story. If you need more I will gladly be able to give more.

** What with the sheer amount of H/S fanfics out there, this will be almost impossible to find. More details are needed.
