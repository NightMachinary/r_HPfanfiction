Something that has a D&D type character like Milo, or just something that has someone from another fandom/world/dimension/universe/multiverse.

By the way, if you haven't read the Natural 20, I strongly recommend it. And you don't /really/ have to know a lot about D&D to enjoy it.

Thanks


** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Girl in Red) has a similar premise, i.e. stick a D&D character in Hogwarts. I try to write it assuming my readers aren't familiar with D&D.

*** is there a release schedule?

also I don't think Rose isn't quite a Mary Sue like you were saying before, just OP, which was going to happen no matter what if you're going to put a 20th level anything in HP.
