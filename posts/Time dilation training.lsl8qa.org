:END:
Hey üëã So I'm trying to find a fic that I can't remember the name of, taking place during one of the summers between the hogwarts years(might be post Order of the Phoenix). In the fic, Harry goes to one of the properties he inherited with Neville longbottom and Draco Malfoy. They activate a time dilation spell, and spend most of the summer doing both physical and magical training. One of the magics they focus on is the animagus transformation, which transfers the powers over to their human forms, and they each unlock a magical animal form. Draco has a super fast direwolf form, Neville has a super strong hairy big hulking form of some kind, Harry has a super strong and fast rottweiler form that can manipulate and is enhanced by shadows. In this story it turns out that all of the black family member's can unlock a dog form that can manipulate shadows too. During a break in their training the three of them go into muggle London to a night club, where they end up finding Luna Lovegood. She is a vampire princess or something, and some of her vampire minions try to restrain the boys, and Neville actually knocks one of the vampires out with one punch.

Please help me find this fanfiction! üò≠üôè
