Hey all,

I'm looking for a fic where the trio is Neville, Hermione and Harry. It starts from Year 1 or possibly before, and Snape takes a mentoring role. Can't remember if Snape went back in time or not, but I think he was aware of Harry's abuse at the Dursleys, and intervened in some way. Snape gave him a necklace with an amulet to use as an emergency alert.

Anyone have any idea of the fic I'm talking about?


** Ack. I think I read this too, but can't for the life of me remember the title.

** Is it Blueowl's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change][To Shape and Change]]? The story has a time-traveling Snape and both Harry and Neville ending up in Hufflepuff.

*** Unfortunately not, though I've read that, and that's amazing as well :D In this story I'm fairly positive they are all in Gryffindor. Thanks though!

** Any more details about this fic you can remember? I have read fics with each of these elements but can't recall any with all of them. That's saying a lot since my H/Hr folder alone has 100+ stories and those are just the ones I remember to bookmark.

*** It's possible I may be confusing some elements. Do you have any recommendations for just good completed Harry-Hermione-Neville trio fics? It could easily be one of those and I'm mixing stuff up. And even if it's not, it's all good reading :D
