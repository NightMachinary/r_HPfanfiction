I'm looking for vampire!Harry story. I like the idea where Harry is similar to a vampire lord from Skyrim or Underworld. I've read one good almost two years ago but author never completed it, now it's deleted though. Harry/AnyFemaleCharacter.


** Mind linking the one you've read before?

You'd think there'd be some good vampire stories for a series as magical as HP. But Twilight just fucked that shit up so hard. Damn sparkling vampires, what's wrong with a good old fashioned blood sucker...

Now that I wrote this I remember one I read myself years ago... But I can't seem to find it. It had Harry as Dracula reborn, and it ended with Voldemort being alive and trying to kill Harry every few years...

I'll keep looking for it but I don't know if I'll find it

*** It's deleted now. Although I think it was wrote by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1239654/The-Santi][The Santi]]. It was Harry/OC, Harry was bitten by female vampire after fifth year. The one you've mentioned was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8517195/1/Heir-of-Dracula][Heir of Dracula]] and it was pretty cool, a little short though.

  Fem!Harry. Harry didn't know what a vampire was. Was it any wonder she thought drinking blood was normal? Rated T for insinuated graphical images. No longer a one-shot.

  Voldemort not only sent his Death Eaters to the Ministry, but vampires as well. Hermione and Harry fall to them and find themselves in new, undead lives. While Harry struggles to remain human, Hermione becomes what was believed dead long ago. She becomes a Countess, an heir to Dracula. Unfortunatly, there are no books on that.

** I have a bunch, none of them are finished (all are abandoned) and they all suck (figuratively and literally). At least they follow more along the lines of Dracula and Nosferatu, rather than that Twilight nonsense.
