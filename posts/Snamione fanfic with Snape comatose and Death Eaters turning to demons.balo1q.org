I am looking for a particular Snape/Hermione fanfic where Snape is gravely injured, he cannot move or talk, is at St. Mungo's and Hermione is tending to him, managing to communicate with small facial motions. Meanwhile, Lucius and Drafo Malfoy are also in the hospital sick with a weird disease. Lucius Malfoy eventually turns into a demon and Snape has to kill him. Narcissa Malfoy kills herself to save Draco because the disease is a kind of curse that takes over Death Eaters turning them into demons. Snape is also gradually being taken over and Hermione somehow manages to go to the demon realm, bargain with the demon for Severus' soul, wins but it costs her her eyesight. That's all I remember, basically. It is such a great fanfic, I read it many years ago and cannot remember where I read it, the author or the title. Can someone help?
