What are you favourite betrayals in fanfiction?

Bonus points for surprise, devastating consequences, and a good backstory/ reason.


** I recently read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9268425/1/Honey][Honey]] and loved it. I don't know if it was the author's intention, but I take the whole story as an over-the-top satire of tropes in manipulative!Dumbledore fics.

The reveal of betrayal(s) of both sides at the end was pretty great.

** linkffn(Potter Ever After by Kevin3) has Minerva McGonagall join Voldemort because before she did, she never was seen as worthy of having her outfits described.

Not as serious as you were hoping, I guess, but it fits!

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

** linkao3(19381933) where Ginny Weasley defects to Lord Voldemort and ends up killing most of the Weasley family ( Ron and George being the only survivors). It's a very dark fic. I don't think that death eater Harry would be that treacherous as he is an orphan. linkao3(19247977) features Death Eater Minerva McGonagall.

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.Originally posted on ffnet, now also updating here.

** Funny, the last two fics I read had betrayals, but I wouldn't recommend either.

"The spider's web" by Merrick Mayfair - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11767791/1/The-Spider-s-Web]]

Has a hydra seduced Ginny Pop up nearly at the fucking end. It was somewhat interesting to see a NON Voldemort aligned evil Ginny, but almost as soon as she shows up, they drop a rock on her head and she dies.

She essentially gets a monologue, Black widow mocks her for being a whore, then dies. I fear I am making this sound more interesting than it is.

​

The other one I won't link to was an NCIS fic where Ziva was always evil, got pregnant, stole files from Vance's office, and when she got deported she told Tony she was preggers and laughed at him as she got on the plane.

God that was a dismal fic. I dropped it when it turned into yet another daddy gibbs fic.

I like betrayal fics in NCIS and Harry Potter because it's fun to see characters be uncharacteristically shitty to one another. I like bash where they make people pants shittingly stupid.

Problem is, they jam a lot of whump into those fics too, and that shit is a disease.

I also like NCIS fics where professionals come in and are fucking baffled at how retarded Gibbs is.

​

I think the first betrayal fic I read was that weird as shit one where Dobby finds Harry dead and revives him... leaving him half house elf.

It was amusing because horcrux Tom seduced Hermione and ANOTHER horcrux Tom murdered the shit out of the Weasleys. And Molly Weasley's last thoughts were "Fuck lily potter"

I THINK Harry dropped London Bridge on Hermione's parents before he killed her?

​

I'm a fan of batshit insane fics. Hurt/comfort can die in a fire.

I like meanspirited thief protaganists best, but an unhinged murderhobo harry is fine too.

*** Cuz having the only spy in a magical war basically be a caricature of a wizard spy so obvious that any first year would immediately suspect is kinda lame?

I think it was Sirius or maybe Remus in the books who described the first war as horrible because no one knew who to trust.

Also it usually gives the dark side some more depth, mainly in Voldemort actually being able to charm, manipulate or plan ahead.

**** I think he lost the ability to charm anyone by splitting his //SOUL// so many times.

I do agree with the fact that it gives more depth but why some of the extremely well made characters, why not some outsider who became a ”genuine” friend, I don't like betrayals on any scale from the well made characters, it just goes against their nature.

***** Oh sure that'd work, but it'd have to be a character of the same calibre as the ones listed.

And he probably did lose a lot by wrecking his soul, but it might be possible for some of his earliest plans (from before he went insane) to still be in effect.

Honestly if I made a betrayal for a character it would be some powerful rando in the order because he/she wanted to use more than stunners
