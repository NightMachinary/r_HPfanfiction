I'm not really a 'Harmony' shipper, but I really like their friendship, so I'm in search of any fanfictions that include their friendship and/or hurt/comfort.

I've read /[[https://fanfiction.net/s/8171452/1/Harmony][Harmony]]/, and it's one of my favorite till this date. Something similar to that would be awesome!


** Time for some shameless self-promotion. I wrote a Harry/Fleur one-shot with Hermione as Harry's wingman. It honestly is more of a Harry&Hermione friendship fic than a Harry/Fleur story so it should fit your request. The follow-up is still a WIP.

**** The Harry and Tonks one will be continiued in another story I'm going to publish on Boxing day. While still fluffy it will also have much grimmer surroundings.

** While not specifically a work recommendation, I'd recommend looking for fics either [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Hermione%20Granger%20*a*%20Harry%20Potter/works][here]] or [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Hermione%20Granger%20*a*%20Harry%20Potter%20Friendship/works][here]] on Ao3. Both of those tags are for friendship specific works between Harry and Hermione, and you can easily filter out any Harry/Hermione works if you'd like. ([[https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/333][Here are some tips about filtering out on Ao3]])
