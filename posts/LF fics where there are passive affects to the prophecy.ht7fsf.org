Like Tom and Harry's power level were made equal the moment Harry was marked. And as the story progress's they are like mirror images of each other. Like Tom gathers his followers and Harry trains the DA, Tom does rituals to get back to his peace Harry trains, and so on and so forth until they ultimately clash in an Armageddon style battle


** Have no idea the name, but one GOF fic had Harry refuse to participate. He lost his magic, and Voldemort, being equal, immediately lost his magic as well.

Voldemort was promptly killed by Lucius who had no intention of following a squib demon baby.

*** There is another one I vaguely remember where the goblet tries to steal his magic but the prophecy protects him since he has to be Voldemort's equal. I think it's a manipulative dumbledore one where he runs away and hides with Sirius after the goblet thing.

  Harry reckons his future is bleak if he stays at Hogwarts. The Tri-Wizard tournament offers him a fail-safe way of escaping his perceived destiny, that is until Harry discovered the hidden costs. H/Hr
