** Harry Potter and the prince of Slytherin I loved this story as it's a WBWL with a completely different twist on it. The author is still continuously updating and almost hit 1 million words. The story is greattt!!!!!

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

** Rather than give you links to some of my All Time Fav's, have a link to my Community on FFN, and ALL of my All Time Fav's. Not all of it is HP, but plenty of it is...

That should keep you busy for a few weeks, unless you've read it all already, or you have a different preference to me.

** I don't know if there are any "need-to-read" fics per se, but if you're looking for the most popular ones, a quick search on the sub should bring up some pretty big threads. I seem to remember someone compiling a list of the sub's most recommended fics, so that might be a good place to start!
