Other than Letters by TE7, what are some good fics where exchanging letters and penpals are prominent plot elements? Ideally with a romantic endgame and a starting point of PoA or later. Preferably only with 1on1 letter interactions rather than magical group chats in enchanted journals or the like. M/F or F/F pls, preferably with Harry or Hermione as a main character.


** The History Project by Colubrina is a Dramione that's an enchanted parchment between the two of them instead of letteds, but still solid.

Epistles by DrSallySparrow and olivieblake is entirely letters that show the growing friendship of Harry amd Draco (background Dramione and Hinny).

Notes On the Temptation of Peter and Heloise by PacificRimbaud is a Pansy/Percy that's also all notes/letters and it's super cute.

hermione/daphne with enchanted journal thing.

its not that great but its the only one i know offhand outside of what te7 wrote. if you do choose to read it then know it gets a bit better later on when the characters are a bit older.

Maybe I could convince you to write one with hp/katie bell.... =p

*** You joke, but I'm working on something with Harry and Katie (although not penpals), hopefully done by the end of the month.

I've bounced a few penpal ideas around with my beta, but we couldn't come up with a satisfying endgame. The current idea would be Harry/Fleur starting OotP and told almost exclusively through letters (so it should cover books 5 and 6 within 10k), but we are struggling to figure out how to resolve the Horcrux hunt arc.

**** Been pushing for harry and katie for a long time. its gonna be great to see one of the good writers take a shot at it.

I think for harry/fleur the issue with the horcrux arc is we dont know a ton about fleur's abilities. this means how you write her will have a major impact on what directions a story can logically take. ive seen it done several ways with fleur, the most satisfying for me personally is not living in a bloody tent for no reason and taking the fight to the enemy in some way. reacting to the enemy is how you lose.

I think that with the goal of trying to figure out obscure hints about where voldemort might have stashed his soul would be best done trying to infiltrate his organization as well as torturing death eaters for information. if the taboo on his name is still around it shouldnt be TOO hard to get a hold of some entry level thugs to start with anyway. traps are very effective even discounting the more silly uses of the taboo trap scenarios.

Not sure what the vibe you are trying to go for is but i could see fleur choosing to be used as bait in some scenarios, going well or not.

Personally I think fleur using some veela seduction on bellatrix to extract information could be a funny and different plot idea too.

for me the hard part of the end of the books is the hp vs voldemort fight, it never feels right unless one of them just destroys the other, but most people dislike that style of ending. something anticlimactic where its just all of the sudden over because in the end everyone dies and a fair fight is a stupid idea.

sorry for my rambling its stupid o'clock and ive been drinking throughout most of it.

***** Harry vs Voldemort is easy, a good ambush and he's gone even if he'd smear the wall with Harry in a fair fight. A point blank magazine of Polonium rounds from under the invisibility cloak, Gryffindor's sword in the back using the same method, plenty of ways to get rid of Voldemort.

I'm looking for something which avoids the Horcrux Hunt or resolves it in a manner you could easily summarize in a letter since I want to tell the whole story through them (which means oneshot or it'd be a drag).

As for the Katie one, I'm basically writing some of my own more humorous school experiences transferred to the HP universe. It should be entertaining, even if not the most romantic of stories.

****** personally i think the idea of waiting to confront voldemort till you find all of his horcruxes is silly. he has a magically made body, lock him in it. kill him over and over and over while you try to track down the remaining horcruxes. waiting to you find them all is asking for trouble.

how powerful is he? can he succumb to potions? muggle drugs? is his body super strong, can it be locked away? if you spend a bunch of money can you launch him and his horcruxes into space on an escape trajectory from the solar system just to mess with him more than death could? he might live forever but if his horcrux is out past the heliopause will his wraith still be able to do anything on earth? if it gets far enough away in will there be time lag that makes all his actions very humorous?

also, i approve of all harry/katie stories. it needs to become the new fad before i can finally rest from my crusade.

******* Why would Voldemort be bullet, sword or poison proof? He isn't superman. And given that the house elves turned the battle of Hogwarts armed like a peasant mob, it would not even be mugglewank.

Agreed on the timing, the canon method is more complicated, although getting rid of the Ministry control will be more difficult if not impossible without a costly final battle.

******** i dont know why voldemort would be proof against methods of demise. the point of not killing him is so that he doesnt go back to a wrath like he did post quirrell as well as somewhat nullifying his remaining horcruxes.

don't need to destroy them if you can keep him alive but imprisoned in some manner, or turning him insane. crucio the bastard for 30 hours and see what his horcruxes do, worth a try right?

i personally dont mind the ministry worth bothering with. they will flock to the winner of any battle(if you remove key voldemort supporters who push the agenda).

  Complete. Starting with a letter found in his bedside table when he assumes the role of Headmaster in 1997, Severus Snape and Hermione Granger begin a strange correspondence. The new Headmaster is glad for the comfort of a confidant, but Hermione has just one problem: it's the end of 1998, and Professor Severus Snape has been dead for months. A story of time and second chances.
