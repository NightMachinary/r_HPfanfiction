Where he doesn't go to a pureblood house and they ask him what he does if he comes across a dragon, he says run away, they respond "Oh how positively slytherin." Stuff like that. If it's focused on some child politics that's fine, just not so focused on "sneaking" and being "cunning". Something that seems like a real environment, not a made up world to be edgy.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] by mira mirth. I just recently read this story and I have to say this is one of the most realistic interpretations of Slytherin Harry I ever came across. It is basically a what-if story where Harry deviates from cannon.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

*** Whats confusing about this? In a typical slytherin harry story, the slytherins, despite being 11 and canon not showing any of them ever doing this, are all genius masterminds who find the optimal way to solve every problem with maximum sneakiness and minimum gryfindoorish recklessness, always finding a way around the wall instead of going through it. They also have ridiculously complex social interaction rules with tons of subtext and no overttext for no reason that they all understand implicitly and must be aware of at all times. Usually with some sort of mask over their real personality. Which is totally ridiculous since as stated they are 11 and people don't act like that. OP was asking for slytherin harry fics where that doesn't happen.
