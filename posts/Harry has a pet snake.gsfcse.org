Have any of you read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11047995][Amethyst]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/geoffaree/pseuds/geoffaree][geoffaree]]? I love it and I love the whole idea of Harry having a pet snake that he talks to and it helps him., and want to read others like it. I've also read A snake named Voldemort and got a kick out of it. Really I just want to read something with Harry hanging out with a snake and it being scaring or freaking people out maybe or him trying to show that being able to talk to snakes isn't evil. I prefer slash stories (doesn't have to be), Dark/Gray harry is good. Love smart or clever Harry. Dumbledore and Weasley bashing (not the twins) amuses me.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** Ever heard of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/288212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Psychic-Serpent][Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent]]? It's the first story in a trilogy and this fic covers 5th year. It has Harry hanging out with a snake. A lot of smut though, Harry gets smarter and stretches his wings a bit, (but he admittedly allows his hormones to control him), no Dumbledore or Weasley bashing. It's overall a very adult version of Harry Potter.

It's pretty good, but it's long.

**** For this fic, it's Harry/Hermione. In the later fics, which I never finished, it strongly hints towards Harry/Ginny. As I said, it rewrites the last 3 books. Ginny and Draco both take a much more active role in these fics and especially in the 3rd.

  Harry won the war against Voldemort but at a terrible price.Fawkes gives him another chance in a new world where he died as an infant and where Voldemort still lurks in the shadows...but not for long, because when one exists the other cannot survive. AU

  AU of PoA. Harry wakes in the night to a voice calling him from somewhere in the castle---and when he follows it, everything changes. Updated every Friday.
