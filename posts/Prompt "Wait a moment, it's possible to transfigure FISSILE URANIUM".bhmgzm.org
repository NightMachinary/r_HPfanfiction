** *Hermione Granger and the Power of the Atom*

Dumbledore sat down and started the meeting. "Welcome, I've just received a message from the Gringotts, they've found and destroyed a horcrux in Lestrange's vault. They were pretty terrified that it might possess someone and cause a security breach. With the locket from Grimmauld and the Diadem from the Room destroyed and Harry's scar extracted, that means there's only Nagini and Voldemort himself left. What's the status on them, Severus?"

"Not good, Albus. Voldemort is protecting Nagini with everything he can. She's pretty much always locked up behind the defenses of the Manor. Even if I would destroy my cover to try to kill her I probably wouldn't succeed."

"Excuse me, but if both Voldemort and Nagini as well as all the high profile Death Eaters are at Malfoy Manor, couldn't we end the war if we destroyed it in?", Hermione asked.

"And how do you propose to do that, Granger? The Manor's defenses are ancient and comparable to Hogwarts. With Albus weakened, half the Order dead and Voldemort defending it, there's no way to take it. At least not while keeping Voldemort from fleeing with Nagini. I say we lure him out with a bait that's perfect for Nagini to assassinate."

"Your plan requires Harry, and he won't be able to leave the Infirmary for months. I know my plan sounds absurd, but what if we had a weapon that could destroy Malfoy Manor before they realize they're attacked? Wouldn't that work?"

Everyone in the room stared at Hermione.

"Are you saying that you have such a weapon, Miss Granger?", Dumbledore asked.

"Not right now, but I've been looking through the Alchemy books you've given me, and I think I found a method to make one. It'd probably take quite a bit of work and some exotic elements that I'd need your help with, but I think it's doable and according to my rough calculations it'd be absurdly powerful. More than enough to punch through the defenses of the Manor."

"And how would that weapon work, Miss Granger? Destroying such ancient protections takes quite a bit of power."

"The details are a bit complicated, but basically it'd abuse a trick in the transformation of one element into another to release energy. Severus would have to smuggle it inside, but it shouldn't be detected by any magical threat detection spells. Once it's inside and Severus has gotten out, we could remotely activate it."

"And it would kill the Dark Lord and Nagini, Granger?", Snape asked, no longer completely dismissing the idea.

"And everyone else inside and close by. It wouldn't be a very precise weapon."

"That sounds a lot like Dark Magic, Miss Granger", Dumbledore questioned, now looking worried.

"It's not!", Hermione defended. "Just some alchemy to prepare the exotic elements and a shrinking charm remotely activated through a protean."

"And it would kill everyone inside?"

"They're all Death Eaters!", Ron shouted.

"Voldemort also marked some children, not any older than yourself."

"The youngest Death Eaters are all in the Slytherin dorm, they won't be at the Manor when we'll be attack."

"Alright", Dumbledore gave in. "I'll help you with the alchemy, Miss Granger, and if it works, we'll use it."

--------------

Snape arrived at the Order meeting in a hurry. "I've deposited the Device in my potion lab in the Manor a few days ago, it's set up and ready. There are currently no prisoners at the Manor and Narcissa is away too. I ordered all the elves on a long shopping trip. The Dark Lord and Nagini are confirmed inside. The only other current residents are the Lestranges, Dolohov, Avery and Pettigrew. I say we end it now."

"Good. Let's end this war.", Hermione said. "Let's do it. To the observation spot."

With a /crack/, Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore and Snape apparated to the hill a few miles away from the manor.

"Are you sure the muggles won't notice anything?", Hermione asked.

Dumbledore took out the Elder Wand and spoke a complicated incantation. "The entire area is hidden. The Malfoy's didn't want any muggles anywhere near their Manor."

"Perfect. Otherwise we could do this. Ready?"

"Ready."

"Do it, Hermione!"

"Alright Granger, let's see what you got."

Hermione took out the protean-charmed counterpart to the activator. Removing all 3 safeties, one after the other. "This is it. Voldemort, this is what muggleborns can do!"

She placed her wand tip on the activator and pushed a tiny bit of magic into it.

In Snape's brewing room in the basement of the manor, the corresponding piece activated, triggering a prepared shrinking charm.

The shrinking charm imploded the small, subcritical sphere of alchemically enriched uranium to a fraction of it's former size. Suddenly, each neutron from a splitting atom triggered more than one other fission, causing the amount of splitting atoms to grow exponentially.

E=mc² did its thing.

A fraction of a second later, the four Order members only saw a flash of light as the ancient Malfoy Manor disintegrated in a massive fireball.

Voldemort's body and his horcrux had both been instantly vaporized from the gamma rays released from the nuclear explosion less than fifty feets away, and his soul lost its grasp on the mortal plane before he realized that something had happened.

As the shockwave safely washed over Dumbledore's shield charm, Hermione heard a sudden scream of pain.

"Severus! Professor Snape! Are you... Are you alright?"

"Ah, it's the Mark. He's gone. It's dissolving. It bloody hurt, but it's gone", he answered, teeth clenched.

"Are you sure it's not doing any serious harm?", Dumbledore asked.

"Yeah man, that looks awful, we should get you to Madam Pomfrey!"

"I wasn't aware that you particularly cared for my wellbeing, Weasley."

"Hey, I mean you're not my favorite professor, but I don't want you dead, you're one of the good guys, one of us!"

"Well, thanks, I'm fine, the pain disappeared pretty quickly. Now, let's take a look at what's left of the Manor?"

The four looked at the smoldering crater where the Manor had just been, surrounded by a burning mess that had, just seconds before, been a forest. The mushroom cloud that had risen above overshadowed the scene,

After a short silence, Ron spoke up. "Hermione, don't you think you overdid it a little bit? I mean, the muggles shouldn't notice but the Ministry will!"

"That was roughly half a kiloton, Ron. That's about as small as you can go with nuclear bombs. Muggles have ones thousands of times bigger."

"I don't think it would be smart to reveal what really happened... I guess we could probably create a story of a failed dark ritual", Dumbledore said. "Unless you want to be famous as the Girl-Who-Nuked, Miss Granger?"

"No, of course not, that would be ridiculous, although somewhat true I guess. Failed dark ritual sounds believable, and nobody knows enough about the kind of magic Voldemort used to notice anything. We definitely don't want others playing around with magical nukes. Let's summon and vanish all the radioactive waste before the aurors arrive, it should only be a few kilos. After that we return to Hogwarts. Harry will have a lot of questions."

** My approach to this is something like the following:

/We start off on a sound canon basis.../

- Alchemy is real in the HP universe.

- Alchemy describes the world in a fundamentally different way to Muggle chemistry.

- Therefore if alchemy is true, Muggle chemistry cannot be correct.

- Transfiguration (and other magic which concerns matter) presumably operates on the basis of the true, magical theory of matter, not on the basis of the incorrect Muggle chemistry.

/Now for the more speculative (i.e. completely made up) elements.../

- "Uranium" does not actually exist. Muggles have erred in identifying it as an independent element. As all wizards know, there are only seven metals.

- What the Muggles have identified as the element Uranium is actually a form of lead. It differs from regular lead in the amount of the element of fire it contains.

- When a wizard uses transfiguration to create lead, it will always create regular lead. You would need to perform alchemy, not transfiguration, to create fire-rich lead.

- Wizards therefore cannot transfigure themselves a lump of "fissile uranium".

#+end_quote

Modern technology doesn't break for the same reason that bridges designed on the basis of Newtonian physics don't collapse. Just because something is fundamentally wrong in the way it describes the world doesn't mean it can't be useful, so long as you limit its domain to areas where its wrongness does not come into play.

Nor does something being fundamentally wrong prevent it from making accurate predictions. For example, our most accurate models of fluid dynamics still contain obviously "wrong" elements such as bodies of water with infinite depth. Nonetheless they generate useful and accurate predictions.

As for "imaging atoms", this isn't strictly speaking an accurate description of the process of electron microscopy. An image of an atom is not possible; they are smaller than the wavelength of light. The "images" produced by electron microscopy are really more like visualisations or graphs than images: they are produced by interpreting data through the lens of atomic theory. In the business this is known as "theory laden observation".

If these ideas interest you, I recommend looking into the philosophy of science, which is a fascinating subject. For now, all that's really worth noting is that there are plenty of perfectly credible views of science in real life where the contents of scientific theories are not considered "true" in a naive sense, never mind in the Harry Potter world where magic exists.

(If anyone is interested, personally I am a constructive empiricist with a bit of structural realism thrown into the mix.)

** 1. Even if you have unlimited supplies of fissile material, you can use it to achieve [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass][criticality]], but it would fizzle and irradiate, not explode. You also need a lot of very precise (and largely classified) engineering to make an explosion with meaningful yield.
2. This is headcanon territory, but I don't think you can transfigure something based on properties that are purely theoretical to you. If I gave you a block of U235, a block of U238, and a block of tungsten, would you be able to even tell which is which? If not, how can you tell magic what you want? It also explains why nobody transfigures chemical weapons. You can do that in principle, yes---but you have to expose yourself to them and experience their effects first.

*** Being able to tell which is which is not actually that hard unless you are putting a lot of constraints in place (random size pieces, cannot interact with them in any way besides visually, no chemical testing, no measuring of any variety etc).

I could quickly tell which was which was tungsten and which was uranium and with some tools and testing could tell you which was pure u235 vs u238 but i would say that the avg person off the street with no knowledge of chemistry or metal working or access to tools or the internet would have a harder time of it.

As for making a bomb with a meaningful yield. If you are willing to kill everyone involved in the process, can get unlimited materials, and you goal is only to destroy something the size of malfoy manor? Totally doable. No need to atomize the manor, a fizzle that is super messy and wasteful and only blows up with the force of a ton (or 1000 tons) of tnt while also just drenching the area in extreme amounts of radiation would do the job just fine.

If hermione conjured it in the forest behind the manor, assembled anything that needed to be done, handed it off to snape who transported it inside and took it out of a bag like hermione's and left it in and detonated it.... wouldnt matter if hermione died within hours or days from extreme exposure or that snape killed himself in the explosion. Hermione could have chosen to sacrifice herself or just didnt know better on one of the steps, maybe her containment during the summon was bad or she didnt understand the dangers of one or more aspects of the event. Snape could choose to sacrifice himself, be unaware of the dangers, or be tricked/sacrificed by hermione. She could have even lied and set up a fake timer making him think he could get away safe after pressing a button which immediately detonated a simple gun type u235 weapon.

Just remember that even a fizzle is good enough sometimes.

Keeping in mind that we are discussing headcanon---rules that I made up that are not derived directly from canon but are consistent with its plot and spirit---I'd draw the line at using tools. You can look at it, touch it, smell it, even taste it, but you can't weigh it on a scale or perform a chemical assay.

To use a more familiar example, you can transfigure a matchstick into a needle, and you can decide on the colouration of that needle (and the metallic composition might be adjusted accordingly), but you can't dictate its exact composition, unless you are so intimately familiar with it that you could tell the difference by sight and similar.

#+begin_quote
  The rest of it

Maybe. Even assuming someone can do the transfiguration, the sort of fizzle that you describe sounds like it already requires quite a bit of finicky engineering, since you want an actual explosion rather than just a criticality or a meltdown.

***** yeah with no tools or scales or chemistry it would be hard. uranium will weigh more, if you keep the size of the blocks consistent or keep the weight consistent but have different size you should be able to tell.

if you are presented with a random piece of metal with no sure thing to compare it to and no real way to do proper testing on it? yeah you are pretty fucked.

To be clear, not trying to say what you can or cannot have as headcanon, was just presenting my views.

As for making a bomb, you can make actual tnt pretty easily even with wizarding or off the shelf level technology. If you are able to transfigure or conjure steel as well as tungsten carbide or even just lead and proper u235 you can make an actual bomb. You can probably skip the tnt component even if you make sure of the sort of pocket dimensions they mess with in books/fanfics depending on what they can do with them.

gun type u235 weapons are really simple and if you accept fizzles that explode as well then anyone with a wand (and ability to transfigure things perfectly) a scale to weigh the components and either a book on early nuclear weapons or access to the internet could make them. They are childsplay compared to modern nuclear weapons. There is a reason no real attempt is made to hide those particular designs anymore. Making u235 is hard, making a low yield nuke from them is not.

IIRC we didnt even test the design we ended up using for "little boy" because of how simple it was and it is thought that only around 1% of the uranium underwent fission still resulting in a 15kt yield

At room temperature, tungsten is about 1% more dense than U238 and about 2% more dense than U235 (from what I can gather). I chose it it for a reason. :)

Regarding headcanon, my note about that was a preemptive disclaimer, not a response to you, because I could be completely wrong. It could just be that anyone with a NEWT in Transfiguration and some rudimentary knowledge of Muggle sciences can do it, all sides are aware of the possibility, but everybody knows that the other side knows as well. This leads to Mutually-Assured Destruction situation: if anyone starts conjuring nukes, there won't /be/ a Britain left to fight over.

​

Ultimately, you are right that it's up to the fic author how difficult it turns out to be. Some Hermiones don't bother with nukes and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][just Geminio together a whole bunch of conventional explosives and drop them from brooms]].

Seriously? well shit you got me with that one. I knew about where tungsten and uranium were on the periodic table and just assumed that with that much of a difference in atomic weights even with whatever structure the atoms took in default metallic form tungsten would surely be lighter. Tis what i get for making assumptions about how much things weigh.

*** Several questions would need to be answered for this:

- Malfoy manor possedes several magical protections (wards in fanon), probably more has been installed after it becames Voldemort HQ. Since Transfiguration would be one of the biggest risk for an infiltration, would the protections recognises that Snape tried to enter with a transfigured item, and if so end the spell?
- Apparition, or even floo are not the most "confortable" way of travel. Since a nuke is not the most stable thing in the world, isn't there a risk that Spane apparition point (outside the protections from what we see at the start of book 7) becomes the center of a smoldering crater?
- How does the protection around Malfoy manor works? Does it black every apparation, apparations in and out, and just apparition in. And even if this case, Dumbledore was able to apparate inside Hogwarts, to Lucius should be able to leave the second there is a problem (and probably Voldemort too since I can't see him delegate his protection to someone else, especially with something that could harm him).
- Would a magical shield be able to protect from a nuke? Magic can destroy a magical shield, but we don't really know how strong they are and if there is a "physical limit" after what even a muggle can break it.
- After the blast, would the irradiated zone be as dangerous for magical than muggles? Or can magical just ignore it cause they don't have cancers or just clean the place.

​

In general, I don't like to use muggles items in Harry Potter, mainly because I don't think it would work, magical in canon ARE better than muggles (physically more resistants, live longer and . . . magic). Most of points raised by muggle wankers does not work in my opinion

- Wizards are not logic and don't seem to care about science yes, but they have magic, they can litterally turn the sky pink or transform things into another. We use logic to understand world, their world can be changed by a whim so logic is not that usefull.
- They have a different political system, but rather than a country with millions of inhabitants, wizard are more like a little town. Same reason why their economy is like this (not enough people to substain the globalised economy we have here). And no they are not subject of the Queen, Minister for Magic keep a link with Prime Minister mainly by politness, so he is not surprised when strange things happen. But a muggleborn going into magical world is litteraly an immigrant.
- Gun beats wand : absolutely nothing in canon hint at it. And considering how muggle are destroyed by death Eater for fun, it's probably worse.

So yeah, I don't like seeing things like muggle bombs or nuke in a fanfic. But the main other reason is that Voldemort is on the other side. He may hate muggles, but as he says, power is power. If somehow a muggle invention would work in the war (like a nuke), I give the good guy 1 month to celebrate before nukes explode in every important locations (plus several in important muggle city cause why not).

***** Protego can block physical objects (Harry uses it in DH to stop Hermione from beating Ron when he comes back, and maybe also against falling debris when they flee the Lovegood house), so the question is if it's powerful enough to hide bullet.

​

For the firearms, Wikipedia says /"Members of the public may own sporting rifles and shotguns, subject to licensing, but handguns were effectively banned after the/ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_school_massacre][/Dunblane school massacre/]] /in 1996 with the exception of Northern Ireland."./\\
Since I don't know how long it took to ban weapons, I don't know if a majority of the public still had their firearm during the end of the 2nd blood war (1995-1998), but even without them, some villages were completely destroyed, including armed people on place such as policeman (and in worst case, Dementor can't die, are invisible for Muggles and can kill everyone).

​

Voldemort is a halfblood who grew up in muggle London. While most of his informations may not be up to date in the 1990s, I doubt he would don't know about something as big as a nuke. And should he not know about it, he can still find the information between his talents in legilimency and the good guy having to explain how they destroyed Malfoy Manor (no matter how stupid the Ministry is, if someone completely destroy a old manor full of enchantments in a matter of seconds, you try to understand how they did it if only to make sure it's not used but someone else). I gave a one month delai to give Voldemort the time to find the information, of course it's only if he survives the 1st strike.

They're designed to stop what you want them to stop. They do stop physical objects, as we see in Deathly Hallows and Crimes of Grindelwald. Magic in HP doesn't work on some mechanical kinetic energy, so I don't see why it wouldn't shield against muggle weaponry.

****** I always liked the idea of magic being able to stop a bullet or a series of bullets but bullets being faster than human reaction speed (protego stops small arms fire but needs to be in place before the shot was fired).

It gives both sides something to work with in the fics that take it that direction.

******* Depends on the situation. I'd say a decent wizard can flick that wand quicker than a muggle could raise the gun, aim, and fire. But if it's an ambush, yeah, the wizard in question is likely dead. Unless the likes of Fred and George's "Shield Hats" work just like a normal Shield Charm does.

******** Exactly that, depends on the situation. imo that makes for much better stories than x beats x every time. In some sort of a duel where it was gun vs wand with a nice clear countdown id say wand most of the time as well. But like you say ambushes could be highly effective.

I always thought the shield hat thing was dumb. The idea that many adult wizards could not cast a shield charm sounded way too unrealistic. Especially if you go with the idea that most or all of them went to hogwarts and that harry could teach it to a bunch of kids in an evening.

I prefer to think of the shield hats and similar things as a bit like body armour from the muggle world. Better than nothing, doesnt stop heavy hitting things but can help in some scenarios.

Scenario would be that if someone is going to cast a stupefy at your back a shield vest could stop or partially negate the spell and give you a chance to fight back. If stupefy works the same on a leg as a torso and you had no shield pants then a hit there would take you down. Same scenario but if we assume instead of a stupefy being cast its a bone breaker or some sort of dark cutting, piercing, or explosive curse the shield vest does little to stop it due to lack of power.

On a somewhat unrelated note, the killing curse is stupid and should not have been a thing unless there are some really extreme restrictions on being able to cast it. When im thinking of stories i usually put it in 1 of 2 categories. It either warps your soul to cast it, permanently changing and corrupting you or having some extreme cost like 7 years of your life. The second category is that it just doesn't exist, it's too overpowered and silly otherwise.

Otherwise incompetent death eaters can cast a spell repeatedly which is not blockabled by magical shields and causes instant death? tis not right.
