  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Harry was sick of it all. So when he catches Draco in Snape's private stores, he decides that he isn't going to stand back and let Draco lie about it. During the fight, a rare and unusual herb is hit, and Harry gets splashed with the concoction...and wakes up in his parent's fourth year! Determined not to be used again, he befriends a younger Snape and changes his name.

** Difficult to say what my favorite story is, but here are a couple recent ones I've enjoyed:

A Step to the Right by CatsAreCool linkffn(12972342) - it's a Harmony story (fair warning) and not really time-travel but travel to an alternate universe instead, but the end result is the same. There are some key differences in the world and the last chapter of the story, which was only posted a couple of days ago, makes it clear why that's the case and gives some hints about the things to come in the sequel. I really enjoyed this, because the setting is creatively different. The author writes a bit long-winded though, the last time he completed a novel length story, it took him 4 years to write >850k words.

JacobApples has already been mentioned as an author, but I like his story Laughing All the Way to London linkffn(13173587) more. Okay, it doesn't exactly match your requirements as Harry is a few years older than the Marauders, but I enjoyed their interactions in this story a bit more.
