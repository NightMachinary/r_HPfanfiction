Any pairing is fine, fem!Harry is fine (as long as she is still paired with a woman), the story should have a main plot which goes beyond "we have to fuck" or the reason for why they are boning and stick to just one woman as partner.

Obviously no m/m, no multi/harems, no non-consensual stuff, no teenage marriages or pregnancies, preferably no Death Eater whitewashing and preferably no Ron/Hermione in the background.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4625848/1/In-Case-of-Emergency][In Case of Emergency]], linkffn(4625848), is a smut fic that has a real plot. R/Hr in the background though.

  When Harry and Ginny broke up, they thought they were each doing what was right for the other But is it possible for them to be "just friends", especially when it seems like someone keeps trying to kill them? Mature sexual themes.

"A Life So Very Much Less Than Ordinary": Harry/Luna with discussed past Harry/Ginny (they're divorced now) and a very briefly mentioned James Sirius/Teddy pairing. (I know you said "no m/m", but trust me, it's not the focus of the story at all and the H/L smut here is good enough that you'll overlook the m/m background stuff.)

Yeah, the interpersonal interactions are nice, but the plot not so much. It has not aged well.

**** Really? Maybe I need to reread it. I just got into FF about a year ago so had plenty of great stuff to read. I read this early on and loved the training, 007 vibe, and the team work tactics stuff.

***** My two biggest issues are the fact that 16 year old Harry is way too overpowered and the fact that you could cut 100k words and actually improve the story by doing so. There's no need for several scenes, each at least 5k words, when the sentence "Harry spent the afternoon practicing shield charms and blasting curses" would do the trick. The Battle Royale Arena was nice, but the constant training montages really dragged on.
