Im looking for a fic where Harry is a magical creature. None of that "Special Type of werewolf that can transform whenever he wants" crap.

I want a fic where, yes, he gets new abilities, and yes, he will wreck most people around him, but he needs to have problems that can't be solved with flinging spells, or throwing money at it until it works.

Also, if its a vampire Harry fic I will love you and you will be my best friend.

Over 70k+ words!

EDIT: No slash!

linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) is /almost/ a creature!Harry fic, but it's close enough that I think you'll enjoy it anyway. Read it and you'll see what I mean. As a bonus, it's complete and has a sequel.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

If you'd change "hate" to "dislike", then the following reaction would not be as severe, I would imagine.

Well, yes of course. It is exclusively the fault of the others that the choice of words you decided to go for doesn't sit well with them. Any and all blame can be attributed to the level of intelligence of this community.

** The two I can think of are Harry/Draco slash, but I will include them just in case you are desperate:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem with Purity by Phoenix_Writing]] is Hermione-focused, but it's very long, I thought it was well-written, and I read it a couple times a year.

I recall a story where Harry's animagus form is a crup, and he befriends Draco in crup form. They are both at Hogwarts helping to rebuild it. I thought it was called "Harry the Crup", but I can't seem to find it. Maybe someone else remembers more and can find it?

** The only vampire Harry I know is Forever Knight, and it's not even a relevant part of the story until near the end. It's centrally Vampire Hermione. Overall I enjoyed it for all 3 times I read it.
