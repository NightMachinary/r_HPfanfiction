** Why do I feel like every single story that fits this criteria will have a nauseating amount of either Dumbledore bashing or Voldemort apologizing? Which is a shame since it could be rad as fuck.

*** Wait, what? People write fics where Voldemort /apologizes/? I mostly agree with certain Dumbledore bashing fics, though. Like, based on mostly canon reasons and not making Dumbledore evil, just patronizing and so secure in his views that he knows what is right for the "Greater Good" that a little hurt to a little orphaned boy shouldn't mean much to protect the rest of the world.

***** Ah. Yeah, Voldemort's actions of murder and chaos and whatever else shouldn't be reasoned with, though I don't mind if someone takes his ideals and mentions how he was correct. Like, Harry realizing that what he said about "There is no good or evil, only power or those to weak to seek it" is kinda true. But to make excuses for the way Voldemort went about things? Yeah, that's not gonna slide. Having Harry have some of his ideals (not pureblood supremecy, of course) and using them in a politically or morally grewy way is cool, though. Like Harry realizes that Muggleborn aren't the problem, it's the purebloods who don't teach them the ways of wizards and blah blah blah.

******* I personally believe that he was simply using them and their ideals for a means to an end. He believed himself to be a Mudblood originally, and so he allied himself with powerful families who he could rule over to help him with whatever he wanted to do with the wizarding world. Perhaps not killing all Muggles and Mudbloods, but maybe bringing back the "Old Ways" and teaching Mudbloods the ways of the wizarding world, which they should have been doing beforehand. They probably crossed out all rituals and anything that could possibly make Mudbloods differ from purebloods during Grindewald's fascist stupidity to rule over Muggles and Muggleborn.

**** The thing is, greater good fics have no bearing in canon Dumbledore. He left that ideology in Nurmengard with Grindelwald. He truly believed keeping Harry Potter at the Dursleys was the only way to keep him alive. If he really was espousing Greater Good mentalities he would have done what a lot of goofy fics do where Dumbledore raises him from birth into a child soldier to throw at Lord Voldemort

Hermione: I will change the world! Everything is backwards, blood purity? Bullsh*t here biology! Why quills?? Parchment? AND NOW SLAVES? I'm surrounded by idiots.

*** Basically, Harry is abused by the Dursleys or has suffered in an orphanage like Riddle (canon divergence obviously), Hermione has been bullied all her life for her appearance and her smarts and she's not about to be hexed by a shit ton of blood supremicts because they believe her beneath them, and Ron has ambitions to be different from the rest of the Weasley clan amongst other things. Harry will have already formed a mask to deal with the abuse of home, Hermione would have been used to the bullying as well and she would learn counter curses and hexes to ward off the worst of the racists, and Ron comes from a family from the Sacred Twenty-Eight so he was taught at least some things about politics and he has a wealth of information about the wizarding world that Harry and Hermione don't have. It's a little AU, obviously, but everything could be twisted to fit.
