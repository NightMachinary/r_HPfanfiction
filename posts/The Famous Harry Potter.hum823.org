So I originally wanted this to be a Discussion/Debate, but in the end I also want Fic recs for it so I'm making it a request.

One of the biggest things that always annoyed me about the Books, & the fic is the general Rejection of Harry's fame. Logically, I understand but we're applying Adult logic to a Kid/Teen. Every kid imagines being famous, having people pay attention & listen to what you have to say; especially one like Harry who was neglected.

‚Äã

So what I'd like to get are some fics where Harry embraces/Learns to Embrace, enjoys aspects of & uses his fame to his advantage.

‚Äã

- Slash is preferable, but I will accept all Recs
- The more rare/Unique the pair the better. I find myself getting bored with Popular/Common Pairs


** IIRC, Harry is quite happy to have his accomplishments acknowledged when it comes to things like quidditch, something that can be attributed to his own talent and skill. I wish more authors would run a bit more with that rather than go the whole ‚Äúno one ever look at me‚Äù route.

I would like to read a story where Harry honest to god works for something, be it quidditch or duelling or whatever, to be the best. I think that would be fun.

*** I know. I quite agree & I do remember reading one some years ago, but all I remember about it is that it was Independent!Harry, Harry/Draco (I think) & Harry Sets up a Quidditch Summer camp for underprivileged young wizards & Witches that Oliver Wood staffed. Sadly, I can't remember the name of it for the Life of Me! ü§î

** I read most of the way through linkffn(Amalgum - Lockhart's Folly) and thought it did quite a good job of blending Harry's personality with Lockhart's, although it later veered into Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Peverell-British territory (ok, not Lord British, but you get the idea).

GildeHarry mentors his younger self in things like establishing a working relationship with Colin Creevey, to distribute official signed photos, so that people aren't motivated to snap pictures while he's showering, and he can use the proceeds for charitable causes. Talking to the press and putting his own version of events out there, so that they don't just snoop and speculate and bow to the whims of people like Lucius Malfoy. And I really like how he ran the pixie lesson.

*** You know, I ran across this fic some yrs ago & skipped it. Fics with Gilderoy sort of squick me generally & the summary just didn't hook me, but this... your description did. That & I actually like the "Hyphenated-Lord" cliche. So I will definitely give it a look. Thanks

**** A caution on the "squick" angle: Although Harry does veto some of Lockhart's ambitions regarding the female population of Hogwarts and serve as a moral compass, he doesn't come up with a convincing argument against hooking up with the female teachers if they're up for it. Not sure how you feel about that.

***** Well, as my post says, I do /prefer/ slash but I have been known to venture into het if I think the story/premise is exceptional or promising and not too graphic, which it is Ffn so... & I did say I accepted all recs.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

** I'd love to see a fic where he takes Lockhart's advice about managing his fame seriously and ends up becoming a sort of apprentice to him.

I've read a few that had a minor side plot related to that but none where it was a major part of the story.
