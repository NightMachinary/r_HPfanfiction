** Harry lives with the malfoys in Linkffn(Enveloped in the Darkness) and Linkffn(Embraced by the Darkness) (its sequel). While the focus isn't on that, there are definitely some cool scenes where he's at their house.

  There is a reason why everyone wants a piece of Harry Potter; the twelve-year-old is considered a prodigy by the Wizarding World, after all. But Harry has chosen his side. The Headmaster and Minister of Magic can try as they might - Harry is a dark wizard. Now...if only he could get in touch with the elusive, recently resurrected Voldemort. Sequel to Enveloped in the Darkness.

  Harry was left at an orphanage after his parents met their demise. There, he finds nothing but suffering until he rejoins the Wizarding World. Dumbledore may hope for Harry to be a kind soul, but he's made mistakes. And what he gets is a future Death Eater. Harry is Dark, Harry is ruthless, and he is siding with Voldemort.

** Harry is more of a "second son" in this fic, as he is legally raised by Sirius. He spends a lot of time at the Manor, and Narcissa is a surrogate mother. Linkffn(Like Brothers)

** On a related note, I was reading the wikipedia profile of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Isaacs][Jason Isaacs]] and saw something that made me wonder. Towards the end, in a quote attributed to Jason, he states

  They just think, who's that t*** in black tie?

Can someone PM me what the censored slur is? I've spent a few minutes googling it, and haven't figured it out. Thanks.
