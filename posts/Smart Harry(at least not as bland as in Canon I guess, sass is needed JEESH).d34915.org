So guys I am in crisis. The fanfictions I read so far Harry is acting dumb and being too reckless. I am in need of some FanFiction where Harry uses more of his Slytherin side, and is not actually daft(please don't mistake me, I know Harry is smart when he needs to but it's bland and cringeworthy when he seemingly only has two modes, intense and daft)


** Harry Potter Geek of Magic - linkffn(12703694) I don't know if it's what you meant, but he's: very smart, extremely talented, socially inept and probably a little autistic. A smashing read, though.

The Mind Arts - linkffn(12740667) This has a fairly smart Harry. Very Slytherin like and quite studious, but not mean or bullying.

Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament - linkffn(13140418) A very curious fic. Quite unique in several aspects. Harry is way smarter than in the original, he's more calculating but still similar to canon Harry to be recognizable, he develops slowly as the story progresses and becomes more canny as the result.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  A disillusioned Harry Potter gets ready to take on a Triwizard Tournament that captures international attention. He finds a new home, mentor, friends, allies and works to become his own man. Follow Harry as he dives into international waters and finds out if he is a shark or a minnow. Rated M in case something rated M is added in the future.
