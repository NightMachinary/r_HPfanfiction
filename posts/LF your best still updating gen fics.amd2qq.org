As I've seem to run out of decent new H/Hr fics to read, I've become more and more interested in gen fics. Don't really care who is the main protagonist or the setting, as long as it's well written and not abandoned. To start, I recommend linkffn(Made of Common Clay, Children of the Sun) and linkao3(Lollies and Loki)

Thanks!

#+begin_quote
  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power. Translated from Russian.)

#+begin_quote
  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13553343][Albus Dumbledore and the Boy Who Lived]] linkao3(13553343) is one of those rare fics that writes Dumbledore as he actually is in the books, rather than making him either a twinkly-eyed grandfather-figure or a stone-cold Machiavellian manipulator, and with good writing to boot.

I've long had a love/hate relationship with all the Snape-becomes-Harry's-guardian fics because found family is one of my favorite tropes, but the, shall we say, creative interpretations of Snape's characterization can quickly become frustrating. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/741255][The Problem Universe]], starting with linkao3(10588629) is maybe the best of the bunch in that regard. (The sequel is currently updating.)

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
