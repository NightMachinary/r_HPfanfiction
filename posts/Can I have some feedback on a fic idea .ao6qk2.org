I'm a massive fan of the Hitman games . My idea goes that after the war,a group of former DA members disgusted by the lack of punishment many Voldermort supporters received form a splinter cell who begin assassinating several prominent blood purists ( The Malfoys,Umbridge,Mrs.Zabini etc. ) in very Hitmanny ways. The meat of a chapter would focus on an assassination intercut with the planning of the hits,the relationships of the splinter cell members ( who include Dennis,Padma,Michael,Seamus,Lavender and Justin ) and the original trio's attempts to track the splinter cell down ( not knowing their identities )


** For reference assassination methods used in the Hitman games include tricking a target's father into blowing up her car, feeding a drug lord to his own pet hippo,derailing a train so that it smashs through a target's base and trapping a target in an effigy .

** I would argue that Hermione would be leading the hitman group. She is shown to have a strong sense of justice, does not stand for unfair treatment and can be utterly ruthless if need be. And she could easily use emotional blackmail to get Harry on board (Do you want me to be murdered? Don't you want justice for Teddy's parents?).

*** I suppose. Maybe after a few high profile targets die Hermione connects the dots and confronts Lavender . Much to Lavender's surprise Hermione wants in and points them toward the next target - A corrupt attorney who got several Snatchers off the hook

**** Hermione is quick to resort to violence when she feels that it is justified and she does not feel bad about it afterwards (she got Umbridge either gang-raped or brutalised by centaurs and didn't bat an eye).

It would make more sense if there were multiple groups of hitmen. Harry, Hermione, maybe Ron, (although he seems to be rather black and white when it comes to morality) as well as the DA group you have in mind. The trio goes after the big fish (Malfoy, Umbridge, anyone from the Muggleborn registration), the DA starts with the collaborators (first from Hogwarts, then in the Ministry).

**** I would also think both Hermione and Harry would team up with them. /sits back and stares at bleepbloopbotz until he starts posting this story/

** Sounds pretty cool to me. Although I could see Ron or more likely George supporting the cell in some way.

** I would think the group would be the ones who lost someone close to them like dennis and george. I dont remember the other people you listed as having a loved one die. I'd say hannah abbot would make a good member as a large portion of her family was murdered by Voldemort.

What if it were lead by say andromeda Tonka though? She lost her cousins (Sirius and regulus). husband, daughter and son in law.

*** Michael was horrifically tortured by the Carrows,Lavender was mauled by Greyback,Justin was forced on the run as a muggle-born,In my headcanon,Parvati dies in the battle and Seamus just wants to spill some blood. Good idea with Andromeda being involved . Maybe as not an active member but as a source of information e.g. Telling the cell where Narcissa would likely flee to following the deaths of her son and husband.

**** Honestly there's good evidence that lavender isn't even alive. If you're going to argue Michael is out for blood because of torture then you'd have to include neville too. There's not any evidence that would point to Michael really wanting revenge.

***** I suppose I could justify Michael - Maybe I'll have Anthony die in the battle too. As for Lavender,plenty of fics have her survive the encounter with Greyback albeit in the same sort of condition as Bill.

** Well, I'd totally read it. I agree with Hellstrike on that Hermione (and maybe Harry) would get in on it, though I really do like the idea of it mostly being from minor characters' PoVs.

Does this mean Lavender survived Greyback's assault? Did he survive too? That could be great start---Lavender getting back at the werewolf who tore most of her throat out...

Oh, see, now you've gotten me excited. If you do end up writing and posting it, please, please, /please/ do a Self-Promo so that we can come check it out

*** Greyback is definitely on the chopping block. I'll probably have him be target three or four ( Mrs. Zabini will most likely be first )
