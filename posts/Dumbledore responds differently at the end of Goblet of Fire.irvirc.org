I've had this plot bunny in my head for nearly a year. I'm no writer, but I finally decided to type it out today, and it turned into the first chapter of what I hope is a halfway decent fanfic. I wonder if anyone is interested in picking it up and making a story of it, so here's what I have so far;

.. "Quickly now John, hurry up", Cornelius urged, his patronus beginning to fade even as the Auror levitated Crouch Jr into the classroom. "Here will do, quickly man, set him down" he said as he turned to the dementor hovering in the corner and continued, "I, as acting Minister of Magic, do hereby sentence Bartemius Crouch Junior to-"

A blinding light suddenly filled the room as a phoenix patronus flew right through the door and crashed into the dementor and dissolved it with a bang and a shower of sparks. As Cornelius tried to regain his bearings, Dumbledore calmly strode into the room and sealed the door. Auror Dawlish tried to intercept but fell over and began snoring as Dumbledore walked by him.

Fudge found himself lifted and tied to a class chair similar to the one Crouch Jr was in, bound and unconscious. Dumbledore then sat in a conjured plush chair and just stared at him, his eyes hard without their usual twinkle, though his face remained blank.

"What is the meaning of this, Dumbledore? What do you think you're doing? Release-", Fudge was cut off as he found himself mute.

"I thought we agreed you'd never bring dementors into Hogwarts again, Cornelius", Dumbledore said as he leaned forward and steepled his fingers, "I let you host this Merlin-be-damned Tournament here, let you bring dragons into my school, and now a student is dead and Voldemort is back." Dumbledore frowned then as he folded his arms.

"And now you want Crouch Kissed so you can sweep everything under the rug. You tried this with Sirius last year, and again you wish to hide the truth about Voldemort with a Dementor's Kiss. Not today." Dumbledore pulled a pebble out of his robes along with his wand and whispered 'Portus' as he dropped it in Fudge's lap.

''I have convened an emergency meeting of the Wizengamot. I'm taking Crouch here with me to answer some questions, under Veritaserum, in a trial at the Grand Chamber. The truth of Voldemort's return comes out today, whether you like it or not". Fudge's eyes widened at that and he began to struggle against his bonds.

Dumbledore wasn't done however, "Before I leave, I want you to have this", he said as he pulled out a formal-looking parchment from his robes and placed it with the pebble. "That is my resignation from my post as Chief Warlock, dated two hours from now, which is also when that portkey is set to take you back to the ministry. The letter also contains a decree of independence for Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest and the Village of Hogsmeade, from the Magical State of Great Britain." That shocked Fudge into stillness.

"I'm going to war with Voldemort, Cornelius. I estimate it'll take him eight weeks at the most to infiltrate the ministry while you bury your head in the sand. I won't let him into Hogwarts through your government."

"I regret it had come to this," Dumbledore said as he stood up, "but I've let too much happen, let too many bad people get away with bad things because of my reluctance to use the power and authority I possess, because of my leniency and trust in the nature of people..." Dumbledore trailed off as he got a faraway look in his eyes.

He shook himself as he placed another pebble Portkey in the still snoring Dawlish's palm. "I will no longer be an accomplice by default. Fawkes, please take my prisoner and I to my brother", he said as he disillusioned Crouch Jr and grabbed his arm.

With a flash of bright orange flame, they both disappeared, leaving Fudge stunned, trying to wrap his head around what has just happened.

. Albus flashed into the shabby upstairs living room above the Hog's Head, and turned to see a wand trained unerringly on the space between his eyes. "What the fuck do you want?", Aberforth growled as he lowered his wand and began walking away.

"I just invoked Protocol Seven", Albus replied simply, even as that caused Aberforth to gasp and turn around so quickly his wand flew out of his hand. As he called it back to him, he asked, "Fudge tried to bury all the shit that happened today at the school?".

"Yes, and tried to have this one Kissed so he wouldn't expose Voldemort's return", Albus replied as he revealed Crouch Jr to a stunned Aberforth. He sighed and continued, "I bear much blame for letting things come to this-"

"Damn right, you do! You said Protocol Seven was a contingency for the contingency and that you'd never let it come to this!", Aberforth cut Albus off angrily.

Albus sighed again and continued, "That's why I need your help. I need you to rally the villagers and start-"

"Protocol Seven was my idea, if you recall. I know what to bloody do. Now get the hell out of my house", Aberforth cut in again as he turned and strode out the door. Albus smiled at that, and grabbing on the arm of Crouch Jr, said, "Fawkes, the Wizengamot Grand Chamber, if you please." In a flash, they were gone.

. Madam Amelia Bones, Head of DMLE was not happy. She had been at Hogwarts doing damage control on the clusterfuck that was the final task of the Triwizard Tournament when Dumbledore had convened an emergency Wizengamot meeting. And now, even as the Chamber echoed with the voices and whispers of the assembled Wizengamot members, the bloody idiot was late!

As such, when said idiot flashed into the Chamber with a phoenix on his shoulder and a bound man at his side, she was up out of her seat and marching towards him even before most of the Chamber realized what the flash of orange light had meant and erupted in calls for Dumbledore's attention.

"Albus, there better be a bloody good reason for this! I need not remind you- Wait a minute.. Is that... Is that Barty Crouch Junior?". Madam Bones stepped back in shock. There was a collective gasp as the Chamber quietened immediately.

"I daresay you understand the severity of the situation, Amelia", Albus said gravely as he turned to address the Chamber.

..

I imagined it takes place in a HP world where the magical population of GB is something like 10,000. Hogsmeade maybe 300-400. To make it easier for the Dumbledores to pull off something like this.

For continuity; Harry doesn't go back to the Dursley's and is instead trained by Dumbledore, a sizable number of the magical population move into Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, Snape betrays Voldemort's horcruxes but nearly dies, Draco and Narcissa also get a redemption arc, and Magical Britain dissolves into a guerrilla type landscape with Dumbledore, Voldemort and the remains of Fudge's ministry all against each other. Also, if there's any romance, Harry and Hermione is preferable but I'm in no position to impose.

Because the next step would be for him to resolve the plot in 5 minutes, which leaves not a whole lot of room for other characters. A competent Dumbledore is one chapter of action and then a "no Voldemort" AU.

You're talking about changing what happens to portray Dumbledore as more competent while saying that Voldemort couldn't be more competent because canon is canon.

If you can say that Dumbledore brings a squad with him to get the ring and succeeds without getting cursed because that's the better way to go about it, you can also say that Voldemort's defences are powerful such that all of them die trying and alerts Voldemort to the attempt.

Again you're suggesting changing canon for Dumbledore but acting like it's impossible to do the same for Voldemort. Voldemort could have plans in place that have him revived the day after his body was destroyed.

Just because Voldemort doesn't have a body doesn't mean that Dumbledore is guaranteed to be able to counter everything that Voldemort has set up in advance.

And why must it work that way?

10 death eaters used as meat shields or mine sweepers does not need to mean that 10 traps/defenses are overcome. A Horcrux invulnerability can't be overcome by numbers. The DADA curse couldn't be overcome with numbers. The fidelious charm doesn't care about how many people you throw at it. Etc.

Maybe the penal battalion all dies and nothing is gained. Maybe Voldemort's defenses detects their dark marks and their intent and teleports them to a safe house, so all you've done is freed some death eaters. Maybe Dumbledore can't even find the Horcruxes because Voldemort hid them better.

Dumbledore can be written as competently as an author wants. But so can Voldemort.

You know, if you insist on coming up with convoluted reasons, fine, just nuke the whole place with Fiendfyre. We know that it works against Horcruxes, and if anyone can control it, Dumbledore does. So rather than come up with anything remotely interesting, just burn everything you even suspect of being the hiding place for one. Plot resoved.

Here's a couple of wild ideas: Dumbledore could have no idea where one or more Horcrux is. Voldemort can react.

************* Voldemort's main theme is that he could have ruled the whole world but instead he focused almost everything on the prophecy and in the end lost to it due to his own obsession with immortality. Him fucking up due to stupidity/the manifestation of primal fear is just as much a core element of his as being able to slaughter his way through a group of wizards.

And the very nature of Horcruxes, as well as the spells we see in canon, make them basically worthless unless you make yours a random pebble and lob it into the ocean. And that is also something which would go against Voldemort's core personality since he insisted on founder artifacts whenever possible.

** The Chamber of the Wizengamot was silent, shocked by the revelations presented, and by the actions that Albus Dumbledore was about to take. The Lords and Ladies were looking at each other in worry, until one rose, the leader of the middle faction, the Moderates, fence-sitters as they were called sometimes derisively.

"So let me get this straight Dumbledore, you show us undeniable proof that that man is back through the most horrible of magics," he points at the stunned Barty Crouch Junior, Fudge tried to protest with claims the man's mind had been manipulated, but was cowed by a myriad of glares "that he still has followers and the war is about to start again."

Dumbledore nodded gravely, "I am afraid so, Lord Greengrass."

"And now you would abandon Britain, to retreat to one of the most protected places in the island and fight him from there, while you let us here, to fend for ourselves, and being led by this..." he pointed at Fudge, who was looking redder by the minute," bumbling, incompetent fool who was about to deny everything and let that monster act unopposed?"

Fudge was about to protest, "Silence! Fool! Traitor! You were about to condemn us all!"

There were several murmurs of agreement, and the one speaking looked around receiving several nods.

"I find this unacceptable, I propose a vote of no confidence to Cornelius Fudge, he was about to betray us all to Voldemort, and is clearly compromised and incompetent to lead us in a war."

Far more quickly than expected, Fudge saw his government crumble with an almost unanimous vote.

"I now propose we elect someone who can lead us in these dark times, someone who I see now finally has found the courage to act and do what is necessary, I nominate Albus Dumbledore."

Stunned silence, the Moderates had always been vocal against Dumbledore's leniency and soft politics, always more aligned with the Traditionalist faction, the look on Lucius Malfoy's face was of utter surprise, and even fear, he started looking for the exits, but they were all blocked, and he saw people closing in on him, while many of his associates came closer to whisper that he should nominate himself, fools.

"I second that motion." Augusta Longbottom rose quickly, "Let's vote right now."

Albus Dumbledore was shocked by this development, he expected to spark debate and maybe put Fudge in hot water, but that the Moderates were more aware than he thought and believed he would be the safest option was surprising, he was expecting that after they saw how bad the situation was, they would join the Progressists in Hogwarts.

Dumbledore saw in this an opportunity, to save those who wouldn't be able to reach Hogwarts, and preserve more of the infrastructure of the government.

"I accept."

It was one of the fastest elections ever, other nominations were practically ignored, for the first time in decades, the Progessist and Moderate parties voted unanimously on a single candidate.

Once Dumbledore was nominated Minister, he received a significant look from Lord Greengrass, he signed heavily, he never wanted this, but he must think of the children. He nodded back, and Lord Greengrass rose again, Dumbledore's trained eyes noticed movement around the chamber.

"Congratulations Minister, I know you will be able to lead us in this fight, but first allow me to help us have a good start by /cleaning house/."

As soon as he began saying those words, there was a blur of movement, and dozens of red flashes were seen around the chamber, Lords and some Ladies started falling unconscious and their sleeves were pulled back. Dumbledore noticed that some of his own people were helping and that some of the Moderates were targeted.

"Death Eater!" the cry came from Amos Diggory who was holding Lucius Malfoy's arm with a strong grip, his face a picture of utter rage.

The cry repeated itself over and over in the chamber, and the stunned members started being brought down to the Aurors, who were looking shocked, Amelia Bones, however, had a most severe expression.

Dumbledore looked sadly at those being brought, he knew some of these as children, he had taught some of them on how to hold a wand, how utterly he had failed to prevent them from being tempted by darkness, but now he had to fix his mistakes, and think of those that were still children.

*** Later after one Wizengamot session that would stay in history as the "Night of the Red Spells", Dumbledore sat in his new office, after Fudge and many members of his cabinet were arrested for corruption due Lucius Malfoy being the first to be interrogated, and he had /much/ to tell. Bringing to even more arrests, the Aurors had a at least a dozen more arrest warrants to complete.

With him were Amelia Bones, Augusta Longbottom, Head Auror Scrimgeour, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Cyrus Greengrass the new Chief Warlock, a compromise to keep some of the more recalcitrant Moderates happy.

Dumbledore first turned to Cyrus, "I can't thank you enough for what you did tonight, , however, I can't help but think it was all planned."

Cyrus smiled lightly, "Why Minister, we had contingency plans, most of them were to just hide or leave the country with our families, but when I saw you enter into that Chamber in a flash of Phoenix fire and heard the way you spoke, I knew you finally had the will to do what was needed, and I love my homeland, my daughters grew up here, and I wouldn't want to leave and see it turned in some dictatorship for that madman."

Dumbledore nodded, "Good, with your support things will be much easier, I must say I never wanted this,"he gestured at the office,"but I see no other option."

After murmurs and nods of agreement, he turned to Amelia.

"I am increasing the DMLE's funds, and authorizing a substantial increase in your numbers, however, as I am sure you know, we must be cautious in who we trust."

Amelia nodded tightly, "I know that Albus, that's why we are adding a new screening process, it's more invasive, but it will leave us more secure that we aren't being infiltrated."

"What about those that are already in?" Augusta Longbottom asked.

"Those are being dealt with as we speak, we are reviewing all our Aurors and workers too, thanks to some...information we received." she glanced momentarily to the side.

It was an unspoken agreement that such valuable information would be useless with Fudge in command and would only backfire on those that offered it.

"I am glad we managed to do what we needed today, I must momentarily return to Hogwarts and inform them of this...new situation, I will be back shortly so we can plan our next steps and capitalize on the confusion caused by today's developments."

As everyone rose and said their farewells, one stayed behind.

"Lord Greengrass, is there something I can help you?"

"Call me Cyrus, I think we will be working together a lot in the future."

"Call me Albus, then."

"Very Wel,l then, Albus, I now come to you as a concerned father." he pulled two sealed envelopes from his robes, and then a sealed scroll.

"My daughters, Daphne and Astoria, after what happened today, I feel they won't be safe in Slytherin House, and I ask you to remove them, at least from the Dungeons."

"I take it you have information to corroborate that."

Cyrus nodded gravely and gave Dumbledore the scroll, he opened and saw a list of names, student names from Slytherin, and some from Ravenclaw, it got from fourth year upwards."

"These are students who we believe are willing to.../act/ in the name of their parent's master and do terrible things, if ordered, some may lack the spine, but others are, well, I am not going to sugarcoat it for you, others are already criminals."

Dumbledore almost crushed the paper, corrupting children for this...to what levels of...

He nodded gravely, "I will act upon this, we have ways to check, and I will also be certain that your daughters are safe, I already have a way to do it."

He had never seen Cyrus Greengrass with such naked emotion on his face, relief. For him to be so worried, there must have been good reasons for it.

"Thank you, thank you! If you need anything else, you have but to ask, most of my party is behind me in this, and the others dislike the other side more than they dislike you. "he gave then the envelopes, one for each daughter, "If you can deliver this to them, they'll know what it means."

Dumbledore nodded again, and took the envelopes, after some words, he called for Fawkes, who, since this whole thing started, seemed more energized than ever, and in a flash of fire, he was back to Hogwarts.

He needed to talk to Harry, things were going to change a lot for the boy, no, the young man, he needed to be prepared, Dumbledore's attempt at giving him a regular and happy childhood had failed, but maybe in being treated as an adult, Harry would find his center.

He would call for Sirius and Remus, and finish recalling the Order, they needed to activate the safehouses, created new ones, Hogwarts could be the Headquarters, or even Sirius's old family home.

He looked at the two letters he was carrying...perhaps he could also give Harry some companionship to teach him about his place in Wizarding Society, and ingratiate him to the other Party, he would need all the help he could get on the days to come.

He smiled to himself, now he was acting as the Master Manipulator everyone thought him to be.

It was oddly freeing.

PS: just to clarify, I think when people saw that, yes, Voldemort was back, those in the know wouldn't want to be led by Fudge, nor have to abandon their things and move to Hogwarts while Voldemort rode roughshod with the rest of the country, also because many wouldn't want to leave positions of power. And between Albus Dumbledore and the crazy lunatic who was known for torturing his own followers, I think they would take the former.
