******** The author loves to poke at the plot holes and inconsistencies of canon. He spares no one from Harry, Hermione to Snape and Voldemort.

** Thank you! There are too many fics that summon a "Harry", even though alt!Harry didn't have his mother killed by local!Voldemort after he offered to spare her, doesn't have brother wands with local!Voldemort, was not marked as local!Voldemort's equal, is not the subject of a prophecy, and is therefore just another wizard. It makes far more sense to summon another Dumbledore.
