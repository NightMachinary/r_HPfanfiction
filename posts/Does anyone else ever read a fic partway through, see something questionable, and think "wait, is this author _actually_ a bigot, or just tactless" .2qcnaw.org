I like to think I'm not some overzealous SJW, but more and more I read something that makes me uncomfortable. Be honest, is it just me?

Most outstanding example of this that I can remember was a fic where a roving Indy!Harry manipulates a group of "transsexuals" (the author means to refer to a group of men wearing dresses) into hitting on the death eater tracking Harry down.

*** You know what? I missed that in my first read through, but I'm pretty sure there's a chapter where a prank goes wrong in Gryffindor Tower by the Weasley Twins results in white skin and blonde hair? And both Patil twins end up asking to take the failed potion because job opportunities are better, or something similar to that.

Hmm, makes me wonder what else I've just brushed off while reading through various HP fics lol

**** But is that bigoted? I mean, we are constantly told how white people are only more successful because they get more opportunities and chances and such, due to racism. If that is indeed the case, is it wrong to consider that SOME people, not all or even most, but some, don't give a damn about the color of their own skin or "pride", and will do anything to ensure they get the better job? Regardless if that involves dressing in a suit, or painting themselves blue for all they care?

Also, it could just be a harmless joke being poked at that same teaching of how racism makes everything better for whitey.

** Lots of people talking about slash in this thread. I think there's a lot of misunderstanding in the fandom as to why people don't like reading slash.

*An objection to slash does not necessarily (and probably in most cases does not) stem from or indicate any homophobia.* The "slash genre" comes with so much extra baggage, additional to the depiction of homosexuality.

For a start, the vast majority of slash fics do not faithfully depict anything like a realistic homosexual relationship. Most slash writers feminise Harry significantly. What they're doing is writing a /heterosexual/ relationship, it just so happens that the "woman" (Harry) happens to have a penis.

Slash fics always describe Harry as "slender" not "thin". They refer to his hair as "locks". They talk about the smoothness of his skin and get adjective-heavy when talking about his eyes. His movements are described as elegant or catlike. I can normally tell within a few paragraphs of reading a slash fic that it's slash, just from the way the writing style and description associate Harry with traditionally feminine qualities.

*Gay men are not women.* To write them in that way is in fact quite insulting to gay men, though you can see why it happens (most slash writers are female).

As if to make matters worse, this feminised Harry almost always has some pretty deep emotional issues (so much slash is also angst or hurt/comfort). Harry is frequently depicted as "strong on the surface, emotional wreck within". Even when slash fics make Harry magically or politically powerful, they still make him emotionally dependent on another person.

It's extremely depressing that the young women writing slash seem to associate emotional weakness with the femininity they give to Harry. It is also fundamentally against my taste. I like reading about a well-adjusted, moderately talented, confident Harry like we get in canon.

There are, of course, simpler reasons why people dislike slash, reasons which are related to the notion of homosexuality. Again, these do not necessary indicate homophobia.

As a reader, I identify myself with a protagonist. That emotional connection is so important to the process of reading, because it's what makes you care about what happens to the character. It's what makes the character feel real. Anything that breaks that feeling of identification will therefore uninvest you from the character, and nothing does this like the character making choices that you would never make. This is why I can't read evil Harry, or rebellious Harry, and it's also a reason why I can't read homosexual Harry.

Also, most fics either ret-con Harry to have been gay all along, or have him turn gay overnight. That's just bad writing.

Finally, slash fics almost always pair Harry with Draco Malfoy, Severus Snape, or Lord Voldemort: his enemies and people well out of his age range. Plus, Snape is ugly. Nobody would ever be romantically attracted to him. Those pairings are as unreadable as Harry/Bellatrix and Harry/Molly.

*** As a reasonably well-educated grownup gay man I have to concur. While I do sometimes binge read slash for the guilty pleasure of having two male protagonists in love for once I mostly make sure I am in the adventure/humor section and choose something reasonably short because the likelyhood of harry being a girly man or a even something that most resembles a girl with a penis is far lower there. Having an actual gay relationship in a fic is a very nice thing for people who like it (for example the gays :P) but most slash fics appeal more to teenage girls and catlady-types because most 'real' gay relationships are betweeen /men/. That is the whole point of the thing, if i wanted all the things traditionally associated with women plus some anal sex I would get a girlfriend with a strap-on :P

**** As a non-gay man, I like my protagonists to like girls. I like to read about what they do with said girls, from just sweet flirting to sexy times... though there doesn't need to be detail on that last part, since it's rarely written well. And I have no interest in seeing sex scene after sex scene filled with cock. It's a shame, I've seen some fics that looked really promising till the slash showed up, but I just can't enjoy immersing into a character that is so fundamentally different. Very much the same reason I don't read many fem!protagonist stories, the character baseline is just too far to immerse in properly.

Out of curiosity, what's your thoughts on so many fics where gay pairings are just accepted in the wizard world? Do you prefer you protagonists to have to deal with the issues of being gay in a setting that doesn't accept it easily, or do you prefer nobody to even bat an eyelash?

Also, have you noticed an odd occurrence where if a fic has one gay pairing, there's incredibly high odds of being two, and if there's two, high odds of three, and so on, to the point where everyone in the WW is gay except maybe Arthur Weasly?

***** I mostly like things to be somewhat realistic, meaning some adversity but mostly positive or completely neutral towards the gay protagonists. Which, of course, does not happen all that often. As with the "everyone is gay" and "of course men can get pregnant" cliches (as well as some others) most slash fics are a heap of whish fulfilment for the authors. Most of which have no idea what being gay actually means for the people involved. Of course i don't want to see the protagonist destroyed over such a minor personal detail, and building all adversity on something like this is either a character study or bad writing. But so is everything being perfect from the very start. Sadly, most slash fics are simply badly written or (worse) badly written porn.

Your reluctance to read such fics is completely understandable, I myself only read some of the better, cringe-free ones as a guilty pleasure. For the most part I stick to general romance-free stories or the really tame het ones as (like you pointed out) I like to identify with the protagonist. And, sadly, all the girly men, pregnant men, sappy clich√©s and badly written sex scenes actually make that harder for me than a "love you", tame kiss with a girl and scene break.

To answer your first question more completely: The acceptance of the protagonist and his love by their surroundings, as everything in fiction, needs to be balanced with the rest of the story. It is nice if the immediate circle of friends and relatives reacts favourably but for that one person. Or if most people have absolutely no problem but only the opposed people speak up. Or a change of location means a sudden (but temporary) backlash from the people they are now exposed to. Opposition and adversity build character and drama, they make the protagonists and their relationship more believable and stronger, to a point. Mindless fluff where everything is perfect from the get go is annoying in the long run (but sometimes nice for a short while) and extreme opposition may be realistic, depending on where you come from, but when I read fiction I don't want to be pummeled over the head with the adversity that I might face for such a minor thing. Let alone a complete, holocaust-style persecution. Just no /shudder/.

As to the second question, the more whish fulfillment there is, the more gays and less problem there are. To the point of ridiculousness. I once abandoned a fic because it turned out everyone was gay, the women where just some kind of broodmares, Harry was Snape and James' kid (only carried to term by lily) and fell in love on first sight. With draco. Who of course is totally nice, as is his father. That is the kind of thing that is nauseating to me and unreadable to most but someone wrote and published it. And because there is so much less stuff written in the genre (and mostly by women) there isnt the amount of good, well-written stories to overshadow the "of course they are soul-bound and now harry is a male veela/girl with a penis" crap. So yes, I noticed :D

** If the author is racist, it usually goes right over my head, and I've got a sixth sense for that stuff - comes with the territory. Since HP, being set where it is, has relatively few characters of colour, there's a lot less opportunity for people to drop the ball. Kinda fortunate and disappointing at the same time, really. That being said, when wizarding cultures from around the world are introduced in fanfics, you can find more than a few gems of ignorance out there.

Misogyny, however... Sometimes you can read a summary and catch a whiff of it. Whether it's a harem fic, or Indy!Harry or even m/m slash (one of several reasons I avoid them), it's harder to hide because of the sheer number of women in the cast. Of course, many of them haven't been fleshed out which gives the main character a license to wear each one like a hat, or throw them away like a chocolate wrapper depending on the author's fancy.

As a side note, are there any slash stories out there where Harry isn't a doormat? Because that's offensive to both his canon character and relationships in general.

** No. If I go in thinking the author's a bigot and will let some of that bigotry through into the story, I'm usually right. It's probably not intentional, reasoned bigotry, of course, just what they've absorbed from their culture and regurgitated without stopping to think that they're denigrating groups that include real people.

It's partially that JKR made it so easy. Which characters are non-white? Cho Chang, who's got about three scenes. Lee Jordan and Dean Thomas, who are far from important characters -- Dean is another warm body to stock the Gryffindor dorms, and Lee is a hanger-on for the twins until even Rowling forgets about him. The Patil twins; it's easy enough for an author to write around them. Kingsley Shacklebolt is the only notable non-white person, really.

Which notable characters are women and not in roles that a 1950s advertisement would be happy with? Amelia Bones, Hermione Granger, and Minerva McGonagall. Bones is far from the main story, and McGonagall is always beside Albus Dumbledore, with his power overshadowing hers. And overpowered Harrys are all the rage, so Hermione is likely to take a back seat pretty much instantly.

Homosexuality? There are bare hints of it, easily ignored -- the books go into as much detail about Aberforth and his goats. This is one place where fandom does much better than canon on a regular basis, and you can see why -- a lot of people here are all "no slash, eww".

The 3 main characters are straight and they are the only characters we really see relationships of. You could make the same argument about any random attribute that affects 5-10% of the public.

The reason Harry Potter doesn't make a big deal out of minorities is because it created its own in mudbloods and purebloods. The morals and lessons of this "bloodism" can be applied to any prejudice which is /the whole point/. Kids will read it and hopefully see their own prejudices in it and adding specific real-world scenarios into it will only dilute that message.

Sadly, canon does that too, especially in GoF, and it even gets the accents wrong. For example, I am pretty sure that Rowling never bothered to check precisely /how would/ a native speaker of Bulgarian (mis)pronounce Hermione's name. (As far as I can tell, he'd most likely pronounce it as an English speaker would, but it's possible that he would use the Russian variant "Germiona", neither of which sound remotely like what Krum had said in the book.)

It's also totally unrealistic that nobody else has a non-standard accent, since this is the UK we're talking amount, where pretty much every other kilometer has a different accent....therefore the use of a non-standard accent only on some characters serves to further depict them as uneducated, working class, or in HP terms, half breeds.

** Yeah, I can't remember the name of that fic but I read it recently. That particular scene was funny as hell in my opinion but not because of the sexuality of the characters involved. It would have been just as good if it was some heterosexual men or women doing the death eater pummeling. The author was trying to portray them getting beat up by the opposite of the death eaters but there is no proof in canon that death eaters have prejudice against minority sexual groups. In fact, the whole topic of sexuality is avoided entirely in the series so it feels a bit weird in a fanfic unless the author manages to be consist.

*** This goes back to my comment about it being more ignorance than malice. There are a lot of things wrong with the scene in the fic as described (I haven't read it, but based off of what OP said and you said) and your commentary. Transexual does not equal gender-bending does not equal sexuality. The author apparently described men wearing dresses as transexual, which is not correct. Sometimes the term transvestite is used, though that's somewhat problematic, so often times people say gender-bending. Both this and transex have to do with gender identity and gender expression, not sexuality. Sexuality is who you are attracted to, and gender identity is entirely separate from that.

So for someone who hasn't been exposed to this, it doesn't bother you at all, but for someone for whom these issues are important, it /is/ offensive. Just because the author, or some readers, don't understand why, doesn't change the fact that it's hugely problematic. That's why OP stopped reading the fic.
