Imagine DADA being taught by someone who has not taught the class. It can be someone from the Potterverse, someone from an entirely different fandom, or even a real person (can be dead or alive). It can take place in any era. It can be as long as you want. It doesn't even have to specifically be about the class as long as the new professor plays an important role.


** I wrote a story once where it was taught by Conner MacLeod from the first /Highlander/ film.

  The powers of the immortals combine in the one receiving the Prize. In the film, upon defeating the Kurgan, Connor MacLeod receives the gift of telepathy. What if he were also gifted with magic? HP/Highlander first film crossover. Not slash.

** linkffn(The Stag and the Dragon by Kenya Starflight) had DADA taught by Darth Vader. The climactic fight got a bit odd, though, since the author had to do some tweaking to make the armies make sense.

  Crossover and OoTP AU. It's Harry's fifth year, and a desperate Dumbledore hires a new Dark Arts teacher who might prove to wreak more havoc than Umbridge ever could... Darth Vader.

** I, once, was planning to write a fiction where Leonardo da Vinci from Da Vinci's Demon to HP universe. Unfortunately nothing came to fruit. Could imagine him as DADA professor.
