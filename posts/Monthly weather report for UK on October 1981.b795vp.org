** Harry's parents died in the evening of Oct 31, and he was left on the doorstep on the evening of Nov 1, to be picked up in the morning of Nov 2. That's ~30 hours where Harry was in the tender care of Hagrid and Dumbledore.

But it's all fine, Harry's baby blanket was made of plot armor, after all.

*** Lily was a charmstress and had a free month nearing the end of her pregnancy to make that blanket as impressive as possible.
