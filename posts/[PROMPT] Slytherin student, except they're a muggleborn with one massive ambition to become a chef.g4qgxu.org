So Slytherin traits are hella weird. On the one hand we have Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle, who show pints of ambition but no cunning. On the other we have those like.. Actually scratch that. What Slytherin canonically shows cunning?

Anways. A muggleborn student shows up for their sorting. They're kind of annoyed that they had to come in the first place - they were going to enter a top tier culinary academy! But their parents told them it was to good of an opportunity to pass, and for a moment they agreed-- wizards must have all sorts of cool baking tips and spells! But upon seeing the booklist, they seriously regretted their decisions, but it was too late now. Upon their sorting, the hat is blown away by the sheer amount of /ambition/ there is, for this kid to want to be a chef. Not much cunning, but a helluva lot of ruthlessness because this kid will do /whatever/ it takes to become the greatest ever chef. Who cared if this he was muggleborn?

"Better be.... Slytherin!"

Aka: a random plot bunny

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

** I'd say Snape, Regulus, and Narcissa did show cunning in how they successfully defied the Dark Lord. Bellatrix is also pretty cunning.

I don't think Crabbe and Goyle were particularly ambitious though. And I'm not entirely sure about Malfoy either, although Malfoy does show a bit of cunning from time to time (ex. fixing the Vanishing Cabinet).

“Looks like you'll have to break it, then, because I don't need your protection! It's my job, he gave it to me and I'm doing it, I've got a plan and it's going to work, it's just taking a bit longer than I thought it would!”

**** I second [[/u/Kiranik1][u/Kiranik1]]'s argument since there was a lot of cunning to go from Montague's accident to a viable method of gaining entrance to the school.

The creation of the plan and the sneaking around to do the plan does involve cunning.

****** It is unlikely that Voldemort or the other DE came up with the Vanishing Cabinet plan, since they wouldn't give much time to a plan they thought would fail. The plan's purpose wasn't to kill Dumbledore, but to shame the Malfoys. Draco probably did not volunteer to kill Dumbledore since even Voldy found it hard. Draco probably learned to fix the Vanishing Cabinet himself since he is pretty isolated at Hogwarts, which is why he does has some cunning.

** Merlin, Tom Riddle, Slughorn, Snape, Lucius, Narcissa, Regulus.

All these showed traits of cunning and ambition for better or worse.

It depends on Merlin, but most sources on him paint him as not only a Sorcerer but also a political advisor who was very dedicated in cementing Arthur's rule of Camelot/Albion

EDIT: Regarding Harry's yearmates, if any of them were cunning, Harry and Co. would have to be too much competent to NOT be foiled. That's why fanfics where the rest of Slytherin laughs at Malfoy and his goons are on to something.
