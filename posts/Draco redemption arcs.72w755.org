Some time ago I asked for Snape-centric redemption fics. ('Cause I'm a sucker for redemption arcs) I've finished going through all the recommendations now, thank you all. So I think it's time to give Malfoy the spotlight. Hit me with your favorite Draco-centric redemption fics!!

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
