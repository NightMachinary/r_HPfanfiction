Recently read linkffn(Harry Potter, Squatter) and now I really want some more of that casual, fun, fluff, and slice of life style of things. The crossover with Percy Jackson was also a nice change of pace.


** Also, I'd recommend linkffn(twins by andrius) and other stuff by the same author.

  In an act of desperation, Harry invites Flora Carrow to the Yule Ball. He never expects having to entertain her twin sister Hestia too.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?
