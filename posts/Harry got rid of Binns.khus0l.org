I'm looking for a fic where Harry accidents exorcised Binns by asking him if he knew if he was dead


** Happens in “A Fair Life by Rtnwriter” linkffn(13285012), it was apparently not even completely intentional.

  Harry has died for the twelfth time and his Reaper is NOT happy about it. Given a chance to go back to fourth year and do things again, Harry jumps at the opportunity. But what's this about being a girl! Don't Fear the Reaper with a twist. Fem!Harry. FemSlash.

**** my little pony, just found it, if wishes were ponies by tkepner, the following is not mine just a quotation of the relevant section

Watching Professor Binns, who had a wrinkled turtle-like face and a lower body that trailed off into nothing, float through the wall and immediately start his lecture was a bit startling. Ten minutes later, Scootaloo spoke up when he paused in his presentation. “Professor Binns? What's it like being dead? Is it interesting?”

The translucent wizard stared at her.

“I mean, we don't have ghosts where we come from and I would think you would find it much more interesting to go on rather than continue teaching history as a ghost as you have for the last hundred years. Or don't you know you're dead?”

Sweetie Belle elbowed Scootaloo and hissed, “Be quiet!” at her.

The ghost stared at her blankly. “Hundred years?” he said in a monotone.

“Yes, sir,” she said, “It is currently . . .” she glanced around uncertainly, “uh, 1991?”

He stared at her a bit longer. “Ex-traordinary,” he said, and then abruptly resumed his lecture. The First Years exchanged glances, then went back to doodling on their parchments or making vague attempts at writing down what he was saying. His vacuum-cleaner dull voice did not inspire anyone into really paying him any attention. That he didn't seem to even notice them, didn't help.

Harry noticed several students giving Scootaloo and Apple Bloom curious looks as the fillies held their quills in their mouths and took sporadic notes. Harry sighed. They probably thought the fillies were nervously chewing on their quills. He had tried to teach them how to write with their hands, but they hadn't picked it up, yet. On the other hand, he would probably just end up giving them copies of his notes. Extensive and complete notes, as Twilight had drilled into him over the last year.

“You can never have too detailed notes, Harry,” she had said. “The way to the top of the class is to have superior notes.” And then she had read his school notes every evening, asking questions for clarification. The answers to which he had to add to the notes. And if he had questions, they looked up the answers in the library and added those to his notes. Harry had learned how to rapidly take accurate and complete lecture notes.

It had been quite odd, at first, as no one had ever cared about his school work. Not even his primary school teachers had seemed to care, except to single him out for criticism. That someone, somepony, actually cared had been a surprise. And while he had grumbled at all the extra work she made him do, he really liked it when she praised his work. And the pay-off in high grades on tests had been gratifying, as well. Not to mention the celebratory dinners with lots of cake.

After ten minutes, and as he said, “The Goblin Rebellion of seventeen . . . ,” Professor Binns stopped and looked over at Scootaloo. “Dead, you say?”

Startled, she nodded and said, “Yes, sir. We were told you fell asleep in front of the staff-room fireplace a hundred years ago, got up the next morning to teach, and left your body behind.”

“Extraordinary.” He stared at her blankly for several moments and then started again, “. . . fifty-two brought about . . . .”

Five minutes later, he stopped again and looked at Scootaloo. “Am I really dead?”

Scootaloo had been most of the way to falling asleep and chirped sharply at the sudden attention, then said, “Uh, yes, sir.”

He stared at her intently. “Are you sure?”

She glanced at Harry and her other two friends. “Uh, yes, sir. Quite sure. We can see through you.”

“You can, can you?” He glanced down at his ghostly arms, frowning.

“Yes, sir,” came a chorus of other students, intrigued by what they were hearing. It was certainly more entertaining than the Goblin Rebellion he had been droning on about.

“Ex-traordinary.” He frowned as he looked around the classroom. “. . . due to the blatant mismanagement by Minister for Magic, Albert Boot, . . .” he said, and continued his lecture.

After five minutes, he stopped again. “You are sure I'm dead?”

Most of the class answered this time, all in the affirmative. Hermione added, “You're even floating in the middle of your podium.”

“Extraordinary!” he said looking down. He looked back up and a smile slowly made its way across his wrinkled and turtle-like face. He seemed to straighten up a bit, and his eyes lost their blank million-mile stare. He looked around the class and cleared his throat. “I do believe,” he said, slowly and still in his vacuum-cleaner dull voice, “that school is out.” He licked his lips, and smiled, and said in a slightly louder voice, one that almost could be said to have emotion in it, “In fact, I think school's out forever. School's not out for summer. School's out completely!” His smile grew broader as he added, “For me, that is.”

He looked up at the far corner at the back of the room and grinned.

The class watched as he started floating in that direction, with students dodging out of his way as he went right through their desks and chairs. When he reached the corner he seemed to suddenly zoom up and disappear. A faint, joyful laugh reached them just before he completely disappeared.

** I don't recall if it was accidentally, but I think in Recipe For Change has a scene where Harry helps Binns cross over by pointing out he is dead. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766915/1/Recipe-for-Change]]

** There's a kinda Dark!Harry fix called Harry Crow where hes raised by goblins, and they kick Binns out. He's forced to go away. While thats not the whole plot, it's a really good fix.
