What are the appealing points of this fic, besides the fact that apparently, femHarry is a potions prodigy (that's all I know, besides the summary) ?


** Nice world building, not a “canon but one thug is different” story, good expansion on the subject of potions, politics oriented but kids are not better than adults, interesting and powerful cast that makes believable mistakes and doesn't rely on their opponents' dumbness, different places and areas with a distinct flavor.

Yeah, I hate those fics where they swap Goyle for Nott or Zabini but keep everything else the same.

In all seriousness though it is a fun story. A bit different from anything else that's out there right now and quite a compelling read. Better than a lot of other stuff you might stumble upon.

**** Also the fact that it is quite a lot of words, so when you take it up you have a lot to read before you catch up to the latest chapter and have to wait and even then the author updates quite often and with massive chapters.

** It has a sane Tom Riddle who is a politician, and the best execution of this idea that I've read. I absolutely love stories without Voldemort, because his absence alone frees the author to a large extent. It takes old overused cliches and uses them well. It gets better with each book. I was in the same position as you, but it really exceeded my expectations and is now easily in my top ten and number 1 fem Harry.

​

The plotlines come from both Song of The Lioness and HP, but the execution is quite different. The AU is well thought out, and the characterization makes you think, yeah, this is what they would probably be like in a world without Voldemort. The AU isn't *too* AU like Hell Eyes, and you don't need to know anything about Alanna the Lioness to be able to enjoy it.

** I don't usually read gender-swap fics, but I'd seen enough buzz around this fic to try it. Still, I went in with limited enthusiasm and would not have if I hadn't been in a similar drought to yours :).

I read all the fics in the series, actually felt compelled to comment on each one, and am looking forward to each update. Seriously, it's a good series. I usually hate OC's but again this series is the exception. It's just really good writing with compelling character development, good original plots, and excellent pacing. I'm definitely a fan.

** I'm not a fan personally. This is for three main reasons:

1. The story glosses over its own premise. The Harriet-Archie switch is executed far too easily, and Harriet has no real reaction to being a girl living among boys. I'm sure that later in the story she is outed and there's some fallout from that, but on a personal, /character/ level the story acts as if the only difference between boys and girls is long vs short hair.

2. The story makes Harriet a squib with a wand. Her ability with potions does not even come close to balancing this out. I also dislike what it implies about magical theory (and indeed the fic using intent-based magical theory for wand magic).

3. Political!Kids where they're all analysing each other's words for hidden meaning.

*** I had many of the same objections to it but honestly the fic outgrows most of what you mentioned.

1. The switch is sort of the core premise of the book the fusion is based on, and she's not outed in the first book like in the original source material, and is still not really outed. She goes to great lengths to protect it as the fic moves on.
2. Without too many spoilers, this is intended, has reasons that are explained later, is consistent with the worldbuilding and it is not a permanent state of affairs.
3. I'm assuming you're referring to the scene in the starting with Pansy, but honestly, that is the worst it gets. I dropped the fic at the same point but I went back to it and it was absolutely worth it. The political scenes that come later are more or less straightforward.

*** You know, considering who you are and how much I like your works, this doesn't bode well for the fic. Also, she's a squib? How can she even go to class? Pre-magicked wand ?

Is it Political Kids for internal politics(house politics) or as if they're mini-Lords ? Cuz I usually dislike mini-Lords but don't mind house politics if its well done, kinda like in HP and PoS.

**** She's not a squib, but for reasons-that-could-probably-be-considered-spoilers, she has trouble using wand magic at first.

I didn't personally like the story, for many of the reasons already listed. Added to that is the fact that it has “magical cores” as a key plot element, which I despise as a trope (though, in fairness, it deals with them in a creative and wholly unique way so YMMV).

**** Squib in the Neville sense, not in the literal sense. I don't know if it gets better in later chapters or not -- it was the "nope" moment for me where I quit the fic.

Neither, really. It's not even really "politics". It's more... Jane Austen type social interactions. Only turned up to 11. And they're 11.

***** If that was the "nope" moment for you, you may regret it. She has difficulty utilizing her magic at first but there are very unique reasons for that. When she learns to control it, she's anything but a squib.

** I think what did it for me was Violet's (the author) ability to keep track of so many world building elements that you're constantly caught by surprise, even when you sort of know how the books will end based on canon. It's the kind of story that has its own community of fans who discuss the plot lines in detail and try to predict what will happen next. It even has a ton of fanfiction of its own.

Some people find the whole switch ruse unbelievable but Violet does a good job at explaining how people will always believe what they see when the truth is too impossible to even consider. Additionally, Harry/Archie develop better magical ways to conceal their identities over time, and their friends and family eventually find the lie much easier to believe than the truth.

Those who complain that Harry/Rigel is a potions-obsessed squib have unfortunately not read far enough to learn the truth behind her control issues. It has nothing to do with a /lack/ of magic.

Harry/Rigel is a socially awkward girl pretending to be a boy who would like nothing more than to lock herself up in a potions lab and learn from Snape (her idol) until she earns her potions mastery. For reasons beyond her control, however, she's constantly dragged into situations that put her under the spotlight because she's anything but normal.

Aside from Harry herself, most of the characters are well developed at least to the point where you can't just replace Slytherin A with Slytherin B like they're the same person. Even the most likable characters have their flaws, and that includes Harry herself.

** The first book was alright. From the second onward the author lost almost all sense of measure and restraint; 30k word chapters with huge, rambling paragraphs choke full of unnecessary detail. Unrealistic depiction of children and teenagers (this was my biggest peeve). In fact all character interaction feels... plastic.

Also, grimdark. I skimmed the later books quite a bit trying to salvage my reading of this story (I like the premise) and the world the author has created is a miserable place. And it only gets worse. (combine that with the rambling thing I mentioned, the end result is not pretty). So probably grimblue would be more accurate, cause it's just depressing.
