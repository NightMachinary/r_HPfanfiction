Spoilers: some First Year spoilers that I've covered up.

Harry-centric, preferably, because I'm a sucker for him! Can be at any point, but maybe an adult!Harry or sixth/seventh!year!Harry might be a good starting point if you're stuck.

Hopefully we all remember one of the first major plot points of the Harry Potter books, how Ron defeats the troll by using wingardium leviosa in First Year, an event that brings together the Golden Trio. I'd really like to see more alternate uses of common spells, just like the above, and although I've read it in some fics, I think I'd enjoy its use as a major plot point, if that's even possible. The possibilities for it are almost limitless, like a /scourgify/ that removes all the skin from your enemies, or a Notice Me Not Charm (although I'm unsure if that's fanon or not) that someone wards onto an item or clothing or apparel to work as a kind of protection - I think I remember reading a fic where Harry had blurred his face, or something, as a form of dissociation, which I found really cool (not the dissociation, just the idea of it, kinda freaky Sci-fi) -, or /aguamenti/ to drown someone. I feel like the examples I've given probably /have/ been used in fanfiction before, and maybe that's why I can think of them.... what I'd really adore and what I'm truly looking for is new innovative intriguing alternate uses that no one would think of at first.

I understand that the Harry Potter Universe is a magical world, and often that makes people feel that it's limitless, but I think I'd really appreciate a story that works more within the constraints of basic spellwork, but manages to alter their uses; such as perhaps Harry only gets two years of magical education before he leaves to live in the muggle world for his own safety, and must alter the use of magic that he has so far learnt. Or, as a more extreme example, he is moved to a different dimension, after only a year or so of magic and he needs to use the knowledge he's learnt. Or, even if he agrees to take Quirrelmort's offer and is kidnapped, and must try to escape with only first year knowledge... We have a lot of stories of a magically capable Harry or an old Harry who works with the Aurors and is skilled with his spellwork, but what I'd like is if we have a Harry who doesn't know much information wise, but he still manages to turn situations to his advantage.

If a fic like this already exists, please please please tell me about it. Take care.

EDIT: thanks so much for the responses and links! I'll be sure to check them out, really appreciate it :D


** Oh, there's this fic, I'm pretty sure it's called Second String, Harry got his soul sucked out by a dementor before 5th year and got sent back in time, to a slightly different but very similar 1975. People assume he's a squib, so he rolls with it, and in secret practices spells from a book of household charms, and gets really good at them. Pretty sure he does use a scourgify or similar the way you mentioned, but also uses other household spells unconventionally. It's WIP but currently updating, on Ao3, and Harry is eventually in a relationship with a man, but it's not a main part of the fic, and easily skimmed if you'd rather not read it. I'm on my phone atm, but I'll edit the post to link the fic later.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

I liked Harry's creative use of human and animal transfiguration in linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning). Granted its a whole branch of magic rather than just one spell, but he's pretty much exclusively focused on human and animal transfiguration.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

** In linkffn(A Black Comedy), Harry has completely and utterly mastered both the Summoning and Banishing charms to the point that he basically has straight-up telekinesis. In-story, it manifests as a bunch of normally-invisible magic arms because reasons or rule of cool or whatever, but without special glasses to see them it just looks like he's moving shit with his mind.

Obligatory warning that it has a very particular type of humor which hasn't aged terribly well, but the plot is still good IMO.

  COMPLETE. Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.

** I remember reading a fic once where Harry used a cleaning spell in the final battle with Voldemort, and Voldemort chokes on dust and dies. Then, he levitates the body back to Hogwarts and freaks everyone out. I think is was a longer fic, there was more to the story than just the alternate usage of a common spell, but the cleaning charm scene was hilarious. Can't remember the name of it, though.
