I have read the many deaths if Harry Potter so


** I can't remember the name of it, but I remember a fic that had it where not even Voldemort was actually capable of killing Harry, and Harry couldn't kill Voldie, due to the very very specific wording of the prophecy.

It was amazing and slightly cracky. I'll have to look for it so I can update this post.
