I'm looking for fics with epic magical battles. Not ones where harry curbstomps the competition like linkffn(harry potter and the elves most fabulous by steelbadger) but more like the battle in chapter two of linkffn(the lesser sadness by newcomb).

linkffn(a third path to the future by vimesenthusiast) is also okay, but I'm mostly thinking of the battle between thanks and harry for that fic.


** Well, I've always had the fights in linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure) as the best I've ever read. While others have had better action sequences, the ones in TOHF easily has the best portrayal of magic on an 'epic' scale in a duel.

*** I love that fic so much, I've just finished re-reading it and god dammit why there isn't more?! it stops just when it starts to pick up! The duels are awe inspiring and the magic described is on a scale not seen in the large majority of fanfictions.

***** sadly as far as I know yes, but just recently the author published a new story, so technically there is hope. But I wouldn't count on it.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.

*** Ehhhh... I feel like the fights in Cadmean victory are just people throwing Fiendfyre around like its candy on Halloween.

It has been a while since i read it so i might be exaggerating but i always felt Fiendfyre shouldn't be used in battle. It's supposed to be near impossible to control and I just can't see anyone being stupid enough to use it while also having to concentrate on evading enemy fire and making sure you don't accidentally burn you allies to a crisp.

**** That's a fair enough complaint, I'd say. There is a little bit of "too much fire" but I wouldn't say that it lessened my enjoyment of the fights. Usually the liberal addition of it seemed to be a finisher or a "clash of wills" style deal to me

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
