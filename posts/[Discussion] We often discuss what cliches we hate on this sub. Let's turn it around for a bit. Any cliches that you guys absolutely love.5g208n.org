** Way too smart 11 year olds. I really don't want to read about accurately described school children, the smarter they are the better.

This usually goes in tandem with political fics which i love. Not the Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Emrys-Slytherin bullshit but rather fics that focus on politics and intrigue rather than murdering Death Eaters and Harry training montages.

Dodgin Prison and Stealing Witches is a good recent example. The story is objectively completely ridiculous but i still love every word of it.

****** I'm kind of wondering what everybody thinks 11 year olds talk like. As someone who has worked a good bit with children (and who read the books for the first time while working with them), all the 11 year olds didn't seem all that different from a lot of the 11 year I have dealt with over the years. Generally more accurate in the books then in fanfics (though it both there is some artistic license).

Do note, however, that both of them are cross-overs, and the latter also has slash which might be off-putting to you even if it's not the main focus but just something that happens.

And if you want something ... deranged, then you'll want “Boredom is Deadly” (linkffn(11305455)).

**** Harry was the owner of all three Hallows, and thus "the Master of Death" according to the Beadle Bard story. Fanon has kind of run with that vague description and you'll find fics where he's possibly immortal and in some cases, has some sort of power over death. It's a trope that can get silly fast, usually if the author gives him unrelated powers because why not. Unrelated powers I've seen are shape shifting, wandless magic, time travel, inexplicable gender swaps, and of course ultra-super-powerfulness.

If you want a quick taste of MoD Harry, you can try out Omen by Evandar. It's a quick one shot that's the sort of flavor I enjoy. linkao3(979922)

I actually plan to eventually (whenever I have time and am done other stories) write one a fanfic where the dimensional walls start to break down and a bunch of Harry's get together to fight a Voldemort who's absorbed the power of several of his counter parts.

Of course it's composed of 99% terribly written sex. It'd be the author's masturbation fantasy and I'm not interested.

I guess it could be interesting if someone didn't just spew their fantasies. But still ridiculous. Maybe James gambled or otherwise lost his wealth and had to scramble to hide it from an unsuspecting Lily. He cons several families into betrothal contracts with his infant son in the plans of fixing it down the line. He dies without resolving it. Harry has to deal with the legal and magical ramifications of the contracts. Susan dumps him because who the hell would want to deal with that. Harry is despondent and overwhelmed by the contracts and commits suicide. Or one of the women (or their significant other/family) kills Harry. The end.

** Time travel, or do-over fics. Political fics. The Dark Lord gets his soul back and isn't as bad as everyone thought fics. Dark/Grey!Harry or Hermione fics. Soul bonds if they're done right. Marriage laws if they're done right. OP Harry, if they're a reason (like in a do-over fic, or because his magic was bound, or because he got a shit ton of training, or something. There /has/ to be a well explained reason.)

Honestly, I'll read just about anything if it's well written. It's bad/lazy writing that I don't like.

** Powerful Harry that has to work to become powerful. While the fics with this are very scarce, there are some, and I love them most of them.

Lily Potter/Harry Potter (IDK why, but it's honestly the best pairing when done correctly).

People edit details of characters or permanently scar Harry (Hair turning white due to a bout with the Cruciatus Curse, Hermoine having Raven Hair instead of Brunette, etc....) To me, it shows that the author isn't going to just go with every single one of JK's details. After all, you're writing fanfic for the opposite purpose.

** Perhaps not really a cliché per say but I do love me fics in which the author excels in writing/choreographing fight scenes.

There's the whole 'reading of the Potter/Black wills at Gringotts' and Harry generally taking control of his family vailts back from Dumbledore/whoever has the key.

There's Harry telling Molly Weasley to take her hugs and overbearing 'I'll be the mum you never had' attitude and shove it up her ass

AU fics that deviate considerably from canon are also some of my favourites. I really enjoy it when Harry does not end up staying with the Dursley's (but for a believable reason!) and arrives at Hogwarts years later much the better for it

** Well, I do love the cliché of a character (preferably the main character) having their body changed, either to that matching the opposite gender or to something that is partially human and partially ... not.

The reason for the first one is that though I was a girl, I spent years playing around with boys as a kid and somewhat thinking myself one of them, so though I know it's not true it still kind of feels to me as if anyone could become a girl; mind you, I like the changes in the other direction too, but female protagonists are much rarer so it does not happen as often. And the second one is because it's a change that is hard to conceal and as such it puts a weight on the character and forces them to get their own masquerade going in order to fool those around them; obviously, that somewhat applies to the first one too but in this case it's more overt.

And, obviously, the fact that I do like this cliché does not mean I read anything with it regardless of quality; some leniency in judgment, quite likely yes, but no regard for quality, heck no.

Also, anything where Hermione shows off her ruthlessness. It's such an interesting character flaw for a nerdy bookworm and for some reason it always seems to get glossed over in fic. If you're not her friend, she's perfectly willing to fuck your shit up. She was the "goody two-shoes" but she /still/ set Snape on fire, punched Malfoy in the face, permanently disfigured Marietta Edgecomb, trapped Rita Skeeter in a jar for god knows how long, gave Umbridge to the centaurs, etc.
