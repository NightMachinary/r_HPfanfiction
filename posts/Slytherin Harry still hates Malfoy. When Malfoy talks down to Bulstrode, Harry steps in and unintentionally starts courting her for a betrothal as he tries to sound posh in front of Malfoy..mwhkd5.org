She can't decline the boy who lived and he doesn't know enough to stop it until he is in too deep and it would ruin her reputation to be turned down at this point.


** I could see that happening him just repeating some things he heard from older boys Be even funnier if he did it to all the girls

** "SLYTHERIN!" The shout rang through the hall silencing all the murmurs that had been floating about just moments before. Harry gulped as he noticed he was the only student so far not to get appaulded. Head down, he hurried to the slytherin table with the other first years. His movement must have triggered something, because a girl who was sorted before him started to clap anf the whole slytherin table followed. Harry gave a grin filled with embarassment as he sat down across from the girl and next to that Malfoy kid he met at the Robe shop.

"Congratulations on joining the elite Potter." the Malfoy kid said as he threw an arm around his shoulder causing Harry to stiffen. He was not used to such close contact. "Stick with me and I can introduce you to all the right sort of people." The girl across from them snorted. Malfoy just glared at her. "Did I say something amusing Bulstrode?"

"You are 11. Who can you introduce him to?" She questioned with a laugh. Malfoy removed his arm from around Harry and glared at the girl. Harry relaxed briefly silently agreeing with the girl.

"And what would a mudblood like yourself know about it?" He sneered at the girl. The temperature at the table seemed to drop significantly as the conversations around them stopped and people started to look in their direction. The girl set her shoulders back and raised her head high. Whatever the boy called her had hurt her. Harry was about to speak up but the girl beat him to it.

"I am a half blood and a daughter of Tyler Bulstrode, son of Violetta Bulstrode, and I thank you not to dismiss my ancestry." She responded proudly.

"Daughter of a half breed illegitimate bastard and a mudblood. You must be so proud." Her face tinged red at his rebuke. "You would need a contract with someone of my breeding to put you back into good favor with the bulstrode line or at least someone of note like Potter here. Though, even if we were to slum it with a mudblood, I'm sure we could do better than you." The girl looked like she was about to cry. Harry scowled. He had to say something.

"Speak for yourself Malfoy. I for one would be honored to consider a contract with Bulstrode." He turned to face the girl who was holding back tears. "Hello, my name is Harry. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance." He offered with a handshake. That stuck up jerk thought he was so great. Harry had been serving at Aunt Petunia's tea parties for years. He knew how to be polite.

The girl looked shocked and was red with embarassment but she took his hand and with a shy smile replied. "Charmed, I'm sure. I am Millicent Bulstrode, as you have heard from the Bulstrode family. It is kind of you to offer, but are you sure we have only just met."

Harry beamed. "Of course Millicent. We are still young, there is plenty of time to dis uss contracts when we are a bit older, but I would be delighted if we could be friends."

The girl smiled brightly. "Thank you Harry, I would be honored." Harry missed the gob smacked expressions of those around him as the last first year was sorted to slytherin.

Malfoy chose that moment to butt in. "You can't be serious Potter! You may be a half blood, but you have far better prospects than the likes of her." Harry scowled in answer.

"I don't see how that is any business of yours. You have just mentioned that you have no interest in a contract with Millicent and I assure you I have just as much interest in a contract with you, so this really is between Millicent and I." Malfoy went bright pink and looked like he was about to say something when the tables were filled with all sorts of the most delicious food Harry had ever seen. Harry took a bit of everything and talked with his new friend about what kind of food they liked and what classes they were looking forward to. All in all it was a good start to a new chapter in his life.

--------------

This won't be a full story, but I am planing a few more scenes including Harry negotiating a dowry without realizing it's purpose and finding out that he is basically dating his best friend when he learns what the contract is actually for.
