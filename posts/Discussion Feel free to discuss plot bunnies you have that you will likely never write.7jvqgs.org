There are a bunch of story ideas that people will likely never write either because real life, they don't have the courage or time or whatever. But here is your chance to post your plot bunnies and see if anyone is interested in writing them.

And if someone is interested in said plot bunny the two of you are more then free to talk to each other about it, and get together to help that person write it.

I figured that there are so many interesting ideas that could be written about but aren't because the person doesn't feel like they can write it convincingly enough, but if someone was interested in it and was willing to write it then they could discuss it with the person that wants it done.


** HP as never-aging master of death. RW/HG are in their early one-hundreds after long, happy lives. HP, with the youth of his teens, cares for what remains of the geriatric golden trio before they pass. HP/GW (GW has already passed and they could never have kids). Loyal and honorable to the very end, HP has taken on the role of caretaker for his friends in their last two decades as their health failed, and their kids started families of their own. The aging golden trio lives together in a cabin in the Forest of Dean, where they spent the adventures of their youth, and one quiet afternoon, HP guides them into the warm arms of death before moving on himself.

** After a successful career in the special forces, Harry makes the decision to become a teacher. He's a complete unknown to the wizarding world, having been funneled into the special forces after his uneventful Hogwarts years. He arranges a week to shadow one of his favorite teachers in school (who is ignorant of his military career). In the classroom, he confesses that he was in the british military-- like the special forces, and sometimes worked across the pond. When someone asks if his missions at home extended across the pond, he answers no. This understated, shy young man of few words becomes Hogwart's new curiosity as he learns the ropes of teaching, something he has an innocent passion for, for the first time. You can take the man out of the military but you can't take the military out of the man. At the end of the week, Hogwarts discovers that the man who's been assisting their professor and quietly observing is the man who defeated the darkest wizard of their generation.

** I've got two.

After Sirius is killed in the ministry,. Harry's chase after Bellatrix leads to the time room instead of the atrium, where Harry is blasted into the remains of the time turners and the next spell that should have killed him interacts with the time magic and sends him back to the day his first Hogwarts letter arrives. A time travel fic where Harry doesn't have all of the knowledge of how to beat Voldemort, is no more powerful or magically able than he was at the end of 5th year, doesn't know about Horcrux's, but still does his best to fix things, not worrying about trying to preserve the timeline. Starting with Sirius.

The other requires a slight change in the timeline. As Master of Death, Harry has multiple choices in "Kings Cross". Go on, go back, or go to the first time he ever touched a Hallow. Harry chooses to go back and ends up in the past soon after he was born. With only post 7th year abilities and knowledge he has to try to find the horcrux's and destroy them, as well as Voldemort, in the 15 months before his parents die. The first horcrux he tries to get is the locket, where he finds and saves Regulus who becomes his friend as they try to bring down Voldemort.

**** Alternate self with a baby self in the world too. I'd have Harry wake up in the forbidden forest. He'd be drawn towards the Hallows and would have to deal with trying to take Dumbledore's wand, getting the cloak from his dad without revealing himself and having to answer a whole lot of uncomfortable questions.

Being drawn to the stone would lead him to the shack, the cup and the diary would be the most difficult. I would have Bellatrix not place the cup in the vault yet to avoid too much recapping and have the diary require either an infiltration of or assault on Malfoy Manor.

** Obliviate doesn't erase memories, it merely locksthem away. Harry had frequent accidental magic, and every time Dumbledore came and obliviated him and the Dursleys. This led to those memories coalescing into a separate personality with instinctive grasp of magic and a mistrust for Dumbledore for always locking him away.

Cue 3rd year. The Dementors have an unusual effect and weaken the barrier between Harry and his other, occasionally letting it out and revealing that Lockhart also had a habit of obliviating students.

** Harry Potter awoke with a groan, forcing himself onto his hands and knees. He looked around and coughed. What had happened? The last thing he remembered, he'd fallen into the trap door Fluffy had been guarding and into a black pool, but this didn't look like the forbidden corridor at all. He coughed again, unable to catch his breath. The air seemed thick with some sort of gas or smog, and Harry struggled to breath. He tried to call out for help, but only made a gasping sound.

Suddenly, from the corner, he heard a shuffling sound.

"Hello?" Harry said, trying to push his glasses up on his forhead. Then he coughed again, the choaking red fog filling his lungs.

The shuffling sound came again, and a creature stepped into the dim red light. Harry shuffled away in panic. It had a maw full of razor sharp teeth, and four legs that seemed to be spikes. It let out a chittering sound, then charged.

Harry pressed himself against the smooth steel wall, beginning to cough and cry in panic. Just as the creature was about to reach him, the steel above Harry bent, then shattered inward, sending the creature back.

"Exarch, I heard something in here," an oddly accented voice called. "Survivor maybe, and one of those mutated ravagers."

A thing in glowing armor plate stepped through the hole it made over Harry. It had no shoes, instead standing atop of black hooves. A tail poked out from the rear of the plate armor, which was set with glowing purple crystals. The thing raised a large warhammer made of more purple crystal. "Begone, foul beast."

The spike creature let out a warbling wail, then charged the warrior. The hammer came down in a thunder of warm yellow light, crushing the chitinous armor of the beast. It fell in a pool green icor onto the ground.

The warrior turned to Harry, and the young boy almost cried out in alarm. It's face was blue, and covered with bristly black hair, as well as blue tentacles that were bound by a leather thong into a sort of beard. It's eyes glowed with an inner blue light, but they were warm and kind.

"What are you, small one?" the warrior rumbled.

Harry was too weak and out of breath to answer, and he was picked up by the warrior in strong arms. The creature hoisted Harry up through the hole, handing him off to a slimmer, more feminine blue creature who was dressed in silver robes with blue crystals sewn in. "Anchorite, this thing looks to be a child. A blood elf, perhaps?"

The female took Harry in her arms, waving a hand over him. A glowing symbol appeared on her forehead between two horns, and Harry felt warmth suffuse his body. He stopped coughing, suddenly feeling much healthier.

"Are you an elf, child?" the blue creature asked in a warm, soft voice.

"I'm a human being," Harry answered. "I'm not an elf."

"Human?" the larger male in armor asked. "Is that not the name of those strangers on the far shore of Azuremyst?"

The female set Harry down, and he found he could easily stand. He pushed his glasses up, peering at the two strange creatures.

"What are you?" he asked. "Who are you?"

"I am Vindicator Maraad of the Hand of Argus," the huge male answered, getting down on one knee to look Harry in the eye. "This is Anchorite Ysel, also of the Hand of Argus. We are draenei. Tell me, little human, how did you end up in one of the shards of the Exodar?"

"I do not know," Harry said. "I remember falling into a black pool. I was trying to stop Professor Snape from obtaining the philosopher's stone. He's an evil wizard."

"A wizard?" Maarad looked up at Ysel and frowned. "Odd."

"Vindicator!" a new voice called.

Harry gasped in amazement as another draenei rode up on what resembled a small elephant with four tusks. The rider waved to the three. “Vindicator, have you found the boy?”

Maarad stood, glancing at Harry. “Yes, Kessel. I have a boy, but how did you know this?”

“The Prophet, he sent word,” Kessel said. “He is wanted in the Exodar at once, as are you, Vindicator.”

Maarad nodded, hoisting his warhammer. “Very well. Then we must leave at once. Come, young human. It seems you have been expected.”

*** The first thing Ron Weasley knew was that he was cold, and that he wasn't at Hogwarts anymore. Shivering, the young wizard sat up and looked around. Where was he? The last thing he remembered was jumping into that black pool with Harry and Hermione, but he didn't see them. He stood up, shivering almost uncontrollably. He looked around, and saw he was on a small mound of grass and rock surrounded by pine trees. The sun was setting, and a chill wind was blowing.

“Bloody fantastic,” Ron said through chattering teeth. He looked around for his wand, but he must have lost it. Where was he? He got out of the wind, finding a small cave to curl up in. He gathered some sticks and bark from the trees, but he was lost as to how to make a fire.

“Come on, come on,” Ron muttered, trying to rub sticks together like the muggles were supposed to do. “Burn! Incenda! Fire! Smoke! ARRGH!” He slammed the sticks together, and a small spark burst out.

“Reth?” the spark said.

Ron blinked, falling back on his haunches. However, as a wizard, a talking spark was not hte oddest thing he had ever seen, so he cupped it in his hands. “I don't suppose you'd mind burning this for me, would you? Please?”

“Reth reth reth,” the spark said, leaping onto the branches. Soon, Ron had a neat little fire going. Warmth filled the cave, and though he was hungry and exhausted, Ron felt pleased.

He sat in the cave for hours, listening to the calls of beasts and the wind and feeling sorry for himself.

“Thanks for the fire,” he told the little spark which was dancing in the flames. “Reth is it?”

“Reth reth reth,” the spark declared, swirling about.

“Thanks mate, but you don't know where I am, do you?”

“Aye, yer lost ya are laddie,” a female voice with a thick scottish accent.

Ron blinked at the fire. “Huh. I didn't know fires were Scottish.”

“What's a scott?” the voice said again, and Ron looked up as a short woman in leather armor with blue facepaint stepped into his little hole.

“Oh, sorry, I thought you were Reth here,” Ron said, pointing to the fire.

The little spark seemed to bow to the visitor. “Reth reth reth.”

The woman nodded, peering into the flames. “Ack, that's a right fine fire elemental ye've managed to bind there lad. The spirits told me I would find a powerful young shaman here, and looks like I have. I must admit though, I did no expect it to be a wee human.”

“Fire elemental?” Ron asked. “Shaman? I'm no shaman, I'm a wizard.”

“Oh, ye frem Dalaran are ye then? Long way from home, lad. Where are yer parents?” the woman asked.

“What's Dalaran? And I suppose mum and dad are back at the Burrow in England. We can't be far from Hogwarts though if we're still in Scotland, right?” Ron asked.

“This is no Scotland,” the woman said, stomping her foot on the earth to emphasise the point. “This here is the Hinterlands, home of the Wildhammer Clan. I'm Myra Stormborn, shaman and griffon rider of the wildhammer clan. Who are you laddie?”

“Um, Ron Weasley,” Ron said. “But you sound like a scot. Where are your parents?”

Myra laughed. “I suppose me dad's back at the Aerie caring for his forge even on a night like this. Me mums likely cookin' supper wonderin' where her daughters got off to again, even if I'm old enough to have a home of me own now. Don't ye know a dwarf when ye see one boy?”

“Um, no,” Ron admitted. “I thought dwarves lived in Scandenavia.”

“Ye have the strangest name for places boyo. Well, come on. Stormbeaks waitin' outside. Let's get ye to a proper fire and some dinner.”

Ron nodded, waving to the fire. He didn't know what was happening, but dinner sounded good. “Bye Reth, thanks for the warmth.”

“Reth reth reth,” the spark said, and hopped up into Ron's pocket. He was warm, but didn't burn Ron's clothes.

“Aye, ye'll make a mighty fine shaman with the proper trainin'” Myra said happily. “Got fire in yer blood ye do.”

“Have you seen my friends, by the way? Harry and Hermione, they're both human kids like me,” Ron said as they walked towards a large golden gryffon. He's never seen one before, but they were supposed to be nice if you'd tamed them.

“No laddie, yer the only one around. They human too?”

“Well yes,” Ron said. “What else would they be.”

“All kind o' beasties around these parts. Elves an' trolls an' mookin. Even got some dragons not to far from here.”

“Oh, my brother Charlie's a dragon tamer. Maybe they'll know where he is at the preserve,” Ron offered.

“I think yer more lost than ye might realize child,” Myra said. “Come on, let's go. We won't find yer friends standing and jawin around here.”

**** “Hey, what are you doing here?”

Hermione sat bolt upright, gasping and looking around wildly. She was lying on a cold concrete floor, with flashing red lights going off all around here. “Harry, Ron, the water-” she cut herself off, peering around.

“Hey, you're not a gnome,” the voice said again. Hermione spun about to see a young girl standing beside her, dressed in overalls with a grease stained face and a wrench in one hand.

“No, I'm a girl,” Hermione said, standing up. She was just about as tall as the other girl, though the other girls brown twin ponytails stuck up well above Hermione's head. “Like you.”

“No, you look like a human,” the girl said, shaking her head. She reached out then and grabbed Hermione's left ear in one hand, rubbing it. “Yep! Not an elf, so you must be a human.”

“Ow!” Hermione protested, rubbing her sore ear. “Who are you, and why did you grab my ear?”

“I'm Kristine Lee Smallfry, though my friends call me K Lee! Why are you here in Gnomeregan human girl? And obviously, I grabbed your ear to check if it was pointed. You don't look like an elf, but you can never tell without empirical evidence.”

“I don't know why I'm in Gnomeregan,” Hermione said sulkily. “I'm supposed to be in Hogwarts helping my friends Harry and Ron stop Professor Snape from getting the Philosopher's Stone.”

“Oh, you need a philosopher's stone?” K Lee said. “Sorry, can't help you there, but I know some alchemists who might be able too! I'm just a regular gnomish engineer, here to scrounge for parts! Had to beat up a lot of troggs to get them too.”

“What's a trogg?” Hermione asked.

“You know, the big ugly things that look like a dwarf with a really bad hair day and even less hygeine?” K Lee said. “Oh, like one of those there. Watch out, that one's irradiated.”

“Urrgghh,” a very odd man said as it walked toward them. It was glowing green, and it's body was covered in hair. It looked to Hermioen sort of like a neanderthal. “Rahg? RAWWWGGHHH!”

The trogg charged, waving a club and foaming at the mouth.

“Step back human, this one's hostile!” K Lee proclaimed. She dug a gun out of her pocket, and pointed it at the charging trogg. “Taste engineering monster!”

A ray of lighting zapped out of the gun, hitting the trogg which turned into a glowing green chipmunk. The chipmunk blinked, squeaked, and ran away.

“Yes!” K Lee cheered. “The Critter Maker 3000 works! Well, most of the time, anyway. Field tests show about a 70% success rate.”

“What happens when it doesn't work?” Hermione asked curiously.

“Oh, you explode. Or they do. Very messy. I'm still working out the kinks, but that's gnomish engineering for you! A dash of magic with a hefty dose of SCIENCE! Together, those two great forces of the universe can do anything!”

“Wow.” Hermione looked around, confused. “Say, do you know where Hogwarts is? I need to find my friends and stop Snape from getting the Philosopher's stone.”

“Oh don't worry about that,” K Lee said. “We can just make a new one if he steals it. My friend Tally Berryfizz can make you another one if that guy steals yours. The ingredients are a bit rare, but I'm an expert at finding rare ingredients! Why, I was thinking of going through the Dark Portal to outland to try some of those fascinating new materials for my inventions. Say, maybe that's where Hogwarts is! You could come with me. I could use a new lab assistant, mine left after I accidentally turned him into a critter once. He got better, but he had no sense of adventure. Dwarves. What can you do?”

“Well if it's not too much trouble,” Hermione said. “I would like to learn more about this magical engineering. They told me you couldn't mix science and magic, but if you can that would be extraordinary. Plus, I really do want to get back to school, or my grades will be dreadful.”

“I can help you with your grades! I was stop of my class in Arcane Theory and Exposiveering 303. I might not look it, but in addition to being an excellent engineer, I'm also a powerful mage!”

“Is that like being a witch?” Hermione asked.

“Oh no, I think that's more like being a warlock,” K Lee said. “My friend Wilfred Fizzlebang knows all about that. I think I have a book on Summoning Demons for Beginners back in my wagon though. Come on, I'll show you! I could use some imp blood for my latest batch of rockets anyway.”

Hermione followed after K Lee, happy to be on her way back to Hogwarts and her friends. If she could get another Philospher's Stone along the way, that would be even better.

** After I am done with my Fight For Rights story I would like to write an idea I have about Harry dying from the Killing Curse in the forest at the end of Deathly Hallows and then going to King's Cross and getting a choice to "Go on or go back," but when he chooses to go back he gets reincarnated into a newborn witch! :) And then he has to learn to accept and cope with growing up all over again, and he has to deal with the struggles of gender dysphoria, and then he goes to hogwarts with ron and hermione's and draco's kids, and then a new threat to the magical world shows up and he has to fight to save it again. :) Also I want to make Voldemort come back way later and that way he and Harry will be almost on equal footing since Harry will have two lives of magic experience when they start fighting again.

Also yes the battle of hogwarts would go different, with Voldemort losing his body again and being a helpless spirit for a decade or two again. :)

****** Let's say a fusion with limited wizarding world involvement. Because of the technology in Bucky/Harry's arm, he ends up unable to rejoin the wizarding world fully. Every time he visits a magical place post winter soldier he's forced to take off his mechanical arm and reinstall it because it goes on the fritz around magic. After some years alone and confused as the winter soldier, he's captured by the avengers and forced to remember his suppressed past. He immediately identifies with captain America because he somehow remembers subconsciously his own past as an underdog turned savior figure. Captain america thinks harry /is/ Bucky Barnes, and shows him pictures and souvenirs from Bucky and his boyhood days for weeks. Seeing those antiquated relics of boyhood trigger Harry's memories of an anachronistic dormitory, too- loose hand-me downs and young friendships. As the tension is Harry's head reaches a maximum, harry is introduced to the magicians of the MCU. perhaps Steven strange or scarlet witch. With that, all his memories domino into place. Years have past and his friends have grown older. The wizarding world tore itself into unworkable factions with Voldemort, who, in the battle for immortality fought to stay ahead of the order's slow but methodical destruction of his horcruxes by dividing his soul further. As a result, he became even more of a grotesque and unreliable villain metaphorically hidden behind a curtain. Harry knee none of this, but cottoned on when Colin creavey barreled into his mcu life one day, certain that this winter soldier photographed in the muggle papers had to be the same boy he himself had photographed growing up....

******* Lol that's way too long of a first act. I figure we'd time jump passed the events everyone already knows via the mcu and just use them to re-frame a few emotional beats. I'm thinking we would take a few chapters for the becoming winter soldier drama, then time jump past the beginning of the winter soldier movie, re-frame an interaction with captain America, time jump to the avengers capturing him and captain America's plan to help him remember he's actually Bucky Barnes. Spend a lengthy chapter on the remembering thread, then a little time re-establishing Harry's identity / perspective on things. Then turn everything on it's head with Colin creavey and an update on the pathetic state of the wizarding world. <maybe this is actually the halfway point!> Next harry visits, learns he can't help alone, and a plan ( drama) is hatched to team up the non- technology based avengers while the tech based ones are sidelined to non-athletic roles like tech support, research and planning. Of course the whole plan goes to the crapper with magic, the wizarding world's over-involved public opinion, and unplanned encounters from old friends and mentors. Enter the third act.

Dumbledore is losing his shit, and his grip on the wizarding world ever since Harry went missing as a child. The sightings at gringotts plus rumors and wizardry lead to the knowledge of Harry's placement with Muggles, and then his Disappearance from same.

Tom 'Diary-Horcrux' Riddle [T1] leaves Hogwarts semi-stealthily, leaving a dead girl in the Chamber of Secrets and mysterious writing on the walls. He studies the actions of Tom 'Lord Voldemort' Riddle [T0], and finds them lacking.

T0 bumbles about Albania and Eastern Europe after fleeing from Dumbledore (and without Magic Rock).

T1 starts war with Wizarding World, not vastly differently than T0 did the first time. T0 gets mad, starts war with both Wizarding World, and T1. HarryThulu chuckles in his island fortress, snacking on dementors and watching his pets (read: prisoners) do tricks. Dumbledore falls victim to the 2face philosophy, the whole of the magic side of International Statute of Secrecy is embroiled in war. Goblins rebel, magical species do magical things, common wizards are idiots, T0, T1, Dumbledore, Ministry of Magic; these are the sides of the widespread panic, fighting, and magic.

As the the warring becomes too much for everyone involved, HarryThulu comes out of his Island Fortress, eats a lot of people and things, and then Declares himself King of Magical Britain.

epilogue: Harry marries the Queen, becomes King of Both Sides of the Statute, and abolishes it.

sequel: with the phenomenal capabilities of magic added to the wonders of modern technology, Harry becomes a Spaceship Captain, Nomad-King of the Sol system, travelling to alien lands, eating things, and catching pets [anyone/anything interesting] to make dance and do tricks.

** The spell that kills Luna Lovegood's mother also winds up killing her father. Luna is either taken in by the Weasleys or the Diggorys--just imagine little Luna wearing a Weasley sweater or else tagging along after Cedric.

Dudley, somehow, is blasted back in time and winds up trying to set things right and save the world from a Bad Future. Only problem is, he has no clue what's actually supposed to happen, and his primary motivation is trying to reconcile with Harry.

Some sort of shenanigan results in Snape getting splashed with Shrinking Solution. Snape is shrunk to three inches tall and then gets stuck that way.

** Rebirth of magic

It started about 5 years ago, just with the two of them. They found each other in the London Library of all places. A perfectly normal place to spend the day for her. But for him, it was just a warm place among many to pass a hard winter's afternoon. She was at 2nd year Uni, narrowing down some research for a paper on epigenetic inheritence when something gave her pause. She looked up to find a boy staring at her. A boy with vivid green eyes. He looked like a vagabond, unclean and uncouth. But he looked comfortable, not diseased or starving, just poor. One of her father's many fond quotes came to her: "In a country well goverend, poverty is something to be ashamed of". And so with an odd feeling at the back of her mind, and charity at the front of it, she offered him a meal. Thus a friendship was born.

Over time, through shared lunches, and walks in the parks and museums of Greater London, they came to share their own stories. Him, a runaway and street urchin; her, a lonely student. But for all that time, all those walks, they never mentioned to each other (who would believe anyway?) all the little things they had in common. One early spring morning, everything changed.

They were walking along aimlessly, debating the merits of various systems of government, when something gave them both pause. The row of shops along the side were a bit run down, but quite normal, until they came across what could only be described as the scene of a bombing. The site appeared abandonded, with only the largest bits of wreckage untouched by time. They looked around and noticed that the other people on the street refused to even look at the destruction, and simply gave the area a wide berth. For them the pull was undeniable, and they entered the wreck of what looked like an old tavern. It looked like the bomb blast had come from the rear of the building, where an oddly bright amount of light was emanating. Neither even thought of leaving, but instead slowly walked toward the back of the room, and stepped through a hole in the wall, into another world.

Much like the bar, the alley they found themselves in looked long abandoned. It showed clear signs of some forgotten battle. But the area felt crisp... fresh. The very air hummed with energy. "What is this place? And where are all the people?" she asked.

...

Story contines with them finding Flourish and Blots and a shared realization of accidental magic in their lives. In one of the books, Harry finds out some of his family history. Hermione finds a newspaper with a /War with the Goblins/ headline where the article mentions unspeakables working on a "final solution" to tame the goblins. Harry and Hermione would have been around 6 when it happened. They pick up wands, learn some magic, and eventually find a few other muggleborn. At some point, they travel to Scotland and find the ruins of the school. Correspondence in the headmasters office indicates an attempt to strip the magic from the Goblins. It would appear the resulting attempt did something to the humans instead.

After a rebuilding montage, they find the children of the magicals, the oldest of whom was 6 when the calamity happened and magic disappeared from their lives. Only in the last year or so has magic begun to return, but the magicals are equally (if not more so) clueless when it comes to actually using magic. They lived a lord of the flies like existence under the heavy hand of the pure blood children. The pure bloods blame the muggles and muggleborn for the calamity. A war ensues.
