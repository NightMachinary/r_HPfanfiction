Attempt at a believable OP!Harry, so the fights take awhile to get to. Here's a taste:

"Kill him!"

Shouts of incantations preceded a stream of spells pouring from the Death Eater's wands, but the floor rose like a silo around Harry and the fallen man, absorbing the first wave of curses. Harry heard a call for blasting hexes and pushed at his barrier, the lifted floor exploding outward in a hail of shrapnel.

The blast of debris was easily shielded, only knocking down a single one of the attackers, who swiftly met his end as a stone spike rose out of the floor and snuffed him out moments after he fell.

"Son of a-" the man in the silver mask cursed, as no sooner had the stone spike retracted from his comrade's chest, the lobby burst into a confusing flurry of transfigured animals and attacks. Chairs turned into wolves and leapt into the fray, the admitting desk grew teeth and snapped off the arm of one of the Death Eaters, the entire floor shifted into a swirling pit of sand, and stone columns emerged out of the walls, bursting in straight lines through the lobby.

Aiming at the solitary figure in the center of the room was no easy task given all of the conjurations and transfigurations cluttering the battlefield. The man in the silver mask was wildly swinging a whip made of molten fire that flowed from his wand, slaying Harry's wolves with wide sweeps, accidentally cutting through one of his allies' legs in the process. Both he and the man that had been literally 'disarmed' by the admitting desk were swiftly dispatched with twin swirls of incandescent flame. Three Death Eaters remained.

"Outside, now!"

"There's only one of him, Dolohov!" shouted another man, shielding against a stone spike that emerged from the floor in front of him. "We can still take hi-" The man abruptly went silent as the paper-thin root that had grown out of the ceiling jabbed into his shoulder, quickly growing throughout his body and bursting out of his chest cavity.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.
