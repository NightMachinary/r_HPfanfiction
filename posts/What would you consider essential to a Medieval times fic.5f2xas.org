I'm currently writing an outline for a new fic about Medieval times,.


** A certain level of historical understanding. I don't expect an author to have a degree in the subject, but if a quick google tells me that witch hunts peaked during the 1500s and continued into the 1700s, I shouldn't be reading in a fic that witch hunts ended during Henry VIII's early 16th century reign. (As an unhypothetical example.) While there's only so much that can be done by a fic author to re-create the 'feel' of a time period, and I don't expect anyone to go to the level of a historical fiction author in their research, some understanding that trains didn't exist during the Founders era (another fic I've seen, yes) makes the difference between whether I keep reading or close the tab.

** Where wizards stand with muggles, would be a big one. Are wizards seperate like they are in modern times? Do muggles and wizards have the same monarch? I think I remember something about witchtrials from the books in that that's when wizards wrnt into hiding? Maybe?

Knight-wizards? Do wizards fight in combat? How sophisticated is wizards magic at this point?

*** I know these are rhetorical, but I'll answer them anyway.

#+begin_quote
  Do Muggles and Wizards have the same Monarch?
#+end_quote

Wizards and witches serve the same King as muggles. The only real reason they do is because the King possesses three artifacts (the crown, the throne, and the staff) which are the predecessors to the unforgivables.

#+begin_quote
  Witch trials
#+end_quote

I'm scrapping witch trials because they've already been combined.

#+begin_quote
  Knight-wizards
#+end_quote

Most wizards don't become Knight's for two reasons:

One, a lot of wizards are wealthy because they can cheat with magic to get work done.

Two, they already have a rank higher than knight (I.E James Potter is an Archduke)

#+begin_quote
  Do wizards fight in combat?
#+end_quote

It all depends on the wizards, but most tend to not. However, there is a whole division for witches and wizards in the army.

#+begin_quote
  How sophisticated is wizards magic at this point?
#+end_quote

The magic is crude and taxing, but get's the job done. Whereas the normal Harry Potter character could easily stun someone, wizards in mine could only knock them out by levitating things at them.

However, they do have some serious magic that can really fuck you up.

** You'll want to do some actual research into what life in medieval times was actually like (what do they eat, wear, spend their days doing, what technology was around, what was the architecture like, etc) in order to paint an accurate picture as well as to emphasize that this is actually medieval times, not a Renaissance fair (the Medieval Era and the Renaissance were quite different!). As an obvious example, there shouldn't be anyone drinking pumpkin juice since pumpkins originated in America which, of course, was unknown to mainstream Europe at the time. If it's a time travel fic, take some time every so often to show the main character being very out of their element, this can both provide comic relief and serve the plot.

Don't assume wizards of the era all know 'Old Forgotten Magiks.' In the Harry Potter universe's magical society, magic takes the place of technology. It advances as well, with new spells being developed and refined as time goes by. But at the same time, you can show the medieval folks possibly being more in touch with the basic less refined magics as it's all they know and thus spend more time mastering, like how a medieval muggle would know all about how to live off the land while modern muggles take such things for granted.

Somethings interesting to explore would be differences in magical society in medieval times versus the modern isolated counterpart. Try to look up historical attitudes regarding witchcraft and the occult in that era keeping in mind that such attitudes have shifted over time.

** Look into the medieval relationship between the church and state. It could be useful to know the kinds of conflicts arise when there are parallel political structures. Look into medieval and renaissance ideas about magic. Look into medieval medicine. Read some medieval theologians on the difference between magic and miracles.

[[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles3b.htm]] [[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/]]

A discussion of how an imbalance of the humors produces sickness might be interesting, especially if potions work on the humor theory of disease. And in turn, the potion works because the magic user believes in the humor theory of disease. (This would suggest that a potion made by a modern and scientific wizard after modern science developed would work on fundamentally different principles.)

** A lighter but more mundane note is shit. I think I read/saw somewhere that back then, shit was everywhere. They didn't have a proper sewage system and they sometimes threw the bucket out the window onto the streets.

So when describing the place, make sure that, if its a well populated city/town, there is a stench in the air.

And besides, the medieval era began with the fall of western Rome, and Rome had sewers.

** You seem to be doing your research so I doubt you've not done this, but an important one is nailing down the time period and sticking to it.

For example, most Founder fics aren't actually set in the canon 10th cent. they're set in a generic high-medieval-fantasy world, which corresponds to the 11-13th cent. with later romanticized ideal added. So the culture and society is completely wrong- it's Anglo-Norman/generic-fantasy rather than a jumbled mess of English/Norse/Welsh/Gael/Scot- and there's huge, obvious, anachronisms like the existence of potatoes.

Otherwise, as long as you do a reasonable amount of research, give the setting a consistent and accurate feel (right names, which is very easy to do, right power structures, no using things they didn't have) I'm fairly flexible on events and AU elements as the world is going to develop differently with actual magic in it- but anything you change has to have a good and believable reason for it that fits in your version of the world.

**** That's a fair approach. I would be a bit careful with just saying they are ignorant, because of the existence of cathedral schools. Also, there was a Renaissance in the 12th century. Then again, as a medieval historian, I am very touchy about how the Middle Ages (please avoid Medieval Times/Dark Ages) is portrayed. If you are interested in specific topics, or general histories, I would be delighted to provide you with some specific books/articles.
