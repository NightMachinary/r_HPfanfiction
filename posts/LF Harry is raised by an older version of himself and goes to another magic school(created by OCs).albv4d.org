So, i'm looking for this fanfic, where I remember that Harry was raised by Sirius(or WITH Sirius, in the same house). Maybe a older version of himself too, I cant remember, but since i really dig into time travel, it makes sense. In this story, i remember that Harry goes to a magic school that worked like muggle school, and you had like loads of muggle classes with your magic classes, and they started studying at 7 or 8 or something? I remember that they tried to make the school "oficial" and went to the Goblet of Fire, and since they started teaching kids so early at 14 Harry was okay to compete against 17 years olds. I also remember that there was a school trip to a zoo that ended up with a kid kind of almost being eaten by a big cat, and being saved by the schools principal or something like that... Also the school was near a beach cuz i remember harry getting surf lessons...

Still cant remember the name of the school, or fanfic, can you guys help me? ;-;

edit: Already found it, thanks Emuburger!\\
edit2: lol it was SEVERUS going back in time, how did i messed that up again? ^^"


** Part of it sounds like linkffn(10101403) Fixing Past Mistakes but its Severus that raises him but a lot of the other stuff happens in this fic or something similar (I think).

linkffn(11434139) A Brand New Start has Harry go back in time and raise himself with Sirius and Remus all living in the same house but young Harry goes to Hogwarts.

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE

  Rita spouting lies, branded as a Dark wizard and goblins in a rage; Harry's had enough. So, he seeks to jump back in time to save himself from a life of misery and fickle loyalty, maybe a little revenge and mysteries along the way.Time Travel! A Harry raises himself fic. Non-epilogue compliant, non-slash.
