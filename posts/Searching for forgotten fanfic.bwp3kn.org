:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember the name of a fic as you may assume so I thank you for your help in advance. I read it on Ff.net and it was a fic o Harry Potter that took?consumed?absorbed?assimilated? Abilities of others with the help of a ritual. I remember that there were a Greek gods in it and no it wasn't a crossover with Percy Jackson,at least I think so. Anyway in the end of a fic he was contacted with a council of Harry Potter's I think? It was an AU. He had a brother,his parents were alive. After ritual he always fell unconscious .The Greek gods too had school of magic and only their descendants were allowed to enter and study there. He captured Gods one by one and some absorbed at that time and some he left alone until the end of destruction of school, I remember that Aphrodite was one of the ones left until the end of the destruction of the gods school and then was absorbed. It wasn't the end yet there was some more storyline. I think he was in studying in Durmstrang? I'm not sure, take it with grain of salt.


** Nervermin found it, it's The rise of Harry Potter by ZaneT69
