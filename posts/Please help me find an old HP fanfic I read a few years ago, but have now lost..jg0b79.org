:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry runs away from the Dursley's, Dumbledore and Harry's frineds freak out trying to find him. He gets some odd jobs in Diagon Alley and uses a black headband to hide his scar. I believe this is post-Order-Of-the-Phoenix.


** Is it linkffn(realizations by wishweaver)? This was the fic that taught me about abandonment issues. Not because of the content; because it hasn't been updated in 10 years

*** Thank you! This is the one I was looking for. May it forever be wide skies in which you soar, vengefulmamantee. May the wings of the Brightshadow enshroud you, that you never need fear the dark.

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help? Additional Story Notes FYI: a. AU Summer before Fifth Year Fic, b. Not particularly fast paced.

  AU Summer before Fifth Year story. If you recognize it, I don't own it. Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What does he do since he's not supposed to contact his friends until he gets the all clear?

**** How did I miss this?!? Thanks so much! I know it's silly, but this was one of the first fics I got super into back in the day and I have returned to it at least 20 times looking for updates over the years. I really appreciate it
