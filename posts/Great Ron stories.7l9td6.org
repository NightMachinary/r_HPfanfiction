My favourite Hermione story is the sadly never to be complete Applied Cultural Anthropology, lol. She's also pretty great in The Never-ending Road.

There's so much Ron bashing too.

What are the best Ron stories? I liked him in Lesser Evils...

**** I agree! You might already know this, but the censored versions of her stories are on fanfiction.net. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/425031/LavenderBrown]]

On her ffn profile, she writes, "I am currently putting together an MSN group devoted to my fics: the uncensored versions. If you want to see them, go to the URL shown above and click on one of the story links, and it will take you to my group. You must register in order to view fics (and note, not every fic has been posted yet). Thanks!"\\
As far as I know that was written in 2003 and I don't see a URL link anywhere :(.

***** I don't read on ff.net, so I didn't know they were there. Thank you very much for the link. Such a bummer that it's the censored versions. She wrote such lovely smut. She had a James and Lily story that was also very good/hot, but I don't remember the title of it. Way back in the day, I used to part of that MSN group, but I don't think it's around anymore. I might have to take a look through my ancient bookmarks and see if it's still there. Too bad I didn't think to save the stories I really liked on my HDD.

****** I'm so sorry I can't be more of help; I can only commiserate. I wasn't part of her MSN group, so you would know more than I would/do. I took a prolonged break from fanfiction. When looking again...Checkmated was no longer running. I do remember a Lily/James fic, but it could possibly be the wrong one. The one I think you're referring to, in one of the last chapters, involved a phenomenally good scene including all-nighters, a faucet, and Lily on the precipice of figuring out the marauders' secrets of being animagi with Moony as werewolf. Regardless, was the fic ever finished?

******* The one I'm thinking of was where James and Lily were head boy and girl. To be honest, I don't remember any of the plot really, just that there were some fantastic smutty bits she published as outtakes. I'll ask my beta who was also on CM until just about the very end. I sure do wish I had an archive of my reviews from back then.

As international influences begin to creep into British politics, Dumbledore isn't the only one worried for the future. Thomas Gaunt is concerned as well, but for very different reasons...

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1316097/Pinky-Brown][Pinky Brown]] has some good Ron-centric fanfic. You could try "Six Foot of Ginger Idiot," which is Ron's diary entries during HBP. linkffn(3637489)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/900634/Solstice-Muse][Solstice Muse]] also writes a lot of stories with Ron even as the main character or one of the main characters. Her writing isn't technically as good as Pinky Brown's, but she's great with characterisation and she hits some real emotional beats. My favourite fic of hers is "Eternal Sunshine of the Scourgified Mind." linkffn(2594688)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4548380/Coyote-Laughing-Softly][Coyote Laughing Softly]] writes mainly Ron/Hermione stories. The highlight is "To Know You is To Love You," which starts with an adult Ron and Hermione going to an unorthodox couple's councelling, and then the main bulk of the fic is dedicated to them getting to see their lives and developing relationship from each other's point of view. linkffn(9094981)

I also have a soft spot for the "Son of the Archer" stories, which are a crossover with the MCU. In this story, Ron is abducted from his family at a very young age, and then ends up in America, adopted by Clint "Hawkeye" Barton. linkffn(11230962; 11884262)

Finally, if you don't mind an alternate take on Ron, I very much like the Weasley Girl series. The premise is simple: In this universe, Ron is a girl. Fem!Ron, with the imaginitive name "Veronica," is hotheaded and sarcastic like her male counterpart, but being the first-born daughter in the family means she has slightly different hang-ups and priorities than a sixth-born son would have. linkao3(6130632; 3721921; 3793561)

And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy.
