Voldemort has no Horcruxes. After Half Blood Prince, Voldemort topples the ministry like canon, but many groups emerge in defiance.

Dumbledore's army is one of those groups, others include the order and ministry loyalists.

no bashing.


** Check out [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined by starfox5]] AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently. Basically Hermione creates her own Muggle born militia. Complete. FFNet.

** Isn't that what happens in DH?

In a realistic setting (well as realistic as you get in JK's world) thirty or so teenagers would stand no chance against Voldemort's forces (or probably not even Voldemort himself). Their greatest advantage was that they mostly resorted to school rebellion against three teachers that had to walk on eggshells around them since some of them were children of the sacred twenty-eight, as well as the Hogwarts defenses when Voldemort attacks the school.

So I'd rather imagine the story taking place sometime in the future when a bunch of witches and wizards had time to get an understanding of the regime's inner workings, had time to train under a powerful master or mistress and the Death Eaters have grown complacent. So basically the DA would be for the Death Eaters lead government what the Death Eaters were to the previous Ministry in the past.

*** That would be good, but I would it like to feature voldemort, harry, fred and others, so that is why it was set then. Ideally it would be set when harry is an adult

**** When I said thirty or so, I included Harry and Fred in the count. If Voldemort is to act in character, he would probably get pretty quickly bored of ruling Magical Britain and pursuit other greater things... I mean he pretty much does that in canon, leaving the Death Eaters to rule however they please while he is off on his quest for the Elder Wand. So I imagine him becoming more of a legendary godlike figure... maybe the magical equivalent of Big Brother. Everyone has to adore him but he doesn't really do much other than exist as a threat, while his Death Eaters make sure that his narrative is kept as law, as well as the fear of him.

***** Actually, that would be interesting, andwould also give the opportunity to spread dumbledore's army very thin, as they might have to work over many countries.

** They're basically the rebel alliance, while Harry, Hermione and Ron are the just the public figures of the rebellion.
