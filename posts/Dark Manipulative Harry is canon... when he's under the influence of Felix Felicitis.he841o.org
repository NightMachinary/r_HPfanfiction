In this scene in canon, he gets Slughorn and Hagrid drunk together. Drunk Hagrid gives Slughorn a lot of valuable potions ingredients, which has Slughorn feeling good, and Hagrid's sentimental good-heartedness is catching, which has Slughorn feeling bad about Harry's parents and wanting to be on the "good side of history." Harry/Felix sets Slughorn's emotions up to be primed to feel guilty/sentimental enough to help Harry understand Voldemort's weaknesses.

This is a good thing overall, Harry manipulates Slughorn past his own cowardice and I'm sure he would be glad about it by the end. Harry also manipulated Hagrid and probably Hagrid would have cosigned the goals. Harry also splits Ginny and Dean up but Ginny in the end was happier being split up with Dean.

Can't say Felix made Harry make harmful decisions but it's definitely in a "for the greater good" kind of style. As Ron and Hermione notice, this whole sequence is very out of character for his generally Gryffindorish personality.


** I wouldn't call it dark and while he doesn't do it often he does similar things in other books. Some are:

- when McGonagall catches them without supervision in CoS, Harry lies and starts going on about how they haven't seen Hermione in ages. McGonagall tears up then takes them to Hermione.

- he pretends Sirius is a mass murderer to get the Dursleys off his back at the end of PoA

- pretending to pour Felix Felicis in Ron's goblet

And another "for the greater good" moment is pretending he'd immediately give Griphook the sword in exchange for his help.

*** Well I guess that's a conversation about what's dark vs light. The Ron's pumpkin juice is actually a great illustration because Hermione is all shocked and offended "Harry I can't believe you would do something like that..." and Harry's like, "Hermione, you're a hypocrite because you confunded McLaggen."

The reason Harry's and Hermione's actions are "not dark" are because Ron's a better person than McLaggen and deserves to win. But Hermione's posturing and Harry's response clearly draws the line about things that aren't really within the boundaries of wholesome lightness.

His manipulations of McGonagall and the Dursleys I don't believe make him dark in the same way as Felix does because he doesn't really manipulate his "victims" into anything really out of their comfort zone. He manipulates McGonagall and the Dursleys into not punishing him which really doesn't affect their life much.

With Slughorn, he had a reasonable fear of Voldemort coming after him if he didn't straddle the line, and poor Hagrid basically got his generous nature taken advantage of thinking he was bonding with another professor who just wants money, just because Harry wanted to get Slughorn in a good mood.

**** Am I the only one who hate this whole dark vs light adjective thing?

It used to be that dark Harry was “dark magic using Harry” and it sort of became “pragmatic Harry who isn't afraid of killing, using dark magic, or doing unsavory things to win”

I've also seen it as “sadistic, sociopathic Harry who gains pleasure from hurting or exploiting/abusing/manipulating others”

Now dark seems to be “Harry lies or manipulates” which is kinda ridiculous. It's like how fanfic would call Harry Slytherin for doing something that is reasonably smart. “Oh you're lying to avoid trouble, how very Slytherin of you” Yeah find me a teen who haven't lied at some point to avoid trouble

Light and dark are such senseless terms nowadays because 1) they've been overused and 2) morality is a lot more complex

***** Yeah, it's strictly supposed to describe the type of magic one uses /and/ who they use it on.

***** Yea that's kind of what the canon books discuss with that book The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, since Dumbledore's supposed to be the king of the Light. Finding out about Dumbledore's past makes Harry and Hermione get "disillusioned" about these perfect boundaries. They're socially isolated kids so their understanding of morality is pretty simple, but some adults think that way too when they idolize someone (Snape for Lily, everybody for Dumbledore).

Many fics decide that Voldemort is playing the long game and is staving off some threat of Muggles destroying the planet if they're given power over magic, kind of like Grindelward. If he's given "true sight" of these actual consequences then he's doing the right thing. But if he's just guessing then he's an egomaniac who's willing to throw away other people's lives for his theories.

I think "Light" morality, whether in magical or nonmagical actions, tends to firstly respect people's autonomy over their own lives. Like a love potion would be dark, a healing potion is light because it gives you back your health which gives you more autonomy. In the real world where most people already don't have autonomy, its more complicated.

** Disagree on the splitting ginny and dean up thing. They were on the rocks already according to canon. He might have subconsciously nudged them but I believe they would have been quits within the week anyway

** On a completely unrelated note, there was a fanfic where a potions accident resulted in Snape permanently under the effects of Felix Felicitis, along with giving him a godlike physique, and golden blond hair. He then succeeded at everything he did, and was utterly miserable for it, because life no longer offered any challenge.

** It's even worse if you subscribe to the theory that Felix Felicis is actually just a placebo with some mood enhancing qualities.

From that perspective, Harry just let his inner Slytherin* out to play but can blame the effects of the potion to justify his actions; both to others and himself.

*Not that Slytherin equals dark and manipulative, but it's probably how Harry would classify it at this point.

*** Why do all these youtube channelers talk so weird like trivia contest announcers lol.

It's an interesting comparison though because its true the way we understand placebo in the Muggle world are kind of magical. Like you can fix internal health issues just by believing you took a pill about it somehow somatically.
