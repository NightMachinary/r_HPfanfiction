EDIT: This is a modern au

It was no secret that Harry Potter was muggle raised. It was also no secret that along side not understanding wizarding culture, he did not understand muggle culture.

Harry was pretty introverted, preferring to spend time alone or with his two best friends. This didn't mean he never socialized in the common room, but it was few and far in between that be did. And while many wanted to get to know Harry better, they usually left with more questions than answers.

"Something wrong, Harry?"

"Huh? Oh, no, just didn't really understand what you were talking about."

...

"You mean trolling?"

☆☆☆

"How do you not know these things?! Did you grow up in a cave?!"

"Not a cave, but, does a cupboard count?" Harry asked hopefully like it was a joke.

"Wha-"

☆☆☆

Eventually, the muggle raised of Gryffindor said enough was enough. At the end of Harry's third year, they stuffed a piece of parchment with different apps and websites for him to explore at his chest. He tried to ask what they were, but they all left silently. Harry was honestly a little creeped.

So, with the little freedom he got from threatening to sick Sirius on the Dursleys, Harry took the Knight bus to the Leaky Cauldron. Once inside of Diagon Ally he rangled with the Goblins to exchange some galleons for pounds, eventually conceding on a 20% converting fee (the greedy little fucks). With that, he got his school supplies, then went out into London.

He went inside a large store called 'Best Buy', and quickly realized he was way out of his element. With the help of a (jealous because why is this thirteen year old carrying two paychecks worth of quid) sales clerk, Harry got himself a nice new ASUS ROG laptop.

When Harry eventually set everything up in his room (along with him being sneaky to find the wifi password), Harry opened something called up called 'Google Chrome'. He did a look around the room, making sure no one would pop up out of nowhere. Glancing at the parchment which instructed him to ask it anything he wants, Harry steadily typed in what every girl obsessed thirteen year old was looking for.

"B-o-o-b-s."

Little did the muggle raised know, the day they gave him that list was the day they created a monster.

☆☆☆

While the opening feast was about to commence, Barty Crouch Jr was clunking through the halls. He cursed Moody's paranoia not for the first time. Now he was late, and he didn't want to give Dumbledore any reason to be suspicious. Though, as someone who had a flair for dramatics, he supposed a cool entrance would cement his character.

Alas, it was not meant to be. When he was almost at the door, Potter himself came out of the side hall and kicked the doors open.

Everyone watched incredulously as the Boy-Who-Lived slowly stalked his way up to the front. His round, wire rimmed glasses gleamed white and allowed no green eyes to show. People who knew him were surprised at the new glasses, even his clothing was more modern. The muggle raised cackled softly in knowing.

When he reached the podium, Dumbledore stepped aside with a nodding gesture, looking amused beyond measure. When Harry stopped, he was silent for a few moments. Many were startled when his head silently jerked up, and felt for a draft when they saw a strange breeze touslling his hair and clothes.

"Hello fellow students. I have only a few things to say. This summer I have searched my soul, questioned my own existence and have come to some riveting conclusions. First and foremost, I have learned was child negligence is. I have also come to the logical conclusion that I am an anime protagonist, and have made many odd choices for that reason. Hopefully one day, you will understand. All you need to know right now, is that I have charmed my glasses to gleam whenever I am being dramatic. This can only be stopped when I push them up the bridge of my nose with my middle finger." He did just that, and for some reason his green eyes were half lidded and possibly glowing. It was oddly intense. "Do what you will with that information."

Harry went to sit down, every muggle raised was practically shaking to restrain their laughter. The wizarding kids just looked confused. And Barty stared from the hallway as Dumbledore introduced 'Moody'.

What the fuck was that?

☆☆☆

Barty was freaking out.

No one was supposed to /know/. How would they? He had done literally /nothing/ incriminating yet!

But since the start of term, Potter had been staring at him so scrutinizingly even /he/ was starting to get uncomfortable.

What did he do?!

☆☆☆

"Harry mate, why have you been staring at Moody? I think you're actually starting to freak him out."

"As a protagonist, I have noticed a trend. Every single Defense teacher I have had has either tried to kill or harm me, and I am almost fucking certain he will try."

"... that makes sense."

☆☆☆

Snape was at the end of his fucking rope.

The brat had somehow managed to get even more infuriating, he was about to strangle the shit.

Where did he get off asking about the relationship he had had with his parents, looking at his shocked face, then after saying "ah, classic grudge from a rivalry over a girl" just bleeding leave?!

And why on Merlin's soggy wand was he right?!

☆☆☆

The great hall was silent as Dumbledore snatched the strange fourth piece of parchment with his wrinkled hand. As he read it he appeared shocked, then resigned. He grumbled out,

"Harry Potter."

"I FUCKING CALLED IT!"

☆☆☆

"Harry, what, and I mean this is the most friendly way possible, the actual fuck are you doing?" Harry and Hermione were up on the astronomy tower, the latter starring expectedly at the former, who was for all intents and purposes, about to jump off of the three hundred meter high tower.

"I'm attempting to awaken my broken, bullshit ability. It's in here somewhere, I know it."

"You're going to die."

"And what a small price to to pay for scientific discovery."

"Harry!"

"It's fine! I can summon my broom if I'm too close to the ground, so I have a back up task plan even if this fails! It's win win!"

"What part of /death/ are you not comprehending?!"

"The G for giving up!"

"There is no G- Harry oh my go- are you fucking serious."

From the apparent power of belief, Harry was currently gliding through the towers on his own set of black colored wings. Enjoying it immensely.

"PROTAGONIST POWERS AND PROTECTION MOTHERFUCKER!"

☆☆☆

Harry could see from his opponents eyes this would be his toughest battle yet, he pushed his glasses up infront of the hushed crowd, all familiar enough with the gesture to know that something was about to go down.

With an edgy smirk that may-or-may not have been practiced in a mirror and a breeze on his protag messy hair, Harry showed his awesome as fuck black wings.

While yes Harry would have liked to keep them a secret, having willed them into existence with a sketchy and made up potion; they didn't simply vanish when he wasn't using them like in stories. Hermione had grumbled about having to be the one to put the disillusionment charm on them for hours.

At least they made a cool entrance.

He whispered determinedly under his breath,

"I'm gonna fuck you up, dragon." Unfortunately, while he said 'up', someone had sneezed. Everyone stared at him weirdly, the awesome atmosphere gone.

"Fuck you UP! I'm not gonna- what ever just start the task."

☆☆☆

Harry grasped his egg as he stared despondently at the young woman in front of him, no longer knowing if this was a preticularly moist dream or not.

"Just because you SAID you were gonna go at me doesn't mean I'll let you!" She had a honey skintone with black hair, horns, scales, a tail, little wings, and big yellow eyes.

APPARENTLY all dragons could change into human, no one knew though for some reason.

Harry ended up backhanded into the ground despite the task being won, knocked out complete with a little ghost.

"BAKA!"

☆☆☆

"Hey Christina, would you go to the Yuletide ball with me?"

Despite getting off with on a bad start, Christina the hungarian horntail decided she liked him and was now legally his pet. But he wasn't so depraved as to treat her as such, no siree.

"Really?! I'd love to master!" The pink collar she was wearing was at her insistence, as was the master thing.

This still didn't stop Hermione from wacking him on the back of the head, but Harry slept at night with the consolence that it was because he was the main character.

And that's great.

"You'll have to take me dress shopping, I don't have anything!"

It was really, truely, absolutely, 100%, certainly, great.

☆☆☆

"Oh 'zank you 'Arry! 'Ow can I ever repay you!" Harry tried to say some words, but they were swallowed up by the humongous hongalongabonhonagaroos his face was being stuffed into.

For the second task, Harry had utilized his wings despite them generally being a nuisance when he wasn't flying or in battle. With a bubble head and propelling charm, he used his wings to stear around in the lake. There was some trouble, but ultimately Harry had ended up rescuing Ron and Fleur's little sister Gabrielle.

Who was hugging his side as tightly as Fleur. The cold (February fuck whoever made this task) wind acted up again, and despite the warming charms curled his black wings around the two French girls.

Christina puffed angrily.

☆☆☆

"Okay, Master, I /guess/ she's good enough for you." Fleur giggled into his chest as Christina pouted, Fleur having proved herself to dragon. "But if you think you can forget about me, you've got another thing coming!"

"Of course, zhere is no need for competition. I vill not be left be'ind." They stared at each other intently.

Harry was was facing the ceiling on his four poster bed, wings around two wonderful girls, silently thanking every god he knew for this turn of events.

"Master, is that a tear?"

☆☆☆

Harry Potter was a lucky fucking man.

Everyone stared in envy as two bomb shells practically fed him his breakfast, at the insistence of "you need to eat for the task!" Harry turned the tables on Fleur, saying she shouldn't be worrying about another champion. Of course he was rebuked, everyone knew he was a walking disaster. Hermione nodded silently until he gave in.

Lucky. Fucking. Bastard.

☆☆☆

Harry whipped around towards Cedric, wings flared in surprise. They were in some sort of graveyard, far away if the change in weather was an indication. They agreed to be on guard, but the gross little voice still surprised him.

"Kill the spare!"

With his wings extended out, Harry caught the jet of green before Cedric, and fell to the ground.

☆☆☆

"Wormtail, you idiot!" Honestly, why was it so hard to find good henchmen? They always mucked everything up. "Use the spare, it's as good as we have now you bumbling fool." That sniveling little man stunned the older boy, who was too busy fusing over a body.

Maybe everyone was just stupid.

The ritual was going smoothly, even though the weak fool almost fainted. It was only a flesh wound, by Merlin.

It was when Wormtail was going to fetch the blood that it went wrong.

"Reduction!"

"What, what?"

"Fuck, sorry, typo, ehem; REDUCTO!" The cauldron was blasted upside, and Wormtail was sent to the ground mangled.

"WHAT?! How are you still alive?!" Voldemort could not level with the stupidity!

"It's quite simple really," Harry Potter drawled as he stood in the heroic breeze, with wings (for some reason) spread dramatically. "I'm the main fucking character. Stupid! Wait, Stupify!" And man-baby Voldemort lost.

Harry cut down Cedric down, who stumbled into his arms. It was a bit awkward because Harry was shorter.

"You saved my ass! I can't repay tha- wait. How are you alive? I saw that curse hit your wing thing." Cedric wasn't inclined to move, and Harry ended up staring into his weirdly enthralling honey eyes.

"First of all, don't bother, second I had some weird soul get out of jail free card, and third of all: is this gay?" Harry wasn't interested in having a sexuality crisis.

"Not if I count as the exception."

"All right."

After gathering all the shit plus two comatose bodies up, they both portkeyed away to Hogwarts.

☆☆☆

Harry stretched as he came out of Dumbledore's office, having gave his version of events. Turns out that Voldemort has some soul containers laying around, and once those were gone they'd finally be rid of the bastard. Harry left that in Dumbledore's capable hands, promising to help if the need ever arises.

"Master!"

"'Arry!"

"Harry!"

Harry smiled as his impromptu harem came up to him, and yes, Cedric counts. They haven't really talked about it, but he's tagging along at the moment. The mc, furry, blonde, and exception. Seems pretty good for now.

Harry smiled as they began arguing about where to eat, but he was distracted. Apparently, being a Triwizard Champion was a means for emancipation. Legally, Harry was an adult.

And Legally, he could go piss off the Goblins by asking about a bunch of legal "Lord Potter" shit.

Harry chuckled sinisterly, feeling like he was about to start fucking over some annoying people.

But first, lunch.

☆☆☆

Holy SHIT this spiraled. I've written crack but wow. If you recognize any references, then you know. K imma sleep.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.
