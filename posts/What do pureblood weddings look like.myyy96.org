I'm writing a fanfic where the main character is a pureblood (specifically from the Black family). And, there is so little information on how Pureblood weddings work. So, any ideas/headcanons on how a pureblood wedding would look like? Traditions? Etc?


** I mean, it's a fanfic so you can just make up what ever you want. But if you want to look to cannon Harry Potter you could check out Bill and Fleur's wedding in the seventh book. They aren't stuffy, traditional purebloods but they are a completely wizarding family so that could be a place to look for ideas. Other than that there isn't really an answer to what pureblood weddings are like.

If it was up to me I would probably say the Blacks would have a more somber sort of ceremony. Probably some kind of magical binding ritual or something, then a big feast. If there was dancing it would probably all be rather formal and elegant. The ritual would probably be the greatest focus. A different pureblood family, like the Malfoys, would probably have a far more extravagant ceremony with a big ball, expensive food, and intracate decorations. These are just my own ideas, though, and may be very different from your vision of the world you have established.

** I'm too lazy to come up with something new so I have looked at a weeding dress. The white dresses weren't popular until Queen Victoria made them popular in 1840. So then I looked at fandom if she was a muggle or a witch. I found out that she was a muggle so I needed to look for someone else who could make white dresses popular. And, funnily enough, there were two ministers of magic which could make it popular in magical Britain.

The first one is Hortensia Milliphutt who was trying to create regulations on pointed hats of all things, so she could also do something else with clothing.

And the second one is Evangeline Orpington who was a good friend with Victoria. So it would make sense if she introduced such a trend.

But because wizards are quite slow at accepting new things I would say that the color of the dress doesn't really matter. Before Victoria it just essentially served for showing off wealth.

Overall, I like Fleur's dress very much. Black wedding dress's meaning is ‚Äútill death do us apart‚Äù thing, if I remember correctly (I have no idea how her dress looked like in a book but in a film she had a black something on it). And a tiara repels evil spirits (I read it's a thing in Norway, or at least was).

** I'd look at British nobility wedding traditions prior to 1692 (Statute of Secrecy) and consider how those traditions might have changed and evolved with the incorporation of magic. While there might be some elements of pagan rituals, it seems unlikely that they would revert to more ancient ceremonies after the Statute of Secrecy was passed (imo), rather newer magical additions established to distinguish the weddings from Muggle ceremonies.

** so here is a very brief excerpt from a fic I'm writing with Regulus' orphaned daughter going to Hogwarts

‚Äò... He had then moved to Beirut to learn under a certain Master of wand lore and enchanting, where he fell in love with a pureblood Princess in her own right; though that wasn't the reason he fell in love. Artemis' mother had inherited his favourite local bookstore that he visited often, and he fell for her at first sight. or, as had written in a letter to Aunt Cissa, she had ‚Äòmade [his] heart flutter like a snitch was caught in his chest, trapped behind his ribs'. Her aunt thought it was the height of romance.

They had married in a tiny ceremony in a forest, witnessed by three centaurs and a moon priestess, which was barely a step up from not getting married at all in Lucius' perspective--which was utterly preposterous, as they had followed a ritual that followed the Old Ways to the letter; which was far more than Lucius could say, as the ceremony had been banned in Britain, among so many other things of such importance. But then, Lucius often showed himself to be utterly gauche and nouveau riche, and far less traditional and pure of blood than he pretended.

Artemis had a photo that her father had sent Aunt Cissa at the time. It had been taken right after the rite, with the two of them standing with their hands still tied together with vines and cords, her in a simple ceremonial gown of undyed linen, and he in only a pair of linen trousers. Both had their waist long black hair out and untamed, with flowers and vines woven in the tresses, his of course being the very same infamous Black curls that Artemis had spent so much time trying to restrain that morning. In the photo, both of her young parents were still covered in slightly smudged runes of joining and oneness; love and fidelity; pleasure and generosity. They had gone for a lifelong bond of equals, something Lucius would never be brave enough to submit himself or his magic to, much to the regret of Aunt Narcissa. The photo was her favourite of her parents, and she brought it with her everywhere in the form of a copy that had been miniaturised and placed in a locket she wore at all times. In it, her parents only had eyes for one another, exchanging a small, private smile and a tender kiss. When they part, Regulus' eyes would stay closed for a moment, as if somehow memorising the feel of her lips on his, before fluttering open to meet her mother's...'

still working on it so sorry if it's rough, but anyway I see it as a ritual thing with oaths spoken but also intended aspects of the marriage present in the ritual

There is a really great wedding scene in one of those reverse harem marriage law fics (lmao!) which involved a ribbon of magic and a pledge of what each person would bring with them into the marriage linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7759351/1/Ten-Too-Many]]) Of course in that fic it's a long process because she has to exchange those vows with ten husbands but it's a nice thought for two as well

There is a similar process in Kiera Marcos' triad fic, I think it's [[https://keiramarcos.com/2018/12/darkly-loyal-chapters-1-5/][Darkly Loyal]] where they do a triad ritual and each choose to share a magical talent that they all get from the bond. That's pretty cool.

I think it depends on what kind of magical tradition you've decided on in world though, because if you don't have magical bonds or something it will look different

*edit to add that I forgot that I was going to change the moon priestess thing because I was going to have a Black family tradition of having their weddings on a new moon so they're under the stars. So always at night and always on new moon.

** I would guess there would be some Pagan symbolism, but I suppose it's up to you on how you want to balance the Victorian vs Pagan/Old mystical mediaeval magical stuff thing(you know, like Arthurian stuff or something).

** Well, since it's the Blacks, I'd assume the slaughter of a muggle for good luck. Maybe that tradition died down thanks to ministry rules, so then they slaughter an animal. The binding that Bill and Fleur's wedding had canonically, and a lot of fancy food and stuff(As you can see, I'm clearly also an elite). Pictures with every guest, and a 3 hour dinner.
