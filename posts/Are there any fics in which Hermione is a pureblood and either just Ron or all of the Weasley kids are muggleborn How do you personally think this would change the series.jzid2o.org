#+TITLE: Are there any fics in which Hermione is a pureblood and either just Ron or all of the Weasley kids are muggleborn? How do you personally think this would change the series?

** This is an interesting idea. I would assume Ron would be as ecstatic about magic as Harry while to Hermione it would be a rather mundane thing to study magic. In such a scenario Harry would be very academically focused because Ron would be too and Hermione will be more laid back compared to canon, meaning academically the trio would be more or less equally matched. Hermione would not be petrified in the second book however Ron might.

It probably wont be Ron that rescues Harry from the Dursleys what with no magical flying car and all and Hermione is not the type of person to run off without a plan so Harrys summer before the second year is shitty at best. Dursleys probably wont send him to Hogwarts so a faculty member might come to rescue Harry when he does not show up to the sorting feast. Ginny would not grow up with the stories of Great Harry Potter the Boy who lived and might act more civil with Harry and potentially become a better friend.

Finally Ron wouldnt abandon them during the seventh year. Weasleys in large would have left the country to somewhere safe like America. Hermione on the other hand might leave, so we would have Harry and Ron stuck in the wild without Hermione to help them and if Hermione does not have a track record of cracking under the pressure like ron does Dumbledore would not leave him the delimunator so She probably would not find her way back to her friends. Couple this with Grangers probably not wanting to send their only Daughter to death, Hermione would be out of the story until the later chapters.

All in all first books would not be that different from the canon however later ones would be vastly different since as the characters age, the worlds they grow up in would cause more and more differences between them.
