Here is the link to the story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11433385/1/The-Many-Skies-of-Lumen]]

I wrote this after making my "LF high fantasy fic" thread because I decided that there aren't enough fantasy stories in this fandom. Although this first chapter doesn't say much, I intend to focus the whole story on world-building, lore, and creating lots of atmosphere.

As the title says, though, this is my first fanfiction, so it's highly likely that some criticism is in order. If anyone reads this, please let me know where you think I could improve.


** tiny (but annoying) nitpick - Lestrange is only one capital letter.

** I don't see anything wrong with it. The writing is good. Can't really judge much more before you get to the high fantasy setting.

As a sidenote, I really wish we had bi-weekly/monthly stickied threads were people could post parts of their stories and have people read them. Both for readers to discover new things and people like OP to get feedback easier.

** Not bad. Not bad at all. As you said yourself it's a little early for feedback but here's some general stuff.

--------------

When someone says a spell I don't know about other people but I prefer to read them as saying the spell. For example you wrote "a muttered /flagrate/". Because the person is actually saying the spell I have always preferred the spell to be placed inside speech marks, although that's just a pet peeve of mine.

--------------

Said. Said. Said. Asked.

I felt like those are the only ways any dialogue was exchanged. I understand that there are only so many ways to say something but don't be afraid to use different words other than said. Overuse of said becomes very stale quickly so every so often use something a little different.

The way in which you say things also impact the meaning quite a lot. For example - Harry said, "Watch out!" is different to - Harry whispered, "Watch out!". Very basic sentence with no description, but by changing the way in which the thing is said you get a different impression. Whispering is more secretive and/or urgent than saying something. Simple things like this can really elevate your writing.

--------------

Anyways apart from those rather small things I didn't find much bad. You have actually started off a promising original fic, not another rehash of a popular trope so I am excited to see where you take this.

I will give you more substantial feedback later on, when there is more material to read.

*** Thank you, I'm glad you found it interesting. On the topic of "said" and "asked," I actually did that intentionally. There's a trope called Said Bookism which refers to the fear of using "said" because it's believed to be boring, but ever since it was pointed out to me that the brain can work out the tone of the dialogue just by reading it, I have tried to stick to just "said." Not to compare my writing to J.K, but if you look at a page of dialogue in DH you will hardly see any other word being used. Rest assured though, if I ever need a word like "whispered" to make it clear that a character is whispering, I will do so.

**** Yeah, be careful on that, it's actually rather poor advice. Most people ignore "said" when they read anyway, and it's much better to not bog down dialogue. Instead of "avoid /said/ whenever you can", try "use /said/ whenever applicable".

**** Ah ok. You can never be sure of someone's intentions unless they specifically say so, so I assumed it was accidental.

** It's very good, and I'll be interested in reading more when it updates.

Advice-wise, you don't have to both describe a spell and mention the spell name if it's cast repeatedly. I noticed this when the characters used /Lumos/, and it was a little distracting. Kinda like the Redundant Department of Redundancy. Other than that, I couldn't find anything to complain about :P

*** You're absolutely right about the description, I came up with it at 2AM. I genuinely don't see how I could improve it that much, though. The whole point of the story is just that: they find a passage which was made by the Unspeakables, and it takes them to a different world. As the person who came up with this story, I feel like I have a pretty good judgement of what is and isn't important, but you might be right.

I appreciate your concern about this being a crossover, but if it was, I would have posted it as a crossover. Give me a little credit in that respect.

The first sentence is a bit odd now that I think about it. You bring up some good points that I'm not sure how to fix.

Edit: I replaced the first sentence with something new. It should be a little better now.

** It kind of dragged on, a whole chapter just to get them through that door. There's this weird tension between them rushing away from the chasing death eaters, and standing around 'angsting' about what to do.

But it was well written, so I look forward to your fantasy setting.
