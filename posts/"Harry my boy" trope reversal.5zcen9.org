We have seen tons of stories where anti/heir/angry Harry reacts to Dumbledore calling him by his first name, usually with a "My boy" involved somewhere.

Is there any story where he just rolls with it and starts addressing Dumbledore as 'Albus'?

Eg: "Harry my boy, I must know where you spent the summer and why you left the safety of you relatives"

And Harry goes, "Well Albus old chap, I had an appointment with the Malfoys to meet the Dark Lord and then I took their hospitality for the remainder of the hols"

  "Hello, Harry," said Dumbledore.

  "Hello, Headmaster," Harry replied. So they were on a first-name basis? Would Dumbledore now say to call him -

  "Please, Harry!" said Dumbledore. "Headmaster sounds so formal. Just call me Heh for short."

  "I'll be sure to, Heh," said Harry.

  There was a slight pause.

  "Do you know," said Dumbledore, "you're the first person who's ever taken me up on that?"

***** HPMOR has many great parts and many bad parts. What I didn't like was the loud "pseudo-science fuck yeah" and that Harry often behaved like an overexcited puppy. Ender's Game in contrast is much, much calmer. Ender is more calculating than HPMOR's Harry, who rushed into things true HP style.

HPMOR can't all be bad, or it wouldn't have much followers. Just like robst isn't all bad - he also just has flaws.

In the end it comes down to a lot of things, and while social validation is nice (If you read something popular, it's a good investment of your time, after all a lot of people did that too!) and comforting, finding and liking your own stuff is great.

  "Ah, Harry, my boy!" welcomed Dumbledore.

  "Ah, Albus, my unwanted and unwelcomed stalker!" Harry snapped back with his own eyes twinkling and a mock-lovial voice.

  That jolted the old man in his seat before he exclaimed, "Harry!"

  "Albus!" Harry exclaimed right back.

**** It's a power fantasy fic with a bunch of tropes and cliches, and literally everyone but Harry and a small selection of people are stupid as fuck. (I think the author's aware of this, and decided just to not hold back.)

It's really, really bad, but at the same time, it's... satisfying to read about Harry showing up the Establishment constantly. If you need a feelgood fic with Harry getting everything handed to him, then this is the fic for you.

You know absolutely where this fic is going, but sometimes you want that obvious action-power-fantasy.

Nothing wrong here, sometimes you do not want or need deep thoughts.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

** It's sort of reversed in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/132/Odd-Ideas][Chapter 132 of "Odd Ideas"]]. Dumbledore talks to Harry/Xander and calls Tonks "Nymphadora". Harry says that she wants to be called Tonks. Dumbledore says that he wants to be called "Albus" and that he will call her Tonks once she stops calling him "Sir", "Headmaster" and "Professor".

** I've seen this happen in a few, but for the life of me I can't remember which stories they were, and I doubt I'll be able to find them again. Sorry about that.

All I can say for sure is that this has /definitely/ happened, and that I remember Dumbledore (or McGonagall - maybe she was in the room too, I'm not too sure), reacting to independent!Harry's petulance by telling him that's not the proper way to address a professor, and Harry responding something like: "Oh, well I thought we were on a first name basis, you see."

I'm really sorry that I can't be of more help.
