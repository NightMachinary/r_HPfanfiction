DISCLAMER : THIS IS A GENERAL RANT. I KNOW ALL FICS IN THIS TROPE AREN'T WHAT I DESCRIBED BUT MOST ARE. IT'S LIKE THE STATEMENT ¬´ MEN ARE TRASH ¬ª YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY IF YOU'RE NOT.

Be it that he was summoned or that he jumped voluntarily into a parallel universe there is something that has always bugged me. Everyone is so damn mistrustful of him. Most of the time they are at war, but are sitting on their hands doing nothing but waiting for the next attack, letting known Death Eaters roam free. But Harry, dear Harry that doesn't bear the mark, that most of the time has been thoroughly questioned under Veritaserum is distrusted and even treated like dirt. They see a young man coming from a different universe and having been through war and wonder why he isn't like every other seventeen year old. Or they snap everytime he talks about something he ¬´ wasn't supposed to know ¬ª. They sometimes fear him because he is powerful. And I get a kick out of it every time I read about him being summoned to defeat Voldemort and they still think it isn't normal for him to have the power to do so. They summon him from his word where he just defeated Voldemort to defeat another version of the monster and they just expect him to roll with it. They expect him to be an obedient little soldier (much like he was in canon), fighting THEIR war on THEIR terms, following the orders of the great Albus Dumbledore like a puppy. And while they expect him to save them --- because it's your duty my boy, countless lives have been lost in the war we've been waging, you must think of them --- they still regard him with contempt and mistrust. Moody and Dumbledore are the characters I hate in these stories. They expect answers, obedience and RESPECT! Other times they won't let him fight, thinking him incompetent but very content of the intel he gave them. All the adults will treat him like a kid, Hogwarts' staff like a student when he is so much more than that and has been through much more than every adults in the room. And there are fics where they won't want to give them information about their world, the state of it and of the war. And the worse is that in these fics, Harry does all he can to earn their trust when he should be yelling at them, cursing them to hell and back. In these fics he doesn't understand that he doesn't have to prove himself to anyone. And in the end he fights their war for them, while content because in this world Sirius or his parents are alive and he can develop a relationship with them at last. Screw that. You may have people that resemble your love ones but you don't have respect, you don't have money, you don't have your friends and makeshift family, you don't have freedom and you have an evil dark overlord to kill AGAIN. Be pissed and don't take any shit. Oh and finally what pisses me off the most ¬´ I'm sorry my boy but this spell could only be cast one and is a one way ticket, you can never go back to your world. Lemon drop? ¬ª

Can we please have a fic where he put them in their place, take no shit from them, make them realize how selfish they were for summoning him from his world. A fic where he doesn't hero worship the headmaster. A fic where he maybe summon the people he cares about and decide he won't settle for the copies. A fic where he takes things in his own hands. A fic where he asks them what they would feel if after the war, one of their loved ones was summoned into the middle of another one. I'm not opposed to a world where James and Lily are alive but I just hate that Harry trusts instantly.

I read one that was good recently : World in pieces by Lomonaaeren. I also read another one where Harry asked to be paid to kill Voldemort but found it meh. And I read plenty more but they were written right into my rant.

** The problem with your requirement is that if you go that way, most of the times authors end up doing a Mary Sue and thats the worst trope second only to bashing (which you are also implying).

Also you only stated one of the problems with dimensional jumping.

The other problem i have is on how Harry always has to NOT care for his parents. Holy fuck. I mean if you have ever lost a parent you would fucking give an arm to seen them again. Yes they are not the same people , but most of the times they are pretty close to what they would be and they still write Harry not caring for them.

*** Yes, I imply bashing because they deserve to be bashed. They summon someone from another universe without care for their lives and family and want to put them right at the wrong end of Voldemort's wand. Of course there is bashing involved. This isn't even a remotely acceptable behavior. I support bashing in this trope because for Dumbledore to summon someone from another universe, he must justify it with his ideology of the greater good. And the greater good ideology is the main ingredient of the bashing trope. I mean wouldn't you be mad? If I parachuted you in Iraq right now and told you that you had to put an end to the conflict while showing you no kindness, wouldn't you be mad? Wouldn't I deserve to be bashed? And to me there is a difference between a Mary Sue (perfect in every way) and a character that's strong and doesn't just accept fate and people's scorn. People like that exist in real life. The Mary Sue thing kind of annoy me because the tiniest deviation from canon which improves Harry gets him labeled as a Mary Sue. Of course I don't like god-like Harry, head of every house, Master of Death, proud owner of a harem, owner of 86 properties, gorgeous as hell, more intelligent than everyone etc... But this is fanfiction and it is born out of yearning. People realized that canon Harry wasn't all that he could be and wanted to show how it would be if he had reached his potential. But instantly he becomes a Mary Sue character. Sometimes he is, sometimes not, there is a middle. Moreover, Tom Riddle was able to be handsome, charismatic, intelligent and nobody ever said anything bad about it. They think that him sinking into the dark arts, losing his looks, charisma and part of his sanity is enough to explain why he wasn't a Mary Sue. But before his ¬´ downfall ¬ª, according to every fanfiction reader, he was. He was not the epitome of goodness but he had many things going for him. As to the parents, I can understand someone jumping at the chance to get to see their late parents again. All I'm saying is that he never knew them, he managed to find his own despite their loss and barely an hour after their first meeting he calls them ‚Äòmum and dad' when they are not in fact the people he lost. That doesn't make them any less his parents but come on surely it's not normal for someone to just accept previously dead and unknown parents so easily. Let them get to know each other first. Dial it down. When you never had parents you can't just stick the title on the first people you meet. Yes they are, but at the same time they're not.

** Well, when Harry gets summoned, the summoners will have the home field advantage. So even if Harry is utterly pissed, I expect some subtleties from a vanquisher of the dark lord to act along until he collects enough info about this world. He can then decide:

1. The summoners are good people, but are really desperate enough to resort to kidnapping; and Voldemort is a true monster that has to be put down. So he agrees to help them at a reasonable price.

2. The summoners are crappy people and screwed up their own war through sheer incompetence and other bullshit. In that case, he wants to extort some serious Galleons and get back home at first opportunity.

3. The summoners are such backstabbing scumbags that allying with Voldemort seems to be the better alternative.

4. Dumbledore and Moody (and others) might be shit, but Hermione/Weasleys/Luna/Neville/others are good, so he either tries to evacuate them to his home dimension, or build a third faction with them. If he can access his home dimension, he can also bring in reinforcements.

5. If time travel is involved additionally and Muggle worlds are very similar, he can make a killing in Muggle stock markets. In that case he has more incentives to play along.

Anyway, throwing a tantrum on potential enemy home turfs is tactically a very stupid thing. Even if hostility is warranted, better hide knife/wand behind your smile.

*** Yeah I think people get offended too easily and take a general statement and apply it to themselves. I'm a man. When I hear ¬´ men are trash ¬ª I don't feel attack because I know I'm not who the statement is about. I'm more than my gender you know. So when I bash fics I don't need someone to tell me ¬´ but they're not all like that, you just read bad ones ¬ª, not unlike men telling ¬´ not all men are trash, you just met bad ones ¬ª. I find that it is a good comparison. I just didn't want to get flamed because people went huffy and puffy about how not all fics were like the ones I described. So yeah ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

*** Oh yeah I read that one, very good but unfortunately unfinished. This is a really good fic but doesn't really play into the trope because they don't get Harry, they get MoD who has lived eons and doesn't look remotely human so he doesn't get the treatment a seventeen year old Harry would. Plus as MoD he is not tied to the new reality as he would have been had he been a simple wizard so that negates all of the problems really

Plus he's ugly, irreverent, cocky, arrogant and twisted in it.
