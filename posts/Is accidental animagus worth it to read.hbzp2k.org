It sounds like another canon rehash with the grangers having a prominent role. Seeing as i don't really like hermione. I only want to read it cos the pairing is harry/luna.

** First and second year are mostly canon-rehash, with some differences - for example, Pettigrew gets caught midway through Harry's first Hogwarts year because Cat!Harry smells that he's an Animagus, and Neville goes with Harry into the Chamber.

The fic diverges strongly starting from Year 3 - instead of Sirius Black (who's already been cleared by then), the plot revolves around Fenrir Greyback and other rogue werewolves instead. This is when the fic really picks up, in my opinion.

Also, Hermione in the fic is a much different person than she is in canon - she's much more likeable from the start, as a result of growing up with a brother who gets her to open up to other friends.

I highly recommend reading it, not just as a Harry/Luna fic, but as a really well-written fic in general.

  Harry is sent to the Dursleys, but due to a natural proclivity for cat animagus transformations, goes to live with the kneazles at Mrs. Figg's a few weeks before he is 2 years old. He spends years as a kneazle, before his association with Ginny Weasley h

** Yes. It is slightly too long, but it has some really great parts (the third year is in my opinion brilliant), and Hermione (given different upbringing, she effectively had a brother) is slightly different than in the canon.

**** First year and second year are canon rehash with minor changes but the story goes in a completery different direction than canon once Year 3 starts because Harry caught Pettigrew in first year and so Sirius got a trial and didn't have to escape Azkaban two years later and also because of extensive worldbuilding.
