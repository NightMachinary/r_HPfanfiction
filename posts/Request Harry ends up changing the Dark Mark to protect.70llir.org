Looking for stories where Harry ends up changing the Dark Mark to protect Severus Snape and whatever other Death Eater that wants/needs help.

I do NOT want Harry to be dark in the story, he is doing it to help them.

Maybe the new Mark (which maybe changes what design it is) has to be more powerful then the one Voldemort placed on the Death Eaters originally, so maybe they have to be more careful on what they say or are slaves/servants.

Or maybe not. Maybe it's just to have Harry help Severus Snape and the other Slytherins (if they want in the story). But Harry is NOT dark.

Any rating is fine am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash. Would rather it be completed but if it has a bunch of chapters it's fine.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5053153/1/Their-Phoenix][Their Phoenix]] comes to mind. Might not be exactly what you are after- most of the action takes place after LV is already defeated. linkffn(5053153)

*** Thanks will check it out. Doesn't have to be exactly what I mentioned, just a bit or whatever.

** Also note I suppose Harry being dark with this would be okay, as long as it's written well.

** The only one that comes to mind offhand is linkao3(93342), which takes place just after the war. AU after HBP, Snarry, very interesting meditation on the morality of "ownership" even as a gesture of good intent. Harry's not at all dark, but he starts out very angry with Snape, and they struggle over Snape's right to die rather than be protected by a mark of ownership.
