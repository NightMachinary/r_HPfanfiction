Like I said. A fic where maybe it's someone in city planning who realizes that there are no gas lines there or gangs realize none of them caused that bit of damage.\\
Just a little bunny I had and was wondering if anyone else had written it already.


** There's also that the Ministry blamed the destruction caused by giants on freak storms during Half-Blood Prince; by 1996, there were weather satellites that could disprove that in orbit.

And, I once read a fic (Memoriam, I think it was called? I can't find it with Google but it had a muggle whose brother was tortured and killed by Death Eaters; she later developed an allergy to magic which made Obliviating her impossible), where Obliviators tried to cover up killings from the Killing Curse by putting heroin in muggle victims, but the autopsies found abnormalities (though that angle was never fully addressed in the fic).

(Found it...why does it have to be spelt 'Memorium' with a U? Anyway, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/][here it is]])

Well, technically it really was terrorists. And considering how high-profile that attack would have been, I would be surprised if they didn't account for more details than normal in that specific cover-up or even colluded with the muggle ministry.

** Linkffn(8096183), Harry Potter and the Natural 20, had a side plot starting up where cops start to notice something fishy due to wizard's not understanding computers and forgetting to wipe them. The poor cops gets obliviated multiple times, but manage to continue their investigation all the time. I got terribly invested, especially since they'd just managed to infiltrate the Leaky Cauldron right when the writer took a break. Although he does have an active forum, it seems to be mostly populated by spammers.

** Also, imagine if a Muggle using Google Earth in the 2000s realized that certain places around the world, like in london and scotland, are pretty much blank spaces. Investigating these places could lead to Muggles discovering places like Diagon Alley and Hogwarts. After all, would Muggle Repelling charms work on a Drone?

*** I get the impression that magic is rather adept at spacial manipulation. Diagon Alley exists in another dimension. The likely way for Muggles to discover such a secret would be gravitational anomalies.

**** I agree, after all, even Harry couldn't see 12 Grimmauld Place, and he was a wizard - when he read the secret, it 'popped' out of no where. I suspect without a fidelous charm, Harry would be able to see it, but Muggles wouldn't. I think Muggles must see the Leaky Cauldron exactly the same way - it actually isn't there for them.

***** Grimmauld Place was protected by a Fidelius, which itself could store its location in a pocket dimension, and cast out an area wide compulsion to not notice the literal gaping hole in space and time. And, the human brain is great at filling in blanks.

The enchantments around the Leaky Cauldron appear to be a muggle repelling charm. Maybe Muggles can see the Leaky Cauldron, but they just brush it off as unimportant. In the books the muggles passing the LC are described as having their eyes roam from the book store to the record store smoothly, as if the pub was not there.

It was also revealed via Pottermore that the wizards had rebelled around the time that Charing Cross Road was created, and basically used Mass Obliviations and changed the design of the street to accommodate the pub. Architects were soundly confused as to why there was a blank space on the design, and why said space did not appear to the naked eye.

Notice the term "naked eye"? I believe that the LC and by extension Diagon Alley could be seen using infrared imaging and satelites of the area around it. Basically, instead of looking for a certain place, search for something that isn't there.

** Sort of along similar lines, I have always wanted a story about a muggle who stumbles upon some magic going on (or I thought about him just stumbling into The Leaky Cauldron) and it turns out he is immune to muggle-repelling charms, notice-me-nots, and the big kicker... memory charms!

The wizarding community would argue about what to do about him, maybe he works at a muggle newspaper or TV station. They argue over whether he's a squib or a muggleborn with suppressed powers, Dept of Mysteries wants to get their hands on him, some nasty purebloods want to get their hands on him to either shut him up or experiment on him, Harry and Co. (I think of this as a post-Hogwarts, pre-Epliogue canon fic) want to be more humane and earn his trust so he'll keep quiet. Then somehow shenanigans erupts and he helps in his small muggle ways.

** I read a fic a few years ago with the gas line problem. The story was, of course, that a gas line ruptured and caused an explosion. The Prime Minister (I think) called the Minister for Magic an idiot and told him that while the gas lines were planned, they were never installed so there couldn't have been a gas line-related explosion.
