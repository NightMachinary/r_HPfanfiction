Hi, so I really interested in read some fanfics, but not like love/romace ones. I would really like to read one that plays it harry potter mythology and adventures in a sartudary morning cartoon way. Is there any fanfic like that? can you point me where to find it? Thank you.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12965602/1/Might-and-Magic][Might and Magic]] The author openly states they are going for an early /Dragon Ball/ vibe. Which definitely shows when Harry and Tonks meet and it has the same sort of feel as early Goku & Bulma.
