Ok so, I'm trying to recreate Harry/Tristan's Mark from Jaded Eyes of a Prodigy by wickedlfairy17 on FF ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4001281/1/Jaded-Eyes-of-a-Prodigy]]) and I'd like/need some recommendations for runes I could use to create it. It doesn't matter if the runes are Celtic/Viking, Wiccan, African, etc.

Here's the chapter it's in: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4001281/8/]]

The description for it is about 3/4 of the way through the chapter.

Thanks for the help!

p.s. This is a really great fic if you like a dark/ dark lord, slightly OP Hary Potter fic. (It's a HP/LV fic though, so if you aren't into that, then you'd only be able to read maybe a little bit over half the story.)

  Harry started with the stem of the rose, it wasn't a simple drawing of a line, no, inside the stem were interlaced runes that would be the start of the process. They would be so small though, that one could not see them if one didn't know where to look. This stem was the core of it and a deep emerald green matching his eyes perfectly.

  His blood had been required for this particular potion and it would ensure every one of his marked would be connected to him on a subtle level. Next he began the rose bud after cleansing his brush and moving the green aside. This rose would be in full bloom and a deep crimson red it would also have hidden symbols within it.

  After that he began his first snake, hissing in parseltongue under his breath as he went, the first one was a deep black that seemed endless. It coiled around the stem and reared up just over the blooming rose with an open hissing mouth. The body was very intricate with every scale detailed holding a different Parseltongue symbol and made the snake seemingly alive. Next he cleansed his brush and added his white accents to the snake.

  It got pearly white eyes and wide spread wings that had every feather in detail only possible with magic. He repeated the process on the opposite side of the rose this time with a white snake with black eyes and wings.

** Why does it sound like an alternate version of the Greek God Hermes symbol thingy?

*** It sounds like it almost is but has a few changes. I'm just trying to figure out the runes I would use to imitate how it's described.

**** What about using some runes/claw markings from Skyrim, the dragon language that is usually scratched on the word walls. Or something like that.
