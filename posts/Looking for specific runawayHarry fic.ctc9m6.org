:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, I have no idea where I read it originally, but I can't remember how it ends and can't stop thinking about it, and it has been driving me insane! If anyone can point me in the right direction, it would be greatly appreciated. From what I remember, Harry runs away from the Dursleys before Hogwarts, but I might be remembering that incorrectly. He's on the street for a little while, but then meets two men, a gay muggle couple who run a strip club. Harry talks them into letting him stay with them, and he begins to build a life there. An older man who runs an herbal shop in town begins to teach him about herbs and meditation, and another character (my memory is pretty fuzzy on this whole fic...) teaches him self-defense. At some point they find out Harry is a wizard, and Harry is surprised that the two muggle men still accept him and care about him. Then the wizarding world, searching for Harry, finds him, and he escapes out of the house through an upstairs window, making a mad break for it. That's all I remember, and I'm not sure if I don't remember how it ended because it was unfinished or because I didn't get to the end for some reason. Not a ton to go on, but basically "Harry runs away and lives with a muggle gay couple who run a strip club," which is hopefully specific enough to find it. Thanks!


** Linkffn(Runaway wizard) is the fic you're looking for :)

  Harry finally gets tired of being mistreated by the Dursley's and his complaints ignored or dismissed by the faculty of Hogwarts so he runs away. He learns a lot on the streets and in the world he falls into.
