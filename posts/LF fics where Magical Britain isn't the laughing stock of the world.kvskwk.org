Lot's a fics have it where the British ministry is the most ineffectual, corrupt and racist/blood supremacist and is generally looked down on by the rest of the world.

Are there any fics where this isn't the case, either the Ministry is rewritten to be actually competent, or visiting the rest of the magical world reveals it to be even worse than Britain?


** i mean, isn't it kinda implied that they atleast have international recognition due to being able to host both the triwizard and quidditch world cup in a single year.

it could be interesting to see how bigoted views are viewed outside of europe since we know that one of the 3 major european schools distance themselves from Muggleborns.

*** International recognition and being allowed to host events is separate from being laughingstock of human rights and corruption, see Qatar and the world cup.

I could never pin down how Fantastic Beasts intended to portray MACUSA. On the one hand the appear to be more progressive when it comes to house elves, but equally they've banned Muggle/Wizard marriages, though it's not really clear if this is pure bigotry or some kind irrational fear left over from the witch trials leading to a really anal enforcement of the Statute of Secrecy.

** That's because it's modelled after our own incompetent government

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** I think most stories are just like that. I mean, from what I read, very few stories go into politics /at all,/ not to mention international politics, so it's kind of assumed that 'it's just what it is'
