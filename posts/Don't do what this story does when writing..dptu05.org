So i stumbled upon this story while looking for new fics to read, i saw the [Harry P, Luna L] tag and thought cool more Harry/Luna for me to read.

Then i started it, half of the first chapter is Authors Notes explaining the challenge said author is writing the story for, what stipulations they have accepted and which ones they don't accept and then an actual authors note talking about their wishes for the story before the chapter actually starts. The Authors note should have just been its own chapter, out of the 2137 words in chapter one 843 of them are part of the three seperate authors notes in the story when the author could have just made the authors notes its own chapter and combined chapters 1 and 2.

That's actually not allowed according to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/][FFN's official rules]]:

#+begin_quote
  The chapter system is not to be used as placeholder for non-story content such as author notes. You can add short author notes to the beginning or at the end of stories but never as individual chapters.
#+end_quote

In cases like this I think you should blame FFN's outdated ruleset and the site's lack of basic functionality that would enable author's to effectively communicate with their readers.

Ao3 doesn't have this problem of authors' notes swallowing chapters, because it lets authors post their own comments to reply directly to comments on the fic, has formatting to separate authors notes from the body of the chapter, and allows authors to post separate works purely for discussing or explaining their fic if they want to.

*** Yep this has been a rule since the First Purge in 2003. There were a LOT of fics that went down in the First Purge and never went back up. I was under the impression that they had a script that looked for keywords in the first/last chapters to determine if it was most likely only author notes, and then it would be flagged for review.

** This seems to be a thing, authors approaching stories as though they're internet recipes. Thanks, don't need twenty pages of your life story before we get to the meat of things. Pitter-patter already.

  How much stress does it take to snap a persons grasp on the world? For Harry James Potter it only took losing his parents, ten years of abuse at his relatives hands and four years of wishy washy treatment by the magical world. The latest fiasco is the straw to break his back so he decides to end it only to fail due to love of another. With her beside him, his word WILL be law HPxLL
