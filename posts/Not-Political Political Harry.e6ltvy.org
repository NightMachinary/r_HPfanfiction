Hey everyone.

I've gone through many phases of fanfiction reading: indie Harry, barely-canon-divergent, whatever. What I'd really love to see right now is a fic where Harry isn't political, but the people around him are. At least the adults. The kids at Hogwarts can sort of get it without really understanding or paying close attention - but no impromptu lessons from Heir Longbottom on the History Of House Potter and the Family Wizengamot Seat.

Bonus points for Dumbledore who's beginning to understand that he's made mistakes, and is trying to make amends for it by genuinely trying to support Harry, not manipulate him. Extra bonus points for no real emphasis on romance, although if there is romance I'm partial to Harry/Slytherin Girls (none of them in canon have personalities aside from Pansy so I'm not going to be specific) and HHr. Extra extra bonus points for no horcruxes.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

  AU of GoF, sequel to Other People's Choices. Harry begins his summer with horrific visions that come true much faster than he was expecting. He'll have to rely on his circle of friends, both his guardians, and all his allies to cope with the results.

*** I had the same thought, but it's really an excellent story, and the slash still hasn't even been more than lightly hinted at all the way through what's posted, which is 23 of 29 chapters. Without spoiling much, the slash is Harry/Draco, and the only apparent set up is that Harry and Draco are getting to be friends, among Harry's other friendships, and that someone made a joke about Draco being a little more affectionate than usual.

Seriously, if the slash is the only thing stopping you, I'd recommend the story anyway. It's that good. I just blitzed through the entire thing in a few hours.
