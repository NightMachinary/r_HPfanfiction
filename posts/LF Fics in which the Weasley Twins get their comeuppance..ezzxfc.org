It's quite sickening that in many fics, Ron, Molly and Ginny are thoroughly bashed whereas twins are revered as pranksters with no mean bone in their bodies. I mean, they actually burnt a hole in five year old Ron's tongue with an Acid Pop (what if it were the intestines) , transformed his teddy bear into a spider thus imprinting him with arachnophobia (when he was around five). It's quite sad to know that Ron's worst fear is spiders when he has already battled Lord Voldemort. Furthermore, Fred has killed his puffskein by bludgeoning it with a Beater's bat and their harrassment of Percy Weasley and the Slytherins by booing at first years who were sorted in Slytherin and not to mention, locking Montague in a vanishing cabinet where he could have starved to death . In the Muggle world, quite a few of these offenses can land one up in jail for a significantly long time, and hence, I would like to read a fic where they get their just desserts.


** Also they nearly made a too-young-to-know-better Ron make an Unbreakable Vow; luckily Arthur caught wind and made them stop. Not exactly a harmless prank.

** This kind of wants me to make a prompt where the Weasley family is a House Divided, with Percy, Fred and George all being sorted into Slytherin, and all being at least mildly anti-muggle or closer to a blood-supremacist.

Also a good opportunity to pair them with the younger Carrow Twins and a pureblood Penelope Clearwater.

(Just my ramblings)

** Not to mention they were trying out their untested magical consumables on students without any supervision, or safety measures. They aren't professionals, they've not even passed the required subjects in school and the only reason they didn't badly injure or kill someone was either luck or plot railroading.

This might be what you want at least in part. The Weasely twins are written as petty thuggish bastards with a childish vendetta against Harry and unfortunately for them they fuck with a Harry who's much more powerful and cunning than they assume. The fic itself is actually quite good overall and has an interesting premise. It's about an AU where Harry inherits the memories and magic of James Potter as well as Lily's protection, and explores indepth what that means. It changes pretty much everything and leads to a Harry I quite like. Also has a rather...unique take on the Sorting Hat and it stars as a major supporting character.

But OP, how else will Harry be able to keep in contact with the 'good' members of the family AND leave oppurtunities for bashing? ^{/s}

*** The token "Good Weasleys". I hate that trope. It honestly feels like a preemptive deflection of a "Weasley hate" argument, where the author is saying "I likr the twins, therefore it's not Weasley bashing".
