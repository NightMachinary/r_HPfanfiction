** Most authors tend to portray Sirius in such a manner because if you tried to portray him as in canon after he came back from azkaban, you'd get someone honestly more like Snape. Hanuted and bitter. And that isn't a very fun character to be portrayed in a good light.

I can't think of any fics yet, but I'll search for it. As I said, your best bet would be to search for Sirius in fics that are Angst/Drama, I guess.

*** I'll search for some too, thanks anyway. That's why I love Sirius-he's highly damaged and he and Snape are very similar characters yet very different. But lots of fanfics after Azkaban have him crack a joke every minute and whining to Remus. Seriously? (No pun intended).

** Well, I've written several stories about Sirius, but he is, I'm afraid, quite unpleasantly drunk for some of the time, though he does pull himself together in time to be useful. They are also OC romances. Maybe they meet part of your criteria.

  Working in the Ministry archives, Julia finds a document she really has no business seeing. When she discovers that the Muggle world is threatened by an ancient and terrifying evil, she seeks Albus Dumbledore's help. He sends her to Twelve Grimmauld Place where she has to persuade the enigmatic, troubled, and very bad-tempered Sirius Black to help save the world.

  The concept of the 'do-over' is used in, at the very least, hundreds of Harry Potter stories. Here's my own take, using a HP character that actually has a good reason for getting another chance to make things better.

** Well, it depends on what you consider IC for a character messed up by Azkaban, but he features prominently in my two longest stories, doesn't focus solely on Harry, isn't paired up with any of the witches you mention, fights in the war and enters politics, and is quite smart - even though he still has some weird sense of humour and is, after 12 years in Azkaban, not that healthy, and wanting to make up for the lost time.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** There is a bit of a trouble with your requirements, I think, since all the requested attributes will /inevitably/ make him at least a little bit OOC.

I liked Sirius characterization in the Wise One trilogy (first part: linkffn(The Wise One: Book One: Becoming by FarenMaddox)). This is an AU in which Sirius escapes earlier, takes Harry and then they leave Britain for a long time. The general focus of the trilogy is on Harry, but Sirius is a very important character and I think that in this series he meets most, if not all, of your criteria.

  When Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and 8-year-old Harry Potter disappears, the world is thrown into upheaval. What will Britain and Harry be without each other, and who will face the Dark? You only THINK you've read this before. I guarantee you haven't.
