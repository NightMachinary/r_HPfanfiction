I remember reading this Harry Potter time- travel fic and I've been looking for it, but I can't for the life of me remember what it's called; but I do remember that it had an absolutely hilarious repetition of Harry's 5th year where he took the mantle of Lord Potter and completely and utterly destroyed Fudge and Umbridge during his Wizengamot trial (I think he even caused Fudge to inadvertently call his Undersecretary Umbitch). Any ideas?


** Sounds like every shitty ind!Harry fic that features time travel.

*** Thanks for that, but if it helps, I think Harry also brought Amelia Bones to where the Dementors Umbridge sent were to attack him.
