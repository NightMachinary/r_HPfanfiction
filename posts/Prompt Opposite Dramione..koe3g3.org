A typical Dramione plot, Draco is supposed to seduce Hermione to gather intel for the Dark Lord, they start dating. Hermione finds this suspicious, plays along, then gets tasked with seducing him to turn him away from the dark.

They date and get closer and more intimate. From the perspective of any third party, it'd be indistinguishable from a typical Dramione romance.

But it's written from the perspective of Draco and Hermione and reveals that they both actually hate each other, have pretty decent acting skills to pretend otherwise and believe that their seduction is working and the other one is actually in love. Both are disgusted by what they're doing, but it's for the cause and it may turn the tide of the war...

** Wait like... post epilouge they're in a family with four kids. Draco forgets to start the dishwasher for the 30th time this week and they start fighting only for Hermione to scream that it was all a ruse. That she never loved him as was just with him for information. And he responds with the same?

**** Not exactly what you're describing, but this reminded me of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12935992/1/][The Intricacies of Marriage by kirsant]]. It's a crack-y humour fic that has Hermione and Draco married by Ministry law. They both try and murder one another on the daily to get out of the marriage. (It does have a romantic ending, though.)

*** I'd assume the ruse would no longer be necessary once the war is over. Or even if priorities shift and Voldemort decides to reassign Draco, one of his few operatives inside Hogwarts, to another mission more important to the war.

The Secret War

by njcov

Lucius tasks Draco with a special mission: "You will seduce the Granger girl. I don't care how you do it, I don't care how long it takes. Tell her you renounce your family, tell her you want no part in the Dark Lord's plan...tell her you need her help. You will make her love you Draco. You will win her trust, and then she will lead us to Potter.”

At the same time, Hermione hatches a plan to get close to Draco and learn of Voldemort's plans to help the Order.

Check it out on A03 and FFN:
