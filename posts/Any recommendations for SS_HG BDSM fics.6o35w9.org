** This is the eighth SS/HG thread you've made in the past fifteen days. You might want to space them out a bit, or perhaps do some hunting for what exactly you would like yourself. Ao3 has a nifty tagging system and you can sort the tag/relationship you want to read by how many have bookmarked it, left a kudos or a comment, etc. I hope this helps.

In any case, I tentatively recommend [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7401394/chapters/16812232][Breathe]] despite its short length and incomplete nature. It's been a while since I've read it, admittedly, but the few words it had really resonated with me. I don't want to spoil it, so I'll let you decide if it'll be of interest. Happy reading!

*** Thanks for the recommendation, and the reason I've made so many threads is so I can compile a bunch of stories to read. Now that I've got a bunch it will take me a while to read the ones I like.

  Now Complete! Severus Snape is not a kind man, but Hermione Granger is past caring. She wants his approval and will do anything to get it. How far will she go? Even she has no concept of the depths to which she will fall in her quest.

** Dude, most fanfic websites have a sorting system that you can use. Ffn has the sorting system where you can customize the pairing, length, sort by reviews, favs, and updates. Similary AO3 has a pretty good sorting system as well.

Making 8 threads in the span of 15 days is not going to help you much.
