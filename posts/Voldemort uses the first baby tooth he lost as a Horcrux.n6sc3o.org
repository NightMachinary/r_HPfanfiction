That's it. I think he would keep because it was a reminder that he is normal, and not a monster... Or to remind himself that that was the moment he really started to grow up (for independence and all that)

Edit: just got an idea; he lost his first baby tooth in the first fight he won. Therefore, it has a great emotional importance


** People like to suggest that Voldie should have made pebble horcruxes, for easier concealment. There's a standard reply that the horcrux ritual requires the object to be meaningful to the caster. But a baby tooth is a spectacularly pebble-like meaningful object.

**** Wasnt the point about them was that something just highly destructive wasn't enough, it had to be something so magically destructive that it's capable of destroying a soul. I don't know if extreme deep sea water pressure is enough to destroy a horcrux.

***** It's my story, so yes, these are my rules, but yes I believe that the only absolute is The Lord God, everything else is just really really really hard to destroy (but I think being in the centre of the nuclear blast could do it or pressure of one ton per square centimetre).

****** A mere ton per square centimetre won't destroy a pebble, if the pressure is coming from all directions. A ton of pressure from every direction won't destroy a book either. It might compress it a bit, but that's all.

** "Go on Ginny, put me in your mouth.." the tooth fairy plead.

"That's just nasty! And potentially illegal...why does the tooth fairy sound like an sixteen year old boy?"

"Maybe fairy is more literal than you thought..?" The voice posited hesitantly.

"Well if you are Voldemort that explains a lot. It's also a bit prejudiced really, you should be more open minded. Dumbledore is a big poof after all."

"See you should put me in your mouth." The disembodied voice said, self-satisfied.

"I prefer cock thank you very much!" Ginny exclaimed. The basilisk fell limp and slid, now murky eyed and flaccid, into the waters. A rooster crowing mournfully.

"And no more talk about the bone of my father, that's just awful!" She said scolding.

"It's the bone of My father!" The tooth fairy plead, dejected.

"You're really messed up you know.."

*** I don't think that at 7 yo, he would already think himself as a god. People kept telling him he was a demon, so maybe that tooth just helped him thinking he wasn't a demon but something else, like an actual human, or more, in his case.
