I would love some recommendations of fics where Harry/students in general are shown buying school supplies, like notebooks or journals for different subjects. Fics that show a somewhat realistic approach to shopping for school supplies for subjects that students will take for 5-7 years. I've read some, and I always love them! I also love fics that show trunk shopping, and love seeing different authors' unique approaches to what trunks can be like.

EDIT: I also remember reading one fic where some older students, possibly Gryffindors, helped give him suggestions for studying and classes. I specifically remember they suggested putting different potions ingredients on an index card, and keeping them altogether in a box. If anyone knows that specific fic, I'd love to re-read that and see if it was as good as I remember.


** The problem with such extensive actual school shopping detailed in fanfiction is that they are almost always Indy!Harry fanfictions and include overly helpful goblins, super powered wands, etc. In fact, OP trunks have become a trope in fanfiction as well, as has the rest of school shopping.

Now, I'm not saying that it is never good, in fact I wholly agree with your sentiment. It is just that most of the fics that have what you are looking for ..... /are lacking./ That being said, here are some fanfics with what you are looking for:

linkffn(4240771) Partially Kissed Hero, by Perfect Lionheart

linkffn(2772010) The Power, by DarthBill

There are others, but as of right now I have to go eat dinner (lmao).

*** That's true, they are often lacking. I don't mind an independent Harry fic, if it's well-written. I don't even necessarily mind the “typical” Indy!fics, if they can give something new and different. I, like most, don't want to read the same basic story line. I will definitely check those out.

**** Remember Moody's trunk? Seven compartments.

linkffn(7144149) This fic has trunks that are like 10-20 square kilometers wide on the inside and has farms, woods, house elf villages, and houses on the inside.

Edit: Came out in 2011-2013. Years before Fantastic Beasts.

** I think my favourite shopping sequence in an HP fic has to be from linkffn(Harry Potter and the Proof of Concept). It's not perfect, but it takes the usual cliches of the very specific subgenre and downplays them in a more believable way. For instance, Harry doesn't buy some incredible book that explains everything there is to know about potions but for some reason isn't on the booklist, he just buys some extra ingredients so that he can practice brewing outside of class.

  The Dursleys resolved to have as little involvement, positive or negative, in Harry's life as possible, and when he finally receives his Hogwarts letter, Harry isn't what people were expecting: intelligent, calculating, and proud, Harry is set to take the wizarding world by storm, starting by building a group of worthwhile friends.
