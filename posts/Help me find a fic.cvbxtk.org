Alright so I read this fic maybe two years ago.

Harry was a younger sibling, he had two older brothers. It started in 4th year and it was a Harry/Ginny ship. James and Lily were dead and i think Siruis and Remus raised them.

I remember in the sequel set in 5th year they went to a carnival on Siruis motorbike.

Oh and I remember a funny thing about it, the AN said Harry and Ginny would take a long time to be together but they get together in the first book 10 or so chapters in.

Please could you help me!
