** [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/2azsida7c4dj9xi/thedeathofnarcissablack.pdf?dl=0][The Death of Narcissa Black]] by massicot, only found out about it because someone [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2h6xjq/i_have_a_copy_of_the_death_of_narcissa_black_by/][posted]] the download link awhile back. You won't find it on most, if any, traditional fanfiction sites because half the story is art. Really good story about the circumstances leading to Narcissa marrying Lucius.

** A [[http://hpedit.tumblr.com/post/92006589335/beautiful-blog-i-was-just-wondering-if-you-knew][masterpost]] of HP headcanon blogs on tumblr; I love livesandliesofwizards. We keep it up to date, so I'll also take suggestions for the list :) I added some from the first time I posted about these. Edit: woops, had the wrong link. [[http://wizardhistory.tumblr.com/post/104678150659/happy-early-holidays-from-wizard-history-inspired][This]] one I had linked earlier has the same links, but a bit more commentary and isn't maintained by me.

Love Death of Narcissa Black. I've also rec'd [[http://gyzym.livejournal.com/109306.html][Living on Wildfires]] (plus [[http://gyzym.livejournal.com/109753.html][part 2]]) a few times before here; it's an AU where Ariana doesn't die, and Dumbledore sticks with Grindelwald.

[[http://shoebox.lomara.org/2012/03/here-now-take-and-enjoy-an-epub-and-mobi-version-of-shoebox/][Shoebox Project]] is a [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Shoebox_Project][very well known Marauders epic]], but it's actually kind of hard to find unless you know about it and it's something to mention for readers who are new to HP fic.

** [[http://www.livejournal.com/tools/memories.bml?user=crack_broom][Crack-boom]] on livejournal has many of the best lj stories in their memories sections, though some are on purged journals. It is especially good since journals can't be found through google. Also, most stories are pretty shippy.
