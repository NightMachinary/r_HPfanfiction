I'm not into slash but I'd like to read a unique story that plays with the expectations of things. Like a Malfoy in Gryffindor or a Potter in Slytherin. Thanks for your help ahead of time!


** I'm also looking for this! If you're into M rated stuff, Bones365 has a fic on fanfic.net that's a rose/scorpius pairing. I think Scorpius is a Gryffindor in that one.

** There is one particular fic which I particularly enjoyed. Despite such questionable characteristics some (myself included) might disagree with (i.e. Harry being on friendly terms with Dudley, Scorpius being as big a jerk as his father, Albus and family knowing about the horcruxes), it still has many elements which put it on par with J.K.'s style with an over arching mystery regarding the behavior of the ghosts and the mysterious Slytherin student Jezabel. Also the close relationship between Albus and Rose is also enjoyable, with their bantering and confidence with each other.

  NOVELLA. Albus Potter has dealt with bullying from bunkmates and his brother, and little else. Now he and Rose are entering year five, and he finds himself wishing for more excitement and fewer annoyances... but only the first will come true. :COMPLETE:
