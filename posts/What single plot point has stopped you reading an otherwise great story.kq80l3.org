This story has been written a few times and the idea adapted a number of times Harry Potter and the New Life by SilverAegis, Shadow Mage Harry ends up in another reality with his family alive and him taking the place of his alternate. The weird and constant incest subtext keeps coming up and ruining the enjoyment.


** When I was reading /Antithesis,/ I was in a pretty bad place in my own life. The whole thing with Harry leaving Ginny in the Chamber hit me hard, so I had to drop the fic. I realize how critical what happened likely was for the subsequent plot, but I had to nope out for my own sake.

** I really, really liked Honour Thy Blood. It has nearly everything I want in a strong Harry fic but the romance is so atrociously done that I had to drop it. I remember dropping it at a chapter where nearly all the couples have their version of a scene where you have the cliché domineering woman sweetly threatening her partner, who gets cowed and becomes henpecked. That sort of dynamic does no favours to any gender and left a bad enough taste in my mouth that I instantly stopped reading.

** Well, there are some pairings I can't stand. For het stuff: I'm quite fond of Harry/Hermione, can (barely) tolerate Harry/Ginny, and /adore/ Harry/Luna. And I hate all the others. For slash, I despise Harry/Snape and Voldemort/Harry (unless it's time travel to back when it was age-appropriate), and quite honestly, I'm just sick of Draco/Harry at this point (it's almost /never/ done well).

In terms of specific plot points: I hate the glorification of the pure blood aristocracy, though there have been a few rare /tasteful/ interpretations of it I've come across.

Usually if I see the words “Dumbles” or some iteration of “Voldyshorts” or “Snake-face”, I just close it automatically--- I know from that that it'll just be really stupid bashing and overpowered Harry to the point where it's just uncomfortable to read something so juvenile. Same with “Umbitch”, even though she deserves it.

Also hate when they have 11 year olds acting like fucking 50 year olds. If it's time travel and it's done /right/, fine, but that's rarely the case.

When there's a remake of “Dumbles”, & Ron and Hermione and Molly & Ginny Weasley as cartoon villains who've been out to get him since before the first year.

Mpreg fics never seem to go well.

Also fuck ever fic that has Harry randomly becoming Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin-Merlin and becoming so OOC it's cringey.

And somehow, guns are superiour to magic, and that becomes annoying to me. A regular soldier wielding some kind of assault rifle doesn't stand a chance. A disarming spell, or a vanishing spell, and that's it. Or a Bombarda.

Unless of course, the soldier's equipment has been enchanted. Then it becomes a different conversation.

Now in the battle of dom, aware wizards and high tier aurors and death eaters fight so fast they are capable of hqving their wands move as blurs.

Harry would of been more effective in canon due to his inexperience + struggles with nv casting. A gun could easily allow him to catch ignlrant opponents unaware.

In terms of international relations, the Harry Potter wizarding world is not exactly that well developed, and it's something that I find is up to authors to expand upon if required. I could certainly see a situation where the UK wizards are in opposition to the continental ones or isolated, and where it's more connected to the english speaking nations - eg, where those might have been more connected to the original English wizarding community (with magic allowing for more communication/transport than the non-magical ones) such that in modern times they're still more intertwined. Or where Grindelwald's conflict leads to the UK wizards being more isolationists towards the continent, etc. As long as it's in a consistent and believable manner, that's what's important IMO

Especially when they are in the early years at hogwarts. Likewise authors say that Hermon or Ron were faking their friendship for money, they can't act that well they're 12.

A/B/O also freaks me out, and ones where they over Americanise things. It puts me (an English person) off when Harry or Hermon use 'muggle slang' that is American.

Weasley, Hermione, or Dumbledore bashing are also common blocks for me. In a similar vein, I usually don't like suddenly-OP-Harry fics (like if he genuinely works for it I don't have as much issue) or fics where goblins are catch-all solutions to everything.

I'm not sure if I've ever dropped a fic due to it being Harry x Draco, but I'm not a big fan of the ship so I tend to not even start any fics tagged with it.

**** Harry follows Sirius through the Veil and they end up in an alternate dimension where their counterparts are dead. They decide to spend their time organising heists on Death Eaters and getting laid. Obviously I haven't finished the story so I can't summarise much beyond that.

A [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bfx8ar/fic_review_a_black_comedy_by_nonjon_the_au_in/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share][review]] was kindly shared with me earlier. It addresses the particular brand of humour as well as some problematic aspects, so I suggest you check it out to see if it's something you can appreciate. In any case it's not to be taken seriously (it is, after all, a comedy).

Having read some discourse on it, I just might as well take it up again, but only to read it as a satire ㅡ I wouldn't be able to stomach it otherwise lol.

**** To expand a bit on the other guy, since he said he hasn't finished reading it, there's a Voldemort plot thread that gets surprisingly serious at points and a legitimate twist at the end regarding the identity of a mystery person who's been interfering with Voldemort's plans. (The characters call him "that fucker" for lack of a better descriptor, in case there was any doubt this is still ultimately a comedy.)

But he's also right in that the humor is the sticking point. Some of it's already a bit skeevy to start with (the Potter house elf sings antebellum era slave songs while working), some of it hasn't aged gracefully after a decade or so of growing social awareness, and some is simply fratbro hijinks that won't appeal to everyone, but it's definitely a YMMV sort of situation.

** The closest thing I can think of is a plot point that made me check out of story, but continue listlessly reading it out of a combination of the sunken cost fallacy and a misplaced sense of obligation, since I /very/ rarely drop fics, no matter how little I enjoy them. Most are from Prince of Slytherin, but more recently, I lost most of my interest in Ghost of Privet Drive when Mal started possessing the Dursleys and progressively more as the fic went from there (I signed on for "Ghost Dad trying to give Harry a halfway decent childhood with very limited resources," and decidedly /not/ for "omnipotent and immortal self-insert hangs out with a cadre of immortal scientists who are kind of just an accepted thing in this version of the story, which is really fucking puzzling when you recall that Voldemort's primary motivation is a fear of death and consequential desire for immortality, while solving most of the series himself; also Dumbledore is incompetent and malicious"). What little interest I had remaining was permanently destroyed by /everything/ involving Bellatrix, but that's its own can of worms.

** Generally I drop fics when OCs and a complete side plot overtake the story.

The reason why I like fanfiction is because I want to read alternate versions of how the Wizarding World deals with Voldemort or the aftermath, or other situations of Wizarding society. I like to see the characters I love in new and interesting situations, and read about how they tackle the challenges of the story. When a fic becomes entirely OC-driven, it feels more like an original fiction than a HP fanfiction. Especially if they don't care about Voldemort at all. A fic that goes into a completely different world, for example elves, creatures, vampires etc. are no longer HP for me.

For example, I really enjoyed the starting of By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept, which is basically Petunia becoming a witch and a good mother. I loved the POV, the struggle with insanity, and the introduction to the main cast. Petunia's first meetings with Dumbledore, in particular, made a lot of sense. But gradually the story was overtaken by OCs, and a team of Petunia + OCs started world-hunting for horcruxes. It went too far away from Harry, from Hogwarts, and from the Wizarding World in itself.

All views expressed are my own. Not trying to pick a fight here. Sorry if anyone is offended.

** A Harry/Hermione romance out of nowhere. I remember reading a fic where Harry declines to attend Hogwarts and decides to stay in the muggle world. He wants nothing to do with magic whatsoever, or people of the wizarding world.

At this point it's great, but then Harry randomly starts dating Hermione because she is the daughter of his dentist, despite her being a witch.

I find this sort of fic sometime and I hate it, where it has an amazing plot and it's all great and then Hermione gets shoehorned in as Harry's love interest despite there being no reason for it to be her whatsoever.

Or in adventures - OP MC stomps all the opposition. I don't mind, I wanted to read some OP fic to simply relax. However, the author decides after dozens of chapters that the story is too stale, and the hero needs to suffer. Hey, I wanted stale, I was happy with stale!\\
This sudden change of mood is something I really didn't need. After reading the ff for hours, getting used to the atmosphere, becoming relaxed, when I'm met with this cold shower, I immediately drop such a story.

** There's a fic called A Second Chance where Sirius is freed from Azkaban legitimately after 4 years or so and puts his life back together, adopts Harry, reunites with Remus, etc. There are two particular aspects of this fic that caught me off guard.

First, Sirius has sex, as do a bunch of other characters. /Lots/ of sex. The death eaters are likewise fond of threatening sexual violence. And the fic is not shy about describing any it. Now, I'm no stranger to smut, but there was nothing in the summary to suggest the level of detail therein.

Second, at the climax of Harry's fifth year, /Sirius still fell through the damn veil./

Full disclosure, I stan for Sirius, so I'm not exactly unbiased here. But there's stations of the canon, and there's /stations of the canon,/ and Sirius dying at the same time in the same place and in the same manner as canon despite a full decade of divergence was enough to make me give up on the fic completely.

Replace evil!Dumbledore with mpreg and you'd have the complete set, and while I don't quite dislike evil!Dumbledore as much as the other things there, I don't like that trope either.
