I've never before wondered about this, but memory extracting seems to bring a lot of questions with it.

For example, what if you do not consciously remember anything about that particular occasion or encounter you are trying to extract? Can your brain still dig that memory out from deep within itself?

Say that one made a conversation at Hogwarts with a classmate that has unforeseen bearing on events of the future. Sixty years passed and a lot of things have happened between. Now realistically speaking a person could remember at most the fact that they spoke to someone at some time about a certain subject. They may not even remember the name of the person to whom they spoke, let alone the exact conversations. Then could extracting a memory awaken all of it that lies dormant in one's unconsciousness?

If that is the case, then it brings the question: does it mean that wizards and witches may have a cure for forgetfulness? Supposing one memorized and then forgot something, would it be too hard to perform a process similar to that of extracting the memory, only that this process ends at awakening the memory from unconsciousness? It might be a complicated bit of mind magic, but it would be immensely useful to never forget anything.

Also, memory extraction itself seems to be a perfect way to preserve memories: supposing you got an important message that you don't want to forget or misremember, you can just extract that bit of memory and look it over in the pensieve right before you need to pass the message on to others.

What are your thoughts on this topic? On a side note, I would appreciate any recommendations of fics in which the authors did interesting things with the memory extracting process, be it how it works, how to train for it, or how to creatively use it.
