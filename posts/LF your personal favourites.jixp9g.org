Hello, I have a request that I think is at least unusual. I'm looking for new fics and want to discover some that I don't know and thought I'd ask you which ones are your personal Must Read Story. Maybe it helps others who are looking for something. My personal favorites at the moment are "Ashes of Chaos", "limpieza de sangre" and "sepertine Advice".


** My reply is always the same. The Sum of Their Parts by holdmybeer. Linkffn(11858167)

It's complete with a confident Harry and no focus on romance. Really brilliant fic.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  Voldemort isn't a man. Ginny Weasley died in the Chamber. Twin divergences, though insignificant compared to the infinite majesty of the universe, spell a destiny irrevocably altered.

  (AU) In 1979, Regulus Black vanished with horcrux in hand, obscuring himself and destroying the locket. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again in '95, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the ashes.

#+begin_quote
  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Updates once every two weeks. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  “Your robes are...red,” Hermione finally said, strangely accusing. “Burgundy!” Severus protested. Red was tacky. Burgundy, however, had class.“And what did you do to your hair?” she asked in horrified fascination.Snape's hand rose to his scalp. “Nothing! What is wrong with you? I just washed it and blow-dried it like every morning...”“Ah, I see.” She nodded and stepped back. “Alternate dimension. It must be.”

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.

  “Harry Potter,” comes the soft, sibilant hiss of a voice he has heard in his dreams, in his nightmares, in his waking hours for years.  Slowly, carefully, Harry twists over and pushes up onto his hands and knees.  He stays there, short breath fogging in front of his face, and his pursuer lets him.  Harry has no doubt of that; he's being allowed this respite. This small moment to catch his bearings, heart pounding in his ears, blood singing. “It seems I have finally caught you.”

** Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6870892?view_adult=true]]) Roy Mustang from FMA gets sent to the world of Harry Potter. Mostly set in 5th year. Hasn't been updated in a while, but I'm pretty sure its because the author is busy.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23702959]]) Half crack where Harry is sent to the universe of a F!Harry, adopts her, and causes chaos (not on purpose though). Very fun and pretty lighthearted, but there is a mention of pedophilia at some point.
