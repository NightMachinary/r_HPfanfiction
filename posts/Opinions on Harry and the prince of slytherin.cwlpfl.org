I was looking at "The golden of Harry potter Fanfiction" thread and saw it pretty high up on this fic pretty high on the list. Personally I don't really like the fic and was wondering if anyone else thought the same., but this is open to all your opinions: the good, the bad etc.

No bash hate etc

Hope this doesn't breake rule 9 :(


** This has been reported for a Rule 9 violation but it does not break Rule 9.

OP has stated they do not like a fic and is asking for ALL opinions. It is tagged as a discussion thread. This is acceptable, as not everyone will like a story and OP wants to talk about it.

Rule 9 applies to *Request Threads* only.

** It's one of my favourites, purely for how the author has managed to take every bad trope from fanfiction he could shove into it, and done them in a way that actually works.

** I think it's fucking awful. The politics are just mindnumbing and beyond OTT for kids, the entire thing is just ridiculous.

** It's okay, but I have no idea how the overall story arc is supposed to progress. It's year 3 and they've already started the Horcrux hunt.

*** I think the Horcux hunt is going to take a while, plus we still have the more interesting prophecy about a Potter in Slytherin which I think will take more importance in later years.

** I reached a point where I decided to stop reading and wait for it to be completed. If I recall I liked the quality of the writing and world-building, but could not stomach Peter getting away with everything under the sun (which of course is intended, but I may wait until I can skip to the comeuppance).

** I read it... Once... Months ago. I recall being very impressed with the world building, but dreadfully bored with the pacing and how some concepts are just hammered into your skull endlessly. I will say Lockhart was very creative and the Mind Arts are very cool, if *extremely* video-gamey.

** I don't like it.

It reads well enough, but honestly, anything WBWL just seems stupid to me.
