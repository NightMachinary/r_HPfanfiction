There has to be more to these two than just strong man lives. Any fanfiction centered on these two that digs into their lives being a bit more than henchmen that will eat anything they see?


** I saw a meme that compared them to Hitchcock and Scully from Brooklyn Nine-Nine and I would def read something along those lines

Crack time travel re-do. Stargate Crossover (no knowledge of Stargate needed) Crabbe, Goyle, AND Dudley get really good development. Greg has dyslexia, and while the both of them aren't the sharpest tools in the shed, they are pretty good people when you strip Malfoy from them. Dudley and those two form a muscle trio of sorts.

** I can tell you that in The Boy Who Died by Silirt, they act more like actual people than backdrops. Malfoy looks down on them because he's a shit, and they're definitely not the brightest, but he eventually realizes they were his only real friends the entire time.
