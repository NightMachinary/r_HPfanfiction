** Well, I don't think any fem!Harry romance recommendation would be complete without !linkffn(Yule Ball Panic) It's a fem!Harry/Hermione fic that focuses heavily on the female supporting cast.

!linkao3(The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles)

This one is fem!Harry/Voldemort. I'm sure many people will find it off-putting just for the pairing, but it's amazingly done, and portrays Voldemort in a more human light without justifying or excusing any of his past actions.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.
