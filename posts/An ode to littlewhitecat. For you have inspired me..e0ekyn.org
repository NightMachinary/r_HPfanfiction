I know the chances of you seeing this are slim but i simply must tell you that you have i inspired me with you Inquisitor Carrow series. Though i must say i found but one flaw in the entirety of what you have written so far.

It has a distinct lack of Orks

Such injustices cannot be allowed to continue. Especially if the lovers of the 40k universe such as ourselves are to continue to write slightly above average crossover fanfiction. As such i have set about the task of overcorrecting for lack of Orks and i hope to one day be as renowned as you in this little niche of the community.

Even though i have just began this task and all i have is 1200 words and a title one day i will post my answer to your inquisitor Carrow series with my own series.

'Arry Krumpa An' dat git 'oo got Krumpt!


** Thought of tagging littlewhitecat? I reeeeally hope his or hers reddit username is littlewhitecat
