:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So there was this fic i read a few years back and it was a dimension travel fic. Basically Harry is summoned from canon world to an alternate universe if which he died as a baby and he has to defeat Voldemort. Ginny jumps into the portal as well.

I remember that it started with Tonks sneaking into Hogwarts to get the ancient book. And that crouch was in charge of the Order since Dumbledore was dead. He was also keeping everyone captive there because he had essentially gone crazy.

Harry helps them create a different order outside of the OotP and it was something to do with rising from the ashes or something like that.

I've looked on Ao3, [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], and even [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com][harrypotterfanfiction.com]] and i cannot find it! If anyone knows about this fic, i'd appreciate the help!
