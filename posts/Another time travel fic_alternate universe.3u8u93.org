Hi everyone,

I've been reading a few alternate universe/time travel fics and I like them so I want to read a few more but I can't really find one that fits my criteria. I would like to have a complete, fairly long fic (150k+ words) with no Dumbledore/Ron bashing because that's just not my thing. Romance is welcome but I don't mind it being without it.

I already read:

Nightmares of Future Past

0800-Rent-A-Hero

Backwards with Purpose

The Hogwarts Strike Team

Yule Time

Does someone have a good other recommendations?

** As far as I'm concerned, Delenda Est linkffn(Delenda Est), is /the definitive/ time travel fic. Very well written, and paints a striking picture in your mind. Ships Harry/Bellatrix, but not in a smutty manner. Expands well on how noble family politics work, and Voldemort is actually scary. There is no character bashing.

The author previously wrote 'Earl of the North', which is incredibly cringy and awful. But for this one, he/she teamed up with someone else, and crafted a needle in a haystack of bad HP fanfiction.

** *Welcome to Hogwarts 1949* linkffn(2550563) is one of my favourite fics. It hasn't been updated in a long while, but the author is currently writing another story and said they'd come back to this one at some point.

Then there's *Back Again, Harry?* linkffn(3693052) which is probably abandoned, but I remember it very fondly.

*C'est La Vie* ist also a great read, and also abandoned. linkffn(8730465)

*A Stranger in an Unholy Land*. Complete, I think. linkffn(1962685)

*Only Enemies*. If you're in the mood for Harry/Bellatrix. linkffn(2896398)

And another favourite of mine: *Circular Reasoning* linkffn(2680093) It's really long and still ongoing.

**** Oh the summary looks nice. I don't mind it when someones is a bit darker and therefore gets more critique for his or her actions. It's more that some writers just like to shit about Dumbledore and Ron so yeah, I don't like that.

** This tends to be my favorite genre so I've got some good recs here. Not all of them meet your desired length. Also a couple were mentioned in this thread already but I'm gonna rec them again anyway.

linkffn(Travel Secrets First) and sequels. This one has Dumbledore bashing, but it did does so it a way that doesn't irritate me like most bash fics. It is an AU like Dumbledore instead of the author trying to convince us canon!Dumbledore was a bad person. The story is about a 20-something Harry going back in time after he learns a nasty truth. It focuses on Hogwarts life and Slytherin House.

linkffn(Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen) Voldemort learns the prophesy and decides trying to kill Harry isn't a good idea. So he sends him to an alt-dimension. However the connection between them still exists. James and Lily live in the AU and it features a really good OC.

linkffn(C'est La Vie) This is one of my all time favorite stories. Harry won the war but it left him a rather broken person, hes a hermit who drinks too much so Fate offers him a chance at a life where he isn't the BWL and doesn't have that responsibility. 4th year fic, Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived and did all the canon Harry stuff. James and Lily live, and the AU Harry Potter is a major git. Its well written, the characterization is phenomenal but it isn't much of an adventure fic if that is your desire.

linkffn(The Lesser Sadness) When Harry dies in the forest he's offered a 3rd option to death and returning to the forest. Harry trades a piece of his soul to return to the 3rd task, however he can't go around with an incomplete soul, so they splice in a couple other's pieces.

linkffn(A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story) Harry gets catapulted through time into an alternate dimension. So he get Sirius out of prison and poses as his son.

linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn518) Long and slow moving story, but well written. Harry interrupts a ritual of Voldemorts and ends up in an alternate dimension where Iris Potter is the girl-who-lived. 4th year fic James and Lily live. Mild Dumbledore bashing in context that he didn't do enough Harry's first time around.

linkffn(The Wizard Who Meddled With Time) Harry learns to control time and goes back to his 4th year to do things properly.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)
