Another request recently made me think about this, but does anyone know a fanfic where Harry is really good at one subject. So he just has a knack for potions/charm etc. Etc.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

*** Just asking, how much realistic rocket science is there going to be in that fic? Magic should at least make a torch drive type of spaceship possible (constant 1g acceleration), which makes a lot of rocketry obsolete, although I'm wondering if spacetime manipulation demonstrated by bigger-on-the-inside things could enable Alcubierre style FTL.

**** "Just asking, how much realistic rocket science is there going to be in that fic?"

All rockets featured in the fic will be based off of contemporary or near future designs based off of existing technology.

I could include a fission "torch drive" rocket, but I would have no explanation as to how Harry knew how to design a fission reactor which can create a stable reaction that produces more energy than it consumes, as currently no such designs exist, although the aforementioned unstable fission reactors do exist in labs in Germany and elsewhere in the world. I would not be able to explain how Harry knows a spell that can cause nuclear-fission, either, although maybe a studious villain can discover a lost spell invented by Merlin that can do such a thing.

These rockets would be fueled by deuterium and other hydrogen ions, and could reach up to 12% light speed.

I would consider introducing a time-travelling villain, but if they were a time-traveller they wouldn't have any need for fast rockets, so I think if I do include such machines in my fic, they'll be invented by a genius.

Nano-craft powered by lasers is another interesting concept which would only use contemporary technology. Such space craft could be accelerated to 20% the speed of light and can be constructed and powered with extant technology, however, being only a few atoms thick, would be incapable of aiding in manned space flights.

([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4z6RZXv5p8]])

As for warp-drives, I'm not knowledgeable enough to come close to understanding any form of complex physics, but I think if I do ever include such things, I should save the most exiting concepts for last.

***** I started reading now but I can't really continue because there's so much that I feel doesn't really make sense or isn't explained.

Harry just started the rocket club at Hogwarts, immediately pulls out a schematic for a shuttle, and they fly to space and deploy a satellite.

Why?

Why do they need a satellite?

Where did they get the detailed schematic of the shuttle?

How can a single seventh year and three firsties create a massive shuttle and launch site from scratch in what feels like no time at all?

How the hell does it work on the first try? They just strapped themselves to a huge tower of hastily transfigured explosives, how did they not get blown up?

Why would they even need a shuttle with chemical propulsion if Harry just explained that magic makes infinite energy possible and therefore chemical engines unnecessary?

Instead of actually explaining how and why and exploring the basics of rocket science, they just magically copy what muggles would do without taking into account how magic rewrites the fundamental principles. All of rocket science is based on the rocket equation, and magic changes the equation to the point that the entire field needs to be re-developed from scratch.

If I was writing a rocket science Harry fic, which I'm planning to do, I wouldn't start with a full shuttle launch.

Instead, I'd start with a small transfigured test stand and a prototype rocket engine running on magic, either on a potion that works like rocket fuel but much better, or perhaps water heated with a magic fire to produce superheated H2O, just like the result of liquid hydrogen and oxygen combustion or water routed around a nuclear reactor, but much simpler.

A prototype engine that runs on magic could be vastly more fuel efficient than a chemical engine. More fuel efficiency means higher specific impulse which means exponentially less fuel required. Instead of a massive tower of fuel, a magically powered spaceship could use just a few cauldrons of heating potion.

If a rocket engine can run on magic fire (like what Hermione used to heat her polyjuice cauldron in the bathroom) and water, which can be created with a simple /Aguamenti/, then it's possible to tell the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation to bugger off and more or less explore the solar system without having to worry about fuel.

Of course, in my story nobody would go to space immediately. After testing a small scale rocket, there'd be tests of small sounding rockets to a few kilometers altitude, perhaps a small rocket strapped to a broom to break the Firebolt's speed record and to demonstrate what the new field of magic rocketry can do, to gain awareness and funding. A really fast broom would certainly catch the attention of the two Gryffindor beaters, who happen to be highly skilled tinkerers and enchanters.

The first wizard to space flight would probably be a suborbital hop on a rocket broom with modified and upgraded stability and control charms, with enchanted clothing and a bubble head charm to protect against vacuum, as the last of a series of increasingly higher altitude test flights.

Once it's proven that magic rockets can work reliably, that the control and stability enchantments work outside of the atmosphere, that it's possible to enchant something to isolate against the vacuum of space, and that all magic works in space just as well as on earth, then a true spaceship can be built.

Without the need to worry about Δv, a magical spaceship can use a completely different flight profile than a typical shuttle, which makes any kind of heat shielding or aerodynamics completely unnecessary.

Instead, the main requirements would be:

-To perform takeoff, atmospheric flight and landing through conventional magical flight without rockets to remove the need for ground infrastructure like runways or launch pads.

-To be invisible to muggles, including radar and cameras.

-Rockets capable of at least 1.5g of acceleration for long periods of time, resulting in very high Δv.

-Stability in vacuum and in atmospheric rocket-powered flight, to prevent the ship from tumbling around.

-Protection against vacuum.

-Navigation systems. You really need to know where you are, how fast you are going, in which direction, and where everything else is.

In canon HP, there's already a vehicle capable of points 1, 2 and 4, stable atmospheric flight and invisibility, sitting in Arthur Weasley's garage.

So a magical spaceship could be a minivan with all the enchantments on the Weasley car, plus the entire rocket assembly in the back area and additional enchantments to seal the crew area vacuum tight. Then add a magical map that displays the planets around the ship and all distances and velocities. The map would probably be the part that'd take the most time apart from the rocket assembly itself, perhaps a year or so to create the enchantments and logic capable of computing orbits. Slightly less time if Moony helps since he's got experience with magic maps.

To fly to space, just take off like a normal flying car, turn on the invisibility, push the button that opens the back door, turn on the engines to a soft 1.5g and slowly pull the nose up to about 30° above the horizon, then wait until you're out of the atmosphere and continue to hold prograde until the orbit is stable, then cut off the engines and enjoy microgravity.

Getting back to earth would just be a manner of turning retrograde and burning until the sideways velocity is almost wiped out, slowly descend by flying backwards and braking with the engines, until you're low and slow enough for traditional magical flight to work properly again, then just fly back home like a normal flying car.

After a successful orbital flight it'd still take some time to perfect the space suits, add an airlock, and add enchantments to protect against radiation before a moon landing could be attempted.

****** "Why do they need a satellite?"

They didn't. It was simply to practice space-flight, which would have been explained in a later chapter.

"Where did they get the detailed schematic of the shuttle?"

Assuming brooms are relatively quick, Harry could have flew to a nearby muggle town and downloaded one from the internet. In Chapter 2 I decided that the cheap school brooms would be as fast as a turn of the century motor vehicle - around 80km/h - for no particular reason, other than to have them be fast, but not too fast.

"How can a single seventh year and three firsties create a massive shuttle and launch site from scratch in what feels like no time at all?"

Conjuration.

"How the hell does it work on the first try? They just strapped themselves to a huge tower of hastily transfigured explosives, how did they not get blown up?"

Luck. I even included a joke about the Challenger tragedy in Chapter 3:

'Also, the space shuttle taking off also looked much like a firework. However, unlike a firework, the space shuttle kept on going up and up, and unlike a space shuttle, the space shuttle did not ever explode.'

"Why would they even need a shuttle with chemical propulsion if Harry just explained that magic makes infinite energy possible and therefore chemical engines unnecessary?"

Why figure out how to translate magical energy into kinetic energy when conjuring a hydrogen solid-fuel booster is so much simpler, and is effectively exactly the same thing? Harry requires a machine that can launch a satellite into geo-stationary orbit so he is practiced incase he ever wants to launch other things into geo-stationary orbit, such as, say, a "Rod of God" over London with which to threaten government officials with?

"Instead of actually explaining how and why and exploring the basics of rocket science, they just magically copy what muggles would do without taking into account how magic rewrites the fundamental principles. All of rocket science is based on the rocket equation, and magic changes the equation to the point that the entire field needs to be re-developed from scratch."

I don't see why this would be the case. It was a muggle rocket propelled by muggle rocket fuel.

"If I was writing a rocket science Harry fic, which I'm planning to do, I wouldn't start with a full shuttle launch."

The version of Harry I have written is irrational, and behaves incredibly irrationally. He has been affected significantly by the moonrock from Chapter 1. More importantly, however, is that building interest early on in a story is how you catch someone's attention and keep them enthralled in it. I promise you the pace will slow down afterwards, and tease out the rest of the plot over 10,000's of words.

"So a magical spaceship could be a minivan with all the enchantments on the Weasley car, plus the entire rocket assembly in the back area and additional enchantments to seal the crew area vacuum tight. Then add a magical map that displays the planets around the ship and all distances and velocities. The map would probably be the part that'd take the most time apart from the rocket assembly itself, perhaps a year or so to create the enchantments and logic capable of computing orbits. Slightly less time if Moony helps since he's got experience with magic maps."

Sure, you can fly to space in a minivan. But then you would have flied to space in a minivan, when you could have done it in a rocket. That seems like a poor decision to make, aesthetically. Rockets look really cool.

****** "Nuclear fission does not produce more energy than nuclear fusion. In nuclear fusion (6.4 MeV) per nucleon is given out which is much greater than the energy given out per nucleon (1 MeV) during a nuclear fission reaction."

Nuclear Fission produces 6.4 million electron volts per nucleon, which I assume is quite a lot. Fire and water (which you would not be able to turn into solid hydrogen/helium fuel - only oxygen) would probably struggle to match the quantity of acceleration such a reaction could provide.

Magic is going to play as significant a part as the rocket "science" will play, as Voldemort is still around and will have to be able to keep up with the heros to be a threat. I could have Voldemort be threatening solely through mundane means, such as hostage taking, but magic should spice him up and make the threat he poses a little more significant.

Also the fic's only 6,000 words right now. I'm writing just over 1,000 not very great words a day, though, so that'll change eventually.
