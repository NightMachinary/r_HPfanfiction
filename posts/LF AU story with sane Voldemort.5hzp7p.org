I'd like to see Voldemort creating secret organisation with political lobbyists, spys, people working on media influence, people pushing laws and bribing politicians, etc. A bit like conspiracy theories about freemasons or illuminati, if you know what I mean. So no murderous insane Voldemort, but more like evil behind the scenes puppet master. (no horcruxes, no slash, if possible)


** Linkffn(the pureblood pretense) has a sane, political leader Voldemort.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

*** Now that I think of it, yes, probably. But we never really see it in the books. Do you have recommendations for Lucius Malfoy and company doing politics?

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
