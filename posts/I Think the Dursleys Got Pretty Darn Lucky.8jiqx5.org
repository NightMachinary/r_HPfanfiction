I recently watched /Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them/ and I came to a realization, the Dursleys could have easily created an obscurial out of Harry. After all, nearly every time he did something wrong, he was punished. This could have made him suppress his magic and bada-bing bada-bam! You have yourself an obscurial. Thoughts?


** I'm pretty sure this is a common fan-theory that just about everyone knows...but I wonder, has it been combined with the 'Dumbledore knew the Dursleys were abusive and sent Harry there to make him easier to control' bash-theory yet?

Imagine it; ridiculously-evil!Dumbledore, sending Harry away to be abused and neglected to turn him into an almighty magical monster. Point it at Voldemort, watch the fireworks fly, and then mop up the remains while 'mourning' 'the tragic sacrifice of the Boy-Who-Lived'.

*** Given that his 'beloved' sister was an Obscurial, whose death probably triggered Grindlewald's interest in harnessing their power, I can only see him going that route if a)something else happened late in life to trigger him into being evil, or b)he'd been playing the long game all along, setting Gellert up to create a hero persona for himself, and had been creating many elaborate plots behind scenes.

I personally like the idea he created a villain out of Riddle, and then manipulated everything out of sheer boredom. After all, he was very intelligent and powerful...easy to imagine him as having a god complex.

Theory: Albus, Gellert, and most of the important historical figures, were just the Flamels playing games because they're far too old and bored.

**** On the Flamel theory; Albus and Gellert got captured and stuck in a basement, while Nicholas and Perenell took over their lives, because it looked like an interesting chess game. Once Perenell was defeated, she obliviated real Gellert and stuck him in Nurmengard, and took over Riddle's life. They continued playing human chess, with Nicholas cheating and creating prophecies and Chosen Ones. Real Albus was swapped in for a convenient death via imperius.

Next round, Perenell plays white as Hermione Weasley, and Nicholas is black as Mafalda Prewett.

**** Not confirmed yet, just a theory so far.

** I don't think the Dursley's are lucky to not have created a concept that didn't even exist when the first 7 books were written.

*** The 2003 Fantastic Beast book is published by the fictional "Obscurus Books" and the Ariana description seems rather fitting. In ghis case I grant Rowling that she knew much earlier.

And anyways, if you argue like that that /of couse/ Harry wouldn't become an obscurial, because he's the main chatacter. That's kinda lazy for the sake og this discussion though.

**** I also think it was a concept that she had brewing in her brain already, even if it might not have been fully realized yet.

***** I mean most likely she knew accidental magic was dangerous.

The whole obscurial thing probably came much later, probably even after the series was fully written. The descriptions of Arianna to me could fit with an obscurial but they don't really reflect the idea that JK had the idea of an obscurial fleshed out before she wrote Deathly Hallows

** On the other hand, Dumbledore made a big deal out of Harry's sheer mental resilience. Despite his upbringing, and his close contact with Voldemort's soul, he still turned out to be a kind and loving person. I think that's a central part of Harry's role as the hero of the series. It illustrates that Harry's ability to love is his greatest strength.

However, I'm not sure what that would imply about Ariana, which is what makes me a bit ehhh about the whole Obscurial thing. It doesn't seem super consistent with Harry's story.

*** Ariana must've suffered something pretty horrible. Why else would Percival go after three young boys badly enough to warrant Azkaban?

I've always suspected either sexual assault or attempted murder. Both would explain the parental rage, and the trauma. Since it sparked from them witnessing magic, I'd imagine they probably thought she was evil and tried to burn her, or drown her, or something. Children can be delightful savages. If they'd explained as they went that it was because she was magic, she'd definitely be afraid of it then.

Now in Harry's case, he's an oblivious Gryffindor, and didn't seem to truly believe it was him doing anything. He was told there was no such thing as magic, and thus never knew to fear it. Magic? Ridiculous. The wind must've blown him up! She spilt dye on her hair! Wool shrinks in wash! The glass must be a....zoo feature?

Credence knew what magic was, and also that he had it. Harry never did.
