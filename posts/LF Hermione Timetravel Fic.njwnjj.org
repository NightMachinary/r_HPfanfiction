:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic in like 2015/16 about Hermione travelling back in time using a fake name that is really horrid and funny and I believe she sacrifices herself in Lily's place. They all grow up and figure something or other out which causes Sirius to go see Regulus and Severus (who I think are dating?) And they give him a box that's sealed with a password full of things about Hermione's time from the 90's. I haven't been able to find it again so if you know it please help!
