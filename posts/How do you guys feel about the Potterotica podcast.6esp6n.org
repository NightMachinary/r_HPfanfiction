** Ms-Figg aka Ruth Solomon passed away back in 2015. Since their podcast only started this year, I'm going to assume 'permission' in their minds equals 'We sent a couple emails asking if the author minded us using their work for our show, and since we never heard back, we assumed it was alright'.

At least the podcasters were accurate about who she was.

** Hey [[/u/polliesayswhat]] and [[/u/wordhamer]] - I actually know the creators of the podcast and not only did they receive permission from Ruth/Ms-Figg's son and daughter, but her family was excited about the opportunity to share her work with a different audience saying, "Mom would love that." The hosts are really focused on honoring the authors that put in the enormous effort and creativity to create these stories. In the latest season, they've been regularly communicating with McTwist for clarifications and frequently give McTwist kudos for their story. Whether you like the podcast or not, I just wanted to clarify that they would never use a story they didn't have permission for!

*** That's good to hear, and I'd agree with her survivors that the author would probably get a kick out of it. The circumstances as mentioned in the article didn't cover that, which left a logical hole easy to fill with conspiracy. I'm happy to hear that my cynicism was unfounded. It adds joy to my day.

[no sarcasm to /s for; I meant it]

**** Of course - I would have done the same. I'll let them know to clarify, where possible, how they got Ms-Figg's permission so it's not a distraction from the podcast itself. Hope you can keep the joy going!

/cough/ Forgive me, but when I followed the link I first saw HuffPost and then a little into the article I saw "Snermione". I don't touch that stuff and even I know its "Snamione". Thanks for the laugh, OP.
