Well, when four of his kids are metamorphmagus, his better half is Andromeda Black and his sister-in-law, Narcissa Malfoy is on their side; the Wizarding World will not know what hit them.

******* "What should I name my time travel fic? Oh, I know, '/Back to the Past/' lol"

But to mirror [[/u/emotionalhaircut]] (great name, btw), I'm not sure how I'd feel about reading a fic with a pregnant 14 year old. Granted, the child wasn't conceived when Ginny was 14, but that just feels like a great setup for a bunch of angst and drama that I have no interest in reading.

Otherwise, do you like the fic, though?

******** Oops, forgot to talk about the fic lol. Yes, the fanfiction is very good; all of the characters are in character, and the way they hide Ginny's pregnancy from the general wizarding public is very clever. And I didn't see the whole pregnancy thing as being weird, but then again, I've read [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesex_(novel][this novel]]), so nothing really bothers me in terms of stories anymore.

******** Like I said, it didn't sound generic enough to me, and it still kind of doesn't -- it's too obvious as to the plot for my tastes. But that's fine. We can agree to disagree.

********* If you search Google for:

="back to the past" AND "chapter 1" site:www.fanfiction.net/s/*/1/=

you'll find around 200 thousand results.

That's... pretty generic.

EDIT: I suppose that that is unfairly grabbing stories that just have "Back to the past" in the title - let's be a tad more specific:

="back to the past chapter 1" site:www.fanfiction.net/s/*/1/=

This should at /least/ narrow it down to stories which are ONLY titled "back to the past" or, in some edge cases, where "back to the past" appears at the end of the title. Nothing much I can do about that.

Around 3,000 results.

On PAGE 4 of the results is the FIRST occurrence of a story which doesn't match my parameters exactly. Just one.

On PAGE 6 are on the next occurrences - 2 of them.

On PAGE 7 there are 3 bad results.

On PAGE 8, there are another 3 bad results.

On PAGE 9, there are 2.

Of the 100 or so results I personally went through, there were 11 bad results, so around 89% of the first 100 results are the exact title "Back to the Past".

It's SUPER generic, my dude. It's not my opinion.

********** But how many of those results are inaccurate results? That's the real question. I could type in the name of my favorite fanfiction, and I could still get well over 100 results that are nowhere close to that fan fiction in title or summary. You're going under the assumption that every result that Google comes up with is accurate, when in truth there's nowhere near that many accurate results.

But that's fine. Like I said, we can agree to disagree.

*********** I actually just edited my response. Accurately, now, it's still getting around 3,000 results.

EDIT: I've now re-edited my message for exactly how accurate it is, for at least the first ten pages.

It's not something that you can "agree to disagree" on. It's just /factually/ a generic af title, my man.

********** No, I'm not an alien lol. Although, it'd be pretty nice to be a Vulcan...jokes aside, I rarely read time travel fanfiction (I don't usually like it), so I don't really know what is generic and what isn't. Also, I don't really come across stories where the plot is that obvious in the title, so there's that.

  Harry and Ginny are somehow transported 8 years back in time. Now they find themselves trapped in their 15/14 year old bodies with their memories intact, surrounded by people who have been dead for years, and did I mention that Ginny is still pregnant?
