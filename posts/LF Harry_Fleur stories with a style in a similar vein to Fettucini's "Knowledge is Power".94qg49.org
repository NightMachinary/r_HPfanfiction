The only real parameters I have are no harems, no slash and no friendship with Hermione/Ron (really tired of them as characters). Crossovers are fine, as is Harry dating other people before meeting Fleur. I'm not of the mind that they need to be soulmates destined to only be in the company of one another, even when they are unaware of each other's existence.


** Knowledge is power is a big guilty pleasure for me. I hope something will come up

*** Exact same here, in a bit of a bad place at the moment and I've read KiP so many times it's nowhere near as fresh.

***** He has two OC friends.

It's the one with a genius Harry raised by Remus. He's a couple years older than he was in canon and excels in all areas of magic. It opens with Harry playing football. He later becomes a Quidditch star.

If that doesn't jog the memory, it's the one where he goes off on misogynistic monologues about how disgusting it is for women to sleep around and wear immodest clothing while thinking it's totally okay for men to do the same.

Think I might give that fic a miss if that's the case.

******* From memory it was a trivial part of the story. It was more a way for the author to have Harry's superiority carry over to his love life as well, so I agree about it being a bit ridiculous. I however believe Harry's lack of a reaction to his friend's (there's two characters whom this applies to) sleeping around is because they are of course, friends. He still isn't completely accepting of them, and spreads rumours about them having the clap, amonght other things. Harry criticizes guys as well as girls when it comes to their approach to relationships, on the basis that he doesn't have any connection to them. Roger Davies was one male character who this occured to that comes to mind.

The reason I enjoy the story so much is partly due to Harry's friends and his genuine and accurate relationships with them. A lot of character interactions and dialogue in fanfiction is stale and unremarkable, however in this fic I can say without a doubt that they are genuinely interesting and funny, at least to me as a reader.

*** Yes, reading fanfiction had no impact on how I view them as characters whatsoever.
