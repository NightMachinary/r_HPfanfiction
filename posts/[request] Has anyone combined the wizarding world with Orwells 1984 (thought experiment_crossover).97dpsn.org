Hello humans. I'm fascinated with weird thought experiments and like good worldbuilding. Therefore I wonder weather someone already has written/combined the secret magical society of Harry Potter with the dystopian totalitarian world of 1984. If you know any stories/thought experiments/texts about this please share.

How would the magical society adapt to a highly totalitarian Britain/Oceania? Would they try to survive in secrecy? Would they try to covertly gain control over the inner hierarchies of that totalitarian system to gain control? Would they try to cut all contact to Muggle society? Or would various groups in the magical society adopt the totalitarian ideology of 1984 muggle Britain? How would the magical society fight for their secrecy if the Muggles live under a highly totalitarian regime which tries to control everything? Would various groups inside magical Britain fight against each other because they favor different strategies to survive? What would happen if the regime finds out about the magical world?

Often, crossovers focus on combining characters from various fictional universes without in depth thinking how these fictional worlds would interact and influence each other. I'm more interested how cultures, ideologies and so on would interact and influence each other, and I hope that there are many weird thought experiments online.

Thank you for all your answers.
