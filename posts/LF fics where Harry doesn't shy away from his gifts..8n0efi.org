In so many fics I see Dumbledore fearing to see Harry so similar to Tom when they were both same age. Charismatic, gifted in magic beyond their peers and even similar face shapes. I wanna read a fic where Harry doesn't fear owning up to his gifts. Experimenting and researching what the hell Parcelmouth thing is useful for aside from talking to over glorified animals(It is a fucking snake, not some holy animal chosen by the gods), actually working and researching on magic on his free times and not blowing it off playing, again, glorified table game(It is just chess. The pieces are somewhat interesting but in the end, it is just a table game. The only reason Rowling even created something like that was to give Ron a positive trait that came in handy in just one night and never become useful ever again. My personal theory was that she feared fans finding out he was as useful as Sakura was. He was just there to give Harry an in with the twins who had his father's map so that he could learn something about his father.). Okay, where was I before I started ranting?... Nevermind. Anyway, long story short I wanna read an HP who uses his gifts. Not discard them just because they remind people of Voldie. I don't want a Harry who is being compared to Voldie. I wanna read Voldie himself being compared to Harry.


** Linkffn(The Mind Arts), Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarcat), Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) all feature a Harry who spends most or all of his free time researching magic, though for different motivations, and a Harry who becomes a dangerous wizard while still in school

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
