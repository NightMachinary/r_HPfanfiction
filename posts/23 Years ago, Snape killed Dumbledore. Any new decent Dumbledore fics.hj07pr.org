** Albus and Harry's World Trip linkffn(13388022)

The scarcrux is destroyed in the Chamber of Secrets. No longer needing to worry about the connection between Harry and Voldemort, Dumbledore can start training Harry in "...the really interesting magics." Ongoing.

*** I feel this story is so overrated because it's premise is relatively rare which is "Dumbledore mentors Harry and goes adventuring with him".

It's magic system is changed drastically from canon. Harry can do really cool things with magic no one else can because "intent". Also the shoehorned star wars references.

The author explains "loopholes" in canon very thoroughly, not trusting the reader to extrapolate, and almost disrespecting the source material by going out of his way to point out and rectify what he feels are mistakes.

The pranks are just cringey, honestly. Everyone's OOC, especially Sirius who's the fanon "unable to take anything serious and only above-average at magic" Sirius Black.

The writing is grammatically correct for the most part, but the style (in my opinion) is lacking.

There are a few good things about it, but I really feel like it requires a disclaimer when being recommended.

**** I've begun seeing this story being recommended here in the last month-ish and haven't found the time to read it yet, but the premise... intrigued me. There are a lot of ways to go in a really wrong direction with this though.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
