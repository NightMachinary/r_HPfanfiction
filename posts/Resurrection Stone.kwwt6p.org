An idea I had for a story. I'm not good enough to do it justice. Ignore Cursed Child.

During one of Albus Potter's years at Hogwarts, he explores the Forbidden Forest. He stumbles across the Resurrection Stone and uses it to bring people back. They tell him about his father and the full story of the war (he hadn't been told everything). The rest of the next generation comes in as well. Lots of meetings like Teddy and his parents, Fred and Fred, etc. The Stone does start to affect Al and the parents have to step in.

Are there any stories already like this?


** In [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forrest_of_Holly]] Harry doesn't tell his children (and anybody else) almost anything about the War, and so they (together with the main heroine of the series, daughter of Dudley) discover the full story only on their own. Except, instead of the Resurrection Stone they use Daily Prophet and other normal sources.
