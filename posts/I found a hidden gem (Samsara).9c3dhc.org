linkffn(12415212) is an extremely well written and captivating story. It is unfortunately only 61K words, as such a work deserves to be fully explored.The prose is amazing for the fandom and the premise intriguing, and even if it isn't your cup of tea, I suggest reading at least the first chapter.

Short summary: Lily's protection runs deeper and makes a deal with the devil to save Harry from number 4's poison.Well groomed and polite (especially polite), Harry Potter starts exploring the world of magic, delving into the secrets of the soul and the deepest magics. A half-goblin mentor and a determined Transfiguration teacher will open the path for him.


** The premise is so interesting, but I can't - just can't - go over an 11 year old holding perfect adult-like conversation and even capable of discussing /interest rate/.

**** Getting these numbers with popular characters is not difficult. I'm writing fanfics for less than a year and have two stories in that area, one with more and the other with slightly fewer favourites/follows. And I still have a long way to go when it comes to writing quality since I am not a native speaker.

Absolutely not true. Some people seem to do it easily. Others never achieve a fraction of that.

****** It's all about exposure. Updates on Weekends (especially Saturday evening) get you far more views than if you publish the same chapter on a Wednesday morning. If you pair Harry with a background character you don't get much attention. I openly admit that "Call Me" is a better fic than my own "No longer alone". Both have Harry/Lisa Turpin as pairing, but since I had included Andromeda and Nymphadora Tonks in the tags I got far more attention.

If you have an interesting premise, avoid the common pitfalls, have somewhat decent language skills (and promote it here as well), getting that amount of attention isn't particularly difficult. Regular updates go a long way in that regard.

******* I've published over 150k words worth of fiction over the past two years. Language is pretty much flawless after thorough beta-ing, pairing is Harry/Ginny (the most popular pairing, going by many polls), and I've received nothing but positive, even lauding reviews for my latest stories. But it's just not happening in terms of exposure.

Your belief that it "isn't particularly difficult" is just not true. You have to have a good network, your premise has to grab enough attention, and most of all you have to be lucky. You are lucky with your amount of exposition and readership, and I hope you realize that.

******** I have no network, no beta and looking back, the first few pieces I published sucked. Far too many dialogue tags, I had no idea how to use commas in the English language (and still struggle with that), use far too many adverbs and -ing forms... The list goes on. Admittedly, I've fixed as many of those mistakes as I could find (basically rewriting my first ever story and large chunks of the already published chapters), but compared to a lot of other authors, even those who get far less attention than me, I suck.

I have written roughly 132k words in the past year, most of that since last December, and I am roughly in the middle when it comes to exposure. Stuff like Adversary breeds excellence has me beaten by miles even though it sucks while stories like Call Me or Headsman's Hostage have far less exposition despite superior writing quality. And the reasons are obvious. Cho isn't well liked and Lisa Turpin is a complete unknown with no fanon base like Daphne.

I mean, it's pretty obvious that including popular characters gets you more attention than not doing so.

******* I'm not going to break that down point by point but you are very wrong. None of those things make a significant difference. I know; I've done them all. If you get plenty of attention it's because you are writing something that people want to read. You don't need to downplay it.

******** I get at least a thousand views more if I update on weekends (spread out over the following days). Apparently we've made very different observations when it comes to getting attention. And while I admit that I'm staying away from common plots and tropes as much as possible, I'm nowhere near the literary skills of, for example, TE7 (although my eventual endings can't really be worse than Letters).

************ Of your stories. They are not very informative and the OC ones sound like they are part of a series or AU, but offer very little information on what the whole fuzz is about. And the fact that you have a couple stories up where you say something like "deleted all chapters" doesn't make navigating your stories easier.

Lastly, I think CC permanently ruined time travel with Harry's children.

***** I agree completely, what you write really does hugely affect the amount of favourites/follows one can receive.

I've seen plenty of stories that are just an absolute hodgepodge of plot ideas, weirdly tacked on harem romance, and top level edge-lord writing that easily breach the 5000F mark. It's a matter of balancing what you want to write versus what others want to read, and know that if you want to write something more niche that you'll most likely receive less attention than something more common.

****** I know. I just published a Hermione/Tonks one-shot and since it's a rare pairing, I'm not expecting a huge amount of favourites/followers there.

But for longer stories with popular characters it's not difficult to get attention if you use a sensible upload schedule and write something creative.
