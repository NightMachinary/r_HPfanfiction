I'm looking for a fic in which all the Potters are alive and Harry is not evil. I still want it to be a fic with action in it. Most fics that have Harry's parents still alive are feel good family fics or Harry is evil. I'd like an action adventure type fic with Harry being good and having his parents. I don't think i've ever come across a fic like this.

If this isn't enough to show why BajaB is one of the more enjoyable and overall talented writers for HP fanfiction then I don't quite know what is.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

*** I don't like this fic at all. The other dimension couldn't have a more different starting condition, and yet the author jammed in canon stations there too.

Then Harry was supposed to have godlike powers, and yet he had big difficulties taking on a few Death Eaters (not even the best ones) at Quidditch World Cup. Looks like blatant manufactured drama to me.

Finally, this author has NEVER finished a story before.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
