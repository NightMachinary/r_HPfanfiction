Chapter 19:

"Cub," Remus said. "It was something I used to call you when you were a baby. For some reason, Lily wasn't a big fan of that nickname," He trailed off nostalgically.

"I can see why," Harry said dryly. "Of all the nicknames you could come up with that was pretty lame. Truth be told, I was expecting Sirius to have come up with something stupid like 'pup' or something. Not," he gestured towards Remus, "/you!/"

â€‹

YES. THE 'PUP' and 'CUB' NICKNAME GETS CALLED OUT ON. I AM CRINGE FREE!


** Rise of Wizards is an overall terrible story, but it's my guilty pleasure. I haven't read it in some time, though. Everyone's worse character trait is magnified and they're all ooc, but I swear the whole 3 or 7 horcrux thing was so in character for Hermione

*** To be fair, most fanfiction is OOC despite claiming to be otherwise. I give this fic some credit for depictions of Ron and Hermione that resemble what believably flawed real-life people have done.

*** What's good about it is that everyone sucks.

The author acknowledges everyone made mistakes.

Other than that, it has good grammar and doesn't treat Hermione like the next Dumbledore. Unfortunately it has friendly goblins.

** The thing that Rise of the Wizards does well is the Dumbledore storyline, where it plays all the manipulative Dumbledore tropes and then pulls a 180 by having Harry just be completely wrong about it all, but it's too late. Real punch to the gut and trope subversion done well.

Everything after the fic leaves the rails of HBP canon is a train-wreck though.

*** I actually agree with you there. Although the fact it is readable is also a reason why it's popular.

** I haven't read this fic, but the badness of Harry's dialogue in your example more than makes up for not using 'cub'.

I also don't see why it's that stupid to call a baby (and not a teenager) that. It's overdone, but Harry cringing at it in-universe comes across as 'edgy teen is too cool for his lame parents'.

** Like most things that make me cringe in FF 'pup' is fine in small doses. Some writers even do it well (like fewer than once every 5000 words) but they still end up making me cringe because I've seen it used so poorly so often in other fics.

*** I think both "pup" and "cub" (and let's even add "Prongslet") are terrible nicknames, and the only situation where they are well used are either the ones like we see in this post (character has a terrible taste), or when Sirius and/or Remus use these nicknames exclusively to mess with Harry.
