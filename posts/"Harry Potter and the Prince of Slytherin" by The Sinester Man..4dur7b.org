** It's really good, and it updates frequently.

It's not just a rehash of canon; there's quite a bit happening outside of Hogwarts.

Also, two words; Competent Lockhart.

** So, I just read through this and enjoyed it quite a bit. It is a bit on the wordy side, but I've found it manageable. I personally like how the author takes some tropes and ideas and creates a spin on them. For example, the author gives some reasons for James bias against slytherins. Not all of it's entirely rational or perfectly plausible, but I like to see stories where all the characters have motivations.

It definitely does have kids who don't act like kids, but if you can look past that, then the characters are relatively decent.

Perhaps the most interesting thing to see where it's going is the whole plot-line behind the [[/spoiler][world forgetting the nargles, beginning with Pandora's use of magic]] .

Overall, its a story with an interesting premise, if not ambitious. For a variety of reasons it has made it onto my favorites list.

** It's my favourite story that's still updating. The writer is absolutely fantastic and whenever there's an update I can't put it down.

Agreed with the other commenter- Best Lockhart I've ever seen by far! I definitely recommend reading this fic. There's so many unique little sub-plots on the go. It is definitely not a canon rehash.

** Great read but you have to actually read it as it takes lots of cringe-worth tropes and flips them on their heads. Most people just go see bad tropes and then come on here and say stupid shit like "I couldn't get past chapter 4". And it's not like there's much good output from the ff community right now to rival it.

** I tried reading it until chapter 30 or so and just check back once in a while. It does have some interesting ideas and at least for WBWL! Fics doesn't go straight for the evil Dumbledore trope. Still it cannot escape the fundamental problems with such fics, as it requires the Potters to be as unloving to Harry as possible and is a massive departure from canon as it is.

But as you noticed, it is incredible long for a fic that is only in 2nd year. At this point, I worry that the author might start to lose control of his plot points and ideas and the fic becomes more needlessly complex than it needs to, especially.

So if you like WBWL Harry, this is another unique take. But if you have reservations about a fic that is already longer than the first 3 books combined, yet has not even cleared the second in terms of scope, than you should just skim the fic for the key details if you have any interest

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

** It's a rehash, uses a lot of shitty tropes, tries to subvert some of them. Some parts of it are pretty decent. The author doesn't know how to shut up and move the plot along. Suffers from 30 year old 12 year old syndrome.

** UGH, seeing as people are generally fond of the story I was planing on reading it, but after the massive cock tease that is the first chapter I don't think I'll be able to do it.

Set up all this interesting stuff, then go, "NA WE'RE TOTALLY JUST GOING TO GO BACK IN TIME TO 1991 AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO READ THROUGH 700,000 WORDS (HALF OF WHICH AREN'T OUT YET) UNTIL YOU GET BACK TO WHERE THE STORY BEGAN."

Not to mention Sirius is going to be in Azkaban for no good reason for 400,000 words. Joy.

Because not all of us like the [[https://www.ted.com/talks/j_j_abrams_mystery_box?language=en][mystery box]] type of storytelling. I really hate when a story only teases the interesting part of a story and then proceeds to ignore it in favor of boring bullshit.

It's a blatant [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch][Bait and Switch]] and not everyone like it.

I am curious if you have read the story, cause some very interesting stuff goes down in the fic. Unless you were generalising.

Anyway, you could say it is a bait and switch, but since the story remains compelling, does it really matter? It would be fun to read on and find out how the hero journeys up to that point. If the author switched to a boring narrative, then it would be another matter---but that doesn't seem to be the case here.

Of course, as you said, different people like different things.

No, it isn't compelling to be lied to by the author, and that's a matter of opinion anyways. I haven't read the fic in question, I don't get twin stories. I don't get the point.

**** Its really stupid to put a teaser like that then have 700,000 words between that scene and the reader.

As for Sirius, I meant the author just decided to conveniently put him in Azkaban. I skimmed the second chapter.
