Either in an AU where he was never sent to Azkaban, or he ended up getting a trial, or his name freed at some point in the story.

No Character Bashing, characters disliking or hating each other is fine; but an author going out of their way of bashing characters is a no go.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

I don't want Harry to be super smart or super intelligent. Slightly smarter or slightly more powerful then in canon is fine, but I don't want it unbelievable.

I'd rather it not be Harry/Hermione, but: IF it's Harry/Hermione, absolutely NO Weasley bashing of any kind.

It can be on any site.

I'd rather it be completed, but if it's interesting enough, it doesn't need to be.


** A Second Chance by Breanie, shows Sirius and Remus raising Harry, just posted chapter number 208, its a really good read, some really good OC's (I love Zee!) and really well written! Main pairing is Hinny but Harry had a thing with Lisa Turpin first and Hermione had a thing with Viktor. Def recommend!!

** The Wise One is a great one of these. Some of those OCs were awesome. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4062601/1/The-Wise-One-Book-One-Becoming]]

  Winner of multiple awards - THANK YOU! Sirius Orion Black took the charge of raising Harry to heart in every way, becoming a pillar of Wizarding Britain. Somewhere along the way, though, he forgot his Marauder side . . . until he meets his soulmate in a surprising place. AU because I change, oh, a LOT of canon. Please read the Author's Notes!
