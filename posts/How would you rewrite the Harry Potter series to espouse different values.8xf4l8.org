** There's plenty of fanfics that try to reframe Harry Potter in a alt-right/nationalistic/racist/fascist mindset: House Elves are parasitic and them being servants/slaves is the natural order of things. The ministry fails because it doesn't have strong leadership. Dumbledore is too forgiving. Muggleborn ("immigrants") try to usurp Wizarding culture and need to be put in their place. Pure-bloods have built the glorious Magical Britain with their blood and sweat and deserve their well earned dues: They naturally should lead and lesser people should follow (basic fascism).

I'm probably forgetting a few fanfic cliches that exemplify this in a similar manner.

**** Yeah because there seems to be something seriously wrong with the education in the US (and possibly other countries). They think fascism/naziism is something completely disgusting and vile that only true monsters would fall for and that it will be obvious when it stares them in the face. They think it's some otherworldly ideology that no good person like themselves would ever fall for. These are also the people who get upset when some publications refer to the internment camps at the US border as "concentration camps", because they think that term should be reserved for something special.

It's the complete opposite of what I learned and I always want to smack these people up the head with a copy of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wave_(novel)][The Wave]]

******** Dumbledore first: In his interaction with Harry, even laden with mea culpas, shows that the ends justify the means, at least where defeating Voldemort is concerned.

As far as the elder wand, I see it's meritocratic nature as tenuous at best. It is far more Arthurian, and while Excalibur ostensibly chose a king from among the people we also know that Arthur was the king along and more importantly that with the right tool he had all the power. Not skill, or intellect, empathy, dedication, but instead a tool.

For me it boils down to this, equity is about reasonable equality of opportunity, and the elder wand generally gives it wielded equality of result, regardless of how well said wielder used their opportunity.

Also, in rereading my first response it was more curt than intended. What are your thoughts?

I think the best you could argue for in terms of blood purity is that pure blood increases the chance of being magical at all (very low chance for people born to muggle parents, unknown chance for people with mixed ancestry, presumably very high chance for people of pure magical ancestry). However since it is unknown whether children of two magicals are less likely to be born squibs than children of a magical and a muggle, this is far from certain.

**** I blame Rowling. Since Wizarding Culture is so vaguely explained or described. I get it in the first three books, that were just boarding school books with magic. But the later books where Rowling started on with the bigger moral story, she still doesn't say anything about what must be a pretty old and rich culture already there. So people make up their own. And it often involves character bashing and lots of terribly written gay sex.

*** Rather than depict a fascist utopia, an alt-right fic would lampoon progressives. For example:

Non-human teachers would be hired at Hogwarts regardless of their qualifications, to show how inclusive and tolerant they are.

The Ministry and other state institutions would have hiring quotas to bring the muggleborn:pureblood ratio in line with the general population. Private companies would follow suit to show how virtuous they are. To join the Aurors, a pureblood would need an O in their Defense NEWT, but a Muggleborn would only need an EE - whereas someone part-nonhuman would only need a passing grade.

Conversely, should Muggleborn become overrepresented in the Ministry compared to general population, it would be celebrated as a great victory. Any suggestion to use those same mechanisms to bring in more purebloods would be laughed at.

Besides some fringe publications, the media would stay silent about crimes commited by Muggleborn, but any violent crime, especially hate crime, by purebloods would be plastered on the first page.

People would be encouraged to celebrate Muggle, goblin, or centaur cultures, but expressing pride in pureblood culture would be a taboo. In fact, it would be widely claimed that purebloods "have no culture at all".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12574498/1/Potter]]

I've definitely read a fic where House Elves where described as Parasites (since someone accused me of making that up), but can't remember which and don't care to. Another variant I've seen is the Elves' ancestors having done something bad and they have been enslaved as punishment and deserve what they get. Maybe someone else remembers the fics for these.

The "pure-bloods are awesome" and "Dumbledore is too forgiving" are so common that I don't feel the need to come up with examples.

Then there's fics like "Partially Kissed Hero" and "For Love of Magic" (see the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8vzvyk/for_love_of_magic_has_updated_and_harry_now_hates/][recent discussion]] on this subreddit) which are more overt/explicit in their political leanings.

This, for example. I've never seen that. Maybe it exists in, like, one obscure anti-creature fic, somewhere. But I've never seen it. However, I have seen fics which portray House Elves as symbiotic in other ways---typically mutualistic.

There are, however, a few which recognize that Rowling was portraying the Death Eaters as a parallel for Nazism, and take that to the conclusion that Fudge's government policies were intended to be a metaphor for Neville Chamberlain.

The important thing is that many if not most writers portray house elves as needing to feed of their owners' magic to survive, and therefore it's morally acceptable for wizards to keep them as slavery.

Your solution of enslavement is genocide. You're really nice person.

In the books we see that Dobby has been excluded from House Elves society. Also we see how Winky dealt with the freedom becoming an alcoholic. With Winky being a typical House Elf we can assume that others will deal with the freedom in similar ways and that will likely lead to the whole raise dying.

But yeah... It's just inconvenience, isn't it? At least they will die free.

What?! Why? Freeing the Elves would obviously be a slow societal process. The first step for example could be to make a law that allow them to leave a family if they wanted to and give them somewhere to go. A next step might be to create a minimum wage for house elves, so that they have the means to leave a family if they are mistreated (instead of being technically free but falling into economical slavery).

Who gave you the insane idea that freeing the Elves means ripping them from their families and forcing them all to be free - without giving them any means to care for themselves.

Is there a law that forbids them leaving by themselves now? What stops them now? Are there any laws about House Elves at all? Must they know about Ministry laws currently?

Relationships between House Elves and their owners aren't about laws, but about culture. I don't think it's possible to force any your laws to them. The point where it should start are House Elves owners.

For some reason almost everyone who root for the freedom for House Elves is missing it. They think "let's make right laws end everything will be great!" while such attitude will likely lead to disaster.

Harsher punishments against criminals and other deviants is one of the first socially acceptable talking points that (borderline) fascists will bring up, even though there's little to no evidence that it would be beneficial - in fact it is probably harmful. Goes hand in hand with demanding the death penalty, etc.

Fits right in with the strong leadership and "cleaning" up society ideal.

It's funny though since Magical Britain already has horrific punishments and Dumbledore probably has a point not wishing anyone to be at the mercy of the Ministry. Just wish he'd been more consistent in giving Sirius the benefit of the doubt.

The "system" can do whatever they want. They can also kill someone for stealing a loaf of bread. What does this have to do with it being immoral or not? We have moved away from the "an eye for an eye" policy, because issues like these are not solved by math equations: Retributive justice as a whole seems like a flawed concept to me. I don't believe in Karma or some kind of mythical balance that needs to be restored by inflicting equal amounts of pain to the perpetrator. In my perception imprisonment of a criminal is valid because it protects society and can be used to rehabilitate, not because I think it's awesome to hurt the dirty criminal and make him be sad and somehow that adds up to some kind of equilibrium (minus times minus equals plus?).

I think the death penalty is for the most part motivated by revenge and a desire to appease the victims family. This doesn't mesh at all with my sense of justice. Also I strongly believe that murderers can be rehabilitated (especially those that committed their crime in a state of emotional shock or trauma) and since my goal would be to improve our society it seems stupid and a waste to me to kill someone who could still be useful and make up for their crimes in a productive way.

Of course this only works in a somewhat enlightened and civilized society. If you have an angry mob of barbarians demanding blood you'll probably be forced to execute criminals in order to keep the peace.

There's little to no hope that any of Hitler's top Lieutenants could have been rehabilitated and there's lots of potential harm in letting them live: Just merely by living they might form a rallying point around a dangerous ideology, could be rescued from imprisonment and wreck further havoc.

It is difficult to say how things would have panned out if they had been shoved into a dark hole and never let out instead of hanging them. Speculative "What if" history like this is not my strength.

Suffice it to say my stance on the death penalty is not quite as firm when it comes to War Criminals and the likes. It is important to point out that I'm not rallying against killing per se (war or self defense for example are very different areas).

Why do you agree to kill Hitler, but ready to spare a man who planned and killed his wife? Or his child? Or another's child? Or several children in school?

- Private property is stuff that you don't use, but extract rents from. Like a car you rent out, or a plot of land where someone else extracts mineral resources and pays you for the privilege.

#+end_quote

At its base level, Communism is about everyone being an equal member of a society. Hierarchy is fundamentally incompatible with this concept, as power/respect/wealth/food become accrued by a select number of individuals over time, /every time hierarchy is introduced to society/. Yes, hierarchy existed inside the Soviet Union, and therefore it fundamentally diverged from the actual theory laid down by Marx and Engels. Even Lenin saw that a government of the Proletariat can't actually work without allowing some intellectual or influential people to guide the revolution.

Otherwise regarding your other points I believe you're misinterpreting what I'm saying to an extent. At it's base level, yes, society as a whole (in any form) attacks the existence of the individual, however in Communist/Fascist/Authoritarian/Autocratic/Dictatorial systems, the individual is a definitive target of the state. No one is completely free in any democracy on earth, but anyone is still freer there than if they were a cog in a communist or other extreme society.

Democracy is, theoretically, a threat to the stability of any system, it's just that capitalism becomes more stable than other forms of economic policy overall because it /appeals/ to human individualism, to our ambitions and also our baser instincts regarding ownership and the accruing of wealth/property/mates etc. I state again, if Communism were the preferred state of being for humans, it would've existed long before the industrial revolution and would reoccur inside control populations of its own accord.

Being an individual is not inherently a threat in of itself to democracy, because in the end the only thing that matters is your vote and your taxes. In Western society, we celebrate our individualism.

However in the extreme forms of government I mentioned above (not just Communism), individualism is by its very existence an attack on the apparatus of the state. Why Communism doesn't work in the modern world, same as any other extreme form of government (in the long run), is because we are at our basest level, individuals. Not part of a commune or hive-mind that would allow actual cooperation. Society is by my understanding a construct created by individuals to ensure the security or availability of resources for those individuals. It is more comfortable to live as part of a society than alone, not just for material reasons but for social ones too, but it doesn't change the fact that in the end our ability to make choices is the largest threat to any societal system, and particularly ones that can only be formed with mass control/indoctrination/force such as Communism.

Again, you've got a list with one odd element out. Mates are people who deserve human rights and are not property.

Anyway, capitalism is indeed an attempt to harness greed to create social progress. The problem is that it does not directly reward social progress. This problem was immediately apparent; the rise of capitalism (with the decline of mercantilism) was marked with slavery and the human rights violations of the Industrial Revolution. We've tried to patch this over with laws, and that was effective up to the Cold War, when the communists were inept bureaucrats intent on murdering large parts of their own populations and the capitalists were hell-bent on eliminating anyone who so much as whispered "worker's rights" on the grounds that they were communists. (Hyperbole, in case you want to argue about this in a literal sense. But I'll note that one of the major tasks for police since their founding has been union busting, and socialists have been essential for a lot of worker's rights.)

#+begin_quote
  I state again, if Communism were the preferred state of being for humans, it would've existed long before the industrial revolution and would reoccur inside control populations of its own accord.

An economic system somewhat similar to capitalism has existed for a very long time; however, slave labor, serfdom, and self-employment were the overwhelming options for labor, instead of wage labor. Capitalism itself superseded mercantilism and is about three hundred years old -- about 150 years older than communism.

Economic systems similar to communism have existed for a long time, at least a couple thousand years. I even linked you to an article about one example of this.

Please, learn the history of the systems you're talking about before you make history-based arguments on which ones are more natural. At least skim the relevant Wikipedia articles.

The fact that it must be propagated by armed Revolution for anyone to actually take notice of it supports this, as in even the people who invented Communism knew that having democracy would never lead to its acceptance or natural formation. Until you start recognising it as as bad as Fascism there's very little point arguing with you. I've studied Communism in all its forms at university grade, in all its executions in history, and literally the one single instance which didn't completely go against the ideals of human rights, democracy and all things decent in the world was a small portion of the way SFR Yugoslavia was run under Tito, and that was more about him not putting up with Stalin and trying to trade with the West more than anything else.

Also union busting is a US problem, we don't really have that in the UK because we have laws that protect unions. I'll readily admit that it's a trait of US Capitalism, but not one inherent to Capitalism as a whole.

The types of labour available are irrelevant to my point about control popualations. If Communism were preferable to human nature, it would not be a fringe idea peddled by middle class intellectuals. I'm not interested in systems that incorporate socialist items or other aspects of Communism, but /Communism itself/. No society has ever in history embraced Communism peacefully and then managed to avoid the creation of a heirarcy, ruling class and eventual perversion of everything the actual political theory is about.

In regards to what that article mentioned, I have repeatedly stated all of my arguments in relation to a modern society, and how Communism is fundamentally incompatible with Democracy. Furthermore, the theocratic communism mentioned (for example) is merely an interpretation of events quoted in the Bible, with no actual recorded deployment from an actual historical source. I have yet to see a single piece of actual evidence that Democratic forms of Communism can work and /have worked/ at any point in human history.

** Its hard to shift Harry Potter much more to the Left before running into fundamental issue's with the setting which all pretty much boil down to the fact that a small segment of the population has godlike supernatural power, and the rest don't.

The troubling implications begin with "why doesn't everyone have magic?". The ability to use magic is implied to be somewhat hereditary which segways into eugenics all too easily. Either there must be some unseen drawback to magic that has led magic to be selected out of the majority of the human genepool, which seems unlikely, or it is some sort of evolutionary leap which is disproven in the text by the presence of ancient Egyptian curses. Introducing "the next stage of human evolution" is also problematic, but beside the point.

The only way I can imagine Harry Potter being rewritten to be truly egalitarian would be to have wizards be reframed more as Illuminati like hoarders of secret knowledge, and that anyone could potentially learn magic. All other sentient species would probably have to be descended from transfigured humans or you run into issue of ethnocentrism by projecting human beliefs onto non-humans and/or problematic questions of what is the measure of a nonhuman.

Basically a state sponsored leper colony). They see basic income as a neo-liberal ploy (as in economic liberalism, because some from that school of thought also promote the idea). Its just that They don't have any counter proposal except for raising wages and unions, neither of which address the actual problem.

I'd also introduce a 'rival' leader within Hogwarts, from Hufflepuff or Slytherin, who is not bad, per se, but espouses a /slightly/ different set of values to Harry and co. Something like them being pro-dementors at Azkaban, pro-house elf rights, anti-discrimination, pro-Ministry reform, pro-Hogwarts reform, and anti-Harry Potter. In other words, someone reasonable, yet disagrees with the Golden Trio fairly often.

I'd like to see them form a following and end up as an up-and-coming leader in the magical government. They could be a great antagonist to the Golden Trio; while this person doesn't really like Harry Potter, they aren't opposed to working with Harry and Co. when it is expedient for him/her.

(And even if there are defences against Veritaserum, that just means that some guilty may escape; it still works perfectly fine to save the innocents.) Also, the story pretty much ends with showing that "Let's kill all enemies" isn't the correct answer, and that democracy beats autocratic systems.

While I generally do write stories where you won't win a war without killing your enemies, and where you'd betray everything you fought for if you'd settle for "status quo ante" after you won the war, there are lines you shouldn't cross.

In Divided and Entwined, a big part of the story centres around the question of how patient you should be with your political opponents when you could simply take over with force instead of trying to get aristocrats to step down and give way to democracy. Doubly so if some of you (former) allies in the war are now hell-bent on revenge and more violence.

But I do subscribe to the notion that when you're facing Death Eaters who want to murder all muggleborns, there's not a lot that's not justified to defeat them.

They shouldn't be perfect. If a Veritaserum is a main tool of justice, no one will spend time and resources for a proper thoughtful investigation. I don't think such system will even have a lawyer for the accused.

Your suggestions lead to questions and one of them is who are the target's enemies.

In my case the target is convicted by the justice system with no relations to outsiders. There are victim and culprit who admitted the crime under the Veritaserum -- in the initial comment you described the system that requires only this.

Why is that? Those who don't believe it will have to fight the legal system first in order to prove that the mistake was made (and all cases closed with Veritaserum must be reopened as result) and than (years after) prove that you were related to it.

This is magic, where the laws of reality go out the window. As far as I understand it, Harry Potter is mainly the result of a conflict between the arguably insane Voldemort and the utilitarian Dumbledore, who might be senile, but is definitely intelligent.

For most of the series it's still essentially a proxy war between Dumbledore and Voldemort. With the level of power both possess, plots can easily go up to many layers of meta. Enough that convoluted plots to frame people using veritaserum are viable options, if only to cause confusion and misdirection.

^{the} above is an argument for why veritaserum may not be viable /in the Harry Potter universe/

The other reason: drunk id correct. It is laughably easy to frame someone using a potion that forces you to tell the truth /as you know it/

Example: “Sirius Black, did you kill James and lily potter” “Yes” Tada. Unless veritaserum allows for a ludicrous amount of explanation of nuances, at which point it's worthless, it can't be used that well. It's only really useful for very very very specific queries, like, “where was your physical body at x time”, but even that's useless if the target had access to a) a time turner, or b) possession.

My example shows you don't even need to rearrange memories. I'm reasonably certain Sirius said something akin to “I killed them” or something, leading to his trial-less Incarceration, so that's what he would say under veritaserum. Politicians have lying with the truth down to an art form. If fanfic hasn't completely made things up, then the wizarding judiciary and legislative branches are one and the same, with the legislature serving as a sort of high court. In other words, the politicians /ARE/ the judges, juries, and likely also lawyers.

** I now imagine Harry, Ron and Hermione singing Bella Ciao around the bonfire in the forest.

But seriously, *edit* here, a lot of stories that try to get political make one, big mistake. They assume solutions/ideologies proposed and implemented by muggles can be solutions for wizarding problems as well. That often ignores one fundamental difference: Wizards have magic. Wizards and witches will not be confronted with the same problems as muggles. Period. Therefore their solutions must be different ones.

Corporate Capitalism as we have it nowadays is not happening in wizard society. The means of production cannot be seized by the upper class, because literally everyone capable of it is given his own, personal universal manufacturing device at the age of 11.

I know, of course, that fantasy always points to reality, no matter if the author wants or not. But I just wanted to point out that in order to worldbuild magical politics, these politics need to be rooted in believable cultural foundations

*** But at the same time "wizards aren't muggles, muggle solutions won't work" is stupid. You have to point out why a muggle solution - checks and balances, democracy, anti-discrimination laws, anti-corruption laws, etc. - wouldn't work for wizards as well. We know the problems of the Ministry in canon, and we know muggle solutions to those problems. What we don't know is why most muggle solutions shouldn't work.

**** That why I wrote "Ideologies/Solutions". An ideology is nothing but a proposed solution to societies problems.

What I meant by saying that muggle solutions don't work for magical people is that the ideologies /must/ differ severely from the ideologies of muggles, simply because they have a different fundamental basis for their entire way of life. I'm not saying /all/ muggle solutions don't work, but I am saying that to apply some solution and call it a day without looking at the magical side of things would not suffice in most cases.

***** The ideologies do not have to differ at all. Democracy, Equal Rights, Human Rights, Due Process - those work for wizards as well as for muggles because they are universal principles, not detailed laws. Yes, you need to adapt them to magic - but at their core, they remain the same, and remain valid for everyone.

But it's not true. If it was the Magical World wouldn't have money, poor and reach. If someone had something, all others could replicate it easily.

As we see in the books the Magical World economy is similar to non-magical and therefore it uses the same principles in its basement.

**** I like to assume that while everyone with a wand could theoretically do everything, only a very select few have the actual talent and drive to achieve that. The vast majority of the wizard population won't be able to cast every spell they need, much less all of the "nice to have".

Why is that? Where is the line between spells for everyone and spells for the "chosen ones"?

Where is difference between transfiguring some brick of wood into cotton or Acromantula silk? Or into still or gold?

******* Still Harry managed to teach it and Patronus to a bunch of 5th and 4th year students.

It's DADA without proper teacher for years. Other subjects (Transfiguration, Charms, Herbology) had very competent teachers and there's no evidence that majority of Hogwarts alumni are bad in those subjects.

********* It works for mundane world.

If magic can produce everything with just several motions of wand, this formula stops working.

To be honest I more like HPMOR approach: everything Magic produces is temporal, conjunction or transfiguration -- doesn't matter. The lifetime depends on the spell strength, but it ends.

Therefore all things (clothes, furniture, food etc.) must be produced as in mundane world. Magic can just help doing it.
