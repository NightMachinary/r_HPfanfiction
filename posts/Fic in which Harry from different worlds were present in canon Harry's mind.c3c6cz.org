:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There were different Harry's who occupied canon Harry's mind.

I remember a warrior Harry, a fem!Harry (who was probably a ravenclaw), a Gryffindor Harry, and there were some more which I am not remembering.

Different Harrys entered canon Harry's mind chapterwise. I mean, chapter 1 had the first 'other' Harry enter canon Harry's mind, chapter 2 had the second one enter canon Harry's mind.....

Also, I think (not sure on this one), Harry had headaches due to these different Harrys entering his mind.

This was (most probably, like 99% sure) on fanfiction.net

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks in advance

  All his life, Harry Potter had heard voices inside his head. He never expected to learn that the voices were his own. Five different Harry Potters, from five different worlds, must work together to survive life, school, and the second war.

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.
