In a moment of insanity, Harry realises it'd be far easier to compete against 7th years if they were completely hammered, and, Harry being better prepared, either gets some muggle diving gear, or builds up a tolerance to Alcohol, or comes up with a plan that limits his time in the water. He then recreates Seamus spell from the First year, but working, and on a grand scale, turning the entire lake into Rum, getting the Merpeople, the squid, the Grindylows etc pissed too,

Bonus points if Harry jumps drunk shark krum on a Jetski or something crazy.


** ...And then, following in Seamus's footsteps in another way, he sets the alcohol on fire.

** Jumping into a lake of alcohol won't make you hammered. It will make you dead.

*** You can swim in Rum. Not too long since the alcohol can also be absorbed through other means than your orifices, but you can do it for a limited amount of time.

So if Harry could fully shield himself from the Rum being absorbed, he could easily swim in it to complete the challenge.

** I don't think the lake critters would be drunk, I think they'd be dead. Krum too, since he did the shark thing with the gills. Possibly Harry as well. It'd be an international incident. This is a /terrible/ plan.
