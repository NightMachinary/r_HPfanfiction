So I'm reading a random fanfiction and its at a part where Harry meets Dobby, and how the house elf is warning him about something bad that's going to happen to Hogwarts, you know the part. And i'm trying to remember if that's how he really does it in the book, it's been so long since I read it that i'm not sure. I know in the movie Dobby tells him that he can't go back to school because it's dangerous.

Now here's my problem. The Diary. Lucius puts it in Ginny cauldron as petty revenge because his house got raided, he is hoping the get Arthur and his family in trouble. Which means there was no evil plot that was going on. There is no way Dobby knows what the diary truly is. I mean Malfoy doesn't know what it is, so neither of them would know what was about to happen. Why would Dobby feel the need to warn Harry about it? I mean the only thing I can think of was Malfoy already plotting to try and remove Dumbledore but he was allowed to do that after shit went down, so that couldn't have been it. Am I missing something? I mean like i said before it's been a while since I read the books, but I don't understand Dobby's warnings.


** You've got the canon timeline mixed up. Between PS and COS, Arthur Weasley writes and implements the Muggle Protection Act and starts raiding properties. At the start of CoS, Lucius tells Borgin his house hasn't been raided yet. Arthur doesn't raid Malfoy Manor until Christmas of second year.

Lucius didn't pass the diary onto Ginny in revenge for a raid. His goal is for Ginny to be caught opening the Chamber of Secrets as a way to discredit Arthur Weasley and by extension the Muggle Protection Act. He knows exactly whose diary it is and what it will do - see the exchange between Dumbledore and Lucius at the end, where the diary is openly referred to as Lord Voldemort's; see also the warning Lucius gave to Draco to keep his head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with the job.

Dobby presumably overheard Lucius discussing his plan with Narcissa.

Of course, the funny thing is that Harry and Ron flying to Hogwarts in a flying car enchanted by Arthur probably did more damage to Arthur's professional reputation than anything Lucius Malfoy achieved.

** although Lucius did not know that the diary was a horcrux, he did know that it would open the chamber of secrets. it was just an added benefit to plant it on a Weasley kid to get revenge on Arthur for the raids

But he knows the diary is Voldemort's and he knows what it will do (re-read the conversation between Lucius and Albus at the end).

** Lucius planned to release the diary at Hogwarts, he just didn't know exactly how. Similarly, Dobby knew the diary was serious bad news without knowing exactly that it would involve opening the chamber of secrets.

** Lucius knew perfectly well, that it is some kind of very dark magical object, which will probably seriously hurt (or kill) Ginny. He probably mentioned it to somebody (Narcissa?) while Dobby was listening.

If he knew it was something to activate the Chamber of Secrets, then it would have tendency to kill muggleborns, not Harry.

Right, so the proper question is, why he didn't show up in The Burrow and why he didn't warn Ginny instead, when it had nothing to do with Harry?

That's a very good question.

Dobby's concern is not to stop bad things from happening at Hogwarts; he is not attempting to foil Lucius' plan in general. Rather, his concern is to prevent Harry from being harmed as a result of the events he considers inevitable.

** firstly - as someone else said, it was to preempt a raid not to take revenge

secondly - Dumbledore explains it in the chapter of Horcruxes in Book 6:

#+begin_quote
  Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen, because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his master's soul in his hands he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence -- but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends: by planting the diary upon Arthur Weasley's daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur, have me thrown out of Hogwarts and get rid of a highly incriminating object in one stroke.
#+end_quote

thirdly - I think this was the best place to ask that, I consider this subreddit the true heir to the early 2000s HP fandom

** Didn't the raids happened because Harry overheard Malfoy the same day Malfoy put the diary on Ginny's cauldron? Since Arthur didn't know of it before, would that still count as revenge?
