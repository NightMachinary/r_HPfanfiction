I'll be honest with you here. I wrote this because I was bored because I went to school 2 hours early and had nothing to do. I cranked this out in 50 minutes without a beta, so poor quality is almost guaranteed. On the other hand, this is the second fic I have ever written, so comments are welcome.

Also, [[/u/pointyball][u/pointyball]]. Here I deliver. It's not quite insane, but it's kinda cracky, I guess.
