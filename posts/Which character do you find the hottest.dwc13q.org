** Sirius is the only character in any of the books I would call 'hot'. I could probably be attracted to Mad-eye or Kingsley at a push.

** I'd say it's a toss up between Daphne and Fleur. Provided, of course, Fleur is the intelligent witch Canon shows her to be, rather than the bimbo esque depiction some people want to reduce her to. Hermione also gets honorable mention :)

But I'm also disproportionately attracted to intelligence and drive, so I'm clearly biased.

** Toss up between James and Sirius. Fleur for the women. I have a thing for arrogant assholes.

** I'd have to assume that Morgana was hot. She was vain and a master of transmutation and a capable potion brewer since she was an animagus.

That aside, Helga Hufflepuff was pretty stacked.
