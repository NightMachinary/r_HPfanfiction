Harry/Tonks is one of, if not my favourite pairing, but I don't see it enough. Is hard to find. Sad panda.

Stories I'm familiar with and know (and love and have saved in like all the bookmark folders) are Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool, and Harry Potter & the Summer of Change. Others I've either forgotten about or something else. I forgot.

Thank!

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

** linkffn(Barefoot) is pretty good. It /looks/ like there's some Harry/Human!Hedwig at one point, but it goes away quicky and Harry/Tonks (or Honks, but that's a ridiculous name) still remains the main pairing. Other than that, it's an awesome story. (The ship isn't the /focus/, by the way.)

****** It's just annoying. "Hedwig can't be a smart owl. She has to be smart because she's actually an animagus" is the takeaway. It's been done in a few fics and is just annoying as fuck, especially when the woman trapped decides "he was such a nice master, i'm totally gonna suck his dick." If you were trapped as animal your first thought isn't sex with the person who kept you as a pet, it's to see how your friends and family are.

******* That's not what happened though. Hedwig /was/ just a normal owl and the thing that turned her human was some kind of fairy orb magic and Hedwig's relationship with Harry (if it can even be called that) was more a misguided way of her coming to terms with her new human emotions and feelings.

I agree that it was one of the worse parts of the story but it's hardly some kind of ridiculous smut plot.

1. I think the merging had a bit of harry/Tonks in it. The pairing is later on in the story and not a huge focus from what I remember. That being said, I am fairly certain I really liked the characterizations in this story quite a lot. It is also gone a year without being updated. This makes the sad panda even more distraught.

2. Ectomancer is also pretty awesome and of course, abandoned. The interactions between them in the later chapters is pretty decent. Not really a fully fledged pairing, but I think it might have developed into one.

3. The rebel and the chosen is a story by Chelsey b, one of the more prolific Harry/Tonks writers. Before she erased all of her stories. Haven't read it in a while, but I think it was pretty decent, finished as well. All of her other stuff can be found floating around in the ether.

4. Honestly can't say much about Renegade Cause, haven't read it in years.

5. Lastly, old friends, new friends is one I have not read, so tread with trepidation. Have heard some mixed things about the endings.

Hopefully one of these is new to you, or brings you some measure of enjoyment. I know the struggle of trying to find good Harry/Tonks all too well.

  "That date was the reason I was shocked to death when I saw that troll. Of course my hero Harry then came to save me and defeat the big bad troll." Tonks ended dramatically, placing a sloppy kiss on Harry's red cheek. He would die before he admitted this to her, but when she said that, he felt rather proud of himself.
