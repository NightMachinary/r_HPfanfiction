Hey guys. I am looking for some storys where the malfoy family is good or at least neutral.

they could have been like that all the time or they change after the first wizarding war or it could be true that lucius was under the imperius.

if the story is still harry-centric and he interacts woth them often (e. g. draco and harry in the same house) would be nice

thanks in advance and sorry for my broken english ^{^}

***** Indeed. And yet I can count on one hand the amount of times I saw it recommended here. I hope the author will release the final book soon.

****** That's my only complaint, honestly. I wish we had the final book. Still, incredible series, and shockingly well edited for a fic.

  When a more studious Harry Potter entered Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming. A Ravenclaw Harry story. Warning: child abuse, character bashing, and pureblood society.

  After a summer spent attending Quidditch World Cup games and tutoring sessions, Harry returns to Hogwarts for his fourth year of schooling with plans to study hard, have fun, play Quidditch and become an animagus. Too bad there's a Tournament that gets in the way. The fourth (and final) part in my series, 'Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven'.

** /Harry's Cousins/ starts with the Malfoys acting like their canon selves, but Harry's presence forces them to reevaluate their beliefs. None of their actions from the war are swept under the rug either, which I appreciate. They're not necessarily good, but they do make an honest effort on Harry's part to change.
