I'm curious what headcanons are out there for the next generation. There's so little known about them. It kind of reminds me of how Blaise Zabini characterizations (and gender) were all over the place until HBP. For me:

James Sirius thinks George's shop is the most amazing thing ever. He's there as often as he can and, when he gets a bit older, he starts helping out during the summers. The teachers at Hogwarts don't appreciate his enthusiasm. Ginny just makes him promise not to interrupt classes. He agrees and pretty much abides by it because, honestly, he's a bit scared of her and knows she will stick a cockroach cluster in his food.

Albus Severus makes his anti-Slytherin feelings clear despite his dad's reassurance. The sorting hat puts him in Gryffindor. He's not any good at Quidditch and is only average in DADA. His best subject is potions. He's the one who has the hardest time being the son of famous Harry Potter.

Lily Luna is a complete daddy's girl. When she's the only Potter still not in school, she gets her parents to tell her tons of Hogwarts stories. Harry shares with her his revised opinion of Slytherin students. This takes with her like it didn't with Albus. Lily becomes the Slytherin in the family and will laugh in the face of anyone who suggests her dad isn't proud of her.

Edited cause I just formed my head-canon for Hugo: he's the normal boy who struggles with being normal among people who always stick out. He's like Ron basically. His sister has the big brains. His cousins all have their niche. Even at the sorting, Lily is the confident family sorted into Slytherin and the family's so focused on that his sorting is barely acknowledged. He acts out in big ways while he's in his mid-teens. Gryffindor.

Rose is kind of the model child. She's smart and typically kind. She doesn't really have a need to succeed academically, but she still does very well in school. Hermione is confused and frustrated that Rose doesn't want to be involved in government stuff. She wants to be a photographer. Hufflepuff.


** -Rose is just as smart as Hermione but has the humor and reckless side of Ron

-Albus has middle child syndrome and feels like he doesn't quite fit in with his large extended family

-James is the "cool kid" and plays up who his dad is instead of getting embarrassed by it like Albus

-Lily is just as fierce as her mother once she gets to hogwarts, and also has a mischievous streak

-Scorpius Malfoy turns out like we all wanted Draco to in terms of rejecting the old pureblood nonsense, by either hating his father or emulating the changes he's made, I could take either

-for some reason I never think about Hugo, he's just there

*** You're not the only one who doesn't think about Hugo. I forget he exists sometimes. I thinks it's the epilogue. We learn something about all the trio's kids except for Hugo. Rose has her mother's brains. James is the dramatic one who likes a laugh. Albus is quiet and insecure about his future. Lily clutched Harry's arm and cried about Hogwarts, mirroring Ginny in PS. Scorpius has the distinction of being the only Malfoy kid.

But Hugo? All we know is that he talks to Lily and they both laugh at Ron's jokes.

** I could talk endlessly about mine and... I accidentally just did:

- Fred Weasley II became one of my my favorite next gen characters after spending two years of being the most frustrating PoV to write. I write him as a straight-laced adrenaline junkie--the stuffy but incredibly competent point man for your Hogwarts heists. Self-conscious about his coolness and comes off as a dork because he's surrounded by his family at school who totally know better. Wishes he were more than a sidekick but is only held back by himself.
- Albus is a simultaneously naive and wise Hufflepuff (I might just love contradictions in my characterizations). If there were a Captain Planet/HP crossover, he'd be the Heart. Steadfast in his beliefs even if they sound super cheesy to everyone else. Can literally talk to Quidditch equipment. Trains under Charlie to become a dragon keeper.
- Rose, for some reason, I think of her as a screaming harpy that doesn't chill until her twenties. Carries a lot of imagined pressure around.
- Lucy is an Slytherpuff art student. My friend writes [[http://hpedit.tumblr.com/post/107542892621/in-the-opinion-of-most-a-slytherin-hufflepuff][my fav version of her]].
- Scorpius is a budding entrepreneur, because one version of my Draco became a businessman postwar. He's kind of lame and has terrible fashion sense because he's rich and he can. He earnestly Believes In People but is an asshole about it, because he wasn't socialized very well (he was largely raised by his favorite house elf). Loves his father but they don't see eye to eye at all about the future of the wizarding world. [[http://hpedit.tumblr.com/post/124683392090/part-i-the-dreaming-cynic-part-ii-the-cynical][A dreaming cynic]] (ah, the contradictions again).
- Might as well introduce [[http://hpedit.tumblr.com/tagged/beatrice-chang][Beatrice]]: Cho married a muggle after the war, and I imagine him as a science researcher who left her after the pressure to keep the magical world secret became too much for him. One of their daughters Bea has an interest in her father's field and magic at a young age and probably a genius IQ. Grows up to be an eccentric inventor who tries to find ways to get the Wizarding World up to speed with the Muggle world. Nearly breaks Hogwarts.

I write a few next gens, but these are all from a story of mine that I consider my "headcanon" next gen.

** Oh gosh I have tons :) More so with Lily and Hugo because I prefer to write about them more than Rose/Albus/Scorpius.

- Lily Luna Potter - She takes after Ginny in appearance, short, red-haired, brown eyes and lots of freckles. She had the choice between Gryffindor/Slytherin and chose Gryffindor, although that was more because a couple of her friends were sorted there before her. She loves Quidditch, where she plays Keeper and eventually becomes Captain. She's cheeky and more than a bit reckless.

- Hugo Arthur Weasley - He's that bored genius child who isn't challenged in school and devotes his time and energy into getting into mischief. He manages to get by with good grades with minimal work, frustrating Hermione to no ends because she knows he's wasting his potential. I see him being a combination of Hermione and Ron in terms of looks. He's tall, blue-eyed and red-headed, his hair is very curly. He hates flying and loves wizarding rock. Thinks himself witty, although he can be offensive at times.

- Colin Thomas Longbottom - an OC, but he's in my next-gen Headcanon so it felt wrong not to include him. He's the eldest Longbottom child and has a brother and two fraternal twin sisters. He's the quieter and more responsible member of the Lily/Hugo/Colin dynamic. He's easily embarrassed, especially by his 'dorky' father who teaches at Hogwarts. Not the greatest at communication, especially when it comes to girls. He's outdoorsy and likes Herbology and Care of Magical Creatures, along with actives like hiking, swimming, camping.

- James Sirius Potter - James is more a blend of both parents. He's got messy, reddish-brown hair. Sorted into Gryffindor. He's the wild child and there were a few rough years n his late teens / early twenties where Harry and Ginny didn't approve of his choices or friends.

I tend to stay away from Rose/Scorpius/Albus just because they're written a lot and people have pretty firm views on them. I tend to think they're not that close. Rose is a Ravenclaw and has her own friends. Albus and Scorpius are Slytherins and roommates, but not best friends.

*** Same about the main characters' kids! I really veer away from stories where they're a trio or they're the primary focus. I feel like fanon makes the Potter-Weasleys... sickeningly functional? Like everyone gets along with each other and are perfect easy-going kids. I like it when family is awkward or just plain doesn't get along, or maybe they don't even know each other all that well. For me, Rose/Scorpius/Albus are split into Ravenclaw/Slytherin/Hufflepuff and annoy the heck out of each other.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** -James Sirius best friends with his cousin Fred II and become the greatest Hogwarts pranksters since Fred and George. Both in Gryffindor. James end up being Gryffindor's Seeker. Prejudice of Slytherin despite what his father has taught him (has trouble accepting his baby sister being sorted Slytherin.

-Albus becomes best friend with Scorpius (their fathers would love that (; ) Either Gryffindor or Slytherin as long as they end up friends. Plays Chaser on his House team. Struggles with having such a strong resemblance to his father, doesn't like all the attention he gets.

-Scorpius being nothing like his father (besides in looks) was when he was in school. Maybe a tad prejudice against Gryffindor's just because of how some of them treat him due to his families mistakes regarding the War. Again best friends with Albus. I imagine him and Lily Luna eventually falling for each other (repeat of falling for the best friends little sister) I think it would be cute. His father isn't exactly pleased about their relationship at first but comes around quicker than expected, his mother loves Lily.

-Very ambitious, as the youngest Lily Luna wants to stand out from her family (who are primarily in Gryffindor) she ends up in Slytherin and is happy about it, except James has trouble accepting her as a Slytherin. A bit rebellious. Ends up being a star Quidditch player (Seeker) gets on the team her first year. Brilliant at potions. Ends up with Scorpius. (Some of her extended family has trouble accepting that though)

-Rose is a daddy's girl but just like her mother when it comes to school. Not a big fan of Scorpius because of all the things Ron's told her about his family (Ron never could let his hatred for Draco go, Harry did although they'll never be best friends) Rose used to be closest with her cousin Albus but when he and Scorpius became such good friends they drifted apart.

-Hugo is just like Ron, feels like he's not good at anything compared to all his cousins. Him and Lily are best friends. ( I don't really have much for Hugo)

-Don't really have anything for the other cousins Sorry this was so long

** The Potters, the Malfoys, the Weasleys and the Parkinsons reconcile over shared drinks following a rather nasty dispute between both sets of Quidditch fanatics.

Pansy Parkinson and Harry Potter faced off against Draco Malfoy and Ron Weasley in an impromptu hexing brawl that set Chudley Stadium on fire, After the arrests, trial and subsequent acquittal of all parties involved in exchange for footing the repair & therapy bills, both Gryffindors and Slytherins started a political alliance that would live on in infamy-thanks, in large part, to the number of screaming matches the allies engaged in when they thought nobody was nearby.
