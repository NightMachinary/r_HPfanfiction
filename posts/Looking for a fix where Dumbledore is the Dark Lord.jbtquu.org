:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this one a few years ago, but it is most likely much older. I don't remember much about this fic other than Dumbledore's death. It turns out that he is the “Dark Lord” in the prophecy who Harry defeats. He is imprisoned in Azkaban, and is hateful of Harry. So he cuts/tears out Daily Prophet articles about Harry, and licks the back to stick them to a wall. Dumbledore eventually does from poisoning from ingesting too much ink(there was probably something harmful in the newspaper ink), and is this “defeated” by Harry.


** That's the epilogue of linkffn(Harry Crow by RobSt).

  What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.
