I don't know why, but I have such a guilty pleasure for fanfics where Harry has different parents. Due to this I have decided to put together a list for other like-minded fans out there. Just to warn you all, most of these have unfortunately been abandoned pretty early into the story.

If there are any that I've missed then feel free to post them in the comments, though if there are any that I missed then there is a chance that it was due to them being slash, which I'm not a fan of.

** Thanks for the resource! I guess you deliberately avoided Severitus given how common it is anyway. Also, I couldn't help but notice...

*** From this list, only 'Harry Riddle' and 'The Veiled Truth' are completed.

'Riddle's Son' was updated last August.

'How Like Hatred' isn't completed, but the author does this thing where they write out and post a whole 'arc' so to speak, so you aren't left with cliffhangers and get a mostly satisfying experience.

'the parseltwins' is regularly updated, last updated two days ago.

'enigma' was last updated in December and seems to get regular long updates.

*** Ah yeah, crossovers are another thing I'm not really a fan off. The three main things I dislike in HP fanfics are crossovers, slash, and fem!Harry.

**** Crossovers are nice if done properly, and it makes sense in context.

Like, say, A Harry Potter/Myst (Uru) crossover, where Magical Earth is actually on another dimension and one of the students is related to the same Stranger in the first four Myst games.

It's unfinished at an awful spot, but it certainly fits the prompt. Lily and James use a fertility ritual to conceive Harry, and run into a Death Eater revel on accident. It goes a bit pear-shaped.
