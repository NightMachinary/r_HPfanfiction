It's been a long time since I've read it. I'm relatively sure I read it on AO3, though it could have also been FFN.

Basically, what the title says. Harry admits it directly to Crouch-Moody at one point, who points a wand at him, but then Harry admits that he's totally okay with it, and implies that he's leaning towards Voldemort, or at least hearing his opinion on things, or something like that. Before that, Crouch was intent on dragging Harry on over to the Dark Lord's POV. Not quite sure if it involved them corresponding beforehand.

Your aid is greatly appreciated.

No wand pointing, but everything else fits.
