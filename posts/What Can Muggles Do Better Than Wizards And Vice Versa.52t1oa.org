I caught a cold while at work, and I thought that a simple pepper up potion would instantly cure me. Then I thought about this question.

Now there were two things that came to mind that muggles can do better than wizards: war/killing and mental healthcare. Non magicals got it down to an art form, and we have a relatively effective mental healthcare system in place.

Wizards got us beat in physical healthcare, transportation, and communication, especially if those mirrors that the Mauraders mass produced them.

What are some things that one side can do that the other can do better?

** Muggles lead in:

Communication: especially instant text, video, and voice

Computation: wizards need to adopt computers for their arithmancy

Distribution: provide products and services to millions, if not billions of individuals fast and reliably; wizards don't have an Internet to spread their information quickly.

Manufacturing processes: where are the temperature and environmental controls for their potion production?

Mass Production: Gemino curse is cool, but try casting it 100 million times (number of iPhones sold in a quarter)

Organization: ruling ten thousand people is hard, but how about ruling a billion? Or what about running a business with 4 million employees, or command a military of 10 million soldiers?

Space technologies: I don't know what wizards teach in astronomy, but it seems they didn't go beyond 19th century muggle astronomy, which is to say hopelessly outdated.

The rate of muggle tech advance is rapid, how about wizards? Thousands years old stuffs (Hallows) were still cool, but you want to compete with 100 years old Muggle stuffs? Tough luck.

At current pace, how would Muggle technologies look like in 20 years, or 50 years?

**** I don't think cars are necessarily the best way of showing "how far we've come". Electric vehicles have been a thing for a long long time, the first commercial product went on sale in 1896.

Self-driving vehicles have been an idea since the 1930s, I believe it was the New York World's Fair, which would have been in 1939. Granted, its implementation took a lot longer. The pioneer of the field, Ernst Dickmanns, had converted a van into a self-driving vehicle (he called it VaMoRs), which made its first successful test drive in 1986. Ten years later he had a pair of Mercedes limousines that drove through inner-city traffic in Paris.

In other words: even in the time Harry Potter is set, non-magicals were more than capable of what must have seemed like miraculous feats. The only reasons this didn't happen sooner was the lack of commercial interest. You already mentioned the EV1, which was a casualty of the powerful oil lobby, but there are many more products that never even made it to the market. In this, we're pretty close to the protectionism shown in the wizarding economy, where flying carpets are banned in a country that is home to at least one influential and powerful broom company like Nimbus.

If there's one area in which wizards are totally out-classed by non-magicals, it is the industry. I'm not speaking of singular parts, like the never-ending development efforts or the infrastructure which allows mass-production at an unbelievable scale, but everything together. Ever since the industrial revolution gave humanity a kick in the behind, we haven't been sitting still for even a minute. The industrial apparatus humanity has built in the past two hundred and fifty years is something the wizarding world will never be able to match. Its endless creativity is inherent in the structure, which allows humans to advance at a never slowing pace.

I believe, that everything a non-magical can create with science, a wizard can do better (either cheaper in materials, faster in production or more convenient to use). You only need to look at wizarding communication. They basically have a device like a smartphone that's capable of FaceChat and those communication mirrors were available in the 1970s if not earlier. Rowling had this idea years before the first mobile phone with a built-in camera was even on the market and those devices were only capable of photographs anyway.

**** Wolfsbane might be a double edged sword here as it speaks of wizards tendency to innovate within established methodology rather than eschewing it for a better solution.

While I had the idea independently, I have since seen it pop up in a few fics - there is no discernible reason for the ongoing existence of widespread lycanthropy nor a likely scenario for the demonization/classicism that surrounds werewolves.

By combining the concept of wildlife preserves and portkey, along with the charms work on the ceiling of the great hall at Hogwarts and a big perimeter wall, all of which should be extraordinarily simple, and well established if not a thousand years old- there should be no werewolves in Britain except by choice, or sad accident, at the time of Harry Potter. Given the timeframes of wizarding history, this effort could locally quell the werewolf population where ever implemented. As lycanthropy appears to be non-hereditary the now safe regions would become home to larger populations.

Over the course of a century, there should be few if any werewolves and over the course of several there should be almost none at all.

Humans, whether wizard or muggle, should have realized this and acted accordingly. It can work for large numbers of the afflicted, it requires little effort to test, it can be expanded with transportation, and it provides security regardless of economic, educational, or access issues.

After this dubious epiphany, I came to the conclusion that the treatment of werewolves in HP is a bit weak. If there was a natural explanation, spontaneous generation, a genetic component, or wizards could get it from actual wolves, then it would make more sense. Wolfsbane seems like a poor bandaid.

TLDR: Not sure if this is a point of wizard/muggle divergence or just a bit of a snipe at a poorly developed facet of HP. YMMV.

And by the same logic no-one would have taken wolfsbane because they would have assumed it was just a poison..

The werewolves themselves would eventually have devised this protective measure. It's just a poorly thought out part of HP. Imo.

***** There is also the bit where Remus doesn't transform until the moon comes out from behind a cloud. That just implies he could hide in a windowless room all night. Maybe the moon would make him irritable and have a rough night, but no transforming.

Your idea is also great. I think dunuelos also had a plot bunny about Hermione giving various credible ideas to try and he was dumbfounded at how simple some were.

I fully agree though that werewolves in Canon were not given full consideration. There are simple things to try and the whole affliction thus becomes trivial.

****** Thanks! If werewolves could sleep in coffins, to avoid the change, the world would seem a different place:)

It would be interesting to read a fic that really delved into why lycanthropy exists, given this sort of perspective for "out-treatment".

Some kind of cult within the were-community or foreign magical bioterrorism are what spring to mind, given a lack of hereditary origin. I suppose that as Teddy's mother wasn't a werewolf it's possible that a union between 2 infected will produce infected offspring, but that isn't ever explicitly stated and would be important knowledge from an epidemiology standpoint.

It was also clear from our interactions with Remus that he didn't want to change and that the process was draining. There was no contrary psychological reasons attributed to the time pretransformation, like an urge to not chain oneself or enter into a controlled environment.

I guess a takeaway is that repurposing a mythology or mythologies for a new work doesn't mean that they will perfectly fit into one's own world.

There again HP was a cultural phenomenon and amazing, so it can't have been that jarring for its target audience. I didn't realize it until years later. As a grown person.

I'll be sure to check out Dunelos.

** I'd to see Magicals and Muggles working together. As things stand right now, we face multiple extinction-level threats, they range anything from nature based (such as giant asteroids, super volcanoes, and killer viruses) to man made (nuclear weapons, deficient super AI, environmental destruction). Many visionaries and scientists, including Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, see space colonization as the only way to avoid such a fate.

Magic, as described in the HP world, seems to allow direct access to fundamental physical forces through a person's will power. If combined with Muggle technologies, would make even interstellar space colonization magnitudes easier. For example:

- Apparition, Port Key, and Floo Travel are basically short distance worm holes through space time. Port Keys could potentially be used to build space stations easily and quickly; Apparitions allow easy transport of astronauts to and from Low Planetary Orbits; Floo Travel connects two points of heat sources, so one fanfic introduces the concept of 'Floo Jump' (as opposed to Hyperspace Jump) to allow interstellar travel using another star as target heat source.

- Broomsticks and Flying Carpets are basically gravity manipulation devices, which could be used to generate Earth-like gravity in various environs, crucial for the health of human beings.

- Conjuration, duplication (Gemino curse) of materials are examples of creating matters temporarily from quantum foam(?), thus using far less energy as required by the Energy Matter Equivalence (E=MC^{2).} This kind of magic would render material scarcity on new colonies a non issue.

- Space extension charm create pocket dimensions in our current universe. It's dreadfully useful, and you can use your imagination to think about all the possibilities.

** As cool as magic is, there isn't a lot it does thats practical that we haven't recreated with technology thats not equal to superior. Of course I could go the asshole route and say sufficiently advanced technology is just magic by another name, but no one likes that guy.

Telecommunications: While wizards likely developed "Instant" communication first, the mirror is limited to one other person. My phone can call literally anyone else on the planet with a phone or computer that has a skype number. +1 for muggles

Information Accessibility: Muggles again, the internet vs a world where book research is still the primary method of learning. Even just library vs library it seems like muggles have a more efficient system. Hail to Dewey. +1 for muggles

Education: Muggles. As is a commonly noted theme, wizard kind doesn't seem to have much in the way of secondary education, nor do they seem to teach fundamental skills. Maybe magic means learning about biology isn't needed, but you're still gonna need multiplication in your life. + 1*1 for muggles

Healthcare: Toss up. Magical healing is definitely more advanced, but they have it seems no real form of mental health care. Harry legit got left alone at age 12 after fighting a giant monster. Let alone the whole killing Quirrell thing.(which is a grey area I know) +.5 to magicals because they can straight regrow bones, and apparently create amazing prosthetics.

Government: Do I even need to explain why muggles are superior? I can just say Umbridge and Fudge right? +1 to muggles

Warfare: Muggles. Wizards are perhaps more creative. But we're far better at killing. We had to be since there were so many more of us. +0 because no one gets points for murder.

Economics: Hard to say, but based on the small size of their businesses and the apparently hoarding nature of wizards I'm gonna say the global muggle economy is superior in the fields of supply, demand and overall growth. However wizards also get a point because their market is likely significantly more stable than ours. +0 to all.

Social Welfare: Don't care.

Scientific/Magical advances: Hard to say. But I'm guessing Muggles again. Look at a fifty year overview. How has our scientific understanding evolved vs how the magical world's has evolved. While we don't get a play by play of the magical world, if you look at how they use magic and apply it, things haven't changed much. Whereas fifty years for muggles...well. You see my point. +1 for muggles.

The tally? Definitely for the muggles.

Now on the micro level is where the magicals win in my opinion.

** Muggles do a lot of things better than Wizards in the generation of the canon HP-books. Things like innovation, democracy, internet, or even war. The thing though is, wizards could do the same. I can see Muggleborns improving the wizarding society after Voldemorts fall. Wizards can improve all kind of electronics with magic, like Arthur enchanted the car. A smartphone without power, but run by magic would be great. While wizards can adapt to muggle innovation, muggles unfortunately can't do vice versa. They can't benefit from Apparition, household charms, and some very cool spells like disillusionment. Although potions would be fine I guess. There is a theory used in a lot of fics, that potions only work on people with a magical core though.

** Well, I don't think wizards have us beat with physical transportation. I mean, Muggles have gone to space and landed on the moon. Apparition and Portkeys don't seem capable of taking them that far, not that I think any Wizards have tried.

Physical healthcare is a debatable one. It's largely dependent on the differences between Muggle and Wizarding physique. I've read fics where Wizards rarely get cancer and therefore, don't have any treatment for it. So, the occasional Wizard that gets cancer has to resort to Muggle treatment. Of course, if we're only discussing based on what is in canon, then yes, they have us beat at physical healthcare.

Communication is also another iffy one. Personally, I'd rather not talk to someone while kneeling with my head in the fireplace. It sounds horrible uncomfortable for long conversations, although I suppose with instantaneous transportation, long conversations are usually done face-to-face. But still, if Apparition doesn't work (maybe you're on completely different ends of the world), you're stuck with sore knees and a sore neck.

As for what Muggles can do better... probably physical fitness, to be honest. Wizards don't have PE. Although, it probably really depends on the individual when it comes to fitness. I mean, I absolutely hate PE and am about as fit as a slug...

Also, maybe Maths. They do have Arithmancy, but I don't know how it works. English. Science, in general (chemistry, physics, biology). Geography. Basically, everything they teach in high school that every single Wizarding kid misses out on in Hogwarts.

Let's not forget the Internet. I bet you Wizards don't even have decent Internet. Probably don't even know what Internet is, apart from the Muggleborns.

** There is literally nothing muggles do better than wizards. I think people forget that nothing prevents wizards from using or understanding technology and adopting it if they wanted. They did so with the Wizarding Wireless, the Hogwarts Express, and the Knight Bus, so if muggles ever made something practical then they could easily copy it However magic cannot be used by muggles. Wizards can use muggle technology as much or as little as they want and still get to use magic themselves, with most of said magic surpassing muggle technology significantly. The only thing preventing wizards from using technology more often is a lack of interest in muggle technology. Any wizard familiar with muggle technology (e.g. muggleborns, some half-bloods, those doing Muggle Studies, etc) would be able to use it just as well as the average muggle could.

Medically, wizards are vastly superior (the most clear example being Skele-grow) and JKR confirmed they can cure any muggle illnesses or diseases (including the likes of cancer) and only have to deal with magical illnesses, which with very few exceptions, are curable by magic too. Even the uncurable magic illnesses (e.g. Lycanthropy) can be treated to an extent (e.g. Wolfsbane Potion). Also, there are the likes of Polyjuice Potion, Veritaserum, and Felix Felicis which muggles cannot recreate. Voldemort's unaided flight itself literally flies in the face of physics. After all, unaided flight is a symbol of one who is beyond humanity and any living thing that can fly is either not human (e.g. birds, insects, etc) or is associated with mythology or divinity (e.g. angels, demons, etc).

Meanwhile, Muggles only have technology and nothing more. Furthermore, muggles not only have to contend with muggle illnesses but if the Statute of Secrecy wasn't being upheld, they would also have to contend with literally every single magical illness as well. The only thing keeping muggles from suffering illnesses tied to the wizarding world is the Statute of Secrecy keeping dangerous creatures and illnesses out of the muggle world.

So you have wizards, who like muggles, are human and are capable of everything that a muggle is capable of, and in addition, have the birthright of magic. Wizards have literally all of the benefits that muggles have, in addition to having magic which can reduce/remove any of the weaknesses that may hinder muggles.

The only thing that muggles do truly better than wizards is wars and their massive death counts, and even then that is down to two reasons: muggles vastly outnumbering wizards so far more muggles die in muggle wars than wizards die in wizarding wars, and secondly, due to ignorance. If Voldemort knew about nuclear weapons and had access to them, he would definitely make use of them, or would hold them over everyone's heads as a looming threat. Alternatively, Voldemort might invent a curse inspired by nuclear weapons (except its radiation would never affect the caster of the curse) so he could basically use them infinitely. Since the wizarding world is vastly smaller, it makes sense that far less people die in wizarding wars than muggles would in muggle wars.

Though if wizards had access to nuclear weapons, or if wizards had ever invented a spell that is even half as strong as a nuclear weapon, then that would certainly be abused by dark wizards. Also, if wizarding population matched the muggle population, I expect more would die in wizarding wars than they ever could in muggle wars. The main reasons that wizarding wars aren't as dark as muggle wars is because there are so few wizards when compared to muggles. If their populations were equal, I think the likes of the Death Eaters could easily kill at least 20 million or more people if they had a comparable membership size as, say, the Nazi Party. If there were like 10 million Death Eaters instead of just the 30-50 total Death Eaters that canon seems to imply, I think they would be able to easily kill 20+ million people at the very minimum. The only things preventing wizarding wars from being as deadly as muggle wars was how few wizards there were, and even fewer who were actually fighting.
