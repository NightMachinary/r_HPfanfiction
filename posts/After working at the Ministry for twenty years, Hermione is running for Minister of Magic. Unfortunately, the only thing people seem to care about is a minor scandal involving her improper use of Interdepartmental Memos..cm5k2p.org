On second thought, this might be too fantastical.

Draco Malfoy was inciting a crowd. He was balding, although hiding it with a terrible comb-over.

  After working at the Ministry for twenty years, Hermione is running for Minister of Magic. Unfortunately, the only thing people seem to care about is a minor scandal involving her improper use of Interdepartmental Memos.

  While Hermione is a capable politician, she has not been able to find the power to get something done that will benefit the people she cares about. She wonders if there is anything she can do to hide this scandal from the public.

  Chapter 1 - An Endearing Secret

  Hermione begins to recall the very last time she and her friends used the E-mail. E-mails were so much better than interdepartmental memos anyways. Who can blame her if she found a slightly more scandalous use for them.

  What did she write to the Minister for Defence about it? It was a stupid idea which she constantly berated herself for. That is why she needed to write a letter to him with a few facts and why she asked the Minister for Defense to use it as an excuse as to why she should not be allowed to continue in ministry.

  It had seemed so clever at the time. Create a scandal involving yourself to silently get out of the ministry. Too bad circumstances changed and now being Minister for Magic was the only way to make a real difference in the world. How could anybody possibly tell that the Ministry only cared about finding someone who could produce magical technology. It is impossible to think about them wanting such a thing when they keep letting the purebloods go unpunished.

  She finished what she had to work on the letter which, after all, should have been done by about 8:40 that night when she was walking the streets of a small town to collect herself mentally, but she forgot. Maybe she should learn multitasking after all. She finished the last of her groceries and put her coat with it on the chair at the kitchen table in preparation to finish off the tea that she had bought from the coffee shop. She hoped to meet Harry and Ron here. Her aunt and uncle in fact, would be there soon as Ginny was returning from her shopping spree. She hoped to meet Harry and Ron here. She could hardly believe it but, as she looked out the window of her apartment door, she noticed this. She noticed that because of bad internet connection she thought the same thing twice. Incredible!! Maybe it wasn't so bad after all. If they could all use Harry Potter related articles, the world would be a little brighter.

** One of the possible directions where “[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130180][James and Me]]” (by Northumbrian) could lead is with something like this in the background (I don't do spoilers, so no more details). Unfortunately, this very nice story has not been finished and given the tracking record of the author I am not holding my breath when it will be finished, if ever.
