So I just recently done reading [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/Fate][Fate]] by the TheTrueSpartan after 43 days. It's quite long yet very well-written story and not finished yet (currently at chapter 120).

So while I'm waiting for the writer to update more chapters, I want to read some other fanfics which is as long and as interesting as this one. I would prefer the kind of fanfics where Snape is Harry's father, or Slytherin Harry or the story is centered towards another character who is not Harry (eg; Draco Malloy is a hero). Please suggest me some long interesting fanfics like the ones I mentioned. Thank you.
