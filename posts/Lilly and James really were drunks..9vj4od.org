The war has hard on the two. Friends were dropping like flies, and they were under pressure from a certain prophecy. They turned to the bottle, and left their son behind them one dark, rainy Halloween night with Sirius Black watching him. They die in a car crash. Voldemort attacks, Sirius Black dies, and Harry somehow survives.

Thus, Harry James Potter ends up on the doorstep of the Dursley's that November morn.
