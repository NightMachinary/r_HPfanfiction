About a month back, I came across an interesting answer on Quora about the difference between sorcery and magic (the former is essentially contract-based magic while the latter is generic but can refer to one's own magic). It helped me to make clear the distinction between the two in a story I'm doing where both exist.

But then I wondered. Are there any decent crossovers with two different magic systems without one being the better of the two? Like HP magic in canon has limitations against using it against very large objects, distant things and for long periods of time, but conversely has an incredible variety of effects (maybe infinite), from useful to bizarre and everything in between. So maybe a story could balance that against a magic system that has a much more limited and doesn't have that level of variety, but has a much greater scale and duration its spells can be cast over.

I'd hate for there to be nothing but examples like this HP/Smallville crossover I read where, despite Harry obviously fitting the requirements to be a /Homo magi/ in DC (namely, being born able to use magic, not simply getting a hankering for the occult), the author made up nonsense just to avoid making any HP characters be powerful and thus useless compared to even John Constantine who wasn't born with magic. (/slight rant)


** linkffn(8096183) is a good fic and both types of magic have their strengths. HP wizards can cast as fast as they speak and don't run out of spells, but Milo's DnD magic can do things theirs can't (casually shattering wands, detailed illusions, flight, summoning monsters, including killing curse proof undead) and he's far more durable than anyone from the HP world

**** It's because milo's rules apply to milo and his stuff and rawlingsverse rules apply to wizards and their stuff. Since the killing curse kills, that's pretty obviously an instant death effect. Turns out those are pretty straight forward to defend against in milo's universe - 4th level Death Ward spell does it. Undead are naturally immune. Sure, the killing curse explodes objects, but skeletons aren't objects (well, skeleton /creatures/ are not objects!).

Milo's universe pretty much no-sells all of the unforgivables. Pain is flavor text, it has no mechanical effect, so it has no effect on Milo. The imperious can be defended against through the first level spell family Protection from <alignment> (doesn't even matter what alignment!), and the Killing Curse is blocked by the 4th level spell.

***** That's sounding like the thing I didn't want though (nixing the benefits of one magic system by making some other system obviously better). But at least in HP canon, Avada kills anything alive (besides a phoenix) and anything else it hits is irreparably damaged. However, I'll still give it a try in hopes that it's only limited to the Unforgivables, as to be fair those are pretty unfair spells.

****** The other system is not obviously better. Milo is limited to spell slots (with some munchkining) and requires a level up to get better -- and has a finite number of them. Plus, under most circumstances, he's limited to 6-second rounds and can only cast one spell per round.

HP Wizards, on the other hand, can cast as fast as they can speak (and even faster, for silent casters), they don't have to wait and move in 6-second increments, and can learn new and better spells and other skills without having to level up.

They both have advantages and disadvantages. Milo's primary advantage is "Out of context problem." It takes a surprisingly long time before anyone but the other kids even understand that he's /not/ an HP Wizard, with everything that implies.

** I'd just like to comment that in the fifth edition of Dungeons and Dragons, a Warlock uses contract based magic, a sorcerer's magic comes from within, and (I believe) a wizard uses techniques to tap into another dimension of energy or something.

Sorry I can't help you find a fic.

*** Interesting. That's the reverse of how "sorcerer" was usually used, i.e. making an agreement with demons, gods and spirits to do magic. That aside, it's ok. I figured this wasn't something that would be easy to find. :/

**** A bit of clarification from [[/u/baniel105][u/baniel105]]'s post

D&D has Sorcerers, Warlocks and Wizards.

A lot of more modern fantasy tropes stem from D&d

As far as D&d lore:

- A wizard is someone who studies arcane books and delves through dusty tomes to /learn/ their magic.

- A sorcerer is someone who is innately possesses their powers, they are /born/ with it and become stronger by honing their existing prowess.

- A warlock is someone who accepts a deal with a magical being referred to as a patron. They /bargain/ for their powers.

As far as your original question; perhaps something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] would interest you. It's a crossover with The Dresden Files, which is a series of fantasy novels focusing on a noir-esque wizard who works as a private investigator, and has elements of all 3 of the archetypes of Wizard Warlock Sorcerer contained in the lore. The Denarian Renegade is regarded as a decent fic overall I believe and you don't require a knowledge of the dresden files to enjoy it.

****** Yeah its a bit of a tricky distinction, a mix of sorcerer and wizard would fit the HP universe I guess.

In the fic I linked at least, the vast majority of the magic users in the universe would be standard HP 'wizards' where as the main character (Harry) is born a wizard, as in canon, and becomes somewhat of a warlock later.

** The factors such as higher upper limit, ease of learning, average user's level, etc. largely even both main systems out (there is also a third, author original magical system, but it barely features).

*Matou Shinji Series:* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse, and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of either. Matou Shinji, the protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him a failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets a letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focuses on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements of both settings with author's original ideas. Features Mahoutokoro, Durmstrang, and original magical school. Ongoing, with currently irregular updates.

*** I was really referring to the typical definition and use of the word "sorcery" in real life not in modern fiction stories and such. The typical definitions that have ancient historical roots are:

#+begin_quote
  the use of power gained from the assistance or control of evil spirits especially for divining

  a type of magic in which spirits, especially evil ones, are used to make things happen
#+end_quote

It's usually in a bargain sort of way (hence "deal with the devil"). For example, Pope Sylvester II was disparaged as being a sorcerer by some aristocrats who claimed he was a sorcerer due to making a deal with a demon named "Meridiana" to use magic. That's why you get things like Dr. Strange (the "Sorcerer Supreme") calling out the names of the deities whose magic he is using ("By the Ruby Rings of Ragadoor!")
