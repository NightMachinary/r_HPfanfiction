** You've broken one of the sacred laws of HP fandom. Luna can only be in a ménage à trois with Harry and Hermione while secretly running the entire Department of Mysteries. How dare you suggest otherwise.

** The Luna in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434/1/Unspeakable-Things][Unspeakable Things]], linkffn(6473434), is a total psycho, but I doubt anyone dares to bully her.

  Formerly Defense for Two. Adopted from Perspicacity with permission. They thought Lockhart was a fraud. They were wrong; he was their guide into a world of danger, adventure, intrigue and other Unspeakable Things.

** I picture this Luna as the kind of Luna that doesn't give a fuck. She calls out thots while draping herself all over Harry because she can. She'd also cold read people at large, revealing their secrets and faults.

*** The cold reading usually bugs me as a literary device. It's less "here's an intuitive character built into the story" and more "insert narrator to deliver truth bomb that can't be economically worked in otherwise"

** Her distracted persona is a deliberate attempt to lose points and discredit the Ravenclaw house because of early rebuffed attempts at friendship. She'll later go on to use her editorial power at the quibbler to passive aggressively ruin the lives and careers of her rivals.
