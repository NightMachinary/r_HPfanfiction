** linkffn(13686510) I'm currently reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13686510/1/The-Dementor-s-Curse][The Dementor's Curse]] It's rated M but so far nothing M has happened, but I think that will come later. I absolutely love fics where Hermione goes back in time to the Marauders era and I felt like this one was different from the ones I've read before. Instead of her trying go back to stop Voldemort, she has an entirely different reason for going back and her goal isn't to change the past, but use information that can help her in her time. So for me that was a different take on time turner fics (I think). I've also read some oneshots by the author and I really like them.

** Reading linkffn(Oblivion by Slide) It's the third in the Stygian trilogy. 1st is Ignite then 2nd is Starfall. Can't really say too much what it's about so I don't give away Starfall. It's rated M because the author just wanted to be careful. If anything it's for violence not smut scenes.

But all her stories are so well written and I'm addicted XD. One of the best written fanfictions I've ever read.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts][The Mind Arts]] by Wu Gang is an excellently written piece of literature in my opinion. Initially, I was always off-put by the summary that was presented, however, taking the plunge due to a recent update - I can not say that I was disappointed. The tone of the story overall leaves an ominous feeling, the treading between good and evil is something I thoroughly enjoyed. If someone has a story that is similar to this, I would thoroughly like to know about it.

** linkao3(The Boys of Crow Hill)

I discovered this while going through a thread for recs where the child characters act like kids and the adult characters act like adults. In order for that to happen, though, Harry needs to have a competent adult he can depend on early in his life, because much of his "taking matters into his own hands instead of asking adults for help" stems from having no one to turn to as a kid.

Enter Remus Lupin, who becomes Harry's teacher prior to Hogwarts. How did this happen? How will this change things?

The premise was good which was why I am still reading it even if the middle chapters became a bit dragging. There were some parts that probably could be condensed to fewer sentences. Anyway, those were solved by skimming through paragraphs. I'm almost at the end, just 2 more chapters to go!

My initial feeling was it was almost like I was reading first Harry Potter book again because I didn't have an angsty, teenage Harry. It made me realize how cute he was as a kid, which was why I fell in love with the original books in the first place.

Later on, it was an intriguing mix of how more adults were acting responsibly but Harry and his friends still having adventures, which I think was done well. Harry never gave the impression of being a rule breaker, things really just seem to happen to him even if the adults were present. (Poor kid.)

I'd recommend this if you're looking for a break from Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor- Hogwarts-etc stories.

*** I'm a few chapters in and I have no idea what's going on but this is really interesting so far. Though I'm confused about what system of government Britain has. Since they fought a civil war over who was King I'm guessing the King isn't just a figurehead like in the real U.K. However Harry also says they are a democracy.

  The Battle of Camlann never happened, thus the legacy of Arthur lives on. The blood of the founders still walk the halls of Hogwarts, while ancient enemies clash to this day. Years later, Harry Potter wakes up a stranger in a strange world. Between over competitive house relations and never ending mysterious plots, he must struggle to find the truth about that fated Halloween. AU

*** is it in progress? it seems to end pretty concisely with the end of the first year. I would have figured the author would start a new fic for the second year.

Either way, best AU i've read in a while, I love what the author did with Voldemort and even with Ron. Most people seem to think of Ron as if his poverty is the main part of his personality. Changing that brilliantly turns my perspective of him on it's head while still being deeply, undeniably, Ron.

So much potential. the world building has only been teased at but what has been teased is riveting. I very much hope the author puts more out.

It's an epistolary fic, which can be great only if well done. It's cute - a little bit of angst, but when the Drarry kicks in you get it only reflected in defensive comments in email, or snarky comments from friends. Also: amazing snarky Pansy, great use of kids, Luna bakes all the things, and Ron calls Hermione ‚ÄúSex Muffin.‚Äù

  Objectively speaking, Hermione Granger knows Britain has a monarchy, just as she knows Prince Draco (the grandson of the King of England) is probably off somewhere living his royal life in total unrelation to hers. Seeing as she isn't delusional, she doesn't really expect to be his friend. She doesn't expect anything that comes after, either. Dramione, modern royalty AU. COMPLETE.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23400634/chapters/60593914#workskin][The Potters and The Weasleys by goodlife23]] Au where Jilly lives, Voldemort is defeated at the end of the first war, Harry isn't their firstborn, he's actually the youngest. All the ages are a bit messed up here so Harry's birthday is a few months after canon and he's in Ginny's year. The Potters and The Weasleys have a century old feud over some goats, never stopped hating each other since then. Until Harry and Ginny meet and become friends. It's only ten chapters so far and they aren't together yet but I am LOVING it. I can't wait until Harry and Ron finally become friends.

** Tittle: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5286116][His Persephone]]

It`s my favourite fic of HP. There're so many reasons why I love it the most over other HP's works:

1. Excellent writing
2. Characters Development: I see such a different behavior (than in books or films). Nevertheless, always according to their personalities and the choices they made make sense.
3. Coherence and Cohesion: The history is fluent, easy to follow. Also, it isn't redundant or childish. Several mature serious topics are treated.\\
4. Originality: It stars with a fairly common premise, but the writer take decisions I've never expected (in the good way) and he lead it to its maximun potential, I think.

Everything I wrote here it's just my personal opinion, you need to read it by yourself to truly understand what I meant.

I like the story well enough. It has interesting premise and fun plots that's very easy to consume in its chapter size. Harry-centric with the other held at arm's length. It doesn't drag but it stumbles when the romance started.

I find some parts in the romance a little (just a smidge) out of nowhere and I'm still on the fence on whether the author purposely written the romance plot in such a way that tried to reflect Harry's own view or it's just awkward. I recommend this!

** linkffn(11269078)

Just finished "To Be a Slytherin" and it was pretty good. It has some flaws but the overall story was captivating enough for me to read all 1.1 million words. Its rare for me to find a long fanfic that I don't get bored with halfway through. I really liked the pacing of the story and the romance. It didn't feel forced. There was a point later on in the story where the OC was a little OP and some bashing but it wasn't too bad.

So far, this was one of the few fanfictions I've read that was the closest to how JKR would've written it and might very well end up as one of my all time favorites. He's got the best portrayal of the Weasley family I've seen to date. I really love that the author kept the Golden Trio together, plus Neville, Luna, and Ginny. A bit of Dumbledore bashing, but nothing too bad. Too bad it's not finished and it looks like it hasn't been updated in awhile. I think the author is still working on it, but I don't know how fast the update will be since he seems to be struggling with some health problems?

(Someone recently claimed that he's passed away, but neither his blog nor his Patreon said anything like that, so I don't know what they based that on.)

IMO it's not so much /bashing/ of Dumbledore, he's still definitely competent and on the side of good, it just recognises that he has character flaws, like always thinking he knows best. Very understandable given his life experience, it just creates tension when Harry has knowledge that Dumbledore doesn't and therefore isn't dancing to his tune. But Dumbledore is never an antagonist.

One night, shortly before his seventeenth birthday, Fawkes appears in his room, and whisks him away to a hidden stronghold. There, our hero meets the spirit of Godric Gryffindor, who takes Harry as his apprentice. Harry/Multi. Powerful, not godlike. Intelligent Harry. Ch 2 is NOT missing.

** Lmao I recently got into Tomione, and just finished the best fic I've ever read: Unsphere the Stars by cocoartist, Rated M. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7728303/1/unsphere-the-stars]] The author has created a magical world far beyond the one already established by JKR and the plot, the dialogue, the world-building, the depth of the characters, the poetry of the writing itself is unlike any I've ever read in a fanfiction. The allure of darkness is what I really like about the pairing of Tom/Hermione.

** New story:

The Secret War

by njcov

Lucius tasks Draco with a special mission: "You will seduce the Granger girl. I don't care how you do it, I don't care how long it takes. Tell her you renounce your family, tell her you want no part in the Dark Lord's plan...tell her you need her help. You will make her love you Draco. You will win her trust, and then she will lead us to Potter.‚Äù

** What haven't I been reading?\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1049966/chapters/2100285][Azoth]] but I finished recently. This was a reread.\\
Again, there are no words for this fic. I love Snape. Are there any good Portrait! Snape fics? Preferably drarry since I can't make myself read any other ship. Haphne is tolerable if done well but I really just can't get /into/ it. The story, I mean.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378][Running On Air]] I really need to stop. Guess when I read this? Today! Well yesterday, technically, since it's 3:21am. This was also a reread.\\
There are no words for how beautiful this fic is. Just...it's a must read for anyone. Wether you like drarry or not, it's a must. They don't even focus on the relationship. It's just...did I mention it's beautiful?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1227880/chapters/2516563?view_adult=true][All Our Secrets Laid Bare]] again, recently finished. I go through these like ice cream. Again, a reread.\\
This was angsty but not in the ‚ÄòDraco is dead/dying/missing' angsty, the ‚ÄòI'm hiding something from you and it's eating me up inside because I'm an idiot in love'

I do wish they'd focused more on Draco's supposed ‚Äòhomophobia' I feel like they glossed over that too much, deeming fit to move on to other plot points.\\
There's definitely quite a bit of sex in this fic, but the scene with Ron and knocking is hilarious although I personally always skip it because I get really strong second hand embarrassment.

THESE NEXT FIVE WERE NEW\\
[[http://cinq.hdhols.com/fortaradiane.html][And I'll Tell You No Lies]] literally just finished this not even ten minutes ago\\
This was funny and cute and oh my god the way the cake out was hilarious and just...have I mentioned these two are fucking idiots? Right out of their minds, these two are.

*/don't read these below unless your okay with crying your fucking eyes out/*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2794931/chapters/6273257?show_comments=true&view_full_work=false#comment_371972679][Third Drawer Down]] again, I read this today.\\
Blood hell. Draco is so sad, and the ending is definitely breaking my heart even now.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5220077/chapters/12036527?show_comments=true&view_full_work=false#comment_371969937][Yours, Draco]] THIS TOO WAS READ TODAY\\
Don't even fuck with me on this. I don't know if TNTFH is sadder or Y,D is but it's a close fucking call. I literally spent about twenty minutes yelling at Harry was crying about Draco.

[[https://oldenuf2nb.livejournal.com/64085.html][Vengeance Is Mine]] again, read this today.\\
Draco is such a bad ass mother fucker its not even funny. Ron is just...I love the way they get on ‚Äòfor harry'.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879818/chapters/1692632?show_comments=true&view_full_work=false#comment_371959497][The Next Twenty Four Hours]] again, I read this today. I‚Äòm on a MCD streak. Don't stop me now, fuckers.\\
Please don't ask me to relive this. It's great and hauntingly beautiful in its sadness and gives me a sense of nostalgia (not as much as ROA ‚ÄòRemember when we were eleven? Let's go back to that'). I don't regret reading this, and neither will you. Though you will cry, I guarantee that. I never cry for fics, not unless they /really/ move me. I cried for [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16390034/chapters/38364101][Nero Su Bianco]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11796285][Waiting By An Open Door]] but how can you not? They're perfectly perfect and /god/ i wish I could just spew ever fic I've ever read and rant about them but these are definitely tops and most recent. I have an obsessive reading ability and can finish over 100k words in about a day, depending on how into the story I am. I usually chalk it down to ADHD putting me in hyper focus.

  September 1997. Hogwarts is under the regime of Voldemort and the Carrows. Finding himself alienated by both his friends and his supposed enemies, Draco puts quill to parchment, and writes letters. He addresses them to the only person he can think of, as Hogwarts rapidly falls into chaos and ruin: Harry Potter. He goes to great lengths to ensure the letters are never discovered, and he's pretty certain he's done a great job.Until the day of his trial.PodFic available!

Time travel fic by Worfe called Timely Errors. I started it yesterday and I'm almost finished! I personally really enjoy complete, novel length fics because though they take longer to finish, they have a much stronger plot. Timely Errors was definitely worth it. The balance between Harry's bigger power and his struggles is perfect. I'd recommend it to anyone who's never tried a time travel fic :)

It has its issues but it's my guilty pleasure with all the lordly stuff. There is bashing and some OOC, some of it is decently explained other parts are very well written and reasoned. So I'd recommend reading it if you like Haphne or lordly stuff.
