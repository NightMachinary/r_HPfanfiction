I just cant help but imagine a Harry who reacts to creatures like hagrid does but with dog/wolves. I just wished for a dog/wolf centric HP fic.

My original idea: When baby Harry was left on the door step he wished for a familiar comfort, he wished for mom, his dad, padfoot and Moony. Two are gone, two are far away but magic did call for something familiar, for a dog and Wolf is permanently ingraned as family for baby Harry. a Gelert found him and kept it warm and nursed the poor baby all night. Few years later, a church grim of the potters finally tracked him and stayed with him. Marge begrudgingly liked him since ripper liked him and has dogs too. When a Death eater found him on the way home from school, a stray hellhound attacked him. Fluffy adored him. So when a seemingly starved and smart grim like dog appeared, he just shrugged and took care of it. On the fateful full moon of his third year,He had stared into a werewolf and shouted "No! down Moony, bad dog!" he smacked it with a news paper. Much to everyone's amazement, the were's ears drooped and hunched down, it whined like a sulking dog that peed in the carpet. It came to a point where no one bats an eye to see Fenris God of wolves hanging around harry's backyard.


** It's a nice idea I've read something similar in the PJO fandom but havent seen anything like that here. Just in case you wanna read that here's the link:

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
