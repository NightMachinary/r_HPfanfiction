** I enjoy the idea that Veela are the female descendents of Helen of Troy, with the power diluting in each successive generation. In this concept, there would be no "full Veela" - the only full Veela would have been Helen.

It doesn't really fit with the Slavic origin of the mythology, but it's a fun idea for fanfic.

** How does Zeus function in this?

The Greek Gods weren't so much gods as we understand them today (mainly through christianity), they were essentially humans with superpowers and massive egoes. So perhaps he was an entity, a god, but a mortal one nonetheless. He operated on the same plane as humans do, but he was super-powered and could do many of the things human wizards can today.

Perhaps he was more of a manifestation of the combined might of human belief, which shaped his character?

*** Zeus was a very skilled wizard with a swan animagus, very arrogant in his belief that he was the best so he was challanged to seduce the most beautiful woman in the city in his animal form. Magic has a strange reaction to a half wizard half bird impregnating a beautiful woman

** linkffn(5490079) had a rather unique origin for veela and an interesting take on religion.

If you are an easily offended Christian please avoid.

** Do you mean introducing Zeus and family into the world of Harry Potter or inserting only the transformation into a swan? So an animagus transformed into a swan that he procreated with a woman?

*** My Headcanon is that the greek gods were wizards, but not in the sense that there would have been one powerful wizards who was worshiped as Zeus , but rater that there were multiple wizards over longer periods of time who muggles ended up interpreting as a single god. This fits nicely with how. Greeks often absorbed foreign mythologies and tried to fit the various gods into their own.

Amongst the wizard that were the origin of Zeus would be various animagi like one that can turn into a swan or another that can turn into a bull.
