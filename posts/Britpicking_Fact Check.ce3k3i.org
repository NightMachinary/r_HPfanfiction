Please let me know if there is a better way of/place for doing this. If Hermione knows The Dursely's name and the town where they live how easy would it be for her to discover their phone number in the summer after first year? Harry gave it to both Hermione and Ron the following summer, but apparently didn't think of it the summer before.


** So we used to get The Phone Book from BT (British Telecoms) through the post each year which would list the phone numbers and addresses of people in your area (I lived in a rural area and think it was a county-wide one, cities may have had their own ones; I imagine the Dursley's would be in a Surry-wide one). Hermione might have been able to get hold of a Surrey copy from her local library in London.

​

There was also Directory Enquiries, which could be reached by calling 192. But I think you needed someone's full address to get their phone number.

​

Plus I suspect the Dursley's would have been ex-directory to avoid being contacted by any pesky double glazing salesmen or /undesirables/. Perhaps nothing a resourceful young witch like Hermione couldn't have worked her way around though?

*** So this made me think, What is the likelihood that Hermione had his full address? It might be weird for us Muggles, but the only letter we actually see addressed is the school one and it does have his full address on it. How possible is it that they exchanged addresses at some point offscreen so they could write?

Or is it a moot point because Hermione didn't have her own Owl?

**** I would say it's very likely that she asked for his address - as a 12 year old I kept a meticulous notebook with all my friends' addresses and phone numbers in, and still have some memorised now (what useless information to retain). Hermione didn't have any friends before Hogwarts, and I think she (like Harry) probably would have been worried about losing those friendships over the long summer break and been eager to keep in touch. In fact, it kind of bothers me that /Harry/ didn't think to ask for her and Ron's addresses/phone numbers.

She definitely had /access/ to an owl because her letters to Harry were among those Dobby had intercepted in the beginning of CoS. Either her parents had bought one so they could easily keep in contact with her while she was at school, or they took trips to Diagon Alley to use the Owl Postal Service there.

But I think it's quite likely that Harry might have suggested that they stick to Owl Post, considering the Dursleys' reactions to him receiving letters in PS. I think even a muggle letter arriving through the letterbox with Harry's name on it would have raised questions/caused an argument. Although that could be an interesting plot point if you're looking to write something about this!

***** Good point my friends and I exchanged phone numbers at the end of the year now that I think about it. And I think you're right about the owl. I think fannon often has her share because she gets Crookshanks so she must not have an owl, but I can see her parents getting one so they can keep in touch with their only daughter.

**** She did send him letters (intercepted by Dobby, but sent nonetheless) so i think she did have an address.

** Hermione not picking up the phone (a payphone in front of the Grimmauld Place, if necessary) is one of the many obvious plotholes in OotP. linkffn(13318258) (unfortunately unfinished) is one of many stories which noticed it.

  "Dumbledore said that we shouldn't write to you so that the owls would not give out your address. I argued that you needed your friends as much as you needed the security, but he dismissed my words. Then I thought that neither he nor the enemy would be able to trace phone calls."

** Other posters have mentioned the phone book. It was the sort of thing that was done as routine back then that today would be slammed as a gross invasion of privacy or something.

Basically it was an alphabetical list of everyone living in a certain area along with the first line and postcode of their address. You could apply to have your number made ex-directory, which stopped it being listed, but there was a small charge so only people like doctors did it so they couldn't be contacted at home by impatient patients.

There was also a version for local businesses called Yellow Pages, because it was printed on yellow paper. That still gets sent round sometimes, but is mainly now done at yell.co.uk instead.

Telephone directories - including out-of-area ones - were always available at local libraries, so if someone wanted to find Harry and knew he lived in Little Whinging, they'd just have to go to the town library, spend 30s flipping through the directory to find Dursley, V and then head to the address.

*** Sounds a lot like the US system. I just wanted to make sure there was a British equivalent. I'd forgotten about other area's books being in the the library though as I only had to look up school friend's numbers as a kid.

**** I thought they were probably similar but I didn't want to assume anything, hence the too-much detail.

And I want to emphasise that I didn't spend my childhood sat at the library reading telephone books. I just happen to know they were there!
