I've uploaded the prologue which is the Origin story of Death and the events of Halloween 1981, sort of in the style of the tale of the three brothers. The rest of the book will be written normally.

Rewrite of the series. Nicolas and Perenelle are more important characters within the series, especially the first and fifth books. Eventual drarry, established relationship by fifth/sixth year but both boys have other relationships before hand. My series also has a better/ fuller/ broader curriculum, more staff and a better portrayal of what life would be like in a British Boarding school where with magic, anything is possible if you've got enough nerve. (Also just a lot more Golden trio friendship moments, like them stealing the penny farthing bike from the muggle studies storage in 6th year and riding around the corridors.)

The first book is called Harry Potter and the Age of Enlightenment. Here's the link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/31287674/chapters/77347973]]

There will be definite uploads twice a week, Fridays and Mondays but for the first couple of chapters I'll be bopping them out over the weekend) I've already plotted out books 1-5. (Book 5 will be in two parts, it's very exciting. It's centres around Harry, time travel and the Flamel's backstory... Hint: the backstory we know is not what happened in the original timeline.)

Anyway, please go check it out? Or at least like bookmark it :) tanka
