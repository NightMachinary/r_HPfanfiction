Proof from canon that Ron is a terrible friend.

1. In Sorcerer's Stone, Ron talks mean about Hermione behind her back and makes her go cry in the bathroom.

2. Ron is an asshole to Hermione in Prisoner of Azkaban despite LITERALLY having NO right to be angry at or upset with her. He meanly shakes bedsheets in her face and yells at her in one of the most public settings of Hogwarts, the Gryffindor Common Room. He freezes her out of the food party in the Gryffindor Common Room after the Gryffindor-Ravenclaw Quidditch match. And he won't even listen to Hagrid when Hagrid gives Ron the correct perspective that Ron should value his friend more than rats. Ron LITERALLY had NO right to be angry at or upset with Hermione but took his own personal problems out on her.

3. Ron is inexcusably jealous of Harry's fame and attention despite knowing that that Harry doesn't like his fame and why. People like Hermione and Ginny understand and respect that Harry doesn't like his fame whereas Ron is a jealous glory hound. Ron never saw Harry as Harry, only ever as the Boy Who Lived. Ron only wanted to be Harry's friend in the first place because he had hoped being friends with the "Boy Who Lived" would bring him some deflected fame. And being overshadowed at home isn't an excuse. Ginny has the same number of siblings as Ron and having one more older sibling actually makes it harder for her to get attention at home than Ron. Yet, Ginny, like Hermione, is never jealous of Harry's fame and attention.

4. Ron BETRAYS Harry in Goblet of Fire after Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire. This was the time that proved that Hermione and not Ron is Harry's true bestie. Hermione's reaction to Harry's name coming out of the Goblet of Fire, especially her immediately believing Harry when he said he hadn't put his name in the Goblet of Fire, is the way any true or loyal friend with any ounce of faith or loyalty would have. After knowing Harry for three years plus, Ron and Hermione should understand that Harry would never have put his own name in the Goblet of Fire. There was no good reason for Ron to believe Harry had put his own name in the Goblet of Fire, yet because of petty jealousy he does and turns against Harry. This was the moment that proved Ron had no true loyalty to Harry and that Hermione was Harry's true BFF. Harry should NOT have forgiven Ron for this obvious betrayal.

5. Ron ABANDONS both Harry and Hermione during the horcrux hunt. Wearing and being influenced by the locket horcrux is NOT an excuse. Harry and Hermione both had to wear it as well. Yet, Ron runs out and abandons his friends when the going gets tough while Hermione stands by Harry all the way. Remember too that Ron was moody here even when he had taken the horcrux off. Abandoning both Harry and Hermione during their darkest days was the ultimate. It was the moment that made Ron 1000% unredeemable. Ron was a fair weather friend who left Harry and Hermione at their darkest time.


** Hermione was literally stalking Harry and Ron in Sorcerer's Stone and eavesdropping on their conversations all the time, before the troll incident. That's what made Ron snap at her, not because he's just a mean kid! If Hermione wasn't sticking her nose in other people's business all the time she wouldn't get people mad at her. It wasn't innocent Hermione and mean Ron: it was not respecting personal space annoying Hermione, and a Ron who finally reached his breaking point. Then she ran off because of that like she was the victim.

** I used to enjoy Ron bashing, but no more, simply because:

The fact that he, as a pureblood who could have laid low, stuck his neck out for Harry and Hermione against overwhelming odds is enough testament to his character.

--------------

And don't give me the vibe about him abandoning his friends. I firmly think it was mostly caused by the Locket Horcrux. *Just minutes after taking that thing off, Ron regretted his decision, but then he ran into a snatcher squad and was held up.* By the time he got free, Harry and Hermione already left and their protections were too good for Ron to find them again.

It was Harry who got that brilliant idea to wear a Horcrux around their necks. It was utterly insane IMO. Why the other two didn't object was beyond me. Harry had as much to blame for Ron leaving as Ron himself, and he seemed to feel partially guilty about that. In the subsequent weeks, he was constantly worrying that Hermione would leave him as well.

So when Ron came back in such a spectacular fashion (saving his life, destroying the Locket), he was more than happy and relieved.

--------------

Furthermore, the movie screenwriter Steve Kloves worked very hard to trash his character and Ginny's, and lots of haters used these scenes to justify their hate:

- In PS, when they fell into the Devil Snare pit, it was Hermione who panicked and Ron who saved the situation. In the movie, they reversed the roles.

- In POA, when Snape accused Hermione of being an annoying 'Know-it All', movie Ron rubbed salt into her wounds by agreeing with Snape. *Book Ron vigorously defended Hermione.*

- In POA, when Sirius threatened the Trio, it was Ron who stood up (despite a broken leg) and defended his friends. In the movie, they again reversed the roles.

- In DH1, check [[https://i.reddituploads.com/4ab32f01f41a435984b104ac204a5fe3?fit=max&h=1536&w=1536&s=31ccdf02a9e0f9be7e2da9fc432430db][this link]] about how badly they messed up Ron's character.

- Here is another [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4xojoh/of_all_the_moments_in_all_the_films_this_is_the/][scene]] that trashed Ron's character. In the Books, Harry hid under his Invisibility Cloak, saw them, but decided not to approach. He met Neville in the Entrance Hall and asked him to kill the Snake. Then in the Courtyard, he found Ginny helping a wounded student, and almost gave up.

I will never consider Movies canon, like 70% of [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] and 80+% on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]]. It's simply another AU fanfic for me. I will also never let fanfics change my perceptions of Book characters, even though I may like or hate them in that particular settings.

--------------

Then there are people who complained that Ron was 'useless'. Well, he hadn't done a lot from Book 4-6, but he accomplished a *lot* in Book 7:

- Stunned Rudy Lestrange, potentially killing him, in the Flight of 7 Potters
- Prevented the other two from saying Voldemort and triggering Taboo
- Saved Harry from the pond
- Destroyed the locket Horcrux
- Disarmed Bellatrix at Malfoy Manor
- Took great care of Hermione in the aftermath
- Came up with the idea of using Basilisk fangs
- Opened CoS with fake parseltongue
- Saved Harry again in RoR
- Brought down Greyback together with Neville

--------------

How many of us can claim to have a friend like him in our lives? He perhaps made *one* major mistake during 7 years, as a 14 years old teenager boy; and he deserved *your* eternal hate?

** Let's just forget that Hermione was the one who criticised and bossed Ron around constantly for seven years, and physically assaulted him twice? Compared to her, complaining about someone to his friend(while not knowing that Hermione was listening) for being bossy and criticising him loudly in class (and embarrassing him), or even leaving the tent because of the influence of a dark mind manipulating artefact (never mind that he regretted it the moment he got out and cooled off without said mind manipulating artefact affecting him), is not nearly as horrible

** 1.A pet-owner primary concern should be their pets for they can't fend for themselves and the pet-owner took on the responsibility of taking care of it by keeping it. Ron is merely a responsible pet-owner in the PoA. 2. Hermione came across as condescending in the Philosopher's Stone when she chided Ron on pronunciation. 3. Ron was a middle child and given that most of his brothers are overachievers, it is natural for Ron to wish not to play second-fiddle and shine on his own. Having said that, whatever Ron did in the GoF although terrible, is forgivable. 4. In the horcrux hunt, Harry couldn't muster enough joy to cast a patronus when he wore the locket and Hermione became more introverted. Ron is not culpable for whatever he did under the locket's influence as another horcrux made his sister open the Chamber of Secrets. 5. Regarding Ron's loyalty, it will do well to remember that he played chess against lethal chesspieces when he was 11, faced his worst fears willingly for his best friend when he was 12 (spiders), dared a supposed mass-murderer to kill him when his leg was broken when he was 13, fought against adult terrorists ( the Death-Eaters) in the Ministry when he was 15 and looted Gringotts ( to get the locket horcrux) and flew on a dragon when he was 17 and last but not the least, fought in the Battle of Hogwarts which ought to disprove any alleged disloyalty that he is said to have. To sum it all, please read the books and forget the films.

**** If my friend's dog killed my cat and refused to apologize for it I would cut her out of my life forever. She wouldn't be a good friend in any case, not apologizing for what HER animal did to mine.

Pets are extremely important to people, no matter the type of animal it is. Even though Scabbers was Peter Pettigrew, Ron didn't know that at the time and Scabbers was still one of his most loved family members. It was unfortunately glossed over in the books.

My cat is worth 10x any of my friends who would refuse to acknowledge their death as their fault after MULTIPLE warnings from me for their animal to stay away from mine, and insist I stay friends with them. That's just toxic.

** Your first point doesn't matter, because he was an 11 year old kid. Of course he's going to make fun of the weird, antisocial smart know-it-all. Especially if they didn't have the best of introductions - and Hermione Granger definitely didn't make the best first impression.

Your second doesn't matter too. You have to remember that at this point he's a 13 years old. Scabbers was one of the few things that were his - furthermore, it was his pet. Sure, it was an old, almost dead rat - but it was /his/ old rat. What did Hermione do? Scoff at him, not listening to any of the things he raised - like "Your CAT ate my RAT". Hermione alternated between two stances in this fight : "cats eat rats" and "my cat didn't eat your rat". Need I remind you who had seniority ? Scabbers, because he was the oldest. Note that Hedwig never ate Scabbers, even through owls, like cats, eat rats. Ron had a genuine reason to be upset - and fucking Perfect Prefect Granger didn't give a fuck, because her cat can't be responsible.

Your third point ? You guessed it. Doesn't matter. Ronald Bilius Weasley never owned anything, except a family. His deepest desire is to be someone great, some*thing* great. Who always seems to be great ? That's right. Harry Potter. Quidditch Hero. Only Child. Savior of the Wizarding World - as of GoF, 3 times. It may have started as "hey, famous Potter boi, let's steal a bit of his fame!" but it genuinely evolved into something great. Proof of concept ? PoA, the Sirius Confrontation. At least, canonwise - as in, bookwise.\\
Ronald Weasley, his leg torn apart, stood up with the little strenght he could muster, and looked at a mass murderer in the eyes, defying him : "if you wanna kill Harry, you'll have to go through me." No hesitation. Obviously terrified, sure - but standing proud, and strong. Ready to die for a friend.\\
He was 14 years old.

Your fourth point, once again, is of no matter. Ronald Weasley and Harry Potter shared a stronger bond than Hermione Granger and Harry Potter. It is Ron who heard Harry whisper in the wind that it would be cool to join the tournament. Ron didn't believe Harry entered because he was a fame-hungry piece of shit - he believed it because Harry told him that if he found a way in, he'd try to get in. He told him this in his face. Of COURSE Ron was going to be hurt - in his Point of View, Harry just lied to him straight to his face! When Ronald finally managed to calm down, and it didn't take long, it was just his ego that stopped him from apologising. And then Harry fought a dragon, and Ron understood - no, he remembered - that life is fickle, especially so if you're Harry - and it would be stupid for one of them to die while angry at each others for no reasons.

Finally, the Horcrux Hunt. Indeed, how despicable that Ron couldn't keep in check a piece of the soul of the most feared boogeyman of magical Britain?\\
Sure, the Granger girl and the Potter brat may have had to wear it, and whenever they did, they were influenced heavily by it. Ron, being the hot-headed adult he was, was just the first one to fight them for whatever he heard. But remember : Harry became paranoid that his best friends were whispering behind his back, about "how useless he was"\\
Hermione was snappy, and - oh wait. That's classic, normal Hermione. Forget it.\\
Anyway. What was the first thing Ron did within 1 minute of getting the Horcrux out of his head ? First, recover his mind. Sadly, he transplanned before he could. Then, he wanted to go back - so he beat up the snatchers, and transplanned back again. And wouldn't you know it, the two other protagonists were gone! Didn't even wait a day to consider he may come back.

But sure, Ron is nothing but a jealous prat. He doesn't deserve Harry's friendship. Harry would have been better off with Neville Longbottom as his sidekick - or better, Daphne Greengrass. Or even better better, no one at all, Hermione was obviously enough.

**** Of course he was weaker than Harry and Hermione at the time!

Have you forgotten about the fact that he had a chunk of his arm ripped off? That blood drenched the side of his body?

He was suffering from anaemia. He was obviously going to be much physically weaker than Harry and Hermione.

He was also worried sick about his family.

He was also more vulnerable in the sense that he had lots of insecurities. He might have buried these insecurities, pushed them away, so he could be there for his friends - but they were still there.

And the Horcrux was able to twist and manipulate them. Ron managed to endure this mental torture for weeks, which is pretty impressive, in my opinion.

Also, there's the fact that Ron immediately wanted to come back after he had left. If he hadn't been captured by the Snatchers, then he would have returned pretty soon afterwards.

Ron didn't make a proper decision to leave. He stormed out during the fight, and was captured by Snatchers before he could return.

**** You do understand that, if Harry left, he'd be alone, and if Hermione left, she'd be alone? Ron had a family he could fall back to. The others didn't stay because they were more loyal, even under the influence of the horcrux, but because there was no point to leaving.

"If Hermione left, she could have gone to Australia to get her parents!" you say. Correct. She leaves the Horcrux, transplanes, regret, come back, and nobody is there. OH WAIT, RON AND HARRY ARE STILL THERE, BECAUSE THEY WOULD BOTH HOLDS THE HOPES SHE'D COME BACK! Both because Ron is more optimistic than Hermioen or Harry, and because he loved her.

But let's hypothetically say they left. What does she do? How does she go to Australia? by plane? With what money? By international portkey? Again, /with what money/? And that's without thinking about, I don't know, her status as a "most wanted"? Or as a muggleborn in a society that kills all of them?

Alright, so let's hypothetically say, she left. She's now in Australia. Now she needs to find her parents. She don't know WHERE they are - they could be anywhere in Australia. How does she find them?

Okay, okay. Hypothetically, she finds them. She makes them remember. And then, she tells them "Oh, sorry, you can't go back to England. I kinda ditched my friends there, to fight the Dark Lord without me - even through I'm the planner of the group." Happy parents, yay!

​

Okay, okay. Let's go with Harry. He leaves them. He's alone. He beats the Snatchers, goes back. Ron convinced Hermione to stay a little more, because indeed he's the only one who would, and everything is back to normal.

Okay, okay, hypotheticals... They left. Now Harry is alone. What next? I don't even want to try and see how he could get out of THIS mess.

She could have told him "what if it was somehow bewitched by Sirius Black? Let's just let the teacher search for curses, and if there's none then there you will have it back" but nooo, miss little perfect Hermione decided that, pffft, talking to others was overrated.

What about HbP? She literally stopped talking to him for a long time because he became better than her at potions, because he "cheated" ! What was Ron's reaction? Something along the lined of "damn, wish I got this one and not the one I have. Someone barfed on mine."

She straight up gave the cold shoulder to Harry because he was following an alternate way of brewing potions - one that, times and times again, proved to be better than the original one. She compared this book with the Diary, all in the hopes that she'd get him to throw the book. And finally, when it was revealed that, yes, some of the spells written on it were maybe potentially not all knockback jinxes, she had the gall to look smug, like "she was right all along".

All Hermione ever talks about are schoolwork, studying, and classes. All she wants to do are research things, and homework.

Meanwhile, Ron is trying to get Harry to do things that they both enjoy. Mainly, Quidditch. They tried Chess at the start, but quickly stopped when Harry didn't express a strong urge to continue getting pummeled to the ground by an experienced player.

​

So, sure. Hermione wants Harry to be safe. She goes to terrible lenghts to do that, always acting without asking him. But Ron? He wants Harry to be happy. Period.

****** "Being alive and safe is far more important than being happy"

Funny, that's what Dumbledore said, on both side of the spectrum. "You arrived to Hogwarts safe. malnourished, and maybe not particularly happy, but safe" (or something along these lines). He also said something like that : "because Voldemort believes in the prophecy, you (Harry) will never be alone. You will never be able to live, so long as he forces you to survive."

So what should we believe? If Dumbledore is to be believed, then he always was saddened that he somehow didn't manage to let Harry have a good, healthy childhood - full of happiness and blissful ignorance. Which means that the books are trying, here, to tell us that survival may be important, but you need to actually live.

Which means, maybe Hermione is making sure Harry is alive, but Ron is giving him reasons to be alive. If you had to chose between living 100 years, or dying at 50 but having lived a life full of happiness and good memories, would you chose to live long? Is being "alive and safe" so much more important than "living life to the fullest"?

Food for thoughts. Except we both know we're not going to change our opinions. You, because you seem to want Ron to be a bad guy. I, because I know I'm right.

​
