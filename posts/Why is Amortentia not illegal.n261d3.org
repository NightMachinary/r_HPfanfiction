Amortentia is a 'love' potion that causes obesession and infatuation.

Why is it legal in Harry Potter? They're practically roofies, just magical. Fred and George are technically selling the magical equivalent of date-rape drugs and anyone can just buy one from the shelf, what's up with that?


** Because the magical government, just like muggle governments, isn't particularly ethical.

** Because Wizarding Britain is gleefully horrific. Their prison is a death camp, their government is right on the line between totalitarianism and farce, their safety and bullying prevention in school is no more than a step above Sumo (rest in peace Hibikiryu and Tokitaizan), bigotry and corruption are the norm, and the press makes Muggle tabloids look respectable.

All to make Harry's journey through school and his multi-year campaign to save everyone from Voldemort as difficult and frustrating as possible.

​

Edit: So why not rape potions? They fit right in.

** The Doylist answer: Rowling's worldbuilding is far, far from the best, and unless something has a very direct bearing on the plot, she pretty much has no interest in it. It's just one of her many oversights.

The Watsonian answer: All love potions we see used seem to turn the target into a major idiot, and everyone around them can spot instantly that he has been bewitched/fed a potion. As such, these potions are far less dangerous than we'd imagine.

​

Personal note: Realistically, I would imagine there is some kind of blanket law against using magic to coerce people into doing your will, and this goes all the way from the Imperius to compulsion spells.

The issue with outlawing specific spells/potions is that they are way too many for anyone to list them all, so they go with banning specific uses.

** What the twins is selling might not even be Amortentia. If that is the most powerful love potion, it stands to reason that there are other love potions that are less powerful that might only cause an interest in someone rather than an infatuation.

*** It probably wasn't amortentia, that's most likely too expensive to brew and sell at Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, which was a joke shop.

The love potions Fred and George were selling would certainly be less powerful. But that's what Romilda Vane was supposed to use on Harry Potter, except Ron was the one affected instead. Did you see the effects of the potion on Ron? Honestly, the scene from movie was funny, Ron looked like he was high off his ass. 😂

But if that potion was used differently, well it wouldn't be so funny, now would it?

**** The strong effect on Ron was because the potion had been left to sit for months in sweets. It's a full three months between Christmas and Ron's birthday and it's probably meant to be taken right away. I didn't find the scene in the book or the movie funny, and I think some particularly strong love potions could be used as rape drugs (the one Merope used on Tom Riddle certainly qualifies), but I don't believe the ones sold in the Weasleys shop were meant to be that strong or are illegal. Amortentia probably should be illegal, but powerful people probably use it so why would they vote for a law making it illegal.

***** True, you've got a point, powerful people use it, so they wouldn't make it illegal. Look at cigarettes, it's a cancer stick, but it's not illegal because it brings a whole lot of profit. Just wish love potions were taken more seriously, but lol if it was taken more seriously, then the Voldemort shtick wouldn't have happened, and we'd have no plot.

***** I feel that doesn't really stand up as and argument though. Even if it is weak on the shelves, of just by leaving it for three months it becomes very strong, you are effectively selling a strong potion. Sure, you have to plan ahead to get the best effect, but that just makes it more dangerous.

****** I think the Weasleys intent was not to sell a strong potion, it's very likely they didn't know about this effect. Should they have done more testing to find out what happens to their potions if they're left for a long time? Yes, definitely. Another possibility is that it was the effect of the cauldron cakes plus the potion plus three months. Maybe if the potion is just left for three months on its own it doesn't grow stronger.

Should Harry tell the twins so they can pull the potion from their market? Yes, definitely. Is it something the twins could have found out through experimentation? Possibly, depending on the actual reason it grew stronger. Should they be selling the potion once they know about the effect? Absolutely not.

** I always thought they showed Amortentia in school so ppl can identify it later on. I feel like you could probably sue someone for using Amortentia on you - marriage swindel - and stuff but I doubt anybody cares if you use it on a Muggle

Weaker love potions are probably seen as "fun" as they most likely don't last very long or are easily to spot/counter

We know how insane the Wizarding world is and in addition, no one who has been doused with Amortentia has probably ever complained

*** /We know how insane the Wizarding world is and in addition, no one who has been doused with Amortentia has probably ever complained/

Too true, and the timeline of the HP books are in the 1990s, date roofies only increased during the mid-90s and the wizarding world doesn't really know anything much of what happens in the muggle world so there wouldn't be any comparison between the two. Muggleborns, maybe, but then they'd already be too entrenched in the culture of the wizarding world that they'd probably ignore the implications of Amortentia and see it as normal.

Also, of course, I completely agree with you, and I hope that whatever Fred & George sold was something much much less strong (getting the second thought rather than “spreading my legs, do it now!” of Amorentia). Also, I am hesitant to suggest linkao3(14164617), because it is very unsafe story, if you have any triggers, avoid it, please.

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

*** Yeah, I'd like to think that JKR didn't think much about it, she probs put it there because love potions are common tropes associated with witches. It does make me wonder though, Hermione was so appalled at the existence of House Elves and slavery, but when it came to love potions, she didn't have much of a reaction.

** Naturally, love potions are very shady to say the least from our modern muggle perspective. But if you want to understand why the wizarding world allows them you need to shift your perspective to that of an entirely different culture.

On the one hand, the wizarding world doesn't seem to take assault very seriously at all. Anything that can be fixed with to quick trip to the hospital wing and that doesn't involve nasty dark magic basically gets brushed off as no bid deal. I think wizards are basically culturally expected to handle such things personally with tit-for-tat retaliation, and only go running to the aurors when things get particularly serious.

On the other hand, its reasonable to assume that if they've got love potions, they've probably also had ready access to birth control potions for centuries, and have thus had centuries to liberalize their views on sex beyond what us muggles have accomplished in the few short decades since the sexual revolution. Access to birth control is one of the major drivers of gender equality, some of the others being access to education and access to weapons that don't depend on physical strength. The wizarding world has all of these and we see it shown as a relatively egalitarian society with regards to gender with many witches holding important positions such as Minister of Magic or Head of DMLE.

So combining these precepts we have a world that probably treats sex about as trivially as it treats violent assault and thus probably also trivializes sexual assault. But also all these witches are armed, educated in defense, and are culturally expected to personally retaliate for any harm done.

This means the wizarding world both probably doesn't care too much about being temporarily love potioned, love potions probably aren't even all that necessary for magicals to get laid, and that attempting to dose someone with one is likely to have some very painful consequences for the perpetrator in retaliation. There are probably some legal consequences for more serious cases such as long-term enthrallment or using it to defraud someone, but causal use likely isn't on the Ministry's radar at all.

Love potions are probably realistically mostly used on muggles, for consensual recreational use, or to help make an arranged marriage work.
