Dunno why that came to mind, but would be pretty funny.


** Interesting, but one alone could probably not do it - but how about a conspiracy among DEs to really trash Voldemort (maybe even without being identified by him!) so that he learns that torturing your followers isn't great, especially since they can strike back!

Would love a Voldemort that got a reality check because his DEs had enough!

ps: What's it with the down-voting of topics you don't like? If you hate a topic: LEAVE IT THE FUCK ALONE YOU MORONS!

** Perversely I already get that kind of satisfaction whenever Voldemort Crucios his followers. They're pureblood bigots who hate and torture Muggles (...that's us, btw.) Lord V seems to care more about concentrating his personal power, so if he wants to be all "You've disappointed me, Lucius." *zap* *zap* *zap* before whipping it out and humiliating the snooty prick...

But of course even Malfoys deserve due process and I would never condone abuse.

** I feel like that legendary giantdad phrase, "I got back up and pwned him," applies to Voldemort in this scenario.
