Lily relives her Hogwarts years up to the moment she dies(not always 1981). Tries to change minor things to no avail. Gets fed up eventually and marries Severus, and that turns out to be when the loop stops.

I want to read it again just for the hilarity. Thanks.

  Lily Potter dies in a flash of green light on Hallowe'en, 1981, and finds herself back in September, 1971. And then, a decade later, again. And again. And again... One-shot. Warning: Horror, 'M' rating, repeated character deaths (including of the protagonist.) Author notes expanded to address witch & wizard idiocy, 6th March 2020.
