This is how I think it worked how do you think it happended?

The list of legitimate people who used the imperius curse defence after the last war probably number in the hundreds if not thousands. With Many high ranking people among there number.

So when actually death eaters like Lucius used the defence It would have been like hiding a needle in a hay stack. With people not wanting to look very hard to find the needles.

I think because we view the story threw Harry's eyes we get a really jaded view of the imperius curse defence because we only really hear about it in relation to Lucius Malfoy and those like him who we as readers know lied about it.

I also think it would have been Abraxas malfoys doing the bribing with lucius being kept on a very short leash to make sure he did not do anything else that stupid again. Only slipping that leash after Abraxas died in the dragon pox outbreak that happened around Dracos first year. Which is why Lucius only started to cause trouble in Harry's second year.


** Thousands may be overreaching considering the size of wizarding population.

But of course there were some actual imperius cases, Hagrid mentions that

Also I don't know where you took Abraxas' death date from.

*** I agree thousands might be a bit much but you get the gist of what I mean

I forget were I originally read about the theory of Abraxas death but it has stuck with me ever since I first read it.

It was also were I read the idea the Abraxas was the one that did the bribing after the first war to get Lucius off.

I will try and find were I originally read the theory and if I find it I will post it here.

Edit: found were I originally read the theory

** The defence must've been very convincing. Remember that it isn't Fudge's bumbling administration that conducted the Death Eater trials; it was Barty Crouch Sr, the guy who hated the Dark Arts and ruled with an iron fist. He wouldn't have rested till he had dug as deep into the matter as possible.

*** Barty lost a lot of clout when Jr was exposed as a death eater though. That happened only a week or so after the war ended. With his side weakened I could see a lot of backstage bribery going around that let some shaky defenses get through

I was under the impression that we didn't have a date for the Longbottom attacks. If I had to guess at a date, it would be much later. Karkaroff was found, arrested and retrial-ed, all with Crouch at full power. The only one who supported the subsequent trial for Bagman was also him. Besides, we know that he was shunted to the Department of magical Co-operation soon after the incident.

** Personally, I think a combination of bribes and placing themselves under Imperius and memory charms.

So the Death Eater has someone they trust place the Imperius Curse on them, so like, Narcissa could place the Imperius on Lucius, for example. Then, Narcissa Obliviates the memory from Lucius, and lifts the Imperius Curse after. Then, bribery makes sure the questions asked at trial under Veritaserum sound thorough, but are actually full of loopholes.

e.g., Were you placed under the Imperius Curse? Yes. When were you placed under the Imperius Curse? I don't know. Who placed you under the Imperius Curse? I don't know. As best as you can guess, who placed you under the Imperius Curse? A supporter of the Dark Lord. When did you come out of your trance? After the Dark Lord fell.

Hence, it sounds like Lucius was secretly put under the Imperius Curse without him noticing, or was put under the Imperius Curse and the perpetrator Obliviated Lucius so that their identity wouldn't be found out. And Lucius, crafty Slytherin that he is, probably came up with answers that said everything and nothing.

** The reason I ask is because I was thinking about a story idea Were Harry gets hold of a list a of people who used the imperius defence to try and work out who the likely death eater are only to find that there were thousands of wizards who used the defence.

** My favorite insult toward Lucius Malfoy and other Death Eaters who pled the Imperius Defense is that each and everyone of them must be WEAKLINGS! Weak-willed, etc to have been under the Imperius Curse for THAT long when Harry Potter was able to break out of it quite easily. God I would love to see the look on Lucius Malfoy's face whenever I see that point come across in fan-fiction.

*** I actually think Harry is not as good at braking the Imperius curse as Harry and readers are led to believe.

Both times he is put under the person does it right to his face so he immediately know he is under the curse which I doubt was the case during the war. And even then Harry was the only one is in class to throw the curse off.

For all we know crouch Jr. Kept the rest of the student under the curse for the rest of the year with the order to go about there life's as they normally would. So Harry spent the rest of the year surrounded by sleeper agents.

In canon I think the amount of people who could throw off the Imperius curse that told people to go about there lives as normal could be counted on two hands with fingers left over.

Which would have been very dangerous for people trying to fight against Voldemort to trust each other to be reliable in a fight.

**** I would agree with you, for Crouch jr. Voldemort's Imperius would be just like his Crucio. Harry openly admits that it was more difficult to throw off Voldemort's control when compared to Crouch Jr.

Also, Voldemort couldn't /possess/ Harry without pain. He could easily control him. The biggest thing is that Voldemort told Harry to do something point blank that Harry did not wish to do. He did not want to duel, he did not want to bow, he did not want to show this monster any respect whatsoever.

Also, Dumbledore could have easily been there. He states that "I do not need a cloak to become invisible Harry" all the way back in the first couple of years. I do not see Crouch Jr. doing anything with Dumbledore potentially watching. Even a subliminal Imperius Curse. We also never see an imperius curse in Hogwarts outside of that lesson. Malfoy imperios someone /outside/ the castle, In fact, I would not be surprised if Hogwarts offers protection against the curse for her students while in her walls.

We see that the Crucio Curse works via word of mouth (Book 7, Neville's D.A.) Yet, they are able to still attend classes. Which makes no sense, because Harry was forced into bed rest for over two days.

Hogwarts logically must provide students with some protection from such curses. Sectumsempra should have tore through Malfoy, especially if Harry was trying to injure Malfoy. Snape's didnt just cut off George's ear, but left a /hole/ in the side of his head. And from Snape's memories, it was a graze, not a full on hit.

Logically, Hogwarts must offer protection to students. Especially from dark Magic.

**** The best evidence we have as a comparison for breaking the imperium would be the Bartys themselves. Where Jr. Takes several years to break free and Sr breaks free in a few months.

And Sr. probably knew he was being curse and it still took him that long.

** Well, I usually explain it away with several reasons working together.

Bribes and networking. Old, rich families worked to get their young, foolish heirs off. It helps that they were judged by the Wizengamot, and not independend judges, since I assume for my stories that the Wizengamot is like the Lord's House, not elected. But a few bribes to the Ministry didn't hurt either.

There were numerous actual Imperius victims and Dumbledore didn't want a witch hunt and purges happen, which could get out of control easily. He would rather see a few guilty go free than punish an innocent or see mob "justice" be done.

People were willing to accept any excuse so they didn't have to face the fact that their friends were monsters.

** Based of real life per thousand birthrates, there's only about 3-4,000 magical people in the UK after the war, Muggleborns included.

Hp Lexicon list 30 named death eaters, some of which went to Azkaban, some of which went down fight and others, like Karkarov ratted out others to avoid time.

So I imagine that it's basically those few people that show up at the graveyard in book 4 that could have possibly used that particular defense.

I think Malfoy's pardon was cynical in nature. Here's a bunch of wealthy well established bloodlines, that because of the low population are very important to the wizarding world. the war was over, no one wanted to continue the fight and Malfoy comes up with a way for everyone to pretend that he and his cronies aren't monsters.

In short the Wizengamot chose what was easy over what was right.

Finally we see in book 7, when the Minister is Imperiused, that the wizarding world has no real defense against the curse, probably why it's an unforgivable in the first place. Look at the examples given in the later books about victims of the curse, they perform horrible acts, no worse in nature than what the Death Eaters were doing.

** What about the dark mark? Although I'm assuming that the willing death eaters took it, were there imperiused people with the mark? Seems unlikely considering a lot of imperiused victims were used as spies. Considering this, I think it's fairly obvious to have some war-time law to simply check your arm.
