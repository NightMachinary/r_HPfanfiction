** This is just trying too hard.

Edit: Names are spelled too consistently. Honestly. Why do people even try to replicate My Immortal's success. They can't even make their crack look effortless.

*** Well, I think that Profesor-Lupus-and-the-Curse-of-the-Wearwolf was pretty fucking great.

**** I just looked it up, and I think it looks great too!

The thing is, it doesn't attempt to replicate the 00's emo kid chatspeak narration of My Immortal. It doesn't even /mention/ My Immortal. It doesn't constantly shatter the fourth wall like My Immortal. It's its own kind of madness.

Actually, it looks a lot like a parody of some seriously written beginner fics, only apparent as crack because of the obvious (consistently varied!) name misspellings and deviations to the plot.

Edit: The author of the linked fic on this thread mentioned My Immortal on their note and /tried/ to completely copy its narrative style. It's just another imitation that isn't absurd enough on its own.

*** Speaking of which, has anyone heard anything new about Rose Christo? It's been a month since she was exposed as a fraud, and I kind of assumed she'd resurface by now and add yet another twist to the story.

**** She seems to have disappeared, for the moment.

If she really didn't write the story, she'll just be another display in My Immortal's trophy case of people who've tried to claim authorship.

Is this about the alleged resurfacing of the original author who claimed MI was a trollfic?

******* She isn't really Native American, she wasn't put through child porn (although she /does/ seem to have grown up in a highly dysfunctional family), her brother wasn't actually "missing" because she'd known how to contact him for years... the list goes on and on. See [[https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/9/16428248/my-immortal-still-a-mystery-rose-christo-fake][here]] for more details. According to her brother, she was fed false information about her childhood by her grandmother for years, and used that to build up a false identity that she continued to live through even when she was old enough to know better.
