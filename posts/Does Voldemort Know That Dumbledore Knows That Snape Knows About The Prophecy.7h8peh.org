** Dumbledore saw Snape when he overheard the prophecy. Even Trelawney saw Snape and while i imagine Dumbledore didn't immediately realize that Snape had actually overheard anything significant, but once he knew that Snape was a death eater and Voldemort knew about the prohpecy it would have been pretty obvious.

**** Dumbledore does not have to trust Snape . What Voldemort knows is that Snape somehow managed to get Dumbledore to recruit him and even someone who is not fully trusted could ferret out valuable information. Snape could probably use the fact that Dumbledore supposedly does not trust him to give less information to Voldemort.

Voldemort knows that Snape is a double agent he just assumes that Snapes ultimate loyalty is to him.

**** It is implied he told him the truth - that he loved Lily and changed sides. Voldemort considered this laughable, of course, but he believed that Dumbledore believed that.

#+begin_quote
  “And through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore has never suspected you?” asked Bellatrix. “He has no idea of your true allegiance, he trusts you implicitly still?”

  “I have played my part well,” said Snape. “And you overlook Dumbledore's greatest weakness: He has to believe the best of people. I spun him a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff, fresh from my Death Eater days, and he embraced me with open arms --- though, as I say, never allowing me nearer the Dark Arts than he could help.

*** That's not the question. The question is whether /Voldemort/ knew that Dumbledore knew.

**** Well since Voldemort took the prophecy seriously he probably used legilimency or a pensieve with Snape to see the memory, which would reveal Snape getting caught, because Voldemort would no doubt demand to see the reason why Snape couldn't bring him the full prophecy.

Voldemort would certainly suspect that Dumbledore knew about it all.

And here is the bingo: Even without legilimency or pensieve Voldemort would ask, and Snape has no reason to lie to him (at that point in time).

***** on that note, if voldemort /had/ used a pensieve for that memory of snape's, then he /would/ have had access to the full prophecy

****** No reason to think a pensieve would let you hear something the owner of the memory didn't.

******* except that that's exactly what a pensieve does, considering harry could hear what the marauders were saying when snape wasn't even close to them, and see what james was writing on his paper when snape was at his own desk
