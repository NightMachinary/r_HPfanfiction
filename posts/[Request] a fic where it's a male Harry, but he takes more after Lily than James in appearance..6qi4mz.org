  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.

** The author's grammar is beyond shit, but the story itself is really good. I highly recommend reading it if you can look past the extremely poor grammar, which does improve somewhat as the story progresses.

  Harry looks exactly like Lily when he appears at Hogwarts much to the surprise of everyone. What if Petunia told him about his world when he finally got his letter? What if they accepted him for who he was? Harry is sorted into Slytherin. He befriends Hermione (raven), Draco(Sly), Neville (Huffel) and of course Luna (Raven) later on. Whats a Potions Master to do? can he hate Harry?
