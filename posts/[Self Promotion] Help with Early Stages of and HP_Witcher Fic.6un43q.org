I've just written the opening chapter of an HP Witcher crossover.

Here's the link to my google doc: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Py7hz4R2Fu5Lce9MT2gJiA_v8oxXGaEiFDGFjAgjPE4/edit?usp=sharing][HP/ Witcher Chapter 1]]

I don't want to publish yet since I don't have much written, but would appreciate any feedback either here or as a comment on the document.

I'd like to know if Hermione's characterization is believable. Harry's a bit of an OC due to a different upbringing, but I think this is a way for an introverted, more self-interested Harry to make a true friend.

I'd also like to know of the action scene is at all exciting, and if the dialogue feels too exposition-y.

I have a rough idea of where I want things to go long-term, but no firm plans for the rest of the first year, so the next bit could be a while coming.

Anyway, thanks!


** Why do people keep adding Hermione as an automatic friend every single time? No matter how you look at it Hermione is a little bitch from day one and the only reason I can see even cannon Harry befriending her is because he never had friends to start with and cherishes even the bad ones. A normal kid couldn't put up with her constant whining and attitude for that long without their own issues. Kids don't make friends on the idea that "Oh she'll grow out of being a know-it-all", they just find new friends that they like being around.

*** Hey, thanks for reading and writing up your thoughts.

Obviously I can't speak for all fanfiction writers who have chosen to keep Hermione as a friend. Given that we're all amateur writers it seems like this and other common tropes are often chosen because they're well explored and easy and leave room for creative energies to be spent on other things the writer is more excited about. Or they really like Hermione. Or Hermione's friendship fits into the plot pretty well.

I'd like to put myself in the latter category. There's not a lot of context to figure this out yet (~2K words) but Harry isn't looking for, and consequently doesn't have, friends. He is super pragmatic (again, more context will hopefully show this) and sees the value in someone that is indebted to him watching his back. She's already proved her value in research and analysis capabilities and he's willing to let her in on some of what he's up to. At this point I don't think he'd consider them to be friends.

As for Hermione's character, yeah she's annoying. But most kids that have any personality are pretty annoying, at least sometimes. If she just rubs you the wrong way I can see getting annoyed at her being included in most fics, but not every single fic that has her should be judged because a bunch of others do the same thing. We're all amateurs and not everything about every new fic can be different and interesting. Look for what the author is trying to do differently and see if that interests you.

**** That's a way more impressive reply than I deserve to be honest since basically all I did was rant about Hermione but I just can't be bothered to read yet another HP fanfic where she's important. I'm sick and tired of her being friends or whatever you want to call them with Harry even when realistically there's no reason to put of with her BS. It's your fic so do what you want but I don't get it why people can't just use some other character or even an OC.
