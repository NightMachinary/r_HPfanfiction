It can be that he's good at drawing or painting or dancing or singing or ballet or even ice skating! I don't care if it's abused Harry or fem Harry or AU. The only thing I care about is if he is artistic. Oh, I don't care about pairings HOWEVER no DRACO OR WEASLY MATCHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25440826/chapters/61701526][Dripping Fingers]] by May_May_o_o has artistic painting & drawing Harry. Tomarry pairing, and can be dark at times but is quite good.

*** Thanks for the recommendation! I love the way the author writes and expresses emotions. Makes me feel nostalgic. Can you by chance recommend some fics that are written similarely?

**** Sorry but i don't really know any more. I may have tried to read one a long time ago but it was way too abstract and hard for me to understand that i didn't finish. Honestly it might not have even been an HP fic that was so long ago ðŸ˜‚

  Everyone knows the story, the Potters attacked and little Harry left with his relatives. But what happens when the last Potter stumbles upon something left behind? What does someone with no preconceived notions about Magic do when they find out that it's real? Do they follow along just like everyone else? Or do they find their own path? Harry Potter did always like to make things!
