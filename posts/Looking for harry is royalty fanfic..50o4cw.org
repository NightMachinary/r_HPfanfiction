Like "bound in servitude" or "the pendragon heir".


** I haven't read either of those, but I recently read these two. Although they might come off a bit trope-y I think the attention to detail makes up for it. linkffn(11876273) linkao3(Peverell's Heir)

  A disastrous encounter with the Dursleys over the summer leads Harry Potter to run away. He runs into a mysterious person, who introduces him to the extravagant, yet perilous elite of Britain's Wizarding society. As Harry takes the first steps along the journey to take his rightful place as the heir of an ancient and prominent legacy, he deals with rivals and discovers new links to his past; ones that could give him a new family or lead him into the clutches of a hardened killer, one whose act of betrayal led to the deaths of his parents...and possibly his own.

***** Ah yes, this is really excellent! I remember it being recommended multiple times a week or so ago, and I have it downloaded to my phone. Will eventually get around to it when I finish the others I'm currently reading.
