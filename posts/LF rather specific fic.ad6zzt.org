Its been a little while since I read this fic on FF.net, so I might make a mistake or two. I think it was called Harry Potter and the Hidden Truth, but this may be wrong.

I remember it was a HP/FD/GD/DG/OC fic. Basically, WBWL (brother) with James and Lily still alive. Harry reappears at Hogwarts years later with multiple girlfriends in tow to fight Voldemort.

OC character is a vampire (may have been some relative of the head of some vampire clan, I don't remember).

Had a bunch of intra familial fighting, notably Harry destroying a large chunk of Potter Manor.

Also had a bunch of foreign/American war wizards getting involved with the fighting at Harry's behest. I mostly remember the ex-Nazi who liked to call people dumpfkopf (or similar).


** Hmm sure but did you even try to look on Google for this fic title? It would have won you some time.

Anyway here you go linkffn(6611996)
