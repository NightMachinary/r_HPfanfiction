** Wouldn't it fun to see all the familiars get tired of the way their charges are being treated at school and decide to step in and fix them? I can imagine them all in the RoR talking with each other and shaking their heads in disgust at what is going on at Hogwarts.

Or they decide that they could take over the world in a much more orderly way

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12603861][Hedwig Slightly Unhinged]] has a hedwig who takes control of Harry's life. Read it a while ago so can't remember all the details, possible harem from what I saw while getting the link, but it's a fun parody fic so it's allowed tropes and cliches!

#+begin_quote
  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.
