I'm looking for an old HP/LotR crossover story. It's no longer on ffn.net and my Googlefu isn't upp to snuff.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3738389/1/The_Serpent_of_the_South]]

I had it bookmarked and all, but that wasn't enough. I sadly don't remember much of it at all, it been almost 10 years since I read it, but I do remember liking it very much.

Does anyone know where I can find it online or if someone has an offline backup? Would be much appreciated.

Thanks.

*** I read that story on a different archive site recently, but it was incomplete there as well. Is three chapters all there ever was of it?

**** Huh, I have a memory of trying to find a ffn fic via webarchive before and getting a robots.txt scraping blocked message. But I'm glad it is there.

Anyhow, no, is far as I know it was never completed. Sadly.
