The glorious crack and bromance (sismance for Hermione) fic has updated.

Best highlight, for me? Malfoy has a screwt-induced breakdown, and Harry's screwt learns to fly (with 'help').

The rampant craziness is brilliant.

I wish there were more fics that had this dynamic between the three/others, too.
