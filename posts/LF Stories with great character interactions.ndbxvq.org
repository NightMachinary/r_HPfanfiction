** Linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower) has my favourite characters. Those wonderful sly sentences that are just coy and dry and mean something entirely different to what is being said. Whole thing is just a bunch of Slytherins it's great I love it.

Linkffn(The Life and Times by Jewels5) was also great writing. Interesting characters and good fun. I really enjoyed reading it.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.
