I don't mind the ice queen clich√© fics I find if its well written it can be nice, but I want to find one where she's more care free and fun.


** This is something that's been bugging me for awhile - why Daphne specifically? Strip away the ice queen meme, and she's basically an OC. You could use any faceless character in her place and not notice the difference.

*** A: Slytherin, so that adds some cross-House drama/whatever.

B (my reason): Her name is the best.

*** Because we have a visualization of Daphne in the general fanfiction universe, more or less creating an established character.

*** There's a rewritten one up that's slightly easier to read. It's mostly the same, but the author smoothed out some of the characters and plot points.
