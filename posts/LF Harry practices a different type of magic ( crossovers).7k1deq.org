Looking for fics where Harry or someone close to him practices magic from other series (World of Warcraft, Marvel, etc).


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12256909/1/][Master Potter of Kamar-Taj]] by Ryuko monogatari) is a pretty decent one so far.

  How does the wizarding world react when it finds out that it is not the only wizarding world? A young Harry is taken to the home of Dr Stephen Strange, and is far more ready for the challenges he will be made to face

** I'd love to write a story where Harry becomes a paladin, Ron becomes a shaman, and Hermione becomes a warlock with an emphasis on gnomish engineering after getting stuck in WoW during their first year. I wrote a sample of it and posted it in the plot bunnies thread not to long ago. Maybe someday.

Gul'dan has literally genocided entire races, soul his soul to literal and figurative Satan, warped his mind and body in pursuit of power, and offered up his own people as a sacrifice to satisfy his own cravings.

  Because of something happening when they were babies, Harry Potter and Harry Dresden's lives are inevitably linked together. The results become evident only a few years later and they are unexpected, problematic and quite a little entertaining for both.
