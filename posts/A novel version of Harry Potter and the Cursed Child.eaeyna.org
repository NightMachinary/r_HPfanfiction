Is there a novel version of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child that someone has made? I know there is no OFFICIAL one, but when in doubt, turn to fanfiction! So?

Thanks in advance!


** I did write what I consider to be a novelisation of CC, but it's probably not quite what you want or would expect. I made a few things a bit different because the plot of CC is so appallingly badly constructed, I'm sure Jack Thorne (who I wouldn't trust with an episode of Teletubbies) must have scribbled it on the back of a fag packet during a liquid lunch.

** I'm guessing you mean not the printed version of the play right? Just want to make sure.

*** Yeah! Sorry, I wasn't really sure how to word it. Like, "Let's go!" said Harry, and not Harry - Let's go!

**** I figured! But you know, it's the internet, can't assume anything, so I wanted to make sure you didn't know you could technically buy a book version of the play lol.

*** I think OP is looking for Cursed Child but is the style of HP books/fanfics, and not the script CC that is sold.
