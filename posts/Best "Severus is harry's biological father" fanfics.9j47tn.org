What are the best fanfics where Snape finds out that he's Harry's father?

How many can you think of? What makes then interesting to read?


** "By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept". Snape's parentage - artificial insemination; he thought Lily hadn't done it so wasn't aware of it - is revealed, but that doesn't mean Snape suddenly likes Harry, and vice versa. They still loathe each other.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

** I liked /Practicing Liars./ I thought the characterizations of Harry and Snape were interesting and worth reading. It is HP/DM preslash, which was annoying, but I still liked it and the pre-relationship stuff wasn't too overbearing. (The White Dementors in it are, in my opinion, one of the eeriest 'monsters' in HP fan fics.) linkffn(5428900)

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.

  HPDM preslash, Severitus, AU. Harry found out he's Snape's son in his fourth year, and concealed the truth from Snape. Now, in his sixth year, he's dodging Snape's suspicions about him and trying to figure out Draco Malfoy. Life is complicated. COMPLETE.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1963825/1/Mine][Mine]] linkffn(1963825) involves Snape rescuing 5-year-old Harry from Dursleys. There are hundreds of stories involving Snape rescuing young Harry from Dursleys but most of them are of a very questionable quality. This one is written well. Very sweet and warm story, almost too sweet but manages to stay within a reasonable level of cuteness.

*** Had they hooked up, Severus wouldn't have become a death eater. Or so I would like to think. Anything is possible, we'll need to take a trip in time to find out for sure.

So just imagine, they have hooked up diverging happens to drive them apart. Lily discovers she's pregnant but doesn't tell Severus, who by the way is on a downward spiral. And then well she marries James has a kid and the rest as we know if history, until 4th/5th/6th year when the truth comes out

What happens then???

  Voldemort needs to find a worthy Heir in order to assume the title of Lord Slytherin. Fortunately, he planned ahead, and his grandson Harry Potter is the perfect candidate. Sort of Severitus. Rating is for Sirius' pottymouth. No pairings.
