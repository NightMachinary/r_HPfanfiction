I've honestly never been a fan of most cannon pairings, or even popular fan pairings such as H/Hg. Lately I've found it hard to find high quality works that also feature unusual pairings, so I'm hoping we could get a list going. I'll start it up. Every fic listed has the ship as at least a main part of the plot. Some may not be "romance" fics, but they all feature it prominently. Every fic listed is at least 100k works, but most are 200k+, with one or two hitting 500k.

I'm quite sure there are more, I remember reading them years ago. Unfortunately, after a 5+ year break from fanfiction, and a rather incomplete copy of my old bookmarks, these are what I've been able to find. So, what's missing?

*** Thanks, I knew I was missing something! Completely forgot Wastelands/Heartlands, though I think Joe abandoned them in favor of his own novels if I remember correctly..

To be honest I've never been a fan of Jeconais writing, it always seems stilted and cliche filled (especially his H/Gabriel fic "Hope"), but I'm definitely going to be checking out a few of the others you listed.

**** Also, in regard to Jeconais

'Hope' is probably the ultimate H/Gabrielle (and possibly the first one). Yes he is rather fluffy and cliche in much of his writing, but the good ones are so good it doesn't matter.

***** I got to maybe chapter 3 of "Hope" before I gave up. Well, gave up for the last time. When I first started reading it I stopped as soon as I read this line:

#+begin_quote
  When Gabrielle realised that she had been saved by ‘Arry, she immediately decided that ‘e waz ‘er mate, and let herself be mated to ‘im.”
#+end_quote

But gave it another shot until we see how unrealistically powerful Harry is. Honestly, an assassin ring? That he could sense? Just out of the fucking blue?

Jeconais could have been considered good ~2005ish, back when there was hardly any decent fanfiction. Now? It's so cringey.

****** I agree with you with respect to Jeconais's work and I only noted it in case it was something that might have appealed to you as a reader, even if only as a guilty pleasure. Back when it was fresh, it was markedly better (and more prolific) writing than much of the fanfiction out there and it was sufficiently different in tone from the deluge of angst-ridden post-OOTP writing that one found in the heyday of the fandom. But now, almost a decade hence, most of his ideas have been copied to the point of becoming hackneyed and even at its best, his writing was overblown, the relationships being more magical co-dependence than anything healthy or organic (or even human).

His style works for some and a few of his stories, the ones where his betas reined him in a bit, are quite good. While /Hope/ and /White Knight, Grey Queen/ get the most recommendations, I think they're overrated and that his shorter work is much better, less apt to get ridiculous (a la /This Means War/ and Harry's riding a dragon into outer space"). /Perfect Situations/ (his Harry/Daphne), for example, is very good, especially when one notes when it was written, before the explosion in Harry/IceQueen-Daphne tales; so is his Gen (though leaning Harry/Fleur) story /Best Man/.

****** The thing is, most of his completed stories ARE from that time period.

So many tropes and cliches we deal with now, were new and innovative ideas when Jeconais and Kinsfire did them.

I understand not being able to read it because of how fanfiction has evolved, but I respect the old masters of fanfiction :)

Also.. White Knight Grey Queen - Harry/Pansy (again...I think it was the first)
