I remember reading a while ago that had Harry in the library, or somewhere similar, looking under the table for some reason and hitting his head. After doing this he gets a memory of sitting under James' desk as a baby. I am just kinda curious if anyone knows what story this was from.

*** Aha! Thank you. I have read them all I just couldn't remember where that scene was from and was curious.
