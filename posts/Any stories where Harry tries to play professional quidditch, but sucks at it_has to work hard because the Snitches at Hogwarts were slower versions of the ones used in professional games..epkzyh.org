** It will have to AU as Oliver Wood noted that Harry before his first game was comparable to Charlie Weasley who could have gone professional if he wanted to. Plus he has top of the line broomstick which he used to maneuver around a Dragon which was pretty insane. So I don't see Harry being that bad.
