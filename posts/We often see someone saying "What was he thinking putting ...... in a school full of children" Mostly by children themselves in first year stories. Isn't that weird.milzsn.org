I mean, they're children themselves. Also, they are amazingly self aware for children. Then they say "Don't they know saying to a child not do something only means they'll do it for sure?" Which is simply untrue. Children don't like to disobey orders, they merely don't think too much about consequences. That is to say, they won't put themselves in danger just because someone told them not to.


** Yes I agree. I've (begrudgingly) accepted the fact that majority of HP fanfic writers love to write the characters from first year, but have no idea how kids typically work.

Children are not as self aware or caring at that age in the face of magical adventures. Harry is often argued to be really clueless but really for a kid thrown in a world he has no knowledge of, what can you expect? Kids are less likely to question the dangers of a situation when theyre curious.

They told him there are creatures that will kill you in the forest next to their school, why shouldn't he or even other students think it okay that a dangerous object is being kept in their school? The castle does have a lot of secrets and mysteries.

And yes I agree children do mostly obey orders. There are occasional kids who don't, but for the most part all of us when we were in school would shut up and listen to our teacher if they got mad enough to yell because we know we did something really bad. I think the only reason Harry ever really gets entangled in the mess he does is because he thinks the consequences of not doing it are worse for him because he knows he's different from all the other students because he has real enemies. Not the same as simply going after trouble because someone told you not to.

I have a lot of issues of how people write kids in their fics. Especially when they have Harry or someone like him enter the wizarding world like he did at age 11 but somehow, conveniently, as if it only makes sense for them to do this, ask all the right questions at Diagon Alley to be equipped with every tool necessary to make them the stronger, read every single book they bought before going to Hogwarts that manages to catch them up to speed on wizarding culture and history and system to the point that they explain things to pure blood kids, and have the social skills and mentality of a master manipulator or interrogator that makes even 150 year olds who are known for defeating dark lords crumble under the pressure of an 11 year old.

Just doesn't make sense it irks me so much. At 11, your biggest concern is making friends or building your social circle and not doing anything embarrassing, not world domination.

*** Someone made a post defending Harry in book 5 when people criticized him of being overly emotional by explaining that on top of OWLs, organizing the DA, classwork, quidditch, sleep, detentions that lasted several hours, etc...

he did a lot with very little time each day /as a 15-year-old/ and had every right to be emotional

**** YES! he's 15 in that book!!!! he's acting like a 15-year-old who's not only been through everything he's been through but also has so much to deal with because it's year 5, AND he's being abused by Umbridge. I always say that Harry doesn't mistrust adults he's just used to dealing with problems on his own from living with the Dursleys. It's not an "I don't trust adults" problem it's an "I've never gone to adults because my problems have never been taken seriously before Hogwarts so why would that change now?" problem. So by the time (book 5) he's at the point where he wants to bring things to adults, he's gone to them for so little that they don't know what he's been through so they're treating him like a 15-year-old and not a 15-year old that's seen some shit and actually knows what he's talking about. They all think it's "normal teenage behavior/rivalry" and not "oh he's been doing this for the last 5 years he might be on to something here." and that's sad because Remus and Lupin 100% act an ass when he CASUALLY mentions Snape stopped giving him Occlumency lessons. Like that's his first time seeing adults respond that way to something that is a big deal but he (like other similar moments) doesn't think is a big deal because 'I can manage'

****** but even then in each case (i am horribly longwinded when it comes to this subject i am SO sorry 😭 😭 😭 )

1. McGonagall is still viewing him as a child who accidentally found out about the SS and takes him more seriously going forward in the series. I wouldn't say she chastises him because she assures him the stone is well guarded (her reaction in the book is one of surprised agitation because they're 11 and not supposed to know about the stone) but they ALSO don't tell her how much they know, why they think it's going to be stolen (by an adult), that the person knows how to get past fluffy, nothing so for all we know she's assuming that they're warning her that a general someone /probably student in her mind/ is going to try and steal the stone. But again she doesn't have that same response when they come to her about very serious things like this in the future (except surprise lol)

2. Idk if Lockhart was betrayal because they'd have had to have faith and trust in him to begin with and they def didn't. They only went to Lockhart KNOWING he was a fake but assuming he was at least going to /try/ and go to find Ginny after seeing the other teachers volunteer him, so they'd tell him what they knew so they could aid him in getting her back. They didn't realize the other teachers volunteered him knowing he would run, if they had they would have gone to someone else like McGonagall.

3. He knew how Snape was so how Snape responded was typical to his relationship with Snape and doesn't break a trust that isn't there. Remus chasing them wasn't a betrayal because Harry KNEW Remus couldn't control that and is even forgiving and ready to vouch for him afterward in fact he doesn't even view what happened as Remus's fault because he's very aware that remus was not in his right mind and hadn't taken his potion.

4. McGonagall did not dismiss him whatsoever she explains the severity of the situation to Harry and why snapping at Umbridge is something he can't do, how she also agrees with him and knows he's telling the truth but that that is NOT the situation they're in. It's not a matter of "true vs false" but one of control so he has to control his temper at least while in her classroom. Harry was not being tortured yet by Umbridge when he's sent to her the first time. He hadn't even served his first detention yet so he can't tell her about something that hasn't happened yet and doesn't even tell his friends when it happens because he feels like it's something he has to put up with himself.

Funnily enough my top priority as a shy and anti-social eleven year old /actually was world domination/. I really loved comic supervillians and fantasy dark lords, and spent a huge amount of time fantasizing about/drawing my secret hideouts carved into mountains and my robot armies. If I'd gotten my Hogwarts letter at the point in my life, I would probably have made very few friends and have thrown myself completely into studying magic. That was what I did IRL, minus the whole magic being real aspect, and it's probably why I enjoy Smart/Indy!Harry fics where he's more reclusive and ambitious.

But I 100% agree with your broader point. Reclusive bookworm eleven-year-olds fantasizing about world domination are still eleven, and they will engage with the world like children, even if they are precocious and reading well above their age level. Growing up is learning how much you /don't/ know as well as expanding what you do know, and bright children often suffer particularly from thinking they know far more about something than they actually do.

It was all just playing around, of course, no torture or murder, closer to what the Marauders were doing than what Riddle got up to with his Death Eaters. But I definitely identify with young Tom Riddle's obsession with learning occult secrets, if not his callous disregard for the sanctity of human life. I channeled my own obsession into learning computer programming as a hobby; writing software in arcane languages that make computers do things was the closest analog to magic I could find.

THIS ENTIRE PARAGRAPH RIGHT HERE! It is one of the most frustrating things about fic writers in the HP fandom because more often than not they put their ADULT thoughts and feelings on characters whose development they've seen from start to finish into a year one (or even a pre-Hogwarts) chapter/fic and it is infuriating. Even the stories that are well written (like the one I'm reading now "[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/737220][A Very Slytherin Harry]]" series on AO3) do this thing where despite being so well written, year one Harry has the mentality and thought process of someone entering their 6th/7th year of Hogwarts. No Harry, that young who has so much that is exactly the same about his origin story while also having so much different would ever 1. Be immediately suspicious of Dumbledore. or 2. NOT see his parents in the mirror of erised. If you are not changing who Harry is FUNDAMENTALLY other than introducing him to magic prior to year one there is no way he wouldn't see his parents in the mirror even if in your AU he does not live with or is taken away from the Dursleys. There is NO WAY that he would question as much as they have him questioning in these fics as he does year one. Your AU year one Harry who is fundamentally the same Harry as JKs Harry would still be the same year one Harry that Dumbledore feels uncomfortable being honest with BECAUSE of his age. THATS why so much is hidden from him from the beginning not only by Dumbledore but by all of the adults it's because he's still a child acting like a child despite facing evil well beyond his years. Because he's not suspicious of all adults nor does he not trust all adults, he doesn't believe that what he's going through is important enough or even big enough of a deal to bring to adults which is VERY different and no one touches on that in fics.Also..... a controversial opinion moment but there is NO fic with "good Snape" that does not have "good Dumbledore" IF everything in your AU prior to Lily and James dying is exactly the same. Another controversial opinion but if you're doing to write HP fic pre-Hogwarts on AND keep the wizarding world essentially unchanged you can not do that having only watched the movies.

I'm so tired of fics that hand information that took us several books to find out, to their 11 year old chatacters either on a silver platter or make it seem like it was obvious enough for them to know from the beginning because that's just how smart their character is.

Like week 1 of first year:

“Are you excited for DADA class, Harry?”

“DADA? No way. I met the professor who teaches that class on my first day in the wizarding world and something about him seems off. I don't know how to explain it but he's suspicious and while we're talking about him, I bet his stutter is fake. I think I'm gonna skip his classes, I've already read the textbook 3 times and lnow enough to teach the class myself but you have fun.”

Any child meeting someone like Quirrell irl or even in fics would go “oh he's a nervous person” because a child isn't going to be able to tell the difference between a real stutter and a fake one. Hell the staff didn't even catch it they just assumed Quirrell had a bad run in with one of the MANY magical creatures in their world and it shook him up a bit. I mean think about the magical world of the books that's not too far out of the realm of possibilities all things considered.

*** Fanfic writers may be constantly writing first years as adults in small bodies, but as annoying as that is? The very rare fic that actually writes them as 11-year-olds is worse. Even canon isn't actually written like that- they're all a touch more self-aware and cogent and stable than actual children. Because actually reading about realistic 11-year-olds is incredibly obnoxious- they constantly do and say dumb things for reasons that are painfully obvious to adults but confusing to them, and act out emotionally because they are still trying to work out what their emotions even are, and act like little shits to each other for paltry reasons. They lack the cuteness of 7-year-olds but also the "wisdom" of teenagers, and you're left with... middle schoolers. No one wants to experience that again just for the sake of realism.

**** That is also very true! I think the closest I came to reading something that actually sounds like an 11 year old is where the adults around her actually treat her like a kid and nuisance and it's harder for her to get people to take her seriously. She was also self aware enough to know when she was in the prescence of dangerous magic but also unintentionally looked over details that would have been crucial to know because she doesn't know it's importance and pushes it to the back of her mind to focus on her own childish agenda and ends up accidentally solving mysteries.

Side note, I think the best asset kids have is being underestimated because they're very observant and overlooked enough to hear things people think they won't understand. I think this would be better for authors to use to their advantage rather than pretending like their characters are grown ups.

** I mean they told us not to put rocks and snowballs one year at my grade school.... No one had done that before hand a lot of people did that after. Thankfully it was only one snowball war before negotiations took place between the fourth and third graders to basically negotiate approved arms for such battles.... We negotiated I guess a schoolyard version of the Geneva convention. But for that one rock inside of a snowball war both teams ratedraided The gym supply shed and grabbed football and baseball helmets. A few people get hit in the head by the rock snowballs but the helmets worked well enough to not have concussions so the adults never found out about it.

​

It's a fond memory looking back but now my brain also tells me what the fuck were they thinking actually telling us that kids do the exact opposite of what they told if no one thought to put rocks in a snowball until they were told you could put rocks and snowballs then the administration kind of brought it on the school themselves and we dealt with it among ourselves we negotiated a treaty for an armistice and blockade of certain snow best weapons with rocks in them so no one would get hurt by then after a few people get hit in the head with them and got some bruises on her arms and legs. Nobody died thankfully and no one got a concussion that I remember of. And we continue to have snowball fights for the rest of that winter before my family moved to Belgium briefly before going back to Germany dad got transferred around European based us military bases a lot like I spent most of my childhood living on a different continent..lol

** The weirdest thing about it isn't just that they're being written by someone who cannot write like a child. The weirdest thing is that Harry Potter runs on Monty Python logic but nobody really seems to call THAT out.

Back in the day, Rowling wrote two little extra books to go with the series, Quidditch Through The Ages and Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them. I think they were like five bucks, and everything in them is canon. They're basically printed versions of those two books, with scribbles and notes in the margins to imply they're copies of Harry's own textbooks. In Beasts, Dumbledore writes a foreword explaining some of the history of the magical world.

In that foreword (which is 100% canon), it is explained that the original Ministry tried to give every magical creature equal say, but that it was a chaos of mooing and braying and things chasing other things, so they axed that. Then they tried to only give humanoid looking things the ability to vote, but the hags ignored the proceedings to look for children to kidnap, the gnomes ran around biting everyone's ankles, and something called a "porlock" started making a terrible mess on the floor. Finally, the Ministry arrived on the idea that only creatures that wanted to involve themselves should have their interests represented, so they reached out to all the intelligent beings to ask them. The centaurs refused the classification of "being" on the grounds that if humans were also "beings" then it would be a dire insult to be considered a "being" as well, and that they would prefer to be called animals to being associated with humanity in any way, shape, or form. The goblins accepted the invitation but then didn't bother to show up because they had better things to do with their time. And finally, all ghosts collectively refused to be considered "Beings," because in their own words, "we aren't Beings, we're HasBeens."

So just to be clear, canonically speaking, the centaurs refused to be given rights because they're unbelievably racist against humans (which makes them a lot less sympathetic in my opinion), the goblins failed to show up to the meeting because they didn't care, and all ghosts collectively threw their rights away for the sake of making a pun. Additionally, this is why it's an inside joke in the Ministry that someone who is "getting moved to the Centaur Liason Office" is going to be fired soon. Because the Ministry does actually maintain an office for the centaurs to use if they ever change their mind and want to be considered beings/people, but no centaur anywhere has ever used the office or made a petition for anything (this is another reason I don't really pity the centaurs anymore, because they could change their status at any time, and simply choose not to).

This is all completely true, and yet no suspiciously sarcastic and well-spoken twelve year old in fanfiction ever seems to call any of it out. In fact, we were explicitly told in the VERY FIRST book that magicals don't have an ounce of common sense, which is the reason why Snape used a logic puzzle as his obstacle to guard the stone. To paraphrase Hermione, the greatest witches and wizards in history didn't have any common sense at all, and would have been stuck in that room forever. The magical world is certifiably insane and completely irrational. I'm honestly surprised the Department of Mysteries doesn't have a Subsection of Silly Walks. And yet, somehow, none of these adult-children ever seem to call any of that out. They only ever seem to care about the OSHA standards of a single magical school.

I have a sneaking suspicion that the other schools aren't the slightest bit better. I kind of wish someone would write a fic about Harry transferring to another school like Beaubaxtons, only to find out that actually, yes, Hogwarts really IS the safest of the schools.

I also kind of wish there was a story out there somewhere about how Voldemort, being a halfblood, actually does use common sense, and this is the real reason he seems so unstoppable. And the only reason Harry can stop him is because he ALSO is a halfblood who can use common sense.

*** Sort of yes and no. This is the problem of a series trying to age with its readers. I wanted to start trying my hand at fanfic recently so I decided to have a go at rereading the series from the top, if only to get my canon straight from my fanon. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone could have been written by Roald Dahl. It is a young children's comedy full of absurd exaggerations and evil adults/plucky children but no one is actually hurt. That is fine. The problem is by book 7 JKR is trying to write an angsty young adult novel about teenagers on the run from a dystopian Definitely Not Nazi government. That is fine.

The problem is that these notionally exist in the same continuity, and taken as a whole, the series has massive problems. Stuff that makes sense in the first few books due to its 'Monty Python Logic' becomes incredibly jarring or even unintended soft horror when viewed in the tone of the last few. When someone wants to write a fanfic, they tend to (and should) pick one and stick with it. The choice is either run an entire crackfic where nothing makes sense, or go back over the events of the early series and justify the problems either through explanation of why it was necessary, or Dumbledore bashing.

Most fanfics do the latter, because crackfic will only get you so far unless you are really good, and also the writes and intended audiences of fanfic tend to be late teens/early twenties, and having finished the series, want more of what they have just read, so you end up with having to take the early stuff out of context.

**** i always assume that the logic of the first few books is because of the student's (and readers) ages. So they come off in a "Monty Python" logic in the beginning because they're being explained in the way a child could understand them. The problem is that it's never really touched on in-depth in later books when the reader would have LOVED that. Instead that knowledge lies within Hermione who either doesn't always explain it or dumbs it down when she tries to go into depth and sees that the others "don't get it". Like the food magic explanation +^{(something that it's weird Ron doesn't know as someone who grew up in a magical household but i just attribute that to the pre-movie books vs post-movie books effect})+ where Hermione is trying to explain the magic law that states one (wizards) cannot create food out of thin air. Things that readers would LOVE more info and explanation one she (JK) just...doesn't explain, and I think it's because she just....didn't want to explain it, like so much that's left unexplained it's lazy writing on JK's part.

He had muggle experience of being charming and able to talk his way (with sense unlike a person like Lockhart) out of any situation prior to Hogwarts AND had pretty great magical abilities before going only for his magical abilities to be honed while at school and his common sense abilities to be honed while he worked at Borgins and Burkes.\\
Like people scoffed at Harry using such a simple spell like Expelliarmus against curses despite that actually being a pretty common sense thing to try?

**** Except of course that any other person besides Voldemort would just dodge or block a disarming spell, and that "Expelliarmus" is strictly inferior to something like "Stupefy" which is both faster to say and also stops your opponent from throwing a knife at you once you turn your back.

It worked so well against Voldemort because Voldemort used a spell that's even slower to cast than the disarming spell and because he did not expect his spell to fail and thus didn't even try to dodge or block. Also the weird interaction with the wands.

Also it's not inferior of a spell the reason they tell him to stop using it is because it's become his signature spell when battling. No spell is weaker it's about who casts it faster and for those in tune with their wands (like it's made clear in book 7) the wizards wand knows the spell as soon as they think it but it's the wizards on skill and bond with their wand that allows the spell to be released.

****** Voldemort does not do his Killing Curse wordlessly though, ever, but granted with wordless magic the time it takes to say the word is less important, though you still need to do the wand gesture, which presumably is longer for spells that have longer words. And of course no spell is superior to any other in a vacuum, but in the context of a fight there are certainly spells that are better than others. For example a spell for turning your skin blue is likely not as effective in a fight as disarming or stunning. And stunning someone is clearly more effective than just taking their weapon away, because backup weapons are a thing.

******* he does do his killing curse wordlessly quite a few times in the book series, the times he does say it out loud with Harry has more to do with the fact that he wants Harry to know that he's aiming to kill not stun. Back-up weapons in Harry Potter would be someone else with a wand. It's always made clear that the minute someone is disarmed if there is no one coming to their aid then they are cornered and at the mercy of the person holding the wand. (see Dumbledore in Book 6 after Draco's disarmed him). For example you prevent someone from disapparating if they are wandless, you prevent someone from sending up a signal for help if they are wandless. You can stun someone but stunning doesn't always knock someone out because there's different levels of strength when stunning depending on many different factors like age, ability, health, whether someone is injured or not, and how many stunning spells they've been hit with. Whereas disarming them (even outside of magic) is always the common sense go to in dangerous situations with someone who has a weapon, you are to disarm them first.

In a fight with mundane ranged weapons, trying to disarm is suicidal.

--------------

And I would like to reiterate that blocking and dodging are things. It is absolutely not "common sense" to just try to disarm, or to immediately go for disarming. It is a sensible choice when it is the only offensive spell you know, or when you rely on arcane things like the phoenix feather wands interaction or the Elder Wand ownership. In a serious fight trying to disarm while your opponent conjures up a firestorm is not effective.

She still fundamentally considers herself a normal person first and a witch second, but Harry has completely assimilated the fact that he is a wizard while not losing himself in it. According to her, it's why he's a better wizard than she is.

I would also repeat some of the things ThisWanderer brought up: namely, that there are plenty of instances of her not showing any common sense at all. She refused to keep Crookshanks away from Scabbers, which was incredibly stupid of her. The infamous "or worse, expelled" line. For all her common sense, she still gets sucked into every half-baked plan or scheme that comes up. Hermione has book smarts, sure, but that's not the same as having common sense. Harry has more common sense than both Ron and Hermione on average, and only seems to lose it when Rowling needs him to be stupid for plot related reasons.

There's the polyjuice plot in second year.

Specifically that's what I can think of on the spot. Generally:

There's going along with all the various schemes. There's coming up with some of those various schemes.

There's all the various instances of emotional obtuseness and not understanding basic socialization, which can fall under common sense depending on the situation.

She's able to think logically in written/defined systems (magic, coursework, a puzzle). She's very frequently depicted as an archetypal "book smart:not street smart" character. That said, few characters in HP have consistent common sense.

You don't see that because it's so ridiculous, that it literally borders on complete immersion destruction.

JKR is many things. Good at deep world building is not one of them.

JKR failed at having a consistent theme for her world, and as such it falls apart at the seams. She started out writing a whimsical mystic world (Monty Python logic) but then transitioned into writing an action story that's more grounded in reality. Those two things she did not manage to mix well together and the result is the dissonant mess that is HP worldbuilding when taken as a whole.

The fact that wizards don't have any common sense and that the magical world is largely nonsensical is the single most interesting thing about the series, and it also explains away MOST of the things people traditionally have problems with in the plot or regarding the decisions certain characters have made.

The series would honestly have been objectively better if Rowling had remembered after book 4 that wizards are all loony. Their laws, their society, their history, and everything else makes infinitely more sense when you put that assumption front and center, and her attempt to make the series darker and edgier also, in direct proportion, made the series worse and more full of contradictions and problems than before. You cannot effectively shoo out the clowns when clowns are the Atlas that is holding up the foundation of your world.

The fact that wizards don't really think about or consider nonmagical solutions to normal problems is the recurring theme of the series, and if Rowling was a truly skilled writer, Voldemort's ultimate defeat at Harry's hands would have been a book-end to that sentiment.
