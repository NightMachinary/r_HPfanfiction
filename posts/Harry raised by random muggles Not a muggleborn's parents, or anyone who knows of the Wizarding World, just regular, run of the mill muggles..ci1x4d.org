** I vaguely remember a story where he was raised by a muggle woman named Natalie? She became famous for defeating Bellatrix with a frying pan. She did marry a muggleborn later though, and Harry met other muggleborn kids and magical people pre-Hogwarts. Probably not what you want exactly, but if you're interested I'll go find it.

I /think/ in this fic Harry is adopted by random muggles but Sirius is still a part of his childhood and Sirius-Harry relationship is the main focus of the fic. However, the muggles are still a huge part esp in the sequels.

***** Search up some Noodlehammer threads for the full explanation, but it's basically a case of a decent writer using his work/characters as a mouthpiece for personal views. Like H.P. Lovecraft.

I agree with [[/u/Imumybuddy][u/Imumybuddy]] 's view:

He's a divisive author, predominantly for rampant Islamaphobia and general hatred directed towards religion, among other things.

I tried reading his stories, but For Love of Magic quickly went from standard, independent Harry, to a sex-crazed maniac with a severe superiority complex.

The writing itself is good, but the characters read like they're the adult version of a horny, angry teenagers daydreams.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.
