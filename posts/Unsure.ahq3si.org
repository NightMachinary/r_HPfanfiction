I used to write quite a bit a few years ago and since have stopped completely writing anything. However right now I am wondering if I should pick it up again.

It is of course not only the question if j should start writing again and if so should I write in English as it is not my native toung.

Even tho I have tried to start writing again I never came far the last few years sometimes I started writing but after 2k or so words I would just hit a stop and find no way around it. Therefore I have around dozen stated story's and even more formulated ideas. However I don't know if I should try and go on with thoes or start anew.

So of you have any Tipps regarding that sort of situation I would be delighted to hear about them


** Start off with one shots, get hooked on the delicious rush of reviews.

**** One shots are a good way to start. When I started in HP fanfic, I made myself stick to one shots because I had a history of abandoning longer works. Self-contained single stories are good for teaching yourself how to effectively plot a single story arc and get in the groove of beginning, middle and end.

It's also a good way to get quick feedback on your writing without getting bound up and frustrated by a longer work. Each story you create can either stand on its own or be part of an interconnected series like my own stories.

Whatever you decide, I hope it's to decide to write!

** I've been a reader for 5-6 years with no inclination/desire to ever write a word until a few months ago when an idea struck me and I started writing because I suddenly had the urge. It has been great and the feedback I've received has been encouraging.

Will I ever write anything after I'm done with my current story? I have no clue. But I will only do it if I think I have something to say and most importantly want to write it.

So I guess I would turn it around on you. Do you want to write? If so do it and don't worry about anything else. If you are trying to force it because it's something you used to enjoy then it doesn't seem like it would be worth the effort.

My tip would be thinking about what you would like to read that you've never seen before...something unique...that is what spurred me to give it a try.

** I write fics for another fandom so I can relate to what you're going through. I have so many stories started and I don't think they'll ever get written. However, I have pushed through on some of them.

I find that if I make a timeline of the story, it helps me tremendously. I don't necessarily follow it, but if I want key scenes in the story I have it listed and can get on track to get to that idea.

Maybe you should work backwards? Write the ending first and figure out how to get there. Or maybe write the middle and see where that takes you.

Have you posted any of your work online? I find that if I post a chapter and someone comments on it, it makes me want to write more.

Good luck with everything!

**** When I was writing my first long-form story for another fandom, I made a plan exactly because I had abandoned a HP fic years before after I lost my draft files. Basically I wrote as much as the story as I could first, and when I felt confident I had a good number of chapters that I could post once a week for a few months while I worked on ending the fic, I started posting it. But it really depends on what kind of personality you have as fic writer. If you are motivated by reviews, then this won't work for you, because you would be doing so much of the writing in the dark. But if you just want to write the fic because you can't get the idea out of your head, maybe give yourself some time with it before posting.
