“Oppugno!” came a shriek from the doorway. Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, her expression wild: The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach. From HBP.

As you can see, when Ron doesn't give Hermione the time of day, and spends some quality time with a good looking girl. Hermione gets upset and furious with Ron and physically harm him. Hermione is a hypocrite character that can do whatever she thinks is right at the moment. Hermione's a independent, straight forward girl who knows what she wants. Ron's a guy who can't figure out his feelings for Hermione. In HBP, Hermione obviously likes Ron and wants to try her hand at a relationship. So why is that she is waiting for Ron to make the first move?

And Don't give me the shit that a guy is supposed to act out first.

There are several things like this that people don't point out about their favourite characters.


** Well, let's face it: Hermione is a Mary Sue. JKR's complete Mary Sue, that many of us identified a lot with when we were young and thought we were the only reading, clever girl around.

All of the good qualities of all the houses are united in her.

She is as brave and upstanding as a Gryffindor, as smart and studious as a Ravenclaw, as loyal and nice as a Hufflepuff, as cunning and clever as a Slytherin.

So yeah, JKR even tried to gave Hermione some tiny little flaws, but she never made her suffer for them, because that is what you do with Mary Sues.

If Hermione were a Sue, you wouldn't have a proliferation of fem!Harry fics in which fem!Harry has all of Hermione's virtues and talents but none of her flaws and limitations.

** The flaws need to matter. Seeing that Hermione never suffers any consequences or get in trouble or even at least confronted because of her flaws, she might as well not have them.

Or even when at first it seems like some of her actions are not portrayed in a good light, she's nearly always vindicated eventually. Like how everyone thinks SPEW is stupid, but at the end Dumbledore says she was right. Or how she doesn't believe Ron could be Prefect instead of Harrry, and then we find out that she was 100% correct in assuming that.

It's like when people say Batman has many flaws. Like how he's too paranoid. Except that he almost always turns out to be right, so he really isn't paranoid.

Compare this to Harry. His reckless attitude got Sirius killed. His flaws have impact on the story, he suffers consequenes for them.

In loose chronological order, almost killed by a troll, turned into a catgirl, petrified, ostracised by her friends, wastes time on an ineffective campaign, is almost expelled, gets cursed worse than anyone else at the Department of Mysteries, loses out in Potions, fails to prevent DEs from raiding Hogwarts, distracts Harry from the Hallows, gets tortured.

To be fair, and as Ron mentions later in the book, this does not really count. Hermione said she could bring a guest, not a date, a guest. Harry went with Luna who was also a guest and not a date. Hermione inviting Ron (who is one of his 2 best friend and the only one without an invitation) as a guest does not count as her making a first move which is ignored by Ron.

** Honestly to me the problem isnt that Hermione has flaws but that she doesn't get to be wrong much. Not that she never does anything questionable; she does clearly. But as far as the narrative is concerned shes not wrong. She's justified.

For example in half blood prince she is a bit jealous of snape's book and gets suspicious of it. But because in the end she was right to be suspicious her jealousy is never adressed. She never got that chance to self reflect and grow because the narrative didn't let her be wrong.

The books especially later ones are full of instances like this. I love Hermione but i can't help but think how much more interesting and compelling she'd be if opportunities to be wrong and grow were capitalized on more. So its kinda a shame it wasn't weren't and still isn't. I dont often see much self reflection of Hermione that leads to character growth. Usually when i see many flaws highlighted or called out it just leads to bashing.

To be fair this is fanfic and people don't usually call out their favs like that. But i have seen this sort of thing on fanfics. Many Draco centric fics will call him out drag him for his flaws make him wrong because he is and then lead him to character growth. Now I understand there's much more to call in Draco than Hermione. I also get alot of the appeal to fic Draco is what could have been not what was. But It does result in more compelling stories for Draco and it would be nice to see that with characters i like more than him.

She only does this with Harry and Ron, who are her best friends. Maybe I'm the weird one here, but I think you do have the freedom to do this with your besties. If you don't, you're not that close with them in the first place.

She calls him out when he's cheating in class and using unknown spells - it's what anyone with a brain cell would do. If he had aimed towards Malfoy's head, or if Snape was taking a nap, Harry would have enjoyed some quality time with the Aurors.

Worst part is that Harry still thinks he's in the right.

If a student was taught a subject by their older sibling is that cheating? She was annoyed because Harry was doing better at her.

Also I would assume the immediate gloating was what is considered not perfect. Then again maybe next time a friend of mine fucks up really badly and is in shock I'll take the opportunity to gloat about how I was right.

Also btw, slapping someone and having birds claw them everywhere until there were multiple scars are completely different. You telling me that if Ron had slugged Hermione in the face so hard that it bruised her or broke her nose because he was jealous that she dating someone else it would have been fine because there's nothing wrong with a little violence between friends?

Seeing as there is a prize for the best brewed potion in the first class, it's quite clear that it is an open book test.

The modifications in Snape's book aren't Harry's work - and using someone else's knowledge to improve your own results in a test is, quite clearly, cheating. He never even tries to verify Snape's scribblings, ever, throughout the course of the year.

This should be obvious.

She is rightfully annoyed - her friend cheats her out of something that should be rightfully hers, seeing as Harry's usual potion work without Snape's modifications is next to unusable.

Are we reading the same lines here? Harry isn't "in shock". He's being a whinging little shit, refusing that he was in the wrong. Sectumsempra could have just as easily have been something like a "skull exploding curse". What would his excuse have been then?

****** She wasn't upset about the prize, she was upset about not being the best at making potions in general. Even after the test she was annoyed at Harry for using different instructions even-though nothing states that you can't do that.

That's the dumbest definition of cheating I have ever seen. Every student in existence uses someone's else knowledge to improve your test score, that's how people study unless they invented the contents themselves. You telling me everyone who has ever used notes that weren't written by them to study is a cheater?

If a student passes their medical exams because they studied the notes given by their senior which pointed out buzzwords , are they cheating? If a student finds a website that teaches how to easily solve complex maths formula in a simplified manner instead of the more long-winded one, are they cheating when they become the best maths student in their class? Now it they were using those notes in a close book test than yeah they are cheating.

"rightfully", potions is all about following the instructions written and Harry followed instructions that were superior to what she used and won. There's a difference between copying someone's work (which can't be done in Potions anyway since it's a basically cooking with instructions given) and using a different cooking recipe.

I mean considering the opponent was trying to fire an illegal curse on him, I assume his excuse would be under duress or self defense. Also considering he skipped dinner and had no appetite after that incident of almost killing Malfoy I would assume he was in shock but hey, what do I know, I'm sure he was completely fine.

Maybe you haven't ever taken a test where you have to answer the question in a given manner - but I can guarantee that if you do solve it in a different manner than what is expected, you will get a zero.

When literally every other student uses one particular method of solution and one single student uses concepts from something more advanced/original that they themselves did not come up with as a shortcut, that is unfair advantage, and is cheating.

HP did not come up with Snape's methods or instructions, and therefore has no right to be using those in an open-book test.

Go ahead and try this. Solve a basic mechanics problem from high school that specifies you to solve it with basic Newtonian mechanics with Hamiltonian theory and see what happens. You will get a zero.

Or a math problem that asks you to solve a problem without using graphs, and you use graphs anyway, "because it's easier". You will get a zero for being a smartass. As someone who has graded papers for

Yes, this will work wonderfully when he's put on trial for murder. "B-b-but Malfoy was trying to use the Cruciatus curse! I heard him start to say Cru- that's why I cut his head off!"

Get real. In case the spell goes wrong and he kills Malfoy, it will be Harry's bumbling excuses against a dead body. And what's more, when they inspect Malfoy's wand, there won't be a single spell fired - it will appear as a completely unprovoked use of Sectumsempra.

******** By that logic Snape was cheating throughout his years at Hogwarts for failing to follow the notes given and using his own providing himself an unfair advantage cause the only thing that matters is methods .Or maybe Potion teachers only care about results. Also Slughorn was observing all the students,you think he never once noticed that Harry did something different? Or was it more likely that Slughorn was looking at the results and making sure that it was going along all right.

Yeah you do realize not every subject marks based of method right?Wanna go with cooking instead? Slughorn never said to follow the textbook, nothing makes it cheating. You just don't wanna admit that Hermione was just annoyed at Harry doing better than her at the subject. If he was really cheating in class you think Hermione of all people would not tell if Harry had been cheating in class?

Please, I'm sure people would believe that the son of a Death Eater who spent years antagonizing Harry Potter the chosen one who will take down Voldemort would try and torture him and Harry reacted quickly but with the wrong spell.

How about chemistry? Potions is a lot closer to chemistry than cooking, since it turns substances that are otherwise completely poisonous to new substances with very different properties. When someone asks you why chemicals react in a specific manner under the proper conditions, do you go and say "Well that doesn't really matter, all that matters is the end product!"

Harry does better than her at Defence as well, and he's been doing better than her ever since third year. I don't Hermione throwing a sulk because he's doing better in that class. I'd say he's doing about the same as she is at Charms, and you don't see her throwing a tantrum then either.

And with a witness present? In a high profile case like that, with someone as famous as Harry and Malfoy, son of a convicted Death Eater? Have fun with the legal precedent that would set.

Harry's not going to be sent to Azkaban because of the political climate, but his dreams of joining the Aurors or any kind of job in law enforcement? He can kiss that goodbye.

** Because relationships and people are complicated. Just because Hermione, in certain situations, doesn't have a problem with speaking up or making decisions doesn't mean that that's going to continue into her relationships as well. She might not be feeling particularly confident in her worth as a woman, or in her desirability, or she might just be scared to say how she feels because she's afraid of being rejected or losing her friendship with Ron. While I'm not particularly a fan of how Lavender was portrayed in the books, it's hardly fair to say that Hermione wouldn't have been emotionally affected by the object of her affections kissing someone else. This shit is complicated and sometimes leads to situations like attacking yellow birds. In the HP universe, at least.

Yes hermione is flawed just like all well written characters are. She was upset and lashed out. Not that ron was entirely innocent in this scene either. We all know he harbored feeling for hermione at the same time. Imo he simply went with lavender because she was safe. Asking hermione out would have open the option that she didnt return his feelings which would lead to awkwardness and possibly the loss of their friendship. I figure hermion would have a similar thought process. Yes hermione was a logical level headed young woman but since when do logic and reason come into play in matters of the heart?

And to tell you that you are pulling that 'magical equivalent of her slapping him across the face' (which would also be entirely unwarranted and UNACCEPTABLE, simply because he *dares* to be romantically involved with someone other than her), this is a quote of what actually happened to him: */"the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach."/*

You can still like Hermione, because she has done some great things in the series, but what she did to Ron here was: vindictive, wrong, cruel and entirely unwarranted.
