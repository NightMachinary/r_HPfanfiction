Also if you have any recommendations that take place inside the HP universe but aren't solely based on the adventures of the golden trio


** Author juniperwindsong writes some really good ones. I really enjoyed linkffn(13447037). I haven't read its sequel yet but it's on my list.

  If Felix Rosier, age sixteen, strict Slytherin prefect and manically dedicated 6th year student, had been told that one year in the future he would be spending nearly a third of each week sneaking out of the school to visit a dragon in the Forbidden Forest, he would have docked points from whatever student was making up such a slanderous lie.

** I will bookmark and get back to you because I'm actually working on one! Set after the game, it's about Merula struggling to figure out which side of the war shes on and features a few characters from both the game and the films.
