Seriously, the animagus form is a reflection of a person's inner/true self. If you have more than one, then aren't you implying that your character is schizophrenic or bipolar or something?

â€‹

Edit: autocorrect mistake


** Since it represents a totemic self, yeah, I'd say the edgelords with two forms are having multiple personality issues... or they're carrying around another soul in their head.

I now have this notion about sporking the trope with a Harry who warns people "You don't want to wake the Dragon!!!" whenever he's close to a complete spaz-out. The irony, of course, is that he isn't speaking metaphorically. Voldemort can assume control of Harry and transform him into this great Wyrm hybrid form, though no one would be left alive after the Mr. Hyde moment passes.

Vernon and Dudley would have been eaten in the early years. The troll? Eaten. Hermione? Hypnotised. Fluffy? Dead from venom.

... and Snape? Retired.

*** Introducing them is relevant because an animagus form tells us a lot about a character. It's not a fancy new spell, it's a challenging process that dives into the core of the person is.

**** Tell that to stories where Harry has multiple forms. For them it's just a stat that shows how overpowered Harry is, like Gearscore in World of Warcraft or XVM/WN8 in WoT.

You are basically asking for the university degrees of streetworkers high on crack here, multiple animagus stories are neither known for quality nor for consistency or a balanced magical system. Usually the inclusion of that trope is enough to dismiss it if you value quality.

***** I know you're right, but it would also be interesting if a story had a multi-animagus Harry who was suffering mental issues due to sharing space with a Horcrux. Even after Horcrux is gone, the imprint it leaves behind means Harry developed a secondary personality or something.

****** There is a story, but it's not due to the Horcrux, it's a genuine multiple personalities disorder. If I recall correctly, they weren't super special creatures, just normal animals - cat, birds, snake - and I think one of them was actually deformed or injured, because that personality gathered all the traumatic memories, and had little personality outside of the trauma, therefore the inner animal reflected that.

*** I'm suddenly thinking about parallels to Pokemon collections.

Everyone's first lesson at age 11 is an animagus form, generally something unimpressive-looking like a mouse or a small bird. As they advance through school, they achieve more and more forms, and the precise number or nature of your forms can be a point of pride or ridicule.

******* True! But also getting a progressively deeper-living fish, and switching the deeper you swim, until you can check out the Mariana Trench would be awesome. I'm not sure if there's a charm that would let someone on Gillyweed survive down there or not, but I suspect there would need to be more major changes than flippers and gills.

******** The water pressure would be absolutely lethal and its completely dark down there, so I'm not sure if that would really be a good experience. You won't be seeing much down there and a diving Roboter or even a magically reinforced submarine would be more useful since you have lights to actually see something.

********* Well the fish and other life down there manage with their other senses, or with their own headlamps, and I think it'd be fascinating to really check it out. Especially with the deep-sea giantism that happens...imagine seeing a giant squid! Deep water scares the shit out of me though, so I understand not being all that interested in it...it just looks so cool.

** Depends on how you look at it. The animagus form could represent one facet of a person's true self, rather than the whole of it. Therefore, there one could have more than one animagus form. Another way of looking at it is from the perspective of identity as a fluid and changeable concept. What you identify most strongly with at one point in time can change easily, and multiple animagus forms could represent that. In that line of thought, I do wonder if there's a fic out there where people's animagus forms vary throughout stages of their life (a bit like the Patronus form, but shifting more frequently and fluidly). But anyway, that's just a tangential thought.

**** Yeah, it makes more sense if it's a representation of all your traits, and that's probably how Rowling meant it too. But I can also see how others might look at it that way (the animagus form represents only one facet of a person's true self), and therefore, what authors who have used the multiple animagus form trope might have used as the reason for why a character has multiple animagi (other than magical power).

*** Sometimes I wonder if maybe it's a representation of a magicals character /at the moment they first transform/. Mostly as McGonagall doesn't seem very cat-like to me. But maybe she was at age 20 though.
