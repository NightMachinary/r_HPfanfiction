Sick of Draco ignoring her blatant flirting, Astoria uses Section 17 subsection C of Harry and Daphne's betrothal contract "If a younger daughter of the House may take this betrothal upon them" to get back at him

** Lucky you, you dream of strange Harry Potter fanfiction prompt while I dream of wack as shit things like riding a polar bear in a pine forest with an ice crown and seeing my family being killed by some kind of ripoff Poison Ivy before I try to escape in some kind of city/labyrinth with many vines with thorns in it.
