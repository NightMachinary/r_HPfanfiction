:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Basicly it was a fic where harry had this inixplicable personal sheild constantly sapping a large portion of his magic. It basicly made it so he couldn't get hurt, and that was the basis of the entire fic.

Edit: It was on either Ffn or ao3. And the actual sheild part started during his childhood.


** I believe I have read a fic or two that may fit your request so I'll look for it. If it's the one I'm thinking of at one point Harry is at the ministry and has an official duel with Lucius Malfoy in a dueling "pit". Malfoy uses the Killing Curse and Lily's image surrounds Harry and reflects the Curse back to Malfoy.

If that isn't it there's another fic where Harry learned to maintain a permanent shield around himself.

  Harry undergoes Maturity early, thrusting him into the adult world with no warning. H/Multi; Powerful!Political!StillATeenager!Harry; Whump!Thump!Bash!Weasleys. Expanded, much better summary inside. In response to the question: The Retired Feature Story ribbon is from Chad, the Admin of the site. He used to do Featured Stories but stopped.

** Can you think of any other scene that stands out in your mind? And is it a power shield or does it strengthen his body including his skin? And I'm assuming the story and this shield starts with Harry in his cupboard.

*** I'm fairly certain it was something akin to a bubble sheild, (forming a forcefield around him. I don't thing it was a scenario of making his skin tougher. It was a either a one shot/short story if that helps.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.
