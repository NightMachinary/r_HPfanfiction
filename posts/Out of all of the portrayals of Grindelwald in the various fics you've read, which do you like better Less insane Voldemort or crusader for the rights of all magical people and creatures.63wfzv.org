** We know that Grindelwald is a Magic Supremacist and builds his ideology onto this belief system surrounding the ominous "Greater Good". However, other than Dumbledore, Grindelwald has no qualms when it comes to horrific violence to achieve the goal of this ideology.

I'm a fan of a villain with agency. I'd make Grindelwald out to be someone who genuinely thought that the muggles needed to be controlled for the sake of everyone on the planet. Given the time when his campaign played out, you can't even blame him. Wizards and witches hide behind magical barriers, obliviation squads and secrecy, suppressing the wonders and beauty of fulminant magic in order to not startle the muggles. Meanwhile the world of no-magic rips itself apart with fire, mustard gas and hailstorms made of lead - millions dying in trenches, millions dying of bombs and gas, millions dying of hunger and disease. By all accounts, the world of the muggles looked a lot like rabid dogs tearing each other to shreds.

On the other hand I also imagine that he had no limits to his acceptance of magic. If it was magic, it was worthy. Period. Muggleborn, Halfblood, Halfbreeds,... didn't matter as long as magic was in their veins. When I imagine Grindelwalds armies, I always imagine entire cavalries of centaurs, lead by the promises of vast woodlands and plains for them alone after the muggles were kept from detroying and exploiting them. I imagine Veela as assassins in his ranks, charming officers and auror captain alike, to thin out the ranks of Gellerts enemies. I imagine Mermen plunder muggle ships on his command, in exchange for the promise of vast reefs and schools of fish unharmed by humans. And of course, I imagine the battalions of wizards and witches, werewolves, hags, vampires, slighted by the Statute and kept down by those who followed it, flocking behind their leader and the dream of great wizarding nations, ruling over the muggle savages.

Thats the villain I'd like to see Grindelwald become. Ruthless and without mercy, but with genuine agency and ideology.

** Both of those options, I'm not a fan of. He was a magical supremacist, end of story.

Frankly, the only portrayal I think is any level of good (outside of the terror that is linkffn(Concentric Wavelengths)) is in the first chapter of linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure).

*** The one element of Grindelwald's character that I feel like I failed to portray was the undercurrent of sadism. He did get kicked out of Durmstrang for crazy experiments, after all. Beneath the veneer of rationality and logical justification there should be a layer of cruelty. But then he would be a pretty shitty leader if it was obvious from the moment you met him.

**** In my perfect, Grindelwald fic, he'd be a magical supremacist, but then within wizards and witches Grindelwald would be a proponent of a strict meritocracy. No idea where I would put him on the issues of creatures, but other than Goblins, Giants, werewolves and Centaurs, I don't honestly know how important it would be.

******* Hm...you could make a case that wizards are better than us, but only because of one thing:

They don't destroy the planet by living on it (!) - they don't use cars, they don't need (or want) electricity (in most cases, some muggleborns might want it), they don't use plastic, they don't mine for uranium. they don't burn oil/coal for electricity (don't need it - "Lumos!") etc.

Over all the planet wouldn't probably be better of with only magicals on it - on the other hand:

They are pretty stagnant, most stuff that can be done has been done (instant transportation? Sure, floo, portkeys and apparition! Levitating stuff? Damned, one of the first lessons at Hogwarts! Wingardium Leviosa! - etc. etc.) and they aren't curios (they don't want or need to go to space for example!) anymore...not to mention that having magic warps their perception (most purebloods lack common sense for example and logic isn't their strong suit either!)

As for Grindelwald? He's a crusader for wizard-/witch-rights...don't know if he cares about creatures at all (he's pretty sophisticated, but cruel - kind of a Lucius Malfoy who made it and has real power (not only behind the scenes via bribery!))...so yeah, he's a magical-supremacist (don't know if he's pureblood-supremacist...we don't truly know what he thinks of the muggleborn!), he wants to control muggles (rule over them!) - we don't know how extreme he would be however:

Would he wipe them out (except for a tiny minority to be used as servants?)? Would he force some kind of mind-control-brand on them or something? Would he let them live in peace as long as they obeyed him and left magicals along (and obeyed them if they told them to do something)?

We don't really know!

** Less crazy Voldemort, but entirely against the statute of secrecy. I mean, we'll see how his character gets developed in the films, but I see him as less "happy go murder" like how Voldemort is often portrayed, and more "stop magical people from needing to /hide/ and let them retake their proper place on top by any means"

Unfortunately whenever I'm reading a fic with Grindelwald in it, there's like /one/ thing I like about how he's written.

I like this interpretation of Grindelwald! It was the only thing I really enjoyed of /Fantastic Beasts/ except the reveal was kind of shoddy and I just wanted Colin Farrell's character - Graves, was it? - to be legit and a supporter. When they start making sense, they're at their most dangerous.

**** Exactly! I love a villain that you can *understand* because that's when they get scary. Evil for evil's sake gets silly at a certain point, and even blood supremacy gets hard to understand unless the writer brings in the idea of some certain culture that's fallen out of favor that they want to preserve (which in itself has become a trope).

** I liked Starfox5's interpretation, that a core of Grindelwald's philosophy, besides ruling the muggles, was equality for all wizards - no discrimination regarding blood. Thus a large number of muggleborns flocked to his army, which in turn bit them in the ass when he was defeated, cause the winners weren't exactly kind.
