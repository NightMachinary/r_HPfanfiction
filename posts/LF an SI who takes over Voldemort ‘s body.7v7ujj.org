Looking for a story where the self insert wakes up as Voldemort and has to pick up where the original Voldemort left off. I'm especially curious if there are any stories where the SI enters during a bad time (e.g. while Voldemort falls unconscious after trying to kill Harry at the end of book 7), and the original Voldy either is totally unreliable due to being batshit crazy or is just not available to help.

The SI can be good or evil. Thank you very much!


** Linkffn(the Evil overlord list) Not exactly what you asked for, but as close as I could find. SI is Tom Riddle's voice in the head that tells him how to rule the world the right way.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

** Does this SI keep Voldemort's power?

Does this SI know of future events?

Does this SI bring along a new soul, or still have Voldemort's broken soul? If the latter is the case, will this SI become just as insane as Voldemort?

*** Lol I'm also curious what people have written in regards to these questions.

I'm guessing most ppl would give him power, foreknowledge, and a whole soul. I'd think foreknowledge is probably the easiest of the three for an SI to do without. Although, it might be kind of interesting to have an SI who has to bluff his way to victory like the Wizard of Oz, or has to stop self from slowing going insane...

** That'd be kind of depressing, actually; there aren't a whole lot of places where someone could loop in as Voldemort and go have a normal-ish life that doesn't involve killing anybody.

I mean, there's the first wizarding war where everyone who isn't a psychopathic Death Eater wants him dead, the over-a-decade where he's a bodiless spirit, the year during which the Ministry is denying his return, the couple of years after that where he's leading a war and everyone who isn't a Death Eater wants him dead again...

...Actually, I wonder if year 5, shortly after Voldemort regains his body, could be a good-ish time to loop in; everyone believes Voldemort is dead so with a few cosmetic charms our OC could just go vanish somewhere.

In any case, though it's not an OC, linkffn(7447454) is about Harry himself getting into Voldemort's mind while the latter is on holiday. It's pretty funny.

And, it's not Harry Potter, but there's this MLP fanfiction called Hail To The King where a human ends up in Sombra's body following the latter's defeat. That's the only thing that comes to mind with the 'right after book 7' thing.

  Dark Lord Voldemort needed a vacation. He even had the perfect plan so that his followers would not even notice his weeklong spree. Too bad his closest horcrux resided in Harry James Potter, the "Brat-Who-Lived"!
