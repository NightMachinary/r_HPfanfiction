  When Voldemort attacked he didn't kill Lily and James. When he met his downfall they mistook Harry's twin as the GWL, they send their son away to the Dursleys but he doesn't quite make it in to the Dursley's loving care. Harry will take Hogwarts and his 'family' by storm and by the time the 'light' realize their mistake it will be too late for them to fix. OOC!Dark!Powerful!Harry.

** The closest fic that meets your description is probably linkffn(Harry Potter: Wizards at War). Warning though, I would say this is not a great fic by any stretch, merely that it fits your description.

There are also several fics where Harry or others meet portraits/horcruxes/etc. of the founders such as A Cadmean Victory, but they usually do not involve time travel. You may also be interested in some reincarnation fics as well, but they generally involve Salazar Slytherin reincarnating as Harry or Hermione and becoming Indie.

  Pre-HBP. Sirius is gone. Harry disappears. The war is starting to get worse. They need their heroes, which is exactly what they will get.

** Harry's date with Voldemort at the conclusion of the Triwizard tournament didn't go quite as planned. Fate steps in with a 'unique' opportunity, offering Harry the chance to live and mature in the past. For a while, anyway.
