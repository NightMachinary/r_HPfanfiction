it can be ocs or canon characters, i just read linkao3(14423964) and it made me want more fics focusing on i guess nontraditional magic use. (considering my main fandom is The Magicians and im currently hyperfocused on hedgewitches from there, i guess im asking for hedgewitch-eqsue situations but in the hp universe or somethign similar?

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

** linkao3(7693897) has Harry not going to Hogwarts and figuring out magic on his own. It's not about a group of muggleborns but it definitely has lots of nontraditional magic.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhk√§se.
