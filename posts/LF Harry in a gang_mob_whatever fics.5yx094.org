Harry in a gang, starting a gang, taking over a gang, being adopted by a gang boss, whatever. Harry is involved with a gang. Preferably major Hogwarts AU, not just plot regurgitation with him ruthless instead of brave, but I'll take what I can get.

Slash, dark!harry, bashing and crossovers are fine. Please no genderbending, harems, mpreg, smut/romance-centric plots or pottercest. Thank you!


** strength of steel wings -adopted by a gang [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings]]

vahan - starts his own mob basically (not as good as other fic imo) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10808106/1/Vahan]]

*** Yeah, just re-read a bit of Vahan. Mostly because I remembered the scene where he gets taken in by cops and wanted to read it again

** You might like linkao3(Business by esama), where Harry becomes the Napoleon of magical crime.

It's one of those solid one-shots that has a great ending but also simultaneously manages to upset me because it would be glorious as a fully fleshed-out version. It's also good despite some tired plot devices -- like goblins with connections or precocious, intelligent Harry -- that would not work nearly half as well if this fic had a different writer.

  Where there is a Moriarty, there must also be a Holmes. Now let's see if she is up to the task.AN: Based on 'Business' by esama. Reading that first is required to understand the story.
