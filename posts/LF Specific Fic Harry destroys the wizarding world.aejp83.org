I cannot recall if this fic is any good, though I believe the writing wasn't bad.\\
What I remember:\\
--Harry is in prison for killing Umbridge (post-war?) and set to get the Dementor's Kiss

--Lots of politics. Hermione works for the Ministry/Shacklebolt and is trying to get Harry to sign something to avert the civil war his demise will cause

-- Spoiler: Harry had the whole thing planned out. I think the purpose of everything was civil war.

--Daphne Greengrass also worked for the Ministry, was sympathetic to Harry

--I think the Dementors were scared of Harry.

​

Any help is appreciated. I honestly can't recall if I even liked this fic, but it's been on my mind and I'd like to reread it.\\
Thanks.

*** Is that smut? It doesn't look like it and far as I know, that's all that author ever writes. It's kind of unsettling, like if Robst wrote a story where Harry wasn't paired with Hermione...

**** Not at all, if I remember correctly (haven't started the reread). I don't recall any real pairings other than Harry maybe having something going on (referred to, but not narrated) with a female prison guard. Never read anything else by this author though.

I'm not surprised since he seems to despise Hermione. Is that the requirement now for having "not Mary Sue" Hermione?

****** He doesn't hate Hermione! She's a fictional character and has no feelings, so he can't really hate her! He just writes her in a way that will only show her in the worst possible light.

** Significant Digits is similar. Complex politics, Dementors scared of Harry (for a reason, Azkaban doesn't exist any more), and the Wizarding World probably won't survive the ending.

  Harry Potter is sent to prision for a crime he did commit. Now they need their hero back but he's lost all interest in saving them. They threw him away and now its going to cost them. Note rating! One-shot.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. After ten years in Azkaban Harry emerges a changed man. Enlightened and respectful, he is creature of magic full of disappointment and shame in his own race. And yet wielding power that none can match.
