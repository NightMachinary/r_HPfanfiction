:FlairText: Request/What's that Fic?
:END:
So, there's a fic where Ron gets the whole of his Gryffindor yearmates to help him get Hermione and Harry together and their every effort goes comically wrong - I'm trying to find that fic, first.

Second, are there any Harmony fics where Ron isn't the bad guy? Like the first I mentioned, or like Crazy Little Things by dreiser (which is Hermione-Luna, but assuming the ship changed) where they're quite amiable post-breakup. If he ships the heck out of Harry and Hermione and is basically a squeeing Tumblr fangirl whenever they do something vaguely romantic, extra kudos indeed. :)

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** Fics that do this properly would be golden, mostly because this very ship is split between two militant sets of fans:

1) Diehard Harmony shippers who bash all the Weasleys except the twins, maybe. Add in a sprinkle of Dumbledore-bashing while you're at it. These are called Harmonians.

2) Rabid, canon-worshipping Romione fans who attack on sight the moment they get even a hint of Harmony, whether in conversational, text, fic, image, or any other kind of form. If you're not with them, then you're their enemy. They only deal in absolutes between canon and non-canon, with the latter being deemed the biggest sin on Earth.

On the one side, you've got Harmonians who want to override canon with their own ship, and on the other side, you've got the reverse mindset where, er, 'Romonians?' bask in their canon victory and refuse to even consider the possibility of two good friends getting together. Oh, and they hate the films and, especially, Steve Kloves too. Their favourite word in the entire dictionary, and the main weapon in their arsenal, is 'platonic'.

It takes a smart mind to stand in the middle and go: Hey, Harry and Hermione are a pretty decent pairing that could've developed in the plot, had J.K. Rowling wanted to go that route. They've got a solid foundation to start a relationship over time, irrespective of their differences and, perhaps, conflicting personalities.

In real life, two friends like Harry and Hermione would have a solid chance of one day ending up in each other's arms doing more than just 'platonic' hugging. So it'd be great to find a fic or two where Ron is neither villified (by Harmonians) nor anti-film worshipped (by diehard Romonians who want to show that they know The Book Canon™).

In canon, Ron definitely displayed jealousy and hostility towards those getting closer towards Hermione (basically Viktor Krum). But we shouldn't forget that Krum was an outsider, whereas Harry was just as much of a friend, if not better, to Ron as Hermione was. So, naturally, I can see Ron definitely wanting his best mates to be happy in each others arms.

Thanks for coming to my Harmony-Romione Ted Talk.

  We need somewhere to learn to fight... he thought. A place to practice... somewhere they can't find us... “...A place to fight the Ministry...” Hermione's voice whispered. A place to learn how to protect people... Ron's lips mouthed. A heavy wooden door appeared, the ageing wood so ancient it appeared almost black -- if not for the single bright unaged golden design embossed upon its surface. A strangely stylised A without the middle bar, the base of the letter spiking out in only to curl in again like a pair of tongs, beneath it an almost bow shaped underline with three notches spiking out along its length, all contained within a circle. Three different desires blended into one open a different door to a new future, new possibilities, a new war, and the revival of a forgotten Chapter of the Brotherhood. It's about time the Wizarding World got a little freedom forced into it.

******* On Ao3, there are 233,837 HP fics at the time of writing this post (4/8/20, 9:08 PM EST)

109,118 of them are M/M, or 46.66% of all HP ao3 fics.

37,528 fics are Drarry, or 29.81% of all M/M fics, also 16.05% of all HP ao3 fics.

11,107 fics are Snarry, or 10.18% of all M/M fics, also 4.75% of all HP ao3 fics.

The issue with Voldemort fics on ao3 is that people tag them either:

- Harry Potter/Tom Riddle

- Harry Potter/Lord Voldemort

- Harry Potter/Tom Riddle | Voldemort

Luckily, if we filter by the third pairing, that gives us all the 5,687 HP/LV fics in any form, or 5.21% of all M/M fics, also 2.43% of all HP ao3 fics.

Surprisingly, there's only 800 Lucius/Harry fics on ao3, only making up 0.73% of M/M fics, or 0.34% of all HP ao3 fics.

In short, these four pairings comprise 55,122 fics, 45.93% of all M/M fics, and 23.57% of all HP fanfic on ao3, which is insane, considering it's only FOUR pairings.

**** If you want a source of conflict, then not bashing Ron is actually the much better way. A hostile idiot!Ron or Potion!Ron doesn't generate much of a conflict - more like a curbstomp usually - and it's a binary one. A good Ron being a rival for Hermione's affection on the other hand, that's a conflict. You don't want to hurt your rival, you want to remain friends with him, and yet... you also want the girl.

(Of course, in such a constellation, Ron could win out. It happened to me when a story I originally planned as a Harry/Hermione story ended up Ron/Hermione because as I wrote, Ron ended up winning her heart. Entirely through me writing what I considered their most likely actions and reactions, nota bene - it wasn't planned out up until the scene where Hermione made her decision.)

***** I never said it was good - just what I think their reasoning was (first rule of psychology - reasoning only has to make sense to the person doing the reasoning :D).

But honestly, IMO any trope can be good for anything, if it's used right. Potion!Ron can use the Pureblood-Law Tropes in conjuction to turn a basic romantic conflict into a big political governmental one, for instance (It's not illegal for a Pureblood to potion a Halfblood/Muggleborn, so any protests is pointless, unless you change things, etc). Hostile!Idiot Ron could become a catspaw for somebody else, or end up leader of a (metaphorical) witchhunt mob, or luck into revealing a secret Harry and Hermione wanted to keep safe, etc. No bad tropes, only bad uses of them. :)

I do think your idea could definitely be interesting. I completely misread that line about Ron winning her heart and was going to say I hope you write that story in the future, but it's one you've written already, isn't it?

** There's a writer on FFN called Potato19, most of +his+ her fics feature Ron as an actual good friend. Also, they're just generally great. I quite like linkffn(11951348) and linkffn(12168621)

  Set the summer after OOTP. Hermione gets struck by Dolohov's Curse in the Department of Mysteries and that sparks a change in the relationship between Harry and Hermione. They help each other deal with the grief, finding solace in each other and, eventually, love. Rated M for mentions of child abuse, some swearing and mild adult situations.

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.

** There was one I read a while back where Ron and Hermione had a mutual split post-DH, and then Ron bet Hermione that she and Harry would be together within 2 weeks or something which Hermione naturally denied but ended up losing the bet.

It was really refreshing to have a well-wishing Ron like that, which makes it all the more frustrating that I can't remember the name.

It does start off looking like a typical Ron-bashing fic but it very quickly subverts that trope, and Ron stay throughout the story as a close and supportive friend.

** Harmony happens with a friendly Ron more often than this sub believes, it's just a lot of the popular cliched ones from years ago have bashing in them so it's assumed that's the norm. Yeah, Ron's jealousy is rightfully used a fair bit since it's a huge part of his character, but that doesn't mean it's a harmony faux pas to not have Ron immediately turn into Umbridge when Harry asks out Hermione.
