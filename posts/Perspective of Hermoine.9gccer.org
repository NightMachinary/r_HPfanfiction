** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: All 7 years from her POV, 660k words, 200 chapters, but in a non-magical Sci-fi AU. It's a pretty awesome story if you don't insist on magic.

**** As I understand it, the characters are the same and the plots echo those of the books. Not my cup of tea, but I don't think the idea itself is quite so preposterous as it sounds at first.

**** The moment to moment writing is very good and the sub plots are interesting and original which is why it drives me crazy that the story twists itself in to knots trying to land at cannon stations without magic. I wish it would have just done it's own thing, but it's not a bad fic.

** Fun fact: Hermoine is the proper spelling of the Greek figure after which Hermione was named. She was the daughter of Helen of Troy, whose story you probably know.

*** I don't think that's true - the greek is "Ἑρμιόνη", which shows the ordering of letters.

Also, while that is the earlier origin, I suspect it's more likely that Granger was named after the character from The Winter's Tale.

**** Depending on which historian and which part of Greece you're looking at, it has been spelled either way. I don't read Greek though, so it could easily be a mistranslation in the texts.

One of my favorites, still has magic but the whole series set in regency era Great Britain. So well written!

*** You know, that typo is immensely funny if you know French, because "moine" means "monk". So OP was asking for stories about the perspective of "Her-monk".

***** That hadn't really occurred to me, actually. Certainly makes it even more preposterous... but the French word "moine" is "monk" as in the people in a monastery, not as in a diminutive for "monkey". So instead imagine Hermione in a monk's robes, with a shaven head...
