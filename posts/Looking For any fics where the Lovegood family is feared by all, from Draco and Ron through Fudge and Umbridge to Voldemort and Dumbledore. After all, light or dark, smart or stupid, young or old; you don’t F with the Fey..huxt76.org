  "Prepare to die Potter," Bellatrix cooed. "You'll . . . wait, is that a Lovegood with you?"

  "Yeah?" Harry asked suspiciously.

  "He's my boyfriend," Luna chirped.

  "Oh . . . false alarm," Bella said loudly. "Let's get back to the Dark Lair."

  "What the hell is going on?" Harry demanded.

  "She's a Lovegood," one of the Death Eaters said as if it explained everything.

  "But . . ."

  "According to the Dark Lord Handbook," Bellatrix said as she pulled out a small pocket guide out from between her breasts. "And I quote 'mettle not in the affairs of Lovegoods' end quote."

  "Oh . . . see you around then," Harry said with an intent look on his face, "I guess."

  "I don't get it," Hermione said in confusion after the Death Eaters were gone. "I just don't understand why people act that way around Luna of all people."

  "I think I've figured it out," Harry whispered to Hermione. "I know why everyone let's Luna's family do whatever they want."

  "Really?" Hermione asked. "Why?"

  "The more powerful a wizard is, the more insane they are." Harry said clearly. "Dumbledore's a bit odd, Voldemort is a power-mad psycho, Hermione you're a controlling information junky, I must admit that I have my issues . . ."

  "Get to the point."

  "Luna and her entire family are just fucking nuts," Harry explained. "Magically, they must be the most powerful family around."

ISTR this theme turns up in linkffn(Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood!) as well.

Both are crackfics, as the Blot tends to be.

*** yes, in fact that explains why magicians can't understand technology (it goes hand in hand with logic) and it also explains why Muggles can't see magic and others easily, likewise things like schizophrenia and others can be diseases in squibs and muggles for people who can see more magic than wizards but cannot interact with it, while for wizards it is a gift of high power.

** I don't have anything quite like that, bt in linkffn(The Queen Who Fell to Earth by Bobmin356), it's known, although perhaps not widely, that you don't use legilimency on a Lovegood.

I remember reading another story in which Luna decides she wants a relationship with Harry, and everyone else tells him, basically, "Better you than me, kid. Keep her happy and occupied." I'll try to remember the title.

  Forced to compete and abandoned by his friends, he steps from the tent with only one goal in mind, suicide. Instead Harry awakens a power that spans time and space and starts a war between the worlds.

  Some people can only be pushed so far. Luna will take a lot, but it's best not to insult her mother.
