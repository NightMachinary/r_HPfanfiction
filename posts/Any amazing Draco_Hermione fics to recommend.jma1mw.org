Hello!

I have been a long Draco/Hermione fanfic reader, so I've read quite a few. I prefer multi-chapter complete fics, I'm not a big fan of one-shots. So if there is anyone out there who knows a really good, well written fic please recommend it! If it's really good, I will do an incomplete fic also, but I would prefer complete.

Thank you for any and all recs!
