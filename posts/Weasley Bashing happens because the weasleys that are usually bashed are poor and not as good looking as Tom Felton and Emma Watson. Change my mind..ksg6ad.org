I am pretty convinced that Weasley Bashing happens because 1. They aren't as attractive as Felton and Watson and 2. They are poor and we subconsciously distrust and dislike the poor, irrespective of our own backgrounds.

Now hear me out, I'm not saying you might not have other reasons. I already know the "Ron walked out, he's jealous, petty arguments" and the "why did she say which platform is it" for Molly Weasley. I'm just saying that people on a subconscious level, target the weasleys in particular because they are poor and weren't that good looking.

Look at the replacements they get in most fanfics. Ron is almost always replaced by 1.Neville Longbottom 2. Theo Nott 3. Blaise Zabini 4.Draco Malfoy.

In the case of Neville and Draco - good looking actors. Also all four come from rich families.

Molly's replacements are : 1. Hermione's mum 2. Daphne's mum. 3. Narcissa Malfoy 4. Rare, but Zabini's mum. 5. Even more rare, Andromeda Tonks, whose only real difference is -she comes from a rich family. May not be as rich as before, but still better off than the Weasleys. Also these Fics don't tend to feature Neville and co. as much.

All are women who are generally described as attractive despite their middle age and in a good financial position.

So yeah, this is the trend that I've observed. I honestly do believe this message registers on a subconscious level and many are unaware of the same.

We say that the Weasleys are uncultured and unfamiliar with the "old ways" . Why? Because they are poor? They seem to have better personalities than the rich - literally offered home and hearth to a kid they didn't know really that well. Unlike rich people who were dismissive towards an orphan and generally insulted people like said orphan's mother.

Where I come from that counts as culture.

Also they have a great aunt, who is wealthy. It's highly unlikely they would be uncivilised or uncouth if such things were really that important. Particularly when the patriarch is well known and respected amongst his colleagues. They would have been taught the old ways for the purpose of protecting the patriarch's image at the least. Also when three of the oldest children have reached heights and excelled with respect to their schooling in terms of academics and social standings, it's highly unlikely that they aren't cultured or civilised in the ways of the people.

Then you have the "doesn't fit the narrative of light v. Dark magic", "light family, Dumbledore lovers, won't understand grey is the way to go"

- you're already changing so much of the narrative. Why is it that you're unwilling to change this aspect to fit you're narrative?
- they can play the roles of all the other people.

I believe the bottom line is people don't want good Weasleys and this is the reason why.

Thank you.


** I've never given it that much thought but I always thought that people like Hermione's mum, Daphne's mum, Narcissa Malfoy, or Andromeda Tonks were used because they were basically blank characters that could be written to suit various plot points.

*** I'm not referring to fics that only replace, I'm talking about where they are replaced and Molly is bashed.

I get wanting to write an OC/Blank character and all that. I do. I'm looking more at the underlying theme behind it doing so. While it's fun to write your own character, you don't necessarily need to put down another character to do so. You can just circumnavigate and avoid.

Which makes her the only one acting "typically" for her age group Hermione, Ron and Harry (and everyone else) just forget about romance unless it's useful for the plot. Viktor, Cho, Lavender, Ginny. It's totally okay to not date, but it seems more like JKR just forgets about those details unless they're helpful for her.

****** Perhaps it's a generation thing (canon is early 1990s vs. my personal exp is late 2010s) but since 2015 or 16 I've had the unfortunate experience of over hearing 10-12 yos discussing physical intimacy in a way that saddens me. Originally, I was concerned those had suffered from sexual abuse and didn't realise. I took my concern to their counselor who informed me the children I was referencing merely had difficulty whispering properly and there was a startling number of sexually active intermediate and middle school school children. Nevertheless, having to dissuade a middleschooler from masturbating in class a couple years later was a shock.

Then I remember I know 2 women who started planning to get pregnant at 14 and accomplished their goal at 15. The one I went to school with was still 15 when she had her baby and that was between 2000-2002, we were in choir together, the father and grandfather of her child's father was friends with my dad and the baby's dad's cousin was my age... The cousin would try to steal my toys when our dads worked at the same worksites so I would put my favourite toys on the top bunk because I could climb up there and she couldn't. The one I met when I was attending university was 16 by the time she had hers. Which means my hypothesis for children growing up more quickly now days was inaccurate.

***** I once had a woman say my grandpa died of cancer because God gave him cancer as a punishment.

This happened at work. That morning the coworker opening with me asked if I would trade her shifts and I'd told her no because the day was the first birthday he wouldn't be around for. The conversation ended then because a customer entered the store. Fast forward to later in the day, my coworker thought the store was empty except for us and apologised for my loss. She went on to say she was grateful she hadn't experienced anything as bad as having her closest family member die of something as terrible as cancer. Meanwhile, I'm trying to shush her because I knew the customer hadn't left yet.

Cue the customer coming around the corner to lecture me on being mournful for the death of a person so despicable, God had to punish him with cancer and I was going to go to Hell for admiring such a person. I ended up losing my cool after only about five minutes and told her to get the ____ out of my store. I called my store manager to see if I was going to get fired when the woman reported me to the company.

Fyi, I didn't. Not long later I was asked if I would transfer to another store that was in dire need of good employees. I went, thinking it was a lie to just be removed from that store without a fuss, but I didn't care. I was at the new store for less than 2 mos when my new manager asked if I would undergo training for assistant manager since she was managing multiple stores and needed help. Talk about feeling flipturned upside down.

People are allowed to write whatever point of view works best for them in the story, some don't like the slytherins and they make them all suffer after the war, some like them and redeem them all.

***** Fair enough. Write whichever approach you like, it's your right, haven't disputed that.

Weasleys are one of the most bashed characters. This is a fact. And quite a large number of people enjoy bashing them, irrespective of the fic. It could be Harry in a different house, WBWL, Grey Harry, Aristocrat Harry, Haphne, Harmony, Hinny even, Flowerpot. Weasley generally are bashed and people like doing it.

I'm trying to state that people enjoy bashing Weasleys because on a subconscious level, not conscious mind you, people dislike them due to their poverty and how to movie portrayed them.

I also believe the reason Draco is loved as much as he is in the community is because of Tom Felton. Draco has a lot of negative characteristics, far more than ron. Yet people are willing to airbrush and forget those tendencies with Draco but not Ron.

I'm trying to look into the reason as to why that happens to be a popular trend. In some cases the plot of the fic requires it, in some cases it doesn't. I'm looking beyond the plot and into the underlying themes. In those fics, how often is Draco portrayed as good looking and well off, while Ron is portrayed as unattractive in as many ways as possible? Is it not possible that on a subconscious level we associate Ron with poor looks, while associating Draco with the good Aristocratic looks of a pure blood heir?

Creating a working mom who struggles to provide for Harry but really cares about him requires way too much effort and imagination on the part of someone who's happy to dismiss complex characters in favor of characterizations.

Remember that Daphne's mom (or really, Daphne) doesn't even show up in canon at all and Andromeda's not given much more than a line about resembling Bellatrix Lestrange. They're basically open to the writer's imagination.

It doesn't necessarily imply a sexual nature. It's never mentioned again beyond that.

When talking of Dress robes she says ‘Your Father's got some for smart parties', which implies a knowledge of more formal events that may need attended.

I don't think it's contrarian at all, I genuinely don't see why people would want to go to a formal ball like the ones people described. A Cèilidh is a Scottish social gathering which is much more lively and less formal. For a family a rambunctious as the Weasleys it might fit them better.

*** Yeah, while I think the bashing sometimes has pretty nasty undertones (the Weasleys are gold diggers, Ginny is slutty, etc.), a lot of it comes down to just wanting to get rid of characters they don't like so they can play with OCs-in-all-but-name.

The Weasleys who get bashed the most (Ron, Ginny, Mrs. Weasley) are all either competing for the “best friend character” (to be replaced with unflawed* characters like Neville or Draco) or the love interest (to be replaced with unflawed characters like Hermione or Daphne). I think Mrs. Weasley gets bashed either as collateral damage (to a Ron/Ginny bash) or because she was mean to Hermione.

* Draco and Hermione are both flawed characters (Draco much more so, of course), but most bashing fics tend to brush over the flaws of characters the author likes. So any "uwu Slytherins are just misunderstood" fic paints Draco as completely unflawed. And any fic that doesn't bash Hermione (usually because she's in the way of the main waifu) also airbrushes her flaws.

***** Could be, but I personally don't really think so.

First, I do think Ron and Ginny get bashed for different reasons. Ginny is simple -- she's the canon waifu, so if you want Harry to get with any other lady, you need to get her out of the way. The simplest way is just for them to amicably break things off, so of course fanfic writers make her an evil gold digger instead.

As for Ron, I think a lot of people come from the movies, which were already kind of airbrushing Hermione's flaws*. So you have a fun best friend character, but he was a giant prick in book 4 and a small prick in book 7. So (a) you can write a balanced Ron who has his good qualities as well as flaws or (b) you could replace him with a new best friend, like Neville or airbrushed!Draco, who never does anything wrong or hurts Harry in any way. A lot of fanfic writers pick B.

As for why other characters get bashed less? I think it really just comes down to plot needs and author bias. Dumbledore is bashed nearly as often as Ron, in my experience, but sometimes you get a sensible Dumbledore in a story than still wants to replace Ron. Or Hermione is sometimes bashed so the author can use their totally-not-an-OC waifu, but since she was the "secondary friend" in canon, she's often left alone.

* Even book Hermione's flaws are mostly justified post-hoc. Her attacking Ron in book 6 was super screwed up, but the book 3 stuff (the Firebolt thing, and Crookshanks eating Scabbers) had her turn out to be right.

****** I think the reason other characters get bashed less probably has more to do with the levels of information JKR provides the reader about specific characters. It's easier to bash certain Weasleys, Dumbledore, etc because JKR describes them in such detail that they are easier characters to manoeuvre through the use of characters traits that are already present (as far as Ginny goes, I think most of writers focus on what seems to be her struggle with separating Harry-the-normal-teenager from Harry-the-boy-who-lived-and-did-many-unnecessarily-impressive-and-impossible-things). Another thing that I have seen in a lot of author notes is a particular leaning towards something JKR said in an interview about potentially lilly Ron off earlier in the series; they use this to justify his 'underdeveloped character' and his immaturity in some of the later books. Characters like Andromeda Tonks, Daphne and others are fairly or outright unknown, thus easier to manipulate as the ideal [insert appropriate character trope here]. Even Neville, the other potential prophesied one, isn't given nearly as much description and back story as the Weasleys or other characters.

Sorry if I offend anyone, I'm operating under the assumption that this is all an intellectual exercise. 😊

** First of all, I am 100% straight, and I thought the twins were scrumptious.

You definitely raise a good point. I agree that subconscious bias plays a significant role in the popularity of Weasley-bashing. Now, I don't think it's to the extent you are thinking.

1. They're not the most prim and proper family.

2. Mrs. Weasley is portrayed as a loud, controlling mother. One has to be to control 7 children (why the hell they had that many children when they could barely afford to is another matter). Harry is not trusting of adults. He is also the chosen one, which gives him an ego (bc identity and the significance of the hero role). He is also a teenager. Mix up a helicopter-parent and a self-righteous, deluded teen in one household. Shit hits the fan. Mrs. Weasley is surprisingly lenient on her kids. Her controlling behavior is more jarring bc of OoP and she's the only "good adult" who is shown to order our protagonists as a "familial/pseudo-familial" authority.

3. Harry has few who are as dear to him as the Weasleys. They introduced to him how families should work. They introduced parts of the magical world. He is very attached to them. Who else would be as great of a betrayer? Dumbledore? He's bashed a lot. Granger? I've seen quite a few that bash her. I haven't seen much "Hermione!Bash Ron!BFF." I assume it's partially due to their betrayals. Ron's in the GoF was him being a typical jealous teenager (ie. a dick). Hermione's in the PoA was her being a concerned friend. Hermione did have bitchy moments, such as the attack on Ron. As bad as it was, it did not directly hurt Harry. While Harry may feel more angry on behalf of others than of himself, /we, the readers, are angry on behalf of Harry/, whenever we're not screaming at him for being stupid.

4. The Longbottoms and the Zabinis are not struggling to make by. As unfortunate as it is, getting food is more important than being a "good" person. Money is a common and simple motivator. Its simplicity attracts writers because it's right there. Its mass presence attracts writers because it's so darn easy for the audience to understand. "Ahh, money. Sold their honor. Classic."

5. If the replacement is from the start and not a "great betrayal," it's generally advantageous to have Harry be chummy with more powerful families. The main characters gets more power, thus the line that authors push gets thrown further back.

6. This is food for thought. We judge others by how they are relative to us. This is not inherently bad. It is bad when it is the only significant metric. For example, I see upper-class young adults as posh, privileged, and prideful. In turn, they see me as a lower-class citizen. It's fucking sad, but it is what it is. Some of the Wizarding World will see the Weasleys as improper and uncultured. The Weasleys will see them as prickish peacocks.

Personally, I hate bashing, but because the Wizarding World is so complex and Voldemort is obviously a bad guy, it's natural for bashing to happen. We all do it in the real world. That is why I prefer him just not getting that close to anyone from the start.

I just want a wholesome crack fic with all the characters not dying like a cartoon. 😭 But, you can't easily go like "Tom, you devil. Can't believe you decimated families while I was busy trying to mortialize ya. The good old days, amiright?"

** I'm speculating, but I think the reason for who they're replaced with, and why they're being replaced is different.

The Weasleys all have negative traits or traits which can be taken as negative. Ron can be downgraded to just a jealous git, with his actions at the time of the tournament, his general lack of being an incredibly sensitive person*, his goals to outshine his brothers, and his smaller work ethic. Percy is a ministry worshipping nutjob for half the series. Molly is overbearing and actually insufferable. She's the worst kind of parent, who doesn't approve of a single career path among any of her children. She tries to publicly humiliate her children with howlers and refuses to take charity, despite the fact that her children could use better school supplies. She's overly emotional, and her pride gets in the way of her good sense. Bill and Charlie both left the country. She kind of sucks beyond the fact that she wants to do good. She tries to break up Bill and Fleur's relationship through the entire thing. I don't know if it was hating foreigners, hating Veela, hating people with money, or whatever, but it's an awful thing to do, especially when Fleur acts much more civilly around the Weasleys than she did through the entire Tournament, because she actually likes them. Arthur is obsessed with muggles, yet doesn't know a single thing about them. He's completely browbeaten by his wife, who doesn't always make the best choices. The twins' prank everyone. This can easily be construed as the sort of bullying that the Marauders took part in. Ginny had a crush on the Boy-Who-Lived. With all of these together, you can kind of put together a family that you wouldn't want to hang out with.

In most fanfictions where we're supposed to bash the Weasleys, there is a tendency for those fanfics to try and go against the idea of the light side. These fanfictions tend to be dark or gray Harry stories, so we've got to move him away from the Weasleys, who are the 'light' family. These types of fanfictions want to make the Wizarding World superior, with their own crazy customs, i.e. 'the old ways'. This puts them at odds with the Weasleys, who never do anything to encourage this view of the Wizarding World. So abandoning them is the easiest option. When you add in the above traits, you'd even enjoy getting rid of them. The uncultured part comes from their behavior. Ron doesn't have table manners, Molly sends Howlers to children and believes Rita Skeeter articles about her children's friends.

These fics also tend to go with the aristocracy supporting craze that surrounds the Lord Potter trope. I'm not sure why the trope is popular besides power fantasy, but it certainly leads into a much more wealth-centric view. The point is, it leaves the Weasleys on the chopping block, as they can be easily cut, and it serves the trope better.

It's this pureblood world that leads into Andromeda Tonks and her ilk as mentors and mother-figures for Harry. The Weasley's are replaced with wealthy purebloods because it allows the story to continue in those tropes. It allows them to replace flawed, but overall good characters, with perfect people. It's not the fact that they're poor, but the fact that they have flaws. They're replaced with wealthy people because of class superiority, but I think that there's too much evidence as to why people bash them to conclude that they're bashed for that same reason.

That being said, I've seen stories that turn the Weasley family's being poor into another flaw for the family. In those cases, I think you're absolutely right.

*** Sorry I'm getting to this late, I was trying to reply to all if not most.

I agree with everything you've stated. The Weasleys do have quite a few traits that can be magnified to make them look worse. I also understand your arguments with respect to pushing certain plots forward and why they'd enjoy putting them down.

I agree, from having read all that you've stated, it can't conclusively be stated that their poverty is the main reason they are bashed.

While I still do stand by my point, that there is a certain class superiority element to the bashing, which makes them a favoured and weak target; having read what you've typed, the bashing on that basis is restricted to a certain trope, and even then in all cases it isn't the only reason.

The love for the "Grey side" which often leads to the "Aristocratic side", which unfortunately will always bring a class superiority element with it is more likely why they are favoured targets.

It does make me wonder why Hermione is often spared the same amount of vitriol the Weasleys receive because she is a person who believes in authority figures and she doesn't really fit into the class system prevalent.

I think this is an important point. The Weasleys, like pretty much all important characters in the books, are complicated people. They all have many positive qualities, but they also have flaws. It's easy to just focus on those flaws, if you want to for whatever reason.

But the characters they're being replaced with are mostly blank slates in canon, so it's easy to make them basically perfect. Malfoy is probably the biggest exception to that, since he is canonically awful, but those stories find ways to explain away his actions anyway.

I do like the aristocracy thing because it's a good way to make politics interesting. Otherwise, one has to appeal to the public, which is so hard to do, or pressure the Minister, which is either impossible or laughably easy. Handling prominent families in factions makes the whole process more digestible. Also, many fics only deal with magical power, not with economic, political, and social power.

Personally, I love it when Harry or some other protagonist like Dumbledore has to decide between curb-stomping Magical Britain and working under the law.

Ron might have shown to have issues over their money problems but he was a child who saw his friends be able to do things he couldn't just because the circumstances he was born in.

Anyway the main three that are mainly bashed are Ron Molly and Ginny and I believe it's because they hold roles people are most likely to want to replace in fanfics (or mother figure, best friend, lover) so the writers tend to hyperfocus on what they see as those characters bad traits and reduce them to just that (Molly can be a bit loud and overprotective? No she's a screaming harpy who doesn't want to see her kids succeed or be happy).

It's funny because these fics also have negative traits of characters they like glossed over and suddenly make them into perfect people who have no flaws or in case of canonically "bad" characters the characters were just misunderstood all along.

I honestly feel bashing as a whole towards the Weasleys rose mostly because of the movies which were very unfair towards Ron and Ginny atleast.

Ron, I get why many dislike him. Molly while she was bad with Sirius, and I see why people would dislike that, it doesn't take away the good that she did through 7 books and 8 movies. But regardless, if you dislike them, you dislike them.

See, I understand the money point. However there really isn't a need to bash someone. You can always ignore their existence. Even if you dislike them.

I feel people prefer Bashing them particularly because they are weak targets, for the reasons I mentioned.

Because in fairness, a lot of worse characters exist as well and they've done a lot worse things than the Weasleys. These characters have their bad traits removed and made good.

I'm thinking, if you can make Draco and Snape good, why is it difficult to make the Weasleys rich or work around with them or ignore them completely? Why go out of your way to put them down? Like ok, you don't like them for what they did, but you've got one guy bullying people and being open prejudiced as well, why are you willing to like him?

I know it isn't wise to think too much about it, but it's possible that we like to hate Weasleys and there could be a subconscious element to it.

Molly is the archetypal, overbearing mother figure. A fair proportion of the books' intended audience would have bad associations towards that type of character.

** I'm sure there are some fics out there that have inspiration based in what you're describing. I would say for the most part though, it's an easy way to explain Harry breaking from the norm, one of the few. Harry's characterized loyalty would be very difficult to explain away, but suddenly becomes much easier when he's angry and betrayed. These emotions are often good segues into a lot of themes author's of a certain calibre will try to explore. Darker, grittier realism styles. Angst, drama. Weasley bashing can be done well and with solid reasoning, and I think it has been. I think a large amount of up and coming writers will latch onto that as a breakaway point for whatever plot they have setup for their own fic. It's an overused story trope, one which probably has roots in classism. I think it's also probably more "magical" for the readers to imagine wealth and easy living. People should definitely try to explore more ways for Harry to become and independent character.

On another note, I think the attractiveness and wealth notes are a bit of a false flag. With magic, almost everyone has access to simple spells, charms, and potions which make beauty standards a bit different. None of the Weasley's were ever stated to be particularly unattractive IIRC? Bill was even widely regarded as fairly dashing, if Fleur had anything to say about it.

*** See, with the wealth bit, I'd point back to your statement that underlying classism is existent. We consider them a lower class as a result of their wealth, because in truth, Weasleys are a old pureblood family. Sacred 28. Even the potters aren't in that one. And my statement is that the classism is indeed underlying and more on a subconscious level, a level where we don't really register it ourselves, we just do it.

The attractiveness bit is towards the movies. In the movies, Rupert by the end of the 8 movies wasn't as loved by most of the fans, as Draco or Neville were. And I believe that the attractiveness and popularity of the actors registered subconsciously as well.

Hence why Neville's and Draco's popularity sky rocketed amongst the Fanfic community. People love and are willing to forgive Draco.

And Rupert, without having that same level of standing, neglected in the trio and having a certain shine taken away in the last film, with a lot of his good lines and parts of his character being taken away from him and incorporated with Hermione, tends to attract negative attention in the Fanfic community.

Because of the open bias towards Draco and Neville, and bias against Ron, I believe that the attractiveness of the actors registered on a subconscious level. Ultimately the movies contribute the most towards Weasley Bashing.

Also with respect to Bill. Bill, Arthur, Charlie and Twins are the least bashed even when Weasleys are bashed. Bill is seen as responsible and good looking and rarely ever bashed. He's given the duty of keeping them in line usually. So attractiveness plays a role here too?

** Late to the party, but I wanted to add that I also think there is a huge appeal in twisted expectations narrative. Just look at all those think-pieces that are basically, "Hey, remember that hero in that movie? Well, they're bad, actually!" or conversely, "Hey, remember that villain in that movie? Well, they're good, actually!" There's a kind of perverse pleasure in taking something that's generally regarded as good and pointing out all the flaws, particularly for people of a certain age who are still figuring out their identity and their views on the world. I know that I loved Dumbledore bashing fics when I was a teenager and thought authors exceptionally clever for pointing out things like how ridiculous it was that children could navigate a set of puzzles intended to keep out a powerful dark wizard. (Don't judge me too harshly. This was in the era pre-Reddit, AO3, and Youtube. They were dark days.)

The Weasleys are good, actually. Every one of them fought for what they thought was right (even Percy). They gave Harry a home and a place to belong when he needed it most. Of course, they have their flaws, but that's what makes them interesting characters.

**** Snape isn't well-off at all. He's working class and still living in the poor neighborhood he grew up in. Rickman isn't how most people see Snape either. I've read a lot of fan fiction with Snape as a main character. He's either still very ugly or he's a god. No description comes close to Rickman whereas Harry and Hermione often look like Radcliffe and Watson, which I suspect people do subconsciously.

***** With respect to Dumbledore and James, they tend to play very different roles in the story in comparison to the weasleys that generally get bashed. When I spoke about Weasleys getting bashed, I was mainly limiting myself to 3 - Ron, Ginny, Molly, because those are ones that a common and favourites that people enjoy bashing. Ron in particular. When I gave this theory, it was more to account for why they target Ron and Ginny more than anyone else in their age group/school years; so James and Dumbledore don't really come into the picture with respect to that.

I was looking into why people prefer bashing Ron in comparison to bashing Draco or any other male pure blood that takes his role. I mean Ron goes from best friend, to comic relief villain. A complete 180. And it's rather popular.

It's more about roles in this. Ron takes up the role of canon Draco Dumbledore takes up canon Voldemort James takes up the role of Snape.

-- generally.

I also came across a Hermione point of yours earlier but I can't find it in this jungle. With respect to Hermione, while she is bashed, she isn't bashed nearly as much as Ron is. Most authors in my experience tend to pair her off with Draco/Neville/Other Pureblood Best friend or write Harmony, when Ron is getting bashed.

‘I honestly believe it's because they become obstacles for the characters the writer likes......but the Weasley bashing is more severe because of how interlocked it all is. Harry married the sister of his best friend...who in turn married his other freind

i have no doubts in my mind had Hermione married Cormac or Ron Stayed or got back with Lavander they would be on the chopping

I think as well it's the grass is always greener because to some the non canon pairing will always look far more tantalizing to the canon ones

** I thought Weasley bashing was a thing of the past now? I feel like it's pretty frowned upon...

I find only maybe 1/30 fics I read now (made up statistic based on gut) have what I call Weasley bashing where they are irrationally hated. There are other fics that may vilify a charachter but they do it in a tasteful manner.

For the most part, I feel like this was something that happened when the fandom was younger and has since been turned around. I'm sure there's some validity to your arguments but I think the biggest reason is laziness - it's an easy plot device that lets you set the stage for Hermione with someone else or a dumbledore was the villain all along storyline....

*** It's frowned upon but Weasley Bashing still continues, especially with people who are newly entering fanfic, either as writers or as readers.

It still happens, on some occasions it's subtle, other occasions, not so much, but it's a trope that isn't really going to go.

I understand that it's an easy plot device and it's lazy writing. My theory is more related to why people are more comfortable with the Weasleys being chosen as the ones who get the shorter end of the stick.

The lazy writing argument is very true and holds a lot of weight. I concur with it completely. But it still takes effort to go out of your way to bash the weasleys. Same amount of effort could be dedicated towards the bashing of any other character to drive the plot as well. It's just people prefer seeing Weasleys bashed. Weaker targets.

****** Still not bashing. That's just dislike of the characters. Most if not all JKR characters have a lot of unlikeable things about them, particularly the Weasleys, Malfoys, and Dumbledore. A lot of the problem with the Weasleys is the same problem with the large, sometimes insurmountable plot holes in between the books: JKR didn't plan long-term. She made up stuff for the book she was writing, and didn't care about how or if it affected the plot of past or future books.

The largest example is Wizarding transportation. In book 1, they ONLY have brooms. By book 2 she adds the Floo, and in subsequent books adds apparating and portkeys. But given the existence of ANY of those latter three, what are the chances that Dumbledore would fly on an uncomfortable broom for HOURS from Scotland to London right as Quirrelmort went for the stone? The plot hole wasn't there in book 1, but by the first few chapters of book 2, that entire end section of book 1 looks like either incompetent writing, or a conspiracy, because it's way too far out of character for Dumbledore to do that if any easier method of transportation existed.

Similarly, she adds more and more flaws to her other most-used characters as the books go on. The twins, for example, seem like jolly prankster tweens in book 1, but by book 4 they're bullying evil masterminds who experiment on young kids. By the later books, if you look at the series holistically it's pretty easy to find major plot holes and/or character flaws that could be either minor if looked at sympathetically, or catastrophic if looked at more critically. It's not bashing to point those out. It's her bad writing that got us here, and if authors want to emphasize rather than whitewash those flaws that's totally valid.

** A couple thing:

I would actually connect Weasley Bashing more with the Harmony style of fics, rather than Draco stanning world. Dramione fics tend to bash Harry too. Obviously there's some that do this as well, but I think those fics tend to be pretty clear that they're choosing to take the dark side on this.

Just Weasley bashing is more of priority for Harmony fics that need the biggest obstacles gone right away. I'm not sure what it was like in the fandom before book 7, but I think the canon epilogue only made that worse. It doesn't help that the movies leeched out all the good about the Weasleys, which is the context for a lot of fans.

A lot of fics seem to use Harry's wealth as a type of wish-fulfillment thing. In that view, if wealth is the purview of the intelligent and honorable, then obviously the weasleys must be the opposite. It's definitely classist, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was being written by fans who aren't wealthy themselves.

Lastly, generally speaking people are obsessed with fancy British people. See the Crown and Bridgerton for reference. Purebloods let them play with those aesthetics, and that's enough for most.

** I think a bit on the shit Molly gets is bc until "Seamus' mom who read the Prophet and thinks you're crazy" in the 5 book, she was a stand in for how the wizarding public saw Harry, and was written a bit... Ditzy for that. Take her not noticing anything wrong with your son's friend asking for FOOD during the summer (plot reasons, yes, but not a good light) her not asking Ron WHY the boy stole the car in Second Year, but sending a Howler, sending a very small egg to Hermione on Easter after Rita Skeeter's article on the girl, her love for Lockhart and his books and even her mother hening on the 5 and 7 books. Don't get me wrong, I like Molly, she's a awesome. But she's flawed, she's human, she makes mistakes. She annoys her son to cut his hair, she hates her French in-laws... Those other carachters are blank slates, you can do whatever (except for Narcissa. She's a bitch. "Oh but she saved Harry" being a coward when you think you'll lose doesn't make you nice, just oppostunistic. She's the Dark side's Peter Pettigrew)

Same for Ron. He's a well developt carachter. Harry is a dumbass stand-in for the reader, Hermione is pratically the definition of a Mary Sue (girl is goddamn perfect) but Ron? Ron is jealous, he gets angry, and frustratred. But he IS a loyal friend, he came back. But writting that? Well, not many people's Cup of tea. Honestly, that Weasley - Dumbledore - Light bashing combo I usually don't even consider HP, it's an AU subgenre where all of the light usually is a bunch of crazy schizofrenic biggots (I love muggleborns but I WILL call Hermione mudblood as soon as she surpasses me) the Dark are all inocent, nice aristocratic rich people who just want to study Magic and they only had a war bc Tom Riddle, Champion Of Magic, had the guts to challenge the evil Light Lord Dictator Dumbledore who's plan of conquerin the world using... Bureocracy was almost complete.

Sometimes, something good comes out of It. Usually? It's only a bunch of repressed conservative people living their dreamland of Monarchy and what they imagine being rich is like using HP.

Anyway, the reason I've disliked the weasley's is because of how some of their actions can be explained. But I honestly couldn't care less if they were poor or not. Actually, the reason they're poor is their own damn fault. Arthur and Molly going at it like fricking rabbits.

But anyway, every 'bad' action any character takes, can be explain in a dozen different ways. Molly calling out for which platform it is? Obviously, Dumbledore bribed her to make sure that Harry knew which platform it was. Ron saying that all the cars were full? A lie. Him (Ron) talking about how evil they (Slytherins) are? It's because Dumbledore wants them to be friends.

For every argument you give, about character A is Evil because so and so, I can probably think of an argument to counter it.

** I think the biggest issue I had with the Weasleys is that they're poor BUT THEY STILL CHOOSE TO HAVE SO MANY KIDS. If you can't provide for your children comfortably, LITERALLY DON'T HAVE SO MUCH KIDS. Much of Ron's jealousy and insecurity comes from his parents' lack of attention on him, his brothers overshadowing him and his family's poverty. The issue wasn't with being poor, but knowing that you can't afford it and you still do it like parenthood makes you to be some kind of saint, and in the process gets even poorer. This itself makes me distrust them.

My second issue is with Molly Weasley's overbearing nature, which is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand it was because of her motherly instincts that gave Harry a family/taste of warmth but on the other hand if I had kids I would've wanted them to know exactly what a situation they were in, ESPECIALLY if someone was actively out for their blood. I wouldn't sugarcoat it or hide the truth from them like Molly did in OoTP (actively against the trio joining OoTP meetings) and in DH (passive aggressively separating the trio from preparations for their horcrux hunt), and causing greater harm in the process. Obviously, we must also blame Dumbledore for it but doesn't hide the fact that Molly just wants her kids to stay naive.

That being said, I do hate it when Ron appears to be an reverse-Draco in Weasley bashing fics, when he condemns Dark magic to no end and bullies every Slytherin that comes his way despite people telling him how hypocritical it is. That would be a complete insult to Canon Weasleys because they are said to be very kind people.

Clothing not so much. If you can change people or change a button into a tortoise, you can totally change clothing. And Reparo seems to work to the extent it can turn broken, horrible glasses into like new. This should fix clothing too.

Secondly, I think people bash because it is the easiest way to break up canon pairings without having to work at it. If Ron and Hermione "just" break up as usual, the author has to write the rest of the weasleys reacting to that, ginny and harry picking a side, risk making the MC look like a flawed or shifty person (seriously, I see so many cheating fics where it's just brushed under tha table because HE was cheating first or his family was mean).

I understand it's an easy plot device, but there are so many ways around it that are equally easy but people choose not to do so, and try to hurt the Weasleys, that it makes me wonder if what I stated are the factors.

Bill I'd a successful curse breaker, Percy a federal working (basically a PA to the president), the twins had a wildly successful shop, Charlie doesn't seem to care about money. Honestly Ron gives major stay at home dad vibes which isn't wrong.

I am fairly confident the Weasley bash is just because they are too prominent in the books. They are bashed because if Harry never becomes involved with then (say because he's slytherin) you have removed the villians of the first three books (malfoys mostly) and they fill that spot. The jump to how to make them villians is 'they're poor' because it's easy. The same way the jump to malfoy is villian because 'he's a death eater' or dumbledor because he's 'manipulative'. Basically what I'm saying is people are just making the story they want to tell work easiest for them. Noone is safe from it.

Are there other ways to do this other than bashing? (And I'd love to hear yours) Yes. But people don't want to spend 150k writing out explanations for Harry and Ron growing apart naturally so that Hermione can be with Harry. So they just bash. It's understandable.

To avoid bashing, I'd just minimise the parts involving the Weasleys to a great extent. In Harry's year alone, we neglect the majority of his year mates. Apply the same principle to the Weasleys. Even with Fred, George and Percy in his house, he didn't interact with them significantly. With Ron, treat him as another year mate. Polity, acknowledge and keep going. There really is no need to bash him based off canon if you keep him at arm's length or as an acquaintance.

****** I'm not sure just ignoring the charaters will work in such an established universe. There will always be readers in you... let's say Harry/ Susan bones fic that while they're solving a mystery would just say "oh I bet they go ask Ron for help."

I think the only way to write them out of the story is to kill them off or send them away for "reason x".

Something starting past 1st year you have to explain why they fell out. Sure you can just write them out and people do. But how different people handle it varies.

I actually think your original point of because they're poor and ugly is actually just wrong. I'm fairly certain it's because they hold a big role people want to put others in.

******* Never stated ugly. I really don't understand why people keep assuming that.

Starting past first year, yeah you'll need to explain it; but there are plenty of Fics that don't revolve around the Weasleys at all and don't bash them. Popular ones is their own right, particularly ones where Harry is a Ravenclaw. Harry McG comes to mind. I'm not too sure if I remember any bashing in Harry Crow. But yeah, in Ravenclaw Fics, Weasleys aren't that much of a presence. I don't see why that can't be carried forward. If they were in Gryffindor, i'd agree, they'd need to interact, but even then you can make it seem like they don't click and change avenues. You don't have to give them an important role in the story.

As for my premise, well we can agree to disagree there and respect one another's points of view.

You forget the slytherin and Gryffindor actively interact and fight and always have. That is not limited to the canon characters.

But as you have said their are also fics that just /don't/ bash the Weasleys. Just like there are some that do. People have a variety of ways and reasons they write as well as how they explain things. Catch-all statements over /why/ they do it are frequent incorrect.

Harry Crow is... an interesting example to bring up. Most fanfic-ers have outgrown it and consider it pretty bad writing as a whole. I was unable to get past the welcome feast so ill take your word on that.

** really the only fanfics i read with weasley bashing or any character bashing in general are the ones where everything is kinda flipped like everyone's personalities are not as they were (like voldemort is the good guy and dumbledore is the bad guy) some are actually really strongly based in what the characters have actually done but interpreted in a completely different way, such as how to some dumbledores actions can seem very manipulative and voldemorts goals were just twisted but i personally don't like the one's where it's clearly just bashing for the sake of bashing like i can see how you can make the weasleys seem like what some do but only if it's well based and not purely built around 'oh the weasleys are poor and uncultured' those are the one's i really hate

In GoF, I get the reaction and the reasoning, he is 14 going on to 15 at that point, you make mistakes. However, he never seemed to apologize or try to make up for that behavior. The shit in DH, is where I was like nope, that is it. Again, I get the story telling aspect behind this character writing. However, I do not like it.

And all that is without going into that in the page the author has all the power into how to describe the characters and in many works, I've read any number of Weasleys are described as very handsome (in particular Bill).

** Get the delta ready cause I'm about to try.

On premise I don't entirely disagree, there are some fics that probably do this. However, I'd argue the biggest contributing factor to Weasley bashing is probably the ship wars. The two most bashed Weasleys (as far as I can tell) tend to be Ron and Ginny, and one the biggest ship is between Harry and Hermione, the characters the bashees end up with.

Also, it's worth noting that a readers definition of what bashing is definitely plays in here. I've seen bashing mean anywhere from an author just torturing a character for no reason to there being a justified argument that ended a friendship that left a foul taste in the mouth of our POV character. When bashing can mean acknowledging flaws of a character, I fail to see what the actual boundaries of it is.

Ron's replacements. This section is varied so I'll split it.

Neville. Sure Neville is wealthier than Ron, however he (imo) does seem to be a better friends and person than Ron (I'll come back to that in a couple of paragraphs). Also, Neville was the other potential BWL. Not to mention that Neville is also an orphan and a bit of an outcast from his family for being different, and suddenly Neville and Harry aren't truly that different and have an interesting dynamic one could play off.

The next three I'll address at once. Normally you see Draco (in my experience) and this is especially notable in Slytherin Harry fics. Though, with Ron's general attitude towards Slytherins Harry just attempting to make friends with these three could be cause for big arguments that could potentially blow up leaving everyone mad. Almost like a reverse of the Lily, James, and Snape situation.

Why would Ron be replaced in the first place? While as mentioned previously, Ron being friends with a Slytherin Harry doesn't make much sense. First there is the hurdle of Harry being Slytherin something Ron is against on principle, and even if Ron got over it who's to say everyone else will. Especially right after a war in which mostly Slytherins were the opposition (as far as we know) what makes you think there wouldn't be another James Potter to split the friendship between a Slytherin and a Gryffindor? All of this is disregarding Ron's characterization. Ron was either out right stated or very heavily implied to be a foul-weather friend in the forward for one of the books. By his nature when things are seemingly going well for Harry, Ron will leave. In these cases I think the rich families tends to be correlation not causation.

Molly's Replacements. Once again I'll split this up, this one will be more varied (3/4 of last time we're one paragraph) but I honestly seldom have seen Molly be replaced.

Hermione's mother. Maybe fair, but I honestly cannot remember ever seeing this.

Next I'll hit Daphne's and Zabini's mothers. I've seen these characters a combined maybe three times (Daphne's once maybe twice and Zabini's barely once). The one Miss Greengrass I remember was where Harry was introduced because he was dating Daphne. Miss Zabini was in Slytherin Harry fic and while she was very friendly and helpful, she existed for all of like 5 chapters before she disappeared and I don't remember seeing her again.

Narcissa. By far the most common one. Narcissa though normally shows up in Severitus fics where Harry is Snape's ward (it could be Snape father(biological or adopted) or Harry living with Snape under Dumbledore orders), or Slytherin Harry fics where Harry is friends with Draco.

Andromeda Tonks. You seem to forget one thing. Andy is the caretaker for Teddy Tonks, also known as Harry's godson. Honestly, if anyone has a claim to the ‘Molly position' it's got to be Andy. Also sidenote: anyone else notice that Teddy seems to be completely forgotten in the father Harry fics, while I've only read a handful of post-Hogwarts it always seems that Teddy goes unmentioned or briefly mentioned and never brought up again. Seems like a missed opportunity to me.

Again, why replace Molly? Normally, when Molly goes she goes the same way as most Weasleys, the author wanted to get rid of Ron for some reason and it didn't make sense having Molly around anymore. Sometimes, it can certainly get more blow up-ie though (sometimes even more so than with Ron). Molly sees Harry as (at the very least almost) one of hers, considering she has no gripes about sending howlers to her children, and her own hot-headedness, it could logically be claimed that she could (and maybe would) send one to reprimand Harry. This would naturally cause Harry (still the POV character) to have a negative opinion of her (at the very least temporarily) which can constitute bashing.

I don't disagree that the trend exists. However, I mentioned before that I believe that it's more correlation not causation. Realistically, we know of the financial positions of: Harry, the Malfoys, and the Weasleys. Everyone else is merely an assumption based on some factors. Though it's clear that (from the developed families we know) no one is as poor as the Weasleys are, that's really the most we could argue. Zabini's mother admittedly is implied to be a sort of black widow, this is not confirmed, nor do we know any specifics regarding her financial situation. From what we know of pureblood families, they're seemingly categorically well off, especially since it's said the Weasley's were fairly well off before they spent their money (On what we don't know. I'm also not sure if this was Pottermore or book info). Thus, everyone being in a better financial position is pretty much by default.

“Where [you] come from that counts as culture.” Well yes, but actually no. Culture describes a behavior of a group. So yes, it could be argued that Weasley culture is being kind and caring. But that's not what people tend to mean when they say uncultured. When someone claims uncultured they tend to mean in comparison to general society. For example, the culture of the KKK is racism, whereas racism is considered uncultured by most. That being said I do generally have the same opinion on the “uncultured Weasley” comment.

This is where I initially though you were going with the previous though. While the Weasleys don't care about their appearance (at least for the most part), they almost certainly know all of the proper and expected social procedures of a family like theirs. They are an acknowledged member of the Sacred 28 after all, and (in fics where Wizengamot is made of wizard families) it makes more sense to exclude Potters than Weasleys. That being said, while the Patriarch (I'm assuming you mean Arther here) is (seemingly) fairly well known, he is certainly not respected.

Now some specific arguments. The first of these two comments is redundant as this is pretty much what Harry Potter is about already. The second isn't entirely unfair though. Onto the points.

Making Grey!Harry isn't changing much of the narrative. Hell, Harry being a reactionary character (at least most of the time in my opinion), it could be argued a Grey!Harry could do literally everything canon Harry does. That being said, if you change a character too much without much reasoning people start to bitch about canon compliancy (which is a whole other debate that I have fairly complex opinions on). Regardless, why not use another character (especially one closer to what is desired) and attempt to avoid the canon compliancy argument (at least mostly).

So Molly can be Teddy's guardian because she was Tonk's Mother? I know I'm being pretentious, but I honestly have no clue what this point is supposed to mean. For many situations, this is generally the truth. It doesn't make sense for something like Slytherin Harry to be close with the Weasleys.

Maybe people don't want good Weasleys. But I still don't think this is the reason why. I do think it's the shipping wars. Similar bashing (though not normally labeled as such) happens to Annabeth in probably at least half of the Pertemis fics. I've seen Hinata bashing in NaruSaku fics.

No problem, and I look forward to a response.

** Simply put, i completely disagree with you.

First, i dislike Ron because he's a petty, jealous, piece of shit that walks away when it matters most. Percy is a brown-nosing piece of shit that chose his career over his family and the truth. Molly can easily be portrayed as an overbearing, overly controlling harpy.

as for replacements for Ron, Neville is simply a logical choice. who the hell else are they going to pick, Dean or Seamus? the fact that he was a potential "Chosen One" just adds symmetry. as for the others, those are generally only the case in stories seeking to either make Slytherins look good or has Harry in Slytherin himself. in which case it makes sense. though i still think that Draco is a spineless piece of trash that should have been thrown in prison for the rest of his life just like his father. at best, her actions should have gotten Narcissa herself a pass. not her husband and son. Nott isn't actually in the books much, but he's from a death eater family, which doesn't speak well of him, whereas Zabini is generally more neutral than the others.

as for replacements for Molly, off-hand, other than Mrs Granger, the one that immediately comes to mind is Amelia Bones, or one of the other minor character. Mrs Greengrass is typically only included in fics pairing harry with Daphne, or more rarely, Astoria. Andromeda is typically either when pairing harry with Tonks, or forging closer ties to Sirius/the Black Family.

as to the Weasleys being "uncultured", most fics i've seen portray that as a deliberate act of disrespect by the family. that they know the "proper" ways, and simply disregard it, for whatever reason.

** Do you see much Weasley bashing nowadays? I don't often read bash fics but they almost always say "Molly/Ron/Ginny bashing" rather than "Weasley bashing" and that makes sense. Ron is a fair weather friend, Ginny is a fangirl and Molly is a nasty piece of work.

** In my opinion, partially its laziness of the writer (many have expounded upon that) and partially because a lot of the negative traits the weasleys have are ones we dont like to identify with. Ron is /stupid/ compared to harry and hermione. Ginny is hopelessly infatuated with an /idea/ rather than a person at the beginning. Molly has /given up/ the concept of being more than a housewife with a ton of kids, (I dont think theres anything wrong with that but I feel thats one of the easiest gripes to pick on) and as a result its easy to turn the family who reached out to harry into a kind but fallacious group of people, whether thats love potions or othwrwise. If u were deciding to turn them on harry, its easiest to presume greed and fame are the ideal motivators, though they dont suffer from those in the actual novels really or not that its demonstrated on any level. Its by far the easiest place to write betrayal if you want that to be a primary motivator for departure from canon

** Bashing is always a sign of bad writing. That isn't to say a good fic can't have bashing, but it's a way of writing one dimensional characters so you have an easy villain. The weasley's are an easy target because they're well known, and if you whittle them down to their most overwhelming trait they're easy to depict poorly. One of their big traits is being poor. Rowling did it to depict struggle and show how money isn't needed to be important and happy. But it's easy to twist it and make them greedy instead

** Ok, I understand what you want to say but I think there are some logical mistakes in it.\\
First, Hermione is described as anything but attractive in the books.\\
Even if you lean towards the movies, Ginny wasn't the ugly duckling you imply here.\\
Neville is kindly referred to as fat in the books and I wouldn't call the actor a supermodel either, but everyone's his own. ;) Now to your original point.\\
I think a general Weseley bashing is very rare. Special bashing yes Molly, Ron and Percy stand out here.\\
I can't remember any fic Arthur was bashed in, and he's not exactly attractive either.\\
Let's go through them one by one:

1. Molly I think it's the way she treats others that is the reason for bashing not her attractiveness. She yells a lot, she always sends the red letters, she is also very overbearing. Everything Points of attack and than there is in book 1 with the loud question where the way to the platform is, itdoes not look good, etc.

2. With Ron it's just his loyalty to his friends ... imagine Sam had left frodo because he was homesick for his mother cooking. Furthermore, he is also often accused in fics that his prejudices are a mirror image of Draco, which is not entirely wrong.

3. Percy is just the kind of bureaucrat you don't want to like, there are also some good fics with him they are rare. He is just written unsympathetically.

We don't have such a large pool of examples from to pull, everything is told from Harry's perspective and with whom he interacts.\\
Andromeda Tonks is e.g. almost 100% fanfic i can't remember we met her in the books.\\
Also comparing Molly with Narcissa is just too rough.\\
One is a sociality lady with one child who has practically not had to worry about anything since she was born.\\
The other is a housewife with 7! children.\\
Yes there is the rich aunt that nobody likes, why and how is never explained and thus embellished in fanfiction, Just like the squip cousin. I think why the Wesleys are not respected (in the story) is Arthur's job, that they are poor, that they have so many children und and their generally positive attitude towards muggles. They are the only family I can remember with more than two children.

Ok, I've already written too much and it is clear that I don't agree with you. :) Let me say this last, there are many more Weasley are good fics and I think that this is also true.

** To some extent, perhaps. But there's other reasons people don't like the Weasleys as much.

One is Ron - Ron as a character is one whose strengths aren't nearly as apparent as Hermione's (she's smart, resourceful, etc - when there's a plot device needed to get some information, she'll be the one to bring it up), and one of his oft-repeated strengths (loyalty) is also one that he memorably breaks a few times (book 4 and book 7).

Add in that Harry gets with Ginny - not necessarily the most popular or well-developed pairing out there, and that Molly is... well, she's well-intentioned, but also gets annoying in a way that most people have felt towards their mother. Harry (the character) wants/needs a family, and Molly is a great fit for him there - but the reader already has a mother, usually, and her attitude is one that then can get annoying. From that you get a recipe for Weasleys having three characters that a good number of people don't like, and it's an easy jump with a manipulative Dumbledore to "isn't it convenient that the Weasleys became Harry's surrogate family?" and to run to the races with it.

The role of the movies in this sort of thing are exaggerated IMO - people love to point to them as reason why people view X one way or the other, but usually there's the exact same impression from the books.

As for the Weasley's having a lack of culture in many fics focusing on 'darker' families, well - again that's natural. We spend a lot of time in canon with the Weasleys, and (in terms of magical culture as being vastly different from 'regular' muggle culture) there's nothing too special. They celebrate the same holidays, they act like a nice family, etc. But if 'pureblood culture' is being explored, there's a lot of interest in making something that's a lot more developed there. And that's much easier to push unto a fairly blank slate or a family that's already known to embrace past magical traditions over the newer line ones. It's a lazy approach, but it's the easiest one. That's the same thing with why alternative characters get chosen - their personalities are less a focus than Ron or Molly, so they're much more blank slates and easy to have a 'perfect' character into it.

The money thing, IMO, just gets added on /after/ everything else - it's not the source of things. It's people going "The weasleys are bad. What would be a bad thing they would do? Oh, they're poor so they need money - and Harry is rich. So they're going to be stealing from him!". Plenty of Dumbledore bashing fics do the same thing (eg, ones where Harry's vault is actually just a small portion of his total inheritance, and Dumbledore took control of the other ones to fund the order), and he's not poor like the Weasleys.

*** I get that I do. The dumbles thing is usually for him to have someone else bankroll the order instead of his own pocket. Why they'd need money is beyond me but nevermind that.

I get that it's a lot of easy and lazy writing that contributes to it and the negatives of the characters. I actually did acknowledge a change in my stance with a couple of the comments, one of them made really good points like yours a bit earlier.

What i was trying to focus is that there is an underlying tone to it that most don't register, but these factors do tend to play a role in the fact that these characters have their negatives amplified while other characters haves theirs nullified.

**** Yeah, and part of what's dumb about the money is that canon Harry was very happy/eager to help the Weasleys out with their money issues, but was rebuffed by Molly. It's very much the opposite of what we see from them all (eg, the Twins basically forcing him to take a stake in their store when he didn't care about it at all).

It's certainly possible that the class aspect and the movie actors play a role in how people see them, but I think it's at the most a fairly minor one. The class factor plays a much bigger role in the aristocratic/noble power wank fics the other way, IMO - not so much in bashing the weasleys, but in praising the rich aristocrats and having Harry turn out to be the richest and bestest of them all without any critical thought - and the Weasleys are bashed because they're associated with Dumbledore and his side that those versions of Harry are against. (Vs other poor families just being ignored as unimportant)

** Fred and George are loved in most of the fics. Not all Weasleys are hated.

I have my own musings on Molly's parenting skills but she is one of the realistic characters.

So, I was quite appalled to see people would write fics where Molly had taken Gringotts key from Harry to steal all his money or trapping him to wed Ginny. Seriously, where did that Molly came from? She was the closest Harry got to have a motherly love.

I think, the main point is, they don't want Harry to be poor. In most fics, Harry becomes heir of all four houses, and inherits money value of seven different households, so obviously Weasleys fall short in the end. To make it more interesting, the fics are written where Weasleys are snatching money. Harry comes off as a self-wish in all these fics.

Not to mention, how some fics exaggerate a non-existing Dramione relationship. I mean there are fics that literally tell there was something happening during Hogwarts between them, exaggerate Draco sparing the trio in Malfoy Manor because he somehow loved Hermione.

I'm totally cool with new pairs and new trios, new storylines but to basically discredit the canon and making every single character OOC, is because they are all clinging on to the self wish.

It's just that authors are too lazy to make the separation long and believable, so they take shortcuts and harp on minor flaws. If the Weasleys had money, there'd be just as many fics extolling how their wealth has disconnected them from reality or some other issue so Harry can break from them.

** Well, it is much easier to write a bashing story about Molly/Ginny/Ron because there is so much one can write about.

Draco is easy to bash too, and I have seen lots of stories where Malfoy was bashed just as much as Ron.

Hermione is harder to make fun of because she doesn't have that many flaws besides her bossiness, habit to demand info from Harry, and her undying love for books. Oh, and her love for Authority.

It's simply easier to bash Ron since his flaws are so much more and easier to exploit.

Ginny's obsession with Harry is also a nice plot-device, and Molly using love-potions to ensure Harry ends up with Ginny doesn't sound that ridiculous.

Anyway, I think the Weasleys are just the easiest to make fun of, and Dumbledore, of course.\\

** The majority of bashing fanfictions are power fantasies, they want Harry to triumph over oppressors. The only canon characters who could be construed that way would be Dumbledore and the Weasleys. It's not about the money, it's people thinking they deserve to control you that the authors don't like. This leads to them lashing out at them trying to put them in their place. Showing the bashed characters to be egotistical, greedy, and uncaring. To assume that its classism misses the point. The main body of fanfiction authors are teenagers, teenagers who want to write about being powerful.

It might just be my perspective, but most teenagers are not aware of wealth, they don't have the experiences in life to really perceive it properly. Teens aren't really exposed to vast economic differences, besides the Weasley's are not /that/ poor. They have to buy second hand and use old things, they don't have to scramble to make ends meet, they don't go hungry. They just can't afford fancy things like brooms and pets (which are very expensive). Ron couldn't buy food on the train, not because he was poor, but because his mother gave him food and told him not to waste his pocket money. He couldn't buy omnoculars at the Quidditch World Cup, probably because they were at a sporting event (you know, where things are exorbitantly expensive). There is nothing in the books that ever indicates that they were in serious poverty. Arthur's the head of a department for Christ's sake, an underfunded one sure, but it's not like he's in a low position.

So in my opinion, it's more about the type of stories these fanfictions are and less about the Weasleys themselves. They represent authority over the character, of the type which these authors are desperate to get away from.

P.S. and I really don't think it has much to do with the actors at all, it's a book series first and foremost. You can tell when an author has written a story with just the movies, and most haven't. I think if we were to check out other writers' opinions on what the appearances of these characters are, we'd find that the movie's depictions of these characters are in the minority. We're fanfiction writers, we build our own fucking world regardless of the decisions authors and casting directors have made.

So go check out this post and give your opinions on who these characters are.

** I Feel this comes sort of from the same place as drarry/snarry/snamoine/dramoine and even Honks( Follow me a second i swear it gets to a point.)

1. your right Tom Felton and Some actors were a lot better looking on screen as they aged. Alan rickman was a well known handsome man.
2. Certain actors chemistry OUT of role ( Emma crushing on tom, Natile winking at Daniel etc) Caused pairings to be formed from the characters
3. The worst traits of some characters toned down removed. ( snape, Malfoy. etc) while others good traits ( Ron especially they gave Hermione some of his good parts in the movies. and mostly kept the bad.)
4. also people are always trying to redeem the bad boy.( or girl for bellaxtrix i seen alot. by giving them into relationships.)

Now. you mentioned money? Alot people who read and write fanfiction are most likely not super well off. with 11% still under the poverty line, and most everyone comes from a Home that's average on money. so they often dream of their fiction MC as having alot of money and culture.

Unless its a purpose why, they don't want to write about people who are struggling financially.

Also, Lets look at the three most bashed weasleys.

Ron - Movies removed all alot of good parts, often overly played as jealous and often thought of as stupid. Which i sort of blame putting him against the foil of Hermione whos a bloody genuis ( and some fan fictions the next merlin how good she is.)

​

Ginny- who was a pigion holed relationship with harry , the actress was not as pretty as hermione or luna and 3 most mention relationships. also they down played the character so much compared to the books, Not i am team Harry/Ginny, but she went from what was suppose be a fun brave girl.. to talking about spoons.

Molly- Most still aren't sure about the love potion, to over bearing, and well plain compared to the rest.

do have the first seasons of Doom Patrol and Titans on dvd that i bought for cheap to check out at some point, though.

** I definitely agree with your thoughts. But oh boy, do I have entire lists as to why I despise-Molly Weasley, Hermione Granger, Dumbledore, Snape, Draco, Poppy, Tonks, and many more. JKR really messed up on these characters for me. I would tell you the reason why I dislike all of them, but that would make this comment way too long.

I just don't get why people are calling them "flaws." Sure, they could count as flaws, but these characters still need to be held accountable for their actions. Usually the good outweighs the bad, and while some of them have good traits, doesn't mean they shouldn't be held accountable for their actions and have those actions pointed out like wildfire. I don't even like any of them despite knowing their good traits as well.

I don't despise these characters for their looks and how rich they are. I agree that if you're going to hate characters, hate them for what they've done in the books. Not because of their looks and how rich they are, which seems to be a problem in the fandom. Someone had to say it, and I'm glad you did.

** I have never seen any Weasley bashing portraited as money related, although I do see your point when it comes to mistrusting poor people.

However, i disagree with it being related to looks. I've seen plenty of Hermione bashing and most Molly bashing comes from the fact that she always wants to be in control and won't listen to anyone who disagrees with her, mainly when it comes to her daughters in law and Sirius.

I don't really see or read fics with Ron bashing, but when it happens it's usually the same bashing that happens in canon.

About having other women as a mother figure to Harry, there are not really many middle aged women out there (besides OC) to be this person for him. If they are rich or in a better position it's just a matter of how you write it, but I don't think it's BECAUSE they have money.

** weasley bashing is inherently classist for sureee. i mean wow i think ginny fred and george are very attractive butt the classist thing for sureee.

jkr herself did not portray them well in the book anyway. a constantly jealous ron does not portray the WC well at all. their dad having an apparently decent job but them still having little money? the blame for having lots of kids for not having a lot of money.

i don't think she portrayed WC well and that's been heavily taken out in fanfiction

** Well reasoned, but Weasley bashing fics started up before the first movie.

Bashing the Weasleys is done because they are perfectly positioned to be whatever the writer might need them to do to advance his/her plot. Making them Comedy relief was aided by JKR's insistence on making them idiots, other than the Twins and to a lesser extent Bill and Charlie. Arthur's need to have a 'rubber duck' explained to him, for example. Ron is especially well-positioned to 'betray' Harry. The only one better positioned for 'betrayal' is Hermione, and you take your life in your hands to even suggest she might not be perfect.

For example, I started in a little story that (slightly) crossed over with the MCU, that ended with McGonagall, Bellatrix, and Hermione all turning out to be Hydra agents who waited until the final battle where each of them executed the man they were assigned to, with their final lines being "Hail Hydra!" God, that pissed people off, with more than one reviewer demanding I make Harry's Hydra agent be ANYONE else, and listed practically the entire female student body.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11642988/8/The-Boneyard]] if you want to read the bare bones of the story.

Harry being 'betrayed' by the Malfoys isn't a plot point, it's a 'just how stupid are you to be surprised by this?' bit of silliness.

*** As I'd stated earlier, I'm not sure when Weasley Bashing started, but I figured that this is a possible reason why it is enjoyed done.

I'm not suggesting it's the main reason, but I do believe that it is prevalent as an underlying theme that most don't register, while doing it. Like I stated, it's on a subconscious level.

However I do understand and agree to your point on the convenience of using them and their position with respect to the plot.

** strongly disagree with your first point. first of all, Weasley bashing fics became popular in this fandom before the first HP film was even cast. second of all, Rupert Grint isn't exactly unattractive? none of the Weasley actors are, imo.

** I have just one quote for you:

#+begin_quote
  Do not attribute to malice that, which can be explained by incompetence.

AKA, stupid, not evil (racist, sexist, classist, etc...). I doubt anyone puts nearly as much thought into bashing as you (apparently) did this post. They are just convenient, low effort plot devices to get to the scenes the author wants written.
