** Daphne's father to Harry: "I'm sorry my daughter gets a little over dramatic, it's this trend that has existed in Syltherin for years and it's silly. /sigh/ look I don't care if you date her, I really don't know what she means by us being gray, we own farms. I'm not political and neither the light nor the dark really care about us. Its less us not picking a side as much as us not having much to contribute. Um, but we aren't bigoted! And I guess if your Order needs some vegetables, we can send you some? Anyway, best put on some robes before Daphne lectures me for being improper.

******* No, no, no, Daphne is to Asami, what Cabbage Corp is to Future Industries. In true Cabbage Corp fashion, that would mean Daphne's schemes and intelligence are really only surface level and are completely outclassed by Asami, and/or another competent person.

This causes Daphne's Father, the Cabbage Merchant, no shortage of anguish, as he just wants to quietly run a successful Cabbage Business. This is exacerbated when Daphne develops a significantly one-sided crush on Harry, whom he hates, not because he's a bigot but because Harry's misadventures into the world of Capitalism, ruins Cabbage Corp's success constantly. He just wants an apology, but Harry has no idea of the ramifications of his actions, enabled in no small part by Daphne's schemes, to get him to notice her.

"We will need 200 Galleons. Yes, that will be all."

Mr Greengrass pulled his daughter aside.

"How can I help you, Lord Greengrass-Hepburn?"

Michael sighed. "Please. Daphne dear. Why do you insist on blabbering this nonsense?"

"Heir Crabbe," Draco tilted his head, "I hope I find you in good health."

"He's literally a hired goon, Draco," Lucius said with a long suffering sigh.

"He is also next in line for the Lordship of the Crabbe estates, father."

"An estate that comprises of two cows, one of which is too old to give birth."

"Regardless, father. It behoves me to ensure that my pureblooded colleagues are treated with respect."

"Y-you know what? I've had enough of this. Narcissa!?" he shouted.

She walked into the dining hall, each step measured and poised to be elegant. "How can I serve the Lord of this House today?"

A nerve in Lucius's head twitched.

"You know, you should have taught me more wizarding etiquettes." Ron spoke as he pretended to read his Quidditch Quarterly, upside down.

Molly raised an eyebrow, "What do you mean?"

"Harry insists I call him Heir Potter-Black-Peverell. I dunno what's got into his head. Looks at me all pig like when I simply call him Harry."

Molly never would have thought... Well, better now, she decided. "Ron, I think you shouldn't really talk to him then, at least till he grows out of this."

*** I think Crouch Jr. might be a special or at least middling case. It seems like there are a few specific, overly inter-married pureblood families where supporting the Death Eater rhetoric is expected, at least politically. The Black family is supposed to be a big deal in the wizarding world, and of the ones we know only Andromeda and Sirius broke the mold.

Or rather, Crouch Jr. might be a special case among the inner circle. We'd probably know if Stan Shunpike had some dark pureblood pedigree, but he was just a random guy and most people had no problem believing he was a Death Eater. Did we ever find out if he was actually Imperiused, like Harry argued?

**** The Blacks are supposed to be one of the worst. The Lestranges are also 100% Dark at least because the RR brothers were the last of the family. Not much is said about e.g. the Selwyns and Yaxleys so it /might/ be safe to assume, for HPFF purposes, that they have family who are not as extremist as they are?

In the 7 Potters battle Stan was described as having a blank face as if he had been Imperiused, so I like to think he was, but many HPFF writers took the position he wasn't. That's a personal choice IMHO.

Actually the one that I'm scratching my head over is Pius Thicknesse. It's said in DH's first chapter that he was Imperiused, but in the Battle of Hogwarts everyone has a fun time whaling on him. Which is usually an author's sign that "hey this is a bad guy". So either he does have DE sympathies and the Imperius was just to push him over the edge, or... JKR is bad at writing battle scenes.

***** Well, when you're fighting someone who's Imperioused, your options are basically kill them anyway, find a way to disable them until the fight is over, or take out the person controlling them, and hope they don't cause too much damage in the meantime. And they seemed to be going for the second option in the Battle of Hogwarts.

It's also possible that Percy and whoever else was fighting Thicknesse didn't know that he was Imperioused.

I'm about to lay down the blasted Lordship just so he stops calling me that - but now I see that might not even do the trick, as somehow all of you in Hogwarts believe, every pureblood house has their own titles!"

******* I just finished reading it and I'm very impressed. A strong Harry without him being god mode in first year. Adults who actually do things and are accountable. And an actually fleshed out world. Consider me a fan.

I find it interesting that you have Harry as a kind of mix between warrior, scholar and Lord.

If I'm right I'm seeing the start of him beginning to enjoy combat in a sense. While still being interested in the political and scholarly portions of the magical world.

The thing I loved most though was your portrayal of Voldemort. An ambitious, evil and insane man to be sure. But terrifyingly powerful and intelligent at the same time. Along with that charisma that would cause a legion of followers to side with him. I approve

Guilty as charged on that one. I just wanted a fic where stuff worked out for him and he overcame stuff, which means he kind of needs to actually he good at stuff like that.

Yeah not gonna say anything about that, but theres a reason combat is done the way it is in this fic, its gonna be great when I finally get to it.

Omg thank you on this. Voldemort is kind of like a cartoon villain in cannon so I just tweaked a few things now hes insane powerful and DANGEROUS. I love writing villains tbh and this version of Voldie speaks to me
