I've been hearing this fanfic praised quite often and have decided to give it a try, but I'm genuinely forcing myself to keep reading. I'm powering through because...well, it says "Harry Potter" in the title, but honestly, I find it way too self-indulgent "LOOK AT HOW SMART I AM" and I can't stand how pretty much every single character has been crippled for the sake of making the author's self-masturbatory self-insert stand out. The premise is interesting but the execution is horrible IMHO, and I find myself rolling my eyes in annoyance far more often than I'm actually enjoying the read.

Thoughts?


** Terrible pacing, terrible flow, overly complicated plots, muddled pedagogy, bad science pretending to be good science, maybe one or two neat ideas, a bunch of fun quotes and an incredibly irritating author.

Just because people liked the story enough to subscribe to that subreddit doesn't mean that each and every one thinks the story has good pacing, optimal flow, simple plots, efficient and clear pedagogy, good science, inifinity neat ideas, zero fun quotes and an extremely enlightened and totally-not-irritating author. Even if each and every one of them did indeed hold this opinion, that doesn't mean they are right.

There are over a billion Muslims and over a billion Catholics, which means at least a billion people are completely wrong about the nature of reality. I have no trouble with the idea that 10,000 fanfiction readers might be duped by a self-aggrandizing author.

That said, I'm sure plenty of people subscribed to that sub agree with many of the points yarg-barg made. In fact, a person might agree with every point [[/u/yarglethatbargle]] made and still subscribe to the sub because it's the first story they ever read and it gives them nostalgia.

No, based on being off-topic. Perhaps I didn't make that clear enough, but OP's question is clearly "What's the general opinion?", and Yarg answered with his personal opinion, without even stating it as such. I downvoted it as off-topic (and partially to counteract its being the most-upvoted answer there, which, with its small but real OTness, seemed very wrong to me).

** HPMoR while having some good elements, unfortunately has also many bad ones.

- Author wanking his philosophy all throughout with a great example being Harry getting super-powerful in a space on one year because he "thinks rationally" (and yes, I know how this is explained, his powering is still bullshit).

- Poor pacing, there are many unneeded scenes that bloat the fic and most do nothing to build either the characters (despite being this long, basically only five characters are given any personality) or to move the plot forward.

- Said plot lacked in any real conflicts until the end.

- "Let me explain all my plans to you" speech.

- Incredibly unsatisfying ending that relies on even bigger deus ex machinas than those employed by Rowling.

- Despite being "science" fic, LessWrong screwed up middle school level biology and then instead of admiting miatake went onto bullshit explanation how he intended Harry to be wrong there.

It feels like basically [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]] bait. It seems like it attracts the kind of people that pay themselves on the back for understanding any of it while the author goes out of their way to explain it all in laymen's terms.

Not saying if you enjoyed it that you're like that! Just that it seems like it very easily appeals to that type.

No but the second time I read it though ("There has to be part of this that makes people love it. I bet it's near the end!") It was grueling. Yes it's long and it's got a bunch of fancy magic stuff that sounds smart, but I don't think it's actually a good, well written fic.

  ...too self-indulgent "LOOK AT HOW SMART I AM"
#+end_quote

The first half of the last chapter is Harry basically agreeing with you.

Harry starts off as the genius 11-year-old equivalent of the college student who has just taken Psych 101. He thinks he knows everything and constantly notices other people not acting "rationally". Over the course of his first year at school he finds out that wow, life is complicated, he's not as good at being rational as he thought he was, and the stakes keep rising.

HPMoR has actual character development. Not a lot of fanfics can say that.

*** My problem isn't Harry being an arrogant douche. My problem is all the supporting cast, in however many chapters I got through, falling to their knees at the alter of the God that is Harry Potter's thought process. Nobody called him out on anything, it was just operated under the assumption that because Harry Potter said it wrong, you should feel guilty and like and horrible person and you sure as hell better genuflect to the shrine of Potter to beg forgiveness. It was essentially as if the author took every bizarre mental game of canon Snape to hate canon Harry and thought 'huh, that sounds /awesome/'.

I've read stories I've enjoyed that take almost every part of canon and bash it all to hell. But Methods of Rationality is, to the letter, the most pretentious 'I know better than everyone' story I have ever read in my entire life. It's ghastly.

In fact I'd leave it well alone and not go near it again with a 10ft barge pole. It like a few others make up the shaky foundations of popular fan fiction but like all foundations it really should be buried underneath far more likeable stuff. It creates a bunch of tropes and awful ideas and reading it gives you a slice of HP fanfic history but other than that it has little to no merit.

** I loved it when I first read it. I still really like it.

There is a warning at the beginning that says "If you don't like it in a few chapters, quit.", and I think it's a fair warning.

The first few chapters are a lot less coherent than later chapters, and are all about a genius-boy learning surface facts about magic. It grates. Waiting 50 chapters to find out what assumptions proved wrong or right or necessary to the story is a lot to ask for only a little payoff. Plus some threads are dropped completely.

The middle arcs are a combination of filler, in which it takes 20 chapters for Harry to learn an insignificant lesson, or neck-breaking romps through impossible danger, in which it takes 12 chapters for Harry to completely master some artifact or magical ability.

Still, the middle parts had fun romps and did a good job of portraying "look how much fun magic could be!"

Also, the story spawned Significant Digits, which I think is even better. It builds the world from hints in HPMOR, has compelling baddies, and though only a few fight scenes, they are well described.

What do you find excellent about the execution? Honestly curious, because I legitimately can't imagine finding the pages of unnecessarily lengthy and convoluted descriptions of simple concepts excellent. To me, it just comes off as "hey look how much I can say about this! ". And not even getting into how the author's self-admitted self- insert completely unrealistically bends adults with decades/ centuries of life experience to his will by basically throwing big words at them. Not to mention how everyone except said self- insert has been extremely dumbed down to allow that.

**** Yes the premise always made clear it would be a self-insert wank. That's why it is terrible. However, the way he went about that is interesting. The sheer creativity of some parts amazes me to this day. The guild battles, Azkabans quest, the final showdown against Voldemort in front of the mirror. All of these are brilliant, creative scenarios that have yet to be replicated in other fics. And Harry being the terrible character that he was allowed that to happen. I understand why it is the most popular fanfic in the fandom, as people love to feel smart by reading what they consider to be smart, but for me the creativity of this fic is what sells it to me. If Harry were a dumb boy (and probably a better character) but the author still managed to create such a story I'd still love it.

Also, the author is not a bad writer. Most of the characters that were not Harry had great characterization and voice. The pace was okay, and the plot made sense. He just HAD to write Harry like that, which I can forgive in the grand scheme of things.

Honestly i think that is an awesome fic and i could inf none of the problems that others did. Also Harry is that way for a purpose.

The author is a Proffessor maybe? And most of the times he uses the chapters as lectures. .

I think that's why people hate it. Less Wrong's (the author) Harry tends to divert and soliloque , explaining about logic fallacies and biases, applying them to the wizarding world and using real examples from Science.

The fic should be read in that mindset and he explains /that/ thoroughly in his notes. Ffs the first author note explains that the whole fic is one big exam that the readers should try to reveal.

Also he raises many problems with the JKR Plot that in retrospect are way too obvious and improves in other. Maybe that's another reason for all the hate
