The SI is a sociopath that manipulates everyone around him/her to they benefit.

And yes, I have read the doll gamer.

It's a co-written double SI, but my SI (Lyra Malfoy) is a manipulative asshole.

Excerpt:

#+begin_quote
  "Okay," said Lyra suddenly, with a nod as if it were all inconsequential. "I just wanted to study how they managed to capture such a powerful spell in something that could fit on a necklace, that's all. I want to do it with another spell. But hey," she said, standing up and shrugging, "if you're not comfortable giving it to me, that's fine." She clicked her tongue. "Man, I wish I was a worse person so I could just pressure you into giving it up. Or beat you up or something."

  Hermione knew Lyra was being genuine, that she didn't really care that much, but also that Lyra was probably still hoping that very fact would convince her to give up the Time-Turner; because if it's not a big deal to Lyra, then it shouldn't be a big deal to Hermione.

  She didn't think she had ever met someone who could be so casually conniving.

*** I love the premise, but the fact that it's co-written is a shame, since those tend to die almost every time. Budgeting time is horrible for creative writing process

In any case I'll be checking it out, sounds awesome and the 80k words that are already there are more than enough Haha

**** We both live on opposite sides of the world too. Though, the story isn't structured like your typical story. There's numerous arcs, numerous time skips, bits of slice of life, etc. The fic could end properly at 150k words, or go on past 500k. We don't really know. It's just a fun project for us.

I can easily foresee over 200k words, though.
