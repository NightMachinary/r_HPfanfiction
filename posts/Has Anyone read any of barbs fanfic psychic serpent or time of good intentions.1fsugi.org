**** The ones that I have found that compete have been from MadScientist

This Triligoy: Harry Potter and the Darkness before the Dawn Harry Potter and the Lions of Gryffindor Harry Potter and the War of Shadows

And then

Harry Potter and the Circle's End

They are some of the best I have ever read.

** I have. Psychic Serpent, Time of Good Intentions, and Triangle Prophecy.

They're good! (although they meander a bit, I think). I think Time of Good Intentions was my favorite of the three, but it's been a long time since I've read them

I would say /Backwards with Purpose/ is a fic of similar scope and duration.
