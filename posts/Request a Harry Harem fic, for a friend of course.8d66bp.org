** Searching for the Power is okay:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5790760/1/Searching-For-The-Power]])

There aren't really that many good smutty harem fics. The sex quickly devolves into paint by numbers and seems more like a chore than anything else.

  Hermione is told Love might be the Power-He-Knows-Not and vows to help Harry find it at any cost. Be Warned of some R/Hr until chpt 20 but skipping those chapters means missing out on H/Hr/G goodness. This is rated MATURE for ADULT CONTENT. Harry/Many

** Ridiculous?

[[https://ficwad.com/story/76962][Harry Potter and the Midnight Sun by Vanir]]

Summary: Harry escapes Britain, and learns the truth about the weirdest heritage ever. He learns stuff and gets some girls, too. There is much to experience in the land of the Midnight Sun

Per the Author's note:

#+begin_quote
  I'm writing this for my own amusement, so it won't be very good. This story will feature plenty of OC's, OOC behaviour, well trodden Clichéfilled paths and a hideously Super Harry. There will be pointless overdone smut. There will be plotholes large enough for Jupiter. There will be bizarre theories and strange forgotten stuff. I will drop threads. This story will not contain literature. I'm not just playing in JKR's sandbox. I'm mixing in concrete and ground glass.

  In a world where Harry and his twin sister are the Twins-Who-Lived, and their parents survived that Halloween night, there is a sexual social experiment at Hogwarts known as the Free Use Experience. Harry/Hermione/OFC/Multi; Sibling Incest; Mild Dumbledore/Snape/Ron bashing; Rated M for lots of lemons! Longer summary and many warnings inside. This story is not for prudes!

** Afaik, the best there is is linkffn(For Love of Magic) plot-wise with a lot of lemons, his main group is Luna, Tonks and Fleur, but he has Narcissa, Vector, All of Fleur's relatives, including her sister, 2 OCs and someonelse that I'm forgetting on the side. Don't be alarmed by the size though, its really good.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  It's every prince's dream wish. A harem for his birthday. When King James and Queen Lily gift their son, Harry, with a harem he was embarrassed. When they kissed for the first time he was aroused. It wasn't until he got to know them that he began to think that this was a bad idea. What do you get when you have seven men fighting over one delectable prince? A Harem Full of Trouble.
