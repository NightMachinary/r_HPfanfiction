Azkaban. Mad, mental, as they describe it. Some go insane and psychotic. It has been said that those who entered to investigate refused afterwards to talk of what they had found inside. However, for fallen Death Eaters such as Mrs. Bellatrix, it is simply a hideout to await the return of her master. It is assumed in the Order of the Phoenix that Bellatrix broke out of this prison, alongside with her fellow Death Eaters, just as bloodthirsty as she entered. But what did really occur in the years spent in this torturous reformatory, and what were the afterward affects? After the Dark Lord's fall on 31 October, 1981, Bellatrix and a group of Voldemort's followers, including Rodolphus, her brother-in-law Rabastan, and Barty Crouch Jr., kidnapped Aurors and Order of the Phoenix members Alice and Frank Longbottom, just new parents to Neville Longbottom. Bellatrix and her partners used the Cruciatus Curse to torture Alice and Frank for information on Voldemort's whereabouts, until the two captives were driven into insanity when they refused to divulge anything. This crime caused a wave of fury upon the wizard community of such ferocity, the Ministry was critically pressured to find the culprits, and when the four were captured they were tried before the Council of Magical Law, and sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban. Before her sentence, Bellatrix stood trial for her crimes, unlike many other Death Eaters, she did not lie about her loyalty --- she proudly claimed that she was loyal to Voldemort and that she would wait for Voldemort's return. Indeed, Bellatrix was so proud of her loyalty to Voldemort that, during her trial before the Council of Magical Law, she was said to have sat upon the chair she was chained to as if it were a throne. Though Bellatrix was in prison for only a short fifteen years, it greatly affected her mental stability. There with her husband, one would think the couple would survive hand in hand. However, rumor has it that Mrs. Lestrange became more than a mere servant to the Dark Lord. Blinded with bloodlust just as Voldemort, she gained great affection and unfamiliar fondness from him. She would kill for him, she would torture for him, and more than anything else, Bellatrix was willing to follow him straight to hell if it meant that Voldemort would give her respect. Because Bellatrix Lestrange was the Queen Bee, but this queen needed a king, and she was more than willing to let Voldemort be her king, because her useless Death Eater of a husband certainly wasn't enough to cut it for someone like Bellatrix. Had anyone served him more loyally than she? Bellatrix, who, even at twenty, had already killed a dozen men and women for a man, who would willingly turn in her own family if her lord asked her to do so. Some entitled her as mad, but Voldemort saw the truth. "A visionary", he called her, "a visionary with hands dipped in blood and a heart as dark as the night. A visionary, that is what you are, Bellatrix, and none other than me can ever truly understand how that feels. They do not understand the truth of how it feels inside to have control over another, to rule over them like you are their god." And what made it superior was that her husband recognized all of it. He identified that Bellatrix loved Voldemort more than she loved him and that she was prepared to do anything he commanded her to do. But Rodolphus did nothing. He said nothing and so she kept doing, coming home late at night with a smirk, almost daring him to call her out, but Rodolphus was not brave like she was, like Voldemort was, and he only took it, accepting it as just another part of their unwanted marriage. She had been his servant for over twenty years, serving him, falling at his feet. Worshipping him, because Voldemort was her lord, her love, and there was no one else in the world who she would rather follow than him. No one else who she would die for. If it was an obsession, then Bellatrix did not want to ever be cured. If it was an obsession, then she would rather die for it than live in a world where she was away from her lord. If it was an obsession, then the world better look out for Bellatrix Lestrange n√©e Black, because she was willing to do anything for Lord Voldemort, even if it meant everyone else in the world had to die. Especially if it meant everyone else in the world had to die.

I would like to read your story, but it's currently an intimating block of letters.
