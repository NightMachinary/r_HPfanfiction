** I'm sure that there are plenty of stories that fit your criteria, but often people don't tag the full four characters.

*** Yes, I think that's main reason. Very popular (lots of Favorites) fics such as “A Black Comedy”, “Emperor”, “Seventh Horcrux”, and “The Accidental Bond” all list Harry as the only main character.

Also, fics published before 2013 can only have two main characters tagged.

**** And I don't remember when exactly they introduced it, but there are stories on FFN that predate any character tagging at all.

Also some authors choose not to use it, for whatever reason.

** Because people seldom bother with the "characters" part of the fics. Frankly speaking, it is not like you can realistically expect people to put all the characters there. They usually just put the main ones or the ones involved with each other.

**** Yes, but like I said, people don't usually have 4 main characters, and even when they do, they don't necesarily tag it like that.

Those tags are more usually used for characters that are in relationships or have a constant perspective in the story.

***** That, and as mentioned elsewhere, the ability to add more than two characters wasn't there at first.

** FF.Net is not AO3. The character tags on FF.Net are generally used to show pairing and main character only.

A pity that AO3 does not have the same tagging culture.

** You know, in most other fandoms sixty 40,000 word or longer fanfics about /specific characters/ would be /a banquet/, not something to complain about.

We're kind of spoiled for choice here.
