Alright, let me explain this. I'm currently discussing a potential Dark!Harry fic with a friend of mine, when we got onto the topic of Muggleborns.

Fanon usually has it so that Muggleborns are oppressed in Wizarding Britain, typically getting shit jobs in the Ministry, and most jobs in general being given to people with connections.

Muggleborns probably make up a fair portion of the Wizarding World, and even if their numbers are lower than I'd imagine there's still a lot of sympathetic Half-Bloods.

I don't think it's too crazy a thought for some aspiring Dark Lord to go 'hmm there's an oppressed group of people pissed at the people who are currently in charge, looks like I just found my army.'

So basically imagine one of those Pureblood Genocide fics, except it's not Hermione or the Order leading the movement, but a genuine Dark Lord playing up people's hatred and getting his political enemies killed via the power of the mob.

Hermione mentions the French Revolution and other bloody moments in history, pointing out that slaughtering everyone in charge /isn't/ how a stable government should be formed? "Hm yea good point I'd be inclined to believe it if you weren't a /Pureblood sympathizer/."

Dumbledore tries to calm them down? "For all your political power you never completely reformed the system? Pureblood Sympathizer tbh."

So I just need to ask, has something like this been done before? Cause I'm thinking it would be pretty cool, and I gotta say I'll be pretty bumbed if someone did it already (because it's sure to be better than anything I crap out)


** Imo in canon muggleborns aren't really that opressed. In fact it's the sentiment among purebloods that they're gaining so much equality, and they're coming for your job is why Voldemort was able to take control of them.

I compare pre canon muggleborn relations to race relations today. There's no longer a systemic discrimination, but some racist sentiment with a group of extremists on one end.

*** There was even a lack of panic or urgency among Muggleborns when Voldemort's return became public.

Too many seemed to be completely caught off guard when the Ministry turned against them in DH.

*** Yea, I agree. I was just pointing out that in fanon, Muggleborn oppression seems to be common place.

**** Haha yeah there are a lot of fanon ideas that grind my gears. The two most being marriage law and seer luna.

Luna is a magnificent character by herself. There's no need to falsely make her more than she is.

***** Marriage law is one big fucking human rights violation that even Nazis, Stalinists, and Maoists didn't dare to implement.

Those dumb fucks who came up with that stupid idea had no clue about how real people would respond to that kind of shit, not withstanding our heroes who trashed Voldemort and his Death Eaters.

*** There has to have been some prejudice though, since they went more than 250 years before they had their first muggle-born minister of magic (in 1962).

Although that may depend on money and connections rather than blood. Muggle Prime Ministers didn't come from working class backgrounds either...

** The only story I know of that comes close to your idea is Linkffn(Reverse by Lady Moonglow) but it takes place after the Muggleborns have won the war using the dark arts and Muggle technology.
