We know that voldemort is not the only dark lord that ever exists. Also, since the prophecy is always being kept on the department of mystery, is there any fic where the opposition, either dumbledore or the ministry, uses every general purpose prophecy like harry that only refer to dark lord and how to vanquish them?

Well... I don't think that dark lord is a profitable profession with so many ways people can screw with you, though....
