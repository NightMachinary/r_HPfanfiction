What if James and Lily hadn't relied on a Secret Keeper and instead just decided to dig a panic bunker somewhere in England? The 'attack' on the house in Godric's Hollow was really a crashed plane and, hilariously, it also did Kill Voldemort. The explosion was enough to launch their paranoia into overdrive and James and Lily take baby Harry down into the bunker and set the time locks for 10 years, right when he's about ready to start Hogwarts.

Harry grows up with his parents but everyone believes that the Muggle airplane crash killed them, because the house was annihilated in the explosion. In their extreme paranoia James and Lily believe that no one can be trusted and the world above is controlled by Voldemort. When the locks open on his 11th birthday, they send Harry to Hogwarts to investigate. By this time, James and Lily are assuming that Voldemort controls Wizarding Britain, including Hogwarts. Harry is instructed to use an assumed name and keep his head down and try to see if there is any resistance he can contact.

In this scenario the prophecy did happen but Harry never became a horcrux and also never became the boy who lived, because Voldemort died in the plane crash.

Harry has a good idea about Wizarding culture but he has no idea what's been going on for the last decade.

Hilarity ensues.


** It's not paranoia if they really are out to get you, at that point it's pragmatism. That being said your idea sounds absolutely hilarious
