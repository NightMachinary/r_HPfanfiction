Saving Sirius...... time turner in hand

Liberating London time travel and Ron following behind him

Finding the only thing you have in the fridge after a long day at the office is a moldy half eaten dry turkey sandwich..... two quick turns and you are Browsing Texaco's while your other half it grumpily filling out arrest warrants at tgd office dream of a nice chicken curry after a long day at the office.

Time travel become just another part of life until at 52 some random French woman ask why you are 127 years of age Mr. Potter?
