Yule Ball Drama by Vance McGill

Classic Harry takes Hermione to the Yule Ball GoF fic, it's got a lot of bashing(Dumbledore, Molly, Ginny, and Ron) which I don't really like but it's a fun read. Some stuff is kind of unrealistic but I enjoying it.

Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path by TemporalKnight

I know this is a very common Harmony(although it become poly later on[I won't spoil in case some hasn't read yet]) fic but I'm a little farther than halfway through and I love it. It's probably my favorite fic I've ever read.

** Just caught up with the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1722145][Revolutionary Arc]] by kitsunerei88, which is a recursive fic series of The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter, diverging at the start of year four. Both the original and the spinoff are over a million words each.

Pretty epic, but it gets gritty once the war begins; murkybluematter tried to keep the characters alive, but kitsunerei88 is willing to kill them off. And both are willing to torment them. Book five (which looks like the final one) is not yet finished but is actively updating.

**** Pacing is a bit hard to judge, because the first three books are basically alternate points of view on the original four years: Caelum Lestrange, Aldon Rosier, and Archie. Book 4 is a polite and civilised war; book 5 is a full-scale violent one.

Writing quality is good, some errors but not more than the original, I don't think. It questions or challenges Harry and Archie's decisions more, but they're never antagonists, it just makes a point of recognising that there were almost certainly better courses of action that a pair of 11-year-olds overlooked. And as mentioned, with a war happening, people die more, including named characters.

** linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan), rated M. Possibly one of the best Ron-centric fanfics out there. The premise is that eight-year-old Ron gets visions of the future about the war and Fred's death and he works to prepare for the war and improve himself in order to change Fate. I found it refreshing to find a fic where Ron takes agency and puts in effort to get ahead instead of just going with the flow, and I enjoyed the early chapters as I tried to guess the origins of Ron's visions. At first I thought he was a Seer, then a Time Traveler, but it goes off in a different direction that was surprising.

One of the best features of this fic is that the author portrays the characters realistically and avoids bashing or Mary Sue's. None of the characters are flawless or infallible (except maybe Luna) and the changing character POV adds depth and insight to the characters instead of just solely following Ron around, even the bad characters.

The story is well written and compelling, not to mention that it's also lengthy and well paced. While the genres it has listed are Adventure and Fantasy, it also includes other like Angst, Humor, Romance, Mystery and Suspense. The story starts out pretty mild, some angst and humor and family stuff but it gets much darker as the story progresses, as does Ron. He doesn't go full Dark but turns into a Grey character.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

** Just got finished reading Season of Warmth by Snapegirlkmf, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6535829/1/Season-of-Warmth]]. Very nice. Snape n Harry become friends. Very well written, the plot develops at a good pace, lots of good, realistic emotional nuance. Positive and heartwarming story (my /fav/ kind of story). If you like the author corvusdraconis you'll like this one. 4.5 out of 5 stars. I look forward to reading more stories by this author.

Only downside is some excessively long expositions of the character's inner mental and emotional state, but that's a common problem in a lot of otherwise good fan fiction. I often just skim/skip these sections. Seems that many fanfic writers can't resist the urge to explain character's inner states in endless mind-numbing detail; page after page after page. I have to create a meme and hashtag about this.

** 1. “The Ilvermorny Champion by Vance McGill” linkffn(12048619) ... I have tried to read this story couple of years ago, and I had very different impressions from the part I read then now. Originally, I was intrigued by the idea of true character development of Hermione from ostracised, bullied, and truly socially awkward ugly duckling to the beautiful swan and girlfriend to the Boy Who Lived. Except, I switched off the book, when I hit requirement for Harry to be multiply married with multiple wives. Recently somebody mentioned this story again, and so I have decided to clench my teeth and try to get through my first harem story. And yes, my prejudices were right, harem (or polygamy) is really 100% sign of the story I don't want to read. No, it is not porn, yes, it is rated M for a reason, but nothing which wouldn't coming out of the story. Yes, there is (in my opinion) too much romantic lesbian relationship between two twelve years old girls (no, nothing physical). However, it was just another proof that authors who go for the glittery shenanigans like harem, betrothal contracts, usually use them as a substitute for the real story. The key event around which whole plot line happens when suddenly one of the main heroines of the story suddenly behaves like an idiot just because author didn't find an organic way how to force story to be like he wanted it, so he beaten it down into submission. Moreover (and that's my general problem with Lord/Heiress type of stories), that life is so distant and alien to me, that I have no emotional contact and interest in it. Sorry, time wasted.

2. “[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and The Goblet of Fire by Coulsdon Eagle]]” (Summary: “What if it had been Hermione's name that the Goblet of Fire spat out? A complex spell cast one summer with the most innocent of intentions results in the Brightest Witch of her Age being entered into the Triwizard Tournament. How can she get out of this?”, last update: 2012-10-31) Classical Harmony story about budding relationship of Harry and Hermione during the Triwizard Tournament, but with a twist that the involuntary fourth Champion is Hermione, not Harry. Contrary to many other Harmony stories this is really well written: there is character development, characters are not just materialized wishful thinking of the author, Hermione is really not a Wonder Woman, they really struggle to decide for each other (actually, I am not sure whether they have a real full mouth-to-mouth kiss in whole story). Also, the relationship between Hermione and her parents is a way more complicated than the 100% approval usual in other Harmony stories. Also, the bad person are really bad, and they try to hurt Hermione all the time. The whole thing was a way more realistic than usual. If you are into GoF stories (and I am kind of fed up with them), then this is certainly the one to read.

3. “A Pinch of Salt, A Dash of Magic by kgfinkel” linkffn(13715486) This is just pure delight. Harry grows up with good!Dursleys and he loves to cook and does it well. Pre-Hogwarts story with a lot of recipes included (kind of similar in this with “proof by novensides” linkao3(15687453)). Sweet, super-sweet, but good desert.

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** I am completely enthralled by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13653786/1/Serpentine-Advice][Serpentine Advice]] linkffn(13653786). The story has a little bit for everyone: romance (non-harem HP/DG/HG love triangle), political intrigue, grey!Harry, founders, economics, ethics/morality, etc.

It starts near the end of 3rd year when Harry discovers a portrait of Salazar Slytherin in the Chamber of Secrets, which begins a mentor/mentee relationship between the two. The story is a work in progress and 4th year is on the very of beginning. The author updates frequently.

  Following the events of Third Year, Harry Potter explores the Chamber of Secrets and finds a portrait of Salazar Slytherin. Following Slytherin's advice, Harry will attempt to break out of the games set upon him and finally be free. But how? And is freedom even possible for the Boy-Who-Lived?

  Leo Castor Black of Number 4, Privet Drive was happy to say that he was the furthest thing from normal, thank you very much. Most likely because that would make him like the Dursleys, whom he despised. Fortunately, he was more like his cousin, Harry. When a couple of letters appear and tell them they're wizards... well, the boy couldn't be more pleased. Rest of Summary in Prologue.

** I just found "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8662596/1/The-Song-of-the-Hat][The Song of the Hat]]", by Gothelittle Rose. It's a next-gen fic with OCs, which might seem like a big red warning sign, but the characterizations and writing quality are almost professional in quality. It stays almost completely true to canon, and the plot is intriguing and not cliched at all. I cannot recommend it enough!
