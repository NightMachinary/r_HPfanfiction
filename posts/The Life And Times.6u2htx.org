I know that this probably gets posted about a lot and that some people done care for this fic but I just finished and I am at a loss. It was incredible and I felt a huge array of emotions through out the whole things and the characters, to me, are portrayed perfectly. I usually hate OCs but I even loved the ones in this. Does anyone know/have any thought/hopes/dreams etc about whether or not this fic will ever be updated? I mean life goes on but I would absolutely love to read the rest of the story.

Also feel free to just discuss why you love TLAT here, I'm in mourning.

*** I started rereading it recently but haven't been very diligent. I really don't know if there is any hope at this point. I really want to think so because I desperately want to see how she would address lily and james actually getting together/telling their feelings to one another

***** Yeah I mean that's true like she would have just told people if she was going to dump it. Ugh idk it's just a really good fic, really really well written and she's honestly just a really talented writer. She made me fall in love with the marauders Era for sure and I think she does and awesome job of setting the scene for he time period as well.

On another note, do you have any fic recs? I'm looking to start something new.
