I mainly use AO3 but I recently downloaded the FanFiction.Net app so there is cool too! I'm not extremely picky on ships or themes as well. My guilty pleasure is evil Dumbledore though. Main main goal are for fanfics that are long!! Literally I just need recommendations so I'll even take some medium length ones. Please please give me recs. I beg!

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead."---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.

** Here are some of the larger fics I have saved in Calibre, in no particular order. It's a bit of a variety.

linkao3(Muggle Management) - This is the first installment in the Hermione Granger and the Child Protection Movement series. Yes, it's super short, but the whole thing is 306k words. Some similar themes that you'd find in AYLNO, and while the series isn't complete you can treat it as such: the authors are still debating another installment.

linkffn(11439594) - Rebuilding: I would say that, if you only read one Dramione fic - pick this one, as it progresses reasonably realistically. EWE. It's all the students figuring out what the fuck happens next when they return for year seven. Trigger warnings for PTSD and related traumas apply here. 260k ish words. Has a stupid number of chapters because it started as a series of drabbles before kind of exploding.

linkao3(Holly at Hogwarts: Now and Forever) - Another series, this one is next generation. I've read the first installment, but never got around to the rest. You're looking at 1.4 million words and counting here.

linkao3(5121464) The Perfectly Normal series by BrilliantLady. It's nearly 600k words, and the author is active in comments stating that another installment is on the way.

And then there's [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1456519][this series]] which has a bit of everything. It's episodic, contains several crossover segments you can bounce around in the series and read whatever strikes your fancy. Be aware, however, that there's a lot of fix-it and OP!Harry in here. A bunch of evil Dumbledore is scattered throughout. Around a million words written by that author. If interested, you're probably going to want to start with the original, which is here: linkffn(2673584)

Edit - Note about Rebuilding. For the longest time, I didn't get the hate for the pairing as this was the only fic I'd read with it. And then I read more, and went "Oh". There's a lot more going on than just the pairing, so unless you're a rabid detractor or the chapter length pisses you off (and really I wouldn't blame you), then give it a shot.

** Hmmm, hard thing to do, recommending a fic here, since I'll most likely recommend ones that you have already read, since I've picked the ones I've read just by listening to other popular opinions. But hey, there's a chance that you haven't seen these particular ones, and you might even like one or two of these, so here goes nothing.

I'd like to start with The Arithmancer Series, by White Squirrel. It begins with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]], a Hermione-centric fic, that delves in spellcrafting and gives Hermione a more prominent role in the usual story we all already know, making significant changes here and there and then taking a huge divergence later on. It has a couple of sequels, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13001252/1/Annals-of-Arithmancy][Annals of Arithmancy]].

Next on my list is the Unbroken Universe, by Robin4. This is a series of Sirius-centered fics, in a dark world where war is rampant and Voldermort is threatening to win. Everything starts with the decision of not making Pettigrew the secret keeper. That little change makes everything... well, different. It starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/Promises-Unbroken][Promises Unbroken]], continues with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1567001/1/Promises-Remembered][Promises Remembered]], and ends with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2204188/1/Promises-Defended][Promises Defended]]. The saga has a prequel too, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4881348/1/Promises-Honored][Promises Honored]], and while it's a prequel it's read best after you have finished the rest of the story. Wanted long fics? Boy, these are *LONG*. Consider yourself warned.

Next in the list is a honorable mention that I feel I have to do. And I say honorable mention because, regrettably, it seems that this story has been abandoned for a couple of years now. But man, what is there is glorious. The story is called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]], by Rakeesh. Time-travelling female Harry (Jasmine) goes back 5000 years in time and witnesses and takes part in memorable historic events. Fantastic story and great character development. Just to give you a teaser, the Myrddin arc is absolutely beautiful, and it can be read as a standalone story of its own.

Next, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]], by Mrs J's Soup. You've probably seen this one recommended a lot too here, and that's because it's really well written. It's a Sirius and Hermione centric fic. Hermione goes back in time to try to make some changes so the present time doesn't go so horribly wrong. The first person she meets when she gets there is Sirius, and things get, well, complicated. Lighthearted sense of humor, and the story is engaging.

Next one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory][A Cadmean Victory]], by DarknessEnthroned. This one starts in 4th year, with the TWT and a slight change of Harry's personality by the author. This slight change makes everything diverge significantly from the original story. With 520,351 words, I think this one meets your criteria by far. Be warned, though, this story really honors its title.

And lastly, I could mention [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434/1/Unspeakable-Things][Unspeakable Things]], by Darth Marrs. I hesitate to mention this, though, because I don't think it's on par with the rest I've listed before. The premise is that Lockhart is not the incompetent cretin we know from the book, and that's actually a facade to hide his true persona, an undercover agent of the Unspeakables, who later recruits Harry and Ginny into his operation. Sometimes darker, sometimes borderline crackfic, take this one with a grain of salt.

So that's it. Good luck finding something you like from this list. Knock yourself out.

​

EDIT: Shit, how could I forget to mention [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose: Always and Always]] and its sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4337434/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-II-The-Book-of-Albus][Backward With Purpose: The Book of Albus]], by deadwoodpecker?. This one features Harry, Ron and Ginny, mainly, in a story where they send themselves back in time to fix their mistakes in their original timeline. I don't know how to describe this one without spoiling it, but believe me when I tell you that it's one of my favorite fics I've ever read. If I had to recommend one to start from this list, it would be this one.

​

EDIT II: Let me try to get the fancypants bot to link all of these too. If I muck it up somehow, please let me know so I can fix the links.

linkffn(10070079;11463030;13001252;1248431;1567001;2204188;4881348;9860311;8581093;11446957;6473434;4101650;4337434)

​

EDIT III: Fuck me, I keep forgetting to add items to the list. If you want a long fic (kinda) I could point you in the direction of [[https://jspotter.fandom.com/wiki/G._Norman_Lippert][George Norman Lippert]]. He's an author who has actually written several books, among them the James Potter series. They even count with Rowling's endorsement. The first two books from this series were actually my introduction to Harry Potter fanfiction in general, and I think I couldn't have had a better one, since his narrative matches the one of Rowling extremely well. The characters feel authentic and the story is well thought and laid. And of course, it spans for 5 books (yes, books!). It's a next gen fic with Harry's firstbon, James, as the main character. He and his brother make new friends in their years in Hogwarts, and they meet new memorable characters. Things start simple and innocent enough, but like with a well used Chekhov's Gun, everything ties up neatly at the end. Highly recommended too. I don't have links for these, since they're not in AO3 or FFN, but they're all easy to find in his website.

Again, I hope you like these, and good luck with your search.

** I normallly never comment, but you mentioned one of my biggest criteria for fanfics, which is length, so here you go, have some suggestions. (Warning: I have a bad memory, so any descriptions I give may be slightly inaccurate. Also, hopefully I link correctly, if not, I will have the names next to them all.) Also, plus next to those I loved more than the rest.

+ linkffn(11191235) - *Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin* - Words: 848,223 Ongoing - Essentially a story of twins and Wrong BWL. Slytherin Harry, Lily and James lived. Lily is a professor and James is an Auror. The key point of this fic is that the Heir of Slytherin isn't the only position of power in the snake den. One of my favorite moments in this fic is the reveal of a certain DADA professor. To not spoil it, I'll leave it as that.

​

linkffn(5681042) - *Heart and Soul* - Words: 751,333 Complete - This is a marriage contract fanfic between Harry and Fleur, which does become a HP/FD/HG pairing (Said in description) Not going to lie, I don't recall much of this fanfic, but I do recall there being an interesting take on horcruxes.

​

linkffn(8186071) - *Harry Crow -* Words: 737,006 Complete - It's RobSt, need I say more? Goblin Harry. From what I remember of the fic, I loved the smart/dangerous Harry.

​

linkffn(9200391) linkffn(12516317) *Home/Return* - Words: 610,682/167,450 Complete/Complete - Harry grows up in Hogwarts, Ravenclaw. Biggest gripe with this story is a bit silly, but the chapter lengths are really short in comparison to most other fanfics I'll list, where most are roughly 3k words each, so chapters feel like they fly by.

​

+ linkffn(11574569) - *Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw* - Words: 592,152 Ongoing - It's a Time Travel fic with implied future harem. If a butterfly wings can cause Tsunamis half-way across the word, how would a giant club interact with the time-line? This is another twin fanfic, with the wrong BWL as well, parents alive and well. I just love the idea of character specialization. My biggest gripe, which is somewhat resolved in later chapters is the overuse of the Fidelius Charm. At the current chapter (53) there's a major confusion point for me, but it's due to the references to a character. "Dead silence filled the room. The ________ might as well have said, 'What's wrong with familicide?', or 'By the way, I've got a bomb rigged under the floor and it's set to go off if anyone says the word cheese.'" Yeah, I'm actually massively curious at this point since a lot of characters seem just a bit off. (Not what I'd expect, rather than straight ooc.)

​

linkffn(11080542) - *Patron* - Words: 542,678 - Complete - From what I recall, this is a story that revolves around a more structured aristocracy setup where the wizengamot and the noble houses are more than just fancy names. Muggleborns need to have these houses be patrons for them, it's law.

​

linkffn(2954601) linkffn(4924075) - *Taking Control / Free Life* - Words: 523,307/72,568 Complete/Ongoing (IT'S ON GOING DAMMIT! IT'S NOT DEAD! ...It's pretty dead.) - Harry finally takes his education seriously. I think you can stop at the end of Taking Control and envision an end from what I recall. Free Life is 7 or so chapters, and doesn't get that far.

​

+++ linkffn(12021325) - *Antithesis -* Words: 483,433 Complete Another twin, Wrong BWL, as with most of the ones I've read, they dislike/hate each other, just another same bland sto- Oh, wait, you want to have your heart ripped out your chest, crying about a family that could have been? Crying about an all around abused Har- Adrian Selwyn WHO JUST WANTS TO BE FUCKING LOVED? WARNING: THIS STORY IS DARK. If you are okay with that and haven't read it yet, READ IT NOW. AND DAMMIT, CAN SOMEBODY GET THIS BLOODY BOWL OF ONIONS AWAY FROM ME??? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GO!

​

linkffn(12177140) - *Phoenix Corrupted* - Words: 387,513 Ongoing (1 year since last update, not too long.) Whole different starting premise to this Boy Who Lived. Professor Dumbledore teaches DADA, and the Headmaster has an interesting ability. If I remember correctly, the story so far is pretty sad, and the current latest chapter (56) is just one long chain of sadness. This is a great story so far.

​

+ linkffn(8379655) - *Hogwarts Battle School* - Words: 367,472 Ongoing (1 year since last update, not too long I keep telling myself.) Headmaster Snape runs his school a bit differently than ol' Dumbly did. Imagine a blend of Harry Potter and Ender's Game, with a slytherin Harry, and you get Hogwarts Battle School. Going though my favorites tonight has essentially made me consider rereading this one, even though it hasn't been updated since I last read it. I'd suggest giving it a read, but it might be a bit battle intensive from what I remember.

​

linkffn(4985330) - *The Other Boy Who Lived -* Words: 251,803 Complete - (This will be an anomaly with my list, since so far they've been decreasing in word count, but it's by the same author as Hogwarts Battle School.) Harry isn't the Boy Who Lived, it's Neville. Also, Harry is an awkward boy when it concerns one particular bushy witch. The end is... pretty sad. (I'm sensing a pattern here... hrmm...)

​

Now we are getting to the sub 300k mark, so I'm just going to place the link and name. These are all complete.

linkffn(3655940) - *Harry Potter: Dark Memories*

​

+ linkffn(1779333) - *Harry Potter and the Runespoor Shield* (I lied, here's a comment.) Great story, but while this story says complete, it's supposed to have a sequel, which unfortunately was either never published, or never written. Good read nonetheless.

​

linkffn(8303194) - *Magicks of the Arcane*

​

linkffn(8670912) linkffn(9196576) linkffn(10905633)- *Harry Potter and the Gift of Memories / Harry Potter and the Heir of Slytherin / Harry Potter and the Ties that Bind* (Wow, I'm a liar. All total, this is roughly 700k words.)

​

Welp, that's it from me from FanFiction at least. There's also A Different Beginning on SIYE, and I cannot for the life of me remember the name of the blind Harry story, which was pretty great. Also, tried not to include any mentioned below, (Although I really really wanted to mention The Accidental Animagus. Kitten Harry is one of the greatest ideas in fanfiction in my mind) and there is a good chance I missed some of the larger HP fanfics solely due to having forgotten to favorite/follow them. Oh, also you can use Scryer DarkLordPotter to search all HP fanfics in various ways. I use the sort by length quite often myself.

​

If you or anybody else has any recommendations with a similar length criteria, I'd love to hear them. (Just be aware that if it's told from the perspective of an OC, I may not read it unless given a recommendation as to why. Please do if you love the story yourself.)

​

Have fun reading!

-Green

Now, off to sleep, since I started writing this at 4am and it's nearly 8am.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  One year ends and another begins. During this year, Harry Potter studies under Nicolas Flamel, is forced to deal with a Vampire Princess, and learns there is yet another danger lurking within the walls of Hogwarts, one that's been around since the time of the Founders. What's a poor student with perfect memory to do? Sequel to Gift of Memories. Warning: Character Death!

**** Np. I do seriously recommend Antithesis, I think it's one of the few, if only, stories in which I've cursed at the author at the same time I complemented them. Oceanbreeze7 had a habit in that story to not hold back any punches and that when you were down, to continue kicking you. I'd scream something right now, but it's a major spoiler, so just take my tears. (;´༎ຶД༎ຶ`)

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
