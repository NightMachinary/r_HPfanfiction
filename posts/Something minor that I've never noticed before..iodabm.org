** I think you've run into just another example of the "Hogwarts is bigger than it's depicted as being" problem.

There are various signs Hogwarts is meant to be much larger than it seems in canon. We're told in PoA that there's approx. 200 students in Slytherin. Dumbledore is described as having been the head of the Transfiguration department, implying other teachers working beneath him. And previously unfamiliar students such as Cormac McLaggen - a Gryffindor, no less - pop up every so often.

Given these - especially the explicit statement of 200 students - I think you just have to take the view that the narrative focus is on Harry to the exclusion of all else, but actually there must be e.g. another dorm of Gryffindor boys in Harry's year.

Remember, at the end of the day, the Harry Potter story is not a first person story. The narrator's voice is not Harry's voice. For a start, the narrator uses language Harry would never use and words he likely doesn't know. But the reverse is also true: Harry knows lots of things the narrator doesn't. Harry knows a lot more about magic than is ever depicted, for example - he's been attending classes and writing homework on it for years. And similarly, he must know a lot more students and teachers than we as readers do.

The only thing that's a real sticking point is the DADA curse, which plays a plot function and rather implies that there's only one DADA teacher. But there are ways around that, albeit none of them fully satisfactory.

With all that in mind, I don't find it odd at all that Zach Smith wasn't mentioned prior to OotP even when he's in Harry's year. There will be a lot of students in Harry's year who are never mentioned.
