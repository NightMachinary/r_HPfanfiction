:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've read "Tainted or Saved" by Neryx & Queen_Snake [[ [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17211539]] ]] and I've been wondering if there's any more of this kind of works? That was the first work I've seen that had Harry take the Dark Mark - that's the only think i'm looking for, really. Don't really care for the rest of the fic.


** There is linkffn(12912422), though it is a Time Travel story. But it shows imo why Voldemort was so feared back in the day.

  Harry accidentally time travels to 1979, where he is immediately captured by Voldemort. After many months of posing as a loyal Death Eater, he is then captured by the Order. Misunderstandings ensue. (Post-Canon, ignores epilogue)

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...

** In this fic Harry time travels to the Marauders era and eventually winds up taking the Dark Mark:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10413771/][Turning of the Times]]

In this fic Harry takes the Dark Mark after being summoned by the Order in an alternate universe:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13209163/1/The-Other-Side-of-Reality][The Other Side of Reality]] (sequel/spinoff to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12773864/1/The-Will-of-All-Others][The Will of All Others]]) - This fic is tropey ('for the greater good' Dumbledore, etc.), but in my opinion it's a fun read.

  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.

  Sequel to The Will of All Others. Harry is trapped in every way under the rule of Lord Voldemort. Now he has been summoned to an Alternate Universe where everything is at once so much better and so much worse. As the events of his world threaten to repeat themselves, how can Harry save this universe, when he couldn't even save his own?
