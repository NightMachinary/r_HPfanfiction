So basically I'm looking for are fics in which Harry has being modified on a genetic level, or augmented with mechanics, whether that was alongside or against his will. Fics like crossovers with x-men(mutant), or warhammer and halo (marine, spartan), Tokyo ghoul, Mass Effect (geth synthetic). He might have subjected himself to the change willingly in an act of desperation or be kidnapped for catching the wrong people's attention, or be just part of an accident.


** Ugh, I remember an 100k+ fic which featured a young (around 10?) Harry and an OC freaky powerful little girl infiltrating a Russian facility in order to rescue another freaky powerful little girl thats getting experimented upon. Harry also had some shit done to him, though I'm not sure what it was.

I can't for the life of me remember the title or author though.

*** You're likely thinking of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11589304/1/Blood-is-not-family][/Blood is not family,/]] a HP × F.E.A.R. crossover. I'd call it a crackfic, but it's rather close to what OP's looking for.

Other more or less relevant stories to mention:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][/With Strength of Steel Wings/]] --- Harry's muggle caretaker aims to use Harry as his key to the magical world. To some degree, Harry experiments on himself as well.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2428341/1/Mastermind-Hunting][/Mastermind Hunting/]] --- (spoilers) Harry accidentally apparates inside the LHC, becomes kinda-omnipotent, gets [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DePower][de-powered]] again for the plot tension to survive, then eventually uploads his consciousness into a computer and makes copies of himself that way. Cons: magically and intellectually weak enemies, also has an extremely stupid ending.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10784770/1/Harry-Potter-Geth][/Harry Potter: Geth/]] (HP × ME)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10006313/1/Ascension][/Ascension/]] (HP × ME, don't remember if it had any modifications in it)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10552390/11/Magic-Online][/Magic Online/]] --- starts as a HP × SAO crossfic, quickly turns into another rehearsal of canon stations.

** There was a comedy fic a loooong time ago with genetic alterations of humans getting animal characteristics in both the muggle and magical world. The genetic manipulators needed a sample from the animal though. In it, Harry managed to wrestle a feather from Fawkes after he delivered a letter from Dumbledore or something.

So he got the operation done. I don't remember much about it other than the fact he was crossed with a phoenix. I do remember that he stole Lucius Malfoy's "pimp cane" somehow, though. That was pretty funny.
