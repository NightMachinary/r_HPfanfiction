My favorite characterization of Snape that I've ever read is [[https://snapecase.livejournal.com/50627.html][Finally, With Nothing On My Tongue by ms_anthrop]]. Where Snape is a genuinely good person, but to do the most that he can he /needs/ to be perceived as bad, no matter how much that hurts him. He's still not a nice person by any means, though.

I'd really like to read anything with Snape as a major character where there's any form of actual depth to him. More than just ' gigantic asshole that's a spy with dubious loyalties'.

If it's long I'd prefer it be HP-centric, with Snape as a side character. Preferably no slash in the main pairing, too. Side pairings are fine. Bonus points if it's HP/Fleur, which I'm currently on a binge of.


** I really enjoyed Snape's depth in linkffn(darkness visible by plutoplex)... but it kind of goes off the rails in the end.

*** Could you explain a bit more what you mean by off the rails? Hopefully without major spoilers, but when the fic is 123 chapters a bit information would be great if you have it!

**** It's hard to say without giving it away. Something happens that causes a drastic change to Snape's character, but it makes sense in context. As a reader it made me go "WHAT that is not what I expected to happen!!!!" and the ending was a little abrupt. I'd still recommend it though.
