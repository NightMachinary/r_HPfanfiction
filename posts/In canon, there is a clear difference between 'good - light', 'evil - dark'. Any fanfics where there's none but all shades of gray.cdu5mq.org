#+TITLE: In canon, there is a clear difference between 'good - light', 'evil - dark'. Any fanfics where there's none but all shades of gray?

'Title'


** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom). This fic does a good job exploring the grey in between good and evil. It switches up sides and makes Dumbledore the antagonist while keeping him good and Voldemort on the right side (at least sometimes) while keeping him a bad person.

This one's pretty good, its still in first years and the story has reached the second year so there isn't that much conflict yet, but I think the story will start to hit those gray areas pretty soon. The story does make you wonder who is right and who is wrong right off the bat.

** If you're ready to delve into the mythical and magical adventures of a world not built to conform to or comfort the average muggle reader, perchance try linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy]]), although you've been warned, it's a jarring experience.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
