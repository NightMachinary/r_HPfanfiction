So I'm reading linkffn(12756051) which is a Game of Thrones fanfic where some people perform some magic to send their minds back in time so they can win the war, something that has been done fairly often in the HPverse (at least sending one or two people back anyway). But because so many people died fighting the White Walkers, the blood they shed powered the spell far beyond what they were expecting and instead of a handful of people, hundreds, if not thousands, of people were sent back in time with their memories intact up until they died.

It struck me that such a macguffin could easily be used in an HP fic where Voldemort is winning and can't be stopped. Something about the great "final battle" and all the dead on both sides super charges the spell and they all, good and bad guys, get sent back into time.


** It puts me in mind of this story linkffn(9993319). Maybe this isn't exactly what you're looking for, but it definitely involved large groups of people going through time.

A mysterious poster for a new club catches Severus' eye. Little does he know... What the club has planned will challenge everything he knows and change the course of his entire life.

  AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love. This story is now complete! Stay tuned for the sequel!

** This may fit what you're looking for, linkffn(6728900). Sadly it hasn't been updated in over 3 years but I thoroughly enjoyed the twist on the whole time travel trope in this fandom.

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

  With the war looking bleak, the Golden Trio, Ginny, Draco, and Lavender go back to Tom Riddle's 7th Year to destroy Lord Voldemort once and for all. What Hermione DIDN'T count on, however, is a shared common room, a curse, and a crazy little thing called love.
