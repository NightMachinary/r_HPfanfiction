I laughed hysterically at the word "Durzkaban" from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches]] and I have no idea why.

I don't think i'm entirely sane anymore.


** I was reading a slightly smutty fic and they used the phrase "her sopping slip-n-slide" and I nearly died. I just started laughing and had to close the fic because it was so painful but so hilarious. But so, so unfortunate at the same time.

** Durzkaban is so cliche, it's not even funny... I laughed at Voldewhore in Amalgum - Lockhart's Folly, but just because it was just that childish and stupid.

*** The mc in that story is a mix of incredibly childish, and Gary Stu, but if you mixed Lockheart and war-vet HP it becomes somewhat reasonable. It's a pretty good story. 7.5/10

** I like when Harry goes "That's not a threat, it's a promise." It's somewhere between cringy and painfully unoriginal and resonates with me like a bad pun.

** I have no idea why, but Harry saying:

#+begin_quote
  "There was an evil wizard named Volauvent, who --"
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4437151/20/Harry-s-New-Home][In Harry's New Home]] by kbinnz cracked me up the first time I read it. Normally nicknames are just annoying, but something about Harry earnestly insisting Lord Voldemort's name was Lord Volauvent....

** I laughed for ages when I read a fic that said that Draco and his buddies had "bumped uglies" with the Golden Trio in the corridor outside the infirmary. That does not mean what the author thought it meant....

**** In some ways it's even funnier if you assume the author did know - the protagonists and their chief bullies had a six-way orgy in public and everyone thought it was no big deal...

** My favourite is:

#+begin_quote
  Harry froze. Hagrid never called him Potter, and, come to think of it, when did Hagrid get red eyes? Suddenly, it all clicked. *"Hagrimort?*"
#+end_quote

from Harry Potter and teh Sparkly Hufflepuff.

Another one is:

#+begin_quote
  Melissa glanced between Harry and Ginny. "Is Ginny short for anything?" "Vaginny!" Harry answered immediately hoping his voice wouldn't crack. "*It's short for Vaginny*."
#+end_quote

I know it could be an old joke. But I had never heard it before.

** I always crack up when someone uses names like "The Shadow". Harry uses Darkness magic and he is known as the "Bloody Shadow", but really he is just Lord Commander of Azkaban... or some shit.

I laugh while moving my mouse to close the tab.
