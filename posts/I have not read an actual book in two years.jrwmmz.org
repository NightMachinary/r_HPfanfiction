I want to seep into my fandom forever, and just not be asked, "Oh what are you reading?" because I keep having to repeat the same books, and people know I'm a fast reader, so one day they'll just be like, "huh. They're super weird for reading something written by 16 year olds on some random website."

And I just kinda wanna blow up in their face because hey! At least I'm reading! At least I'm not a voyeur!

"Hey, that thing you were reading the other day says other-"

"Shutup voice in my head!"

"..."

"Am I telling myself to shutup? Is that a paradox? By me telling me to shutup, am I disobeying myself?"

"..."


** I try to read at least one "real" book per month but I still just keep coming back to FF. I feel like it's a pathological need for the familiarity of my favorite characters and settings but I mean, it's not preventing me from keeping my job or taking care of myself so it's not /that/ bad.

"Real" books I've read lately:

Rivers of London

Lovecraft Country

Storygrid

Dune

Stories of Your Life and Others

Leopold's Ghost (interestingly, this one is nonfiction and King Leopold was more evil and depraved than any depiction of Voldemort I've ever seen, and I've seen people trying to be edgy as shit)

For non-FF web fiction:

Mother of Learning

Worth the Candle

**** Im not sure how to warn you properly, I'm pretty desensitized to gore and evil and stuff but King Leopold's Ghost made me sick to my stomach. It's incredible how awful humans can be to each other and I have to hope he was the limit. If you don't like the feeling of wanting to cry and burn humanity to the ground you may want to skip that one. The others are all mostly pleasant.

Storygrid is a writing advice book, not a story.

The others I think anyone who likes HPFF will have a good chance of enjoying.

***** He wasn't. But I do think that he may have had a wider base of depravity than most of the other absolutely horrible people in history.

*** Mother of Learning? Nice!

Frankly, canon Voldemort was not all that impressive on the creepiness scale. In the words of the great Lady Archimedes, "Anyone who resorts to Unforgivable Curses doesn't have an ounce of creativity."

** I feel guilty for that.

I feel like I should quit my comfort zone that are fanfictions. Especially since I keep buying books that interest me, and I truly believe it is stiffing my own creativity and narrowing my own worldview to stay within the same universe. And thus it's a bad thing.

I really intend to read actual books I buy. But then, there a fanfiction update, a post who rec this one or another, and bam, it's been 3 months since I read a line from an actual book.

I think I should give me a time to read actual book, like from 10pm to 11pm, and then fanfictions as I pleased any other time.

** I haven't read an actual book since I discovered fanfiction 8 years ago (other than one or two when I was at school). Before that I would read a book at least every other day. I felt guilty for so long, but honestly I don't care anymore- at least I'm reading and enjoying it!

I tend to read longer novel length fics that are well written (often my authors or adults etc), but I do hope that I get back into actual books someday! The hp world is so comforting and familiar though, and I don't need another thing to beat myself up about- so I'm just going with it for now and not being too harsh on myself

** Personally, I like fanfics better than ‚Äúreal‚Äù books, because 1. I don't feel as bad when I glaze over paragraph upon paragraph, or zone out for like ten minutes but keep reading forward, and 2. I feel like I'm more okay with things not going how I'd imagined them in a non-canon setting. Like, endings that I would have previously thought unsatisfactory suddenly become better in a non-canon story. The Supernatural finale is a prime example of this; I hate that the Supernatural finale is canon, but if it were... say, a HP fanfic, I would be like, ‚Äúthat's some good shit right there.‚Äù And I'd read it once a month.

I feel like this says more about me than fanfics as a medium, so I'm just gonna shut up now, and hope that someone knows what the hell I'm saying because I sure as shit don't!

** Get yourself a subscription to kindle unlimited and read some of those. Most of them are basically original fanfiction, and the writing quality often tells. And as you're paying a subscription you can try a book and not feel jipped if it's too bad to read.
