:END:
Hello, I hope you can help me find a fanfiction. I do not remember it very well, but I believe that Cedric lives, although it becomes invalid or over time it will lose its ability to walk. Thank you!


** Linkffn(finding himself)

Instead of dying, Cedric gets hit by a curse from Lucius Malfoy and loses use of his legs. He starts seeing Hermione while technically still dating Cho, and becomes Head Boy which puts him on the front lines against Umbridge.

  The-Boy-Who-Almost-Died has to figure out what it means that he didn't. Harry's tumultuous 5th year at Hogwarts is Cedric's 7th and final. Bound together by shared trauma, both boys fall under Ministry suspicion ... Who is Cedric Diggory? Cedric!Lives AU
