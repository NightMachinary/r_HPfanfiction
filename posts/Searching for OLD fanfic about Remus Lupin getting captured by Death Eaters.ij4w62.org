:END:
I'm looking for a really old -like early 2000s pre- Order of the Phoenix book- fanfic about Lupin being kidnapped after a full moon and being locked in Lucius Malfoy's dungeon and being tortured for a while. I think it was a pretty long fic; there was no sex in it as far as I remember. Mostly focused on Lupin in captivity but it switched a couple times to his buddies trying to find him.

I hope this fic isn't lost in ancient internet space!
