** A mudblood in Slytherin in the middle of Voldemort's first war. Oh my....

Obviously Snape would have to be like super protective of her, the two would have to constantly fight off bullies and later junior death eaters. It's likely that they would be much closer and Snape would likely have antagonized all the junior death eaters right from the start.

As for how the Marauders will react, either they'll go with "All Slytherins are evil" and target both Snape and Lily, antagonizing both, ruining James's chances with her and causing the two to be alone against enemies from both sides (--> close relationship), or if the Marauders recognize Snape and Lily's status as outsiders in Slytherin they might team up to prank the others who bully Lily. In that case Snape might very well become one of the six Marauders. Wormtail, Moony, Padfoot, Prongs, Prince and Flowers.

Obviously either way, Snape wouldn't join Voldemort. I doubt he'd make many friends in Slytherin. He'd either be recruited by Dumbledore with the other Marauders, as a potions supplier for the Order with Lily or if the two don't make any allies they might try to stay hidden and wait out the war while selling complicated potions over mail order.

In either case, the situation would be different enough that Harry wouldn't be born, or at least not in the same circumstances as canon. So, how the war ends is pretty difficult to answer.

** Admiting Lily survive her scolarity as a mudblood Slytherin in the middle of Voldemort rise, several things would change :

- Sirius told Harry that James was interested in Lily the moment he saw her, even if he dealed with it like a kid (pulling her hairs and generaly acting as an idiot in her vinicity). But would he infatuation survived her sorting?
- Even if it did survive the sorting, her sorting would make their romance way harder. By being in Slytherin, Lily would have "suffered" more of their pranks/ aggressions, and may be less inclined to give him a chance. Not to mention her whole "House Politic" (between the persons angry at her for "trying to sully a pure line", "choosing a Blood Traitor" and "betraying her house", I doubt she would have a lot of support in her house, if any considering, once again, Voldemort rise).
- How would Snape react? Probably happy at first, but then he would see how hard Lily has it. Would he feel bad for her? Support her even if as a poor half-blood he has it almost as bad? Distance himself from her or stick as a couple of parias?
- "Snape worst memory" would never happen, not only because James would act differently with her in Slytherin. But also because Lily would either don't care anymore about the name calling, or have already cut ties with Snape way before it.
- Also, Snape loves Dark Art, but seem to prefer Lily to it. So if they don't break their friendship. He would either not join the Death Eater or join it with Lily (as a incredibly talented Mudblood, she may get in the same way Snape got it, even if I don't see why she would choose it except by desperation).

â€‹

In general a lot of things would change and Harry would probably not exist. But canon Lily is not really Slytherin material (at least according to the "baised" sources who talked about her), so her character would be changed so much it may as well be an OC.

*** Now I want to see a fic where Lily is sorted Slytherin, and she ends up being more vicious and vindictive than Snape, not shying away from Dark Arts. I.e., "I don't enjoy it, Sev, but you know how it is: with your Potions skills and your blood, you can make nice with them any time. I don't have that option."

*** Lily would indeed never join Slytherin on her own. But her only magical friend wanted her there, so it's entirely possible that she'd override the primary choice, just like Harry did in canon.

**** Harry never did that, he had a choice in some way, but the hat talked about al the houses equally as an option, only after Harry made clear that he doesn't want to go to Slytherin did he start to talk more about it, but it sounded more in a tanting way to test Harry's reaction than anything else

*** He'd almost certainly not become an Order member (the Marauders have little reason to change their canon stance, and Albus' bias against him would remain unchanged), but yes, I do believe that him joining the Death Eaters in such a situation boils down to whether or not Lily is willing to remain close with him this time around.

** There is a fic with this premise. linkffn(13167427).

The interactions between James and Lily feel rushed to me - I feel that the author should have taken more time in the story to develop their relationship from where it begins to where it ends. The bad plot element of rape was used, albeit it is a fairly minor element.

Other parts of the fic feel somewhat strange, like how quickly Lily falls into the groove that she's in for the majority of her years at school, and how quickly she falls out of that groove. It seems artificial, given that the writer hasn't really changed Lily's personality from her canon one.

** I read a oneshot like this where a Sorting Hat from 1998 gets a redo and changes the 1971 sorting to encourage House Unity, splitting up the Marauders and sorting James, Severus, Lily into Slytherin. It backfires -- the Marauders never form, Lily and Severus starts out ostracized for their impure blood or being a Slytherin. Eventually, the DE recruitment recognizes Severus' skills as a Potions prodigy. James dies a spy, the Snapes duo become the most feared of Voldemorts' Death Eaters (he makes an exception to Lily's blood status to appease Severus and to use her skills), Peter still becomes a spy and the Dark Lord is winning.

Either way, I think a Slytherin Lily would ultimately end in one of 2 things: both her and Severus becoming married Death Eaters (or a Lily in a similar position as Narcissa), or both leaving Wizarding Britain alltogether. They would both be ostracized during Hogwarts for their blood status (Slytherins) or for being a Slytherin (by everyone else). Eventually, it's possible that their skills, especially Severus, would attract DE attention. In the end, they both join from pressure, or they say fuck off to the society who ostracized them both since they joined.

*** Not all slytherins turned Death Eaters. There seem to have been pressure from blood purists in this house, probably some bullying too, but that's all.

Slytherins weren't exactly ostracized either in canon. Altough some of the other students don't like or trust them. Some of the professors came from Slytherins.

An interresting take would be Severus, Lilly and Sirius (rather than James) ending up in Slytherin. James and Sirius became friends in the Hogwarts express, it would be interesting to see how such a sorting affects things, considering James was at least loyal to his friends. Sirius and Severus might bound upon their less than stellar childhoods. Lilly was already brilliant in Canon, she'd have to become ruthless too.

There's potential there I think.

**** A Sirius in Slytherin would probably not keep James' close friendship -- they literally just met each other on the Express (and thus aren't really friends yet, even if the seeds are there), and James seemed to become a bit wary of Sirius once he mentioned that his entire family had been Sorted there. Not saying they'd become enemies, but they'd never become the friends they became in canon.

However, it is likely that a Sirius in Slytherin alongside Lily and Severus would end up a trio of friends once it became obvious that Severus held no ill will towards Muggleborns (by virtue of being close friends with one) and Lily being Muggleborn herself. His more malicious tendencies would probably end up being targeted towards Slytherin blood purists instead.

  It's 1998, and Tom Marvolo Riddle has apparently won, so the Sorting Hat decides to travel back in time and *try* to do something about that. Alternate Universe results. Manipulative! Sorting Hat. One-off piece. Humour/Tragedy, rated 'M' for occasional swear-words or strong language. (Punctuation corrections, 9th March, 2014)
