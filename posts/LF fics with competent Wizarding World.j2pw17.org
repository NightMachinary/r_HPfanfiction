I am looking for a fanfic where the Ministry Of Magic, wizards, witches and the whole magical world in general is not this stupid and incompetent society but instead a fairly competent and logical world.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]] get my top picks for this theme. In the first fic, the Ministry is fairly competent and effective. In the second one, Dumbledore, Lucius Malfoy, and Voldemort are all scary in their own ways, and so do their minions.

** Ya know, I think this would be pretty hard to do while maintaining any resemblance at all to the HP world. It would also self-destruct pretty fast once the wizards became powerful enough.

Such a society actually existed for a while in the HP universe, at least in the HPMOR incarnation. It was in Atlantis, and it ended up getting itself erased from time. HPMOR actually had mostly weaker magic than Rowling's HP, attributed to interventions by Merlin after the fall of Atlantis, and again to keep the story from falling apart.

*** You're saying a competent government would destroy itself because wizards become too powerful? You realise politics and money were the reason the Ministry was so corrupted and inefficient, right? Magic had nothing to do with that.

**** No I mean competent wizards would become powerful enough that a competent ministry wouldn't help. Imagine dark wizards being able to transfigure nuclear bombs by magic.

***** You realise that if wizardkind advances, not only the bad guys will become more powerful. The good guys will also get more powerful, it goes both ways. Also, nuclear weapons are a no bother since they are not magical.

******** Give it a break. First you transfigure the nuke and then you enchant it, just like you would a sword. Come to think of it, what happens if you hack at a wizard with an unenchanted sword, or just clonk them with a shovel? This stuff has all been done over many times.
