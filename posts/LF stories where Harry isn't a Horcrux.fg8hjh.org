Maybe it was written before the reveal, or maybe it's just an AU story and they explain how Harry survived the killing curse in a different way.

Can be on ANY site, am fine with het/slash/femslash, and anyone can be the main character.

NO Lord Potter or Harem Harry stories.

Would rather not have character bashing if possible. Characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but an author going out of their way to bash on a character is normally a no go. If it's a more minor part of the story, I suppose that's okay, but would rather have no bashing at all.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** There are many decent ways how to get rid of that Horcrux (decent, i.e., not goblins' magic solves all your problems), which are still in-canon (of course, the story goes AU after that):

1. Somebody finally notices, that Bill Weasley is an experienced cursebreaker, and perhaps he has something to say about Horcruxes. And he has. Or perhaps the Department of Mysteries gets finally involved.

2. Horcrux is eliminated somehow without anybody even noticing it (e.g., linkffn(13106883), where Harry decides that he is unloved by his aunt Petunia, because he is a boy, and by accidental magic turns himself into fem!Harry; the Horcrux doesn't make the transformation and uses his evilness by killing Uncle Vernon). I like this option very much.

3. also a bit overused option: Harry gets killed somehow (e.g., in the traffic accident) and then we have the after-life scene long before the Battle of Hogwarts.

  in a burst of accidental magic, Harry uses legilimensy to see pictures of his mother, and wish magic turns him into a little girl who looks like Lily. Vernon dies, and Petunia looks for somewhere to move. In Crawley they meet a little girl who also has accidental magic and with Petunia's knowledge and Dan Granger's cunning, plots are made. Fem! Harry, an experiment for me.
