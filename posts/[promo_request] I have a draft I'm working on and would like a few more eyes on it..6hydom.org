** Generally, the "Hermione goes back in time and falls in love with Tom Riddle" storyline has been done so many times, it would be far more original if Hermione went back in time and /didn't fall in love with anyone/. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but what's your unique twist?

- There's a possible continuity issue, in that Hermione was severely injured at the Ministry. She shouldn't be up and about a few hours later, unless the point of divergence occurred before that, in which case it would be good to document that.

- The portrait at McGonagall's office felt weak: it's a Gryffindor portrait, after all. Make Hermione /work/ to get in. If there's a password, make her guess it (perhaps based on the previous passwords she'd gotten when she had a legitimate reason to be there). Or, if she's as desperate as she is supposed to be, make her actually burn the portrait, perhaps with some obscure spell that the portrait would actually fear.

- The scene of her digging through papers before using the Summoning Charm made me smile.

- Keep in mind that 1943 is the year Tom Riddle had let the Basilisk out, so a number of students may have been petrified, and it's about a week before Myrtle is murdered. In light of that, and in light of Hermione knowing what's really going on, Tom Riddle should go to Azkaban for a long, long time.

- Hermione has no reason to withhold information from Dumbledore, and a Dumbledore armed with foreknowledge this far in advance would short-circuit the whole story, as in linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them by White Squirrel).

- The Headmaster of Hogwarts is not Albus Dumbledore but Armando Dippet, so it would be up to Dippet to set Hermione up with a new identity, etc..

- I don't know how much you care about canon vs. fanon, but there is no capital-L "Light" in canon. There are people who want to abuse Muggles, oppress Muggleborn, and practice Dark Arts on innocents, and there are those, like Dumbledore, Bones, and Scrimegour, who oppose them, but they don't think of themselves as all being "Light".

- World War II is in full swing, and Grindelwald is marching across Europe. Dumbledore's epic duel with him is yet to come.

- I don't recall off the top of my head what Hermione knew about Tom's character at that point, but she would probably have an idea that he was always a highly manipulative psychopath.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

** Tomione?? I'm on it! :D :D

Edit: here's my thoughts on it:

- Found in 5th paragraph: "I don't think you're quit that Gryffindor,"do you mean " I don't think you are quite that Gryffindor? " I think it still needs to be clarified.

- I think bombarda is a very destructive spell. Don't you think it would just destroy the box and its contents?

- I imagine you are going to change "A great deal of plot exposition and info dump later" to something a little more specific?

- " if only because how could being fifty years before anyone she loved was around be any example of the power of love was beyond the power of her imagination." it's a bit confusing. Maybe something like " if only because how could being fifty years in the past, before anyone she loved was alive, be any example of the power of love? It was beyond the reach of her imagination."

- It's a bit too early to give opinions on plot or characterization. My only advice here is to be very careful of Hermione's and Tom's characterization, any deviation from canon should be well justified by something that happened in your story (or mentioned at least) or they will be OOC. (It happens a lot in tomione)

Good luck!

  write this pairing as more of a partnership between intellectuals
#+end_quote

Oh I like the sound of that! And of course! I've already bookmarked your story, can't wait to read more of it.

If you need more help feel free to pm me. Good luck!

** I would personally start a new paragraph after each line of dialogue. It makes things a bit cleaner and clearer.

The period should go inside the parentheses in “Stupify”. towards the end, and I believe it's spelled Stupefy!

The third to last paragraph is a bit confusing - perhaps go into some dialogue and show this bit instead of simply telling it: "A great deal of plot exposition and info dump later, Hermione was settling into a room the professor had set aside for her, having received her appearance in the current time with remarkable aplomb and joviality. Apparently, her adamant refusal to explain any context except for the fact that the Timeturner had been her last hope to scrape a thimbleful of good out of a terrible situation driven by her love for a friend had been all it had taken to put her firmly on this much younger Albus Dumbledore's goodside."

It's a very interesting premise! I hope this helps :)

**** For example: “Very well, I don't think you're quit that Gryffindor, but I'd hate to find out that I'm wrong,” the portrait said, and resignedly opened the way for Hermione to enter. As she stepped into the office, she found herself surrounded by an office that seemed all a-clutter. She supposed it would be an effective way of keeping Umbridge's eyes off of things that Professor McGonagall would rather she not notice, but unfortunately Hermione was certain that her Timeturner would be one of the things that was hidden among the mess of things before her. I would just begin a new paragraph for "As she stepped..." Little things like that.

Oh ok, that makes sense lol!

You're welcome! :)

**** I reread it, and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it! Since you fixed most of the mistakes, here's just a few things I noticed:

#+begin_quote
  As she came upon the portrait guarding the entrance to Professor McGonagall's office, Hermione only narrowly avoided running face first into the canvas in front of her, slamming both palms into the wall as she caught her breath.
#+end_quote

(I would suggest changing the structure, wording, or length of the sentence. Maybe by putting;

#+begin_quote
  Hermione only narrowly avoided running face first into the canvas in front of her as she came upon the portrait guarding the entrance to Professor McGonagall's office, slamming both palms into the wall while she caught her breath.
#+end_quote

Now it's clear that all three of these things are happening at once. I also changed the "as" after wall to "while")

#+begin_quote
  After taking one of the options she had stolen from the hospital wing
#+end_quote

(I think you meant to write "potions", maybe an auto-correct?)

#+begin_quote
  "Not only are you no Gryffindor, you're a villain besides,"
#+end_quote

(The way you write in besides seems a little off-- I think I understand how you wanted the besides to seem, sort of like an "additionally" or "as well" but it just comes across strangely because besides isn't really the right word for that. If you don't want to take it out completely, try something like;

#+begin_quote
  "Not only are you no Gryffindor, you're a villain to boot,"

  "Not only are you no Gryffindor, you're a villain as well,"
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  "More than being no Gryffindor, you're also villain,"
#+end_quote

These all sound ok being tacked onto the end of a sentence.)

#+begin_quote
  As she began digging through different boxes and drawers that littered the room, Hermione began to plan.
#+end_quote

(another one of those repetitive words :P, just replace one of the "began"s with a different word like "started" or "commenced". An online thesaurus is a good place to look for similar words if you don't like any that come to mind.)

There's a couple more lurking around in the story, but grammar/spelling is something that's easily fixable. Overall, I really, really liked it! The mistakes that I pointed out, and the ones that I didn't are things that I noticed afterwards, when reading through it a second time. The first time, I read it and just enjoyed it. There wasn't anything that jarred me from the flow of the story. Since I've now pointed out things wrong with the story twice, I figured I'd go ahead and point out a few things that I really /liked/:

- You writing in Hermione's injury, her thieving of potions, and her emotional distraught made me happy. For me, personally, I'm the kind of gal who likes the really nitty-gritty Tomiones.

- I think Hermione not telling Dumbledore anything is feasible; Hermione was told the dangers of altering time, and the fact that she's aware who Eloise is means she knows the potential affects of altering time, and would most likely strive to prevent it.

- I also really enjoyed the little detail about the Time Turner probably being broken due to the /Bombarda/. I'm a stickler for small things that tie the story together, and that one made me inexplicably happy.

- I'm pleased with the fact Dumbledore and Hermione are making no efforts to return Hermione to her timeline. In this case, informing the Unspeakables /would/ be dangerous, since Hermione wasn't accidently shipped to another time. Not only that, but telling the authorities could lead to Hermione being cut open and examined due to the unusual nature of her being sent into another century.

- HAHA HERMIONE NICE ONE. KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN. YEAH OK.
