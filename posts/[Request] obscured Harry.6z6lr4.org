Well... Since reading the many deaths of harry potter, I'm interested in super paranoid harry. I'm seeking something like harry trying to disguise/hide himself so much, super paranoid about everything around him. Plus point if he hid himself with spell that generated darkness (maybe closest association would be dementor, or final fantasy's black mage), though this is not necessary.

So, any recommendation for paranoid harry?


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia) by arekay not as edgy as you wanted it but is pretty fun.

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.
