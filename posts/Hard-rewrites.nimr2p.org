What do you guys think of hard rewrites? As well as adding OCs to it?

Im doing this and I added OCs who are Grindelwald's descendants. My story concept is that they're going to finish what their grandfather started, but the actually succeed in conquering the muggle world, all due to a simple machination of magic.

Hbu, what are your guys' opinion on hard rewrites, fics the completely go off from the original story. But keep it's continuity somewhat with the addition of the fic writer adding their own lore.


** I don't personally mind them but if the only resemblance to the original story are names, I can't help but wonder why the author is not writing their original story? If it's really good they could get financially compensated for it and could even start their own franchise. And there are some like that that are really good and if they decided to re-write it as an original story all they'd need would be an editor and they could produce some really beautiful original series.

*** True true. Mine is near an original story, but I choose not to write it one cause I already have an original story I've been working on for years now.

Course that doesn't mean I'll set up a Patreon later on if I really do get a lot of readers for my fic. I might if my chapters decide to be longer than 10k words and decide to release once a month which would allow me to make some money and write about two chapters a month at around 10-20k words each. That is if I ever decide I want to try and do that. I might in the summer really, it'd help improve my writing, give me deadlines and schedules, as well as a small side-hustle income.

Though this would only be realistic if I really wanted to constantly write 10k+ worded chapters, I do don't get me wrong, but I literally have 3 part-time jobs and community college, so it'll have to wait till summer. Which sucks cause I love writing and telling stories.

**** Other people might disagree so don't take my word for it but I would suggest avoiding 10k+ chapters as they can be quite tedious to read. I personally prefer reading max 4-5k word chapters that focus on one particular event that's relevant to the plot and better read more of those than one that has so many events in it that it reads like a story on its own. However I would also suggest going the other way and writing a ton of chapters over the same event to the point that it drags on forever.

Edit: I think that PS is the perfect example of this

Chapter 1 - we're introduced to the story

Chapter 2 - we learn of Harry's shitty life with the Dursleys

Chapter 3 - we learn that someone really wants to get in touch with Harry and the Dursleys try to prevent it

Chapter 4 - we learn of Harry's magical origins

Chapter 5 - we get a glimpse of the magical world outside of Hogwarts and we're introduced to the main institutions of the world

Chapter 6 - Harry meets his future allies and enemies

Chapter 7 - we're introduced to Hogwarts

Chapter 8 - we see the typical life as a new student at Hogwarts

Chapter 9 - we learn the secret of the forbidden corridor

Chapter 10 - Harry becomes friends with Hermione, while discovering that someone is up to something

Chapter 11 - we're introduced to Quidditch and learn that someone wants to kill Harry

Chapter 12 - we get introduced to Dumbledore

Chapter 13 - Harry finds out about the Philosopher's Stone

Chapter 14 - the events for the final showdown get set in motion

Chapter 15 - we're introduced to the Forbidden Forest

Chapter 16 - the trio goes through the gauntlet protecting the stone... personally I think that the confrontation with Quirrell should have also been in this chapter but I think JK wanted to end it on a cliffhanger

Chapter 17 - we're introduced to Voldemort and conclusion

***** I mean, my story is a slow burn, so eh. That and I skipped first year, got halfway through it but only did it to introduce characters. I didn't want so contrivided plot like the Philosopher Stone and such, as that made no sense to me.

As for series bloat, I can see where you're coming from. I try to ideally go for 5-7k worded chapters but as the story progresses I'm pretty sure it'll be more.

For plot I have the ending in mind but I'm doing a George R R Martin style chaptering, creating interwoven storylines as well as perspectives. I like to give my audience multiple angles, especially when I get later into my story, I'll be jumping place to place at times.

** It's not a hard rewrite, but I'm working on a series of works where the difference is Ginny participating much more actively than she does in the books.

As for OCs, I've fleshed out the other members of Cho Chang's friend group as I've made Marietta Edgecombe into a major character.

I'm still very far away from it being finished, so we'll see how this all turns out. (Admittedly, it does fall into the same features one other commenter said.)

** I don't mind rewrites. Ocs can be good..if they don't overshadow the people the story is supposed to be able. Having a purpose to the rewrite is a big draw for Me.

*** Yeah, same. I have a pet peeves when people write OCs but don't add anything new to the actual plot.

Same Harry vs Voldemort ending, good triumphs evil, etc.

** I probably wouldn't read it... Personally I try to find stories where Harry avoids Hogwarts all together. After reading >1k different fanfics it all somehow blends to one big blob of : we're on point X of canon, will Harry(ette?) do in Hogwarts today? A) do the canon stuff B) do the complete opposite just because C) do the remarkably well adjusted and we'll reasoned thing for a teenager that has been under an unreasonable amount of stress for an unreasonably long time, D) do something different that doesn't have major consequences for the plot otherwise E) do actually something unique that will actually surprise me, once every 50 fics I read?

I might be a bit cynical though.
