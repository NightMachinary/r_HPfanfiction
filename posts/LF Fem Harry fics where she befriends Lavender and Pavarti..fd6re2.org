I am tired of reading fem Harry fics in which she ends up befriending Hermione. Canon Hermione had no female friends ( even Crookshanks was male) until year five in the D.A and even then, her friendship or acquaintance with other girls ( Ginny, Luna and Tonks) is not as significant as her friendship with Harry and Ron ( which only happened due to the Troll).


** In linkffn(13197260), they are at least cooperating, similar in linkffn(13132217). However, the most beautiful school Lavender is IMHO in linkao3(567400;568303), who is friendly with male!Harry, but even more bizarre relationship is her being friendly with Luna. And the rest of the stories is great as well.

  Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations.

  Some may consider him useless, but Ludo Bagman has been absolutely inspired by muggle sports channels. As a result, a camera charm has been created. It is ready to catch all the action of the Triwizard Tournament and broadcast it into every home over Wizarding Europe. Now Harriet is on the big screen, and the crowd is going to see a lot more than they bargained for. FEM/Harry.

  When Harry learns something that could prove he didn't enter himself into the Triwizard Tournament, he decides to take it once step further and prank everyone in retaliation. However, his prank may have some unforeseen side effects. COMPLETE! Edited as of 11/13/19!

  Harry always knew that there was something unique about him. In a way, the arrival of the Hogwarts acceptance letters was almost expected... except, why are they all addressed to 'Harriet Potter?
