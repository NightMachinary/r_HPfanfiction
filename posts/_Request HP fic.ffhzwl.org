Any fics out there where the Deathly Hollows are basically courtship/engagement/marriage gifts from Loki to suitors of his daughter Hel(could be from Hel herself)? As in the wand could be the courtship gift, stone for engagement and cloak the marriage gift, in that order for obvious reasons. As I see it there is no obvious timeframe for the item's appearance into the world, so it could've happened at the height of the Viking age where Norse influence is most prevalent in the British isles. If anyone knows of some fics based on this premise let me know, please. If there aren't any, maybe some kind soul with talent in writing and some spare time could write something like this.

Cheers!
