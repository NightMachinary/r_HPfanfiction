Was wondering if there are stories out there about, or which include, characters getting therapy? Have been reading fics again recently and it struck me how many of these characters need it...

The therapist has an obvious conflict of interest, but the fic is still good.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day.

** - linkffn(Daphne Greengrass and the 6th Year From Hell by WhiskeyTangoFoxtrot;Daphne Greengrass and the 6th Year From Hell by WhiskeyTangoFoxtrot) has Ron dealing a lot with his wounds and some related [NO SPOILERS!] after the Deaprtment of Mysteries battle, and there is a Mind Healer there. BTW, great story even otherwise (unfortunately, the second part is not finished).

- linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50) is all about Ginny dealing with her post-war PTSD and other related stuff, so yes, there is a mind healer as well.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)
