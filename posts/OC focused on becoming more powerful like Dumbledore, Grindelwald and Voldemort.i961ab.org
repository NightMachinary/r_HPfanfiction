Are there any fanfictions out there with an OC mostly focused on becoming more powerful? I'd like it best if it starts with the OC in Hogwarts (the era doesn't matter, but please no time-travel!). The character shouldn't be really evil, no killing innocents and torturing for fun and so, but killing evil people and diving into the dark arts is good. What I'd like best is a fanfiction where the reader can follow the character growing and slowly reaching a level that's not so far under Dumbledore or Voldemort. A search for immortality could be a nice bonus, if done good (I have nothing against the character making a/several Horcrux, just the character shouldn't really be evil.) The character could be a bit (or very) like Dumbledore in his youth, also searching for power.

Thanks for any responses!


** Not an OC in the traditional sense, but the Albus Potter series from NoahPhantom has an Albus Potter that's obsessed with learning all sorts of magic and, by the end, he is comparable in power with the three above. The thing about him is that he doesn't really use any shortcuts to become overpowered. He is just naturally curious and a pretty good student (not even the third best in his class though).

*** Worth mentioning that pretty much everyone in that series is equal to or greater in power to Dumbledore/Grindelwald/Voldemort because of the rapid technological advances during/after the Dark Revival. IIRC Harry struggles to catch up to the new technology and it's made clear Adelina, for example is much more powerful than him.

(massive spoiler for the end of the series. Seriously, don't click if you haven't read it!)

Also, depending on how you read the ending, Albus's unusual power comes from Cordot casting the Magimorph Devoctrix on him in the first chapter, which is about as close to a shortcut as you can get! Also, while he could easily take out Voldemort or Grindelwald by the end, he's nowhere on the level of Shawna Wilcox, Adelina, Gallen Ingot, Desulgon, etc.

I'd agree Albus is the most curious of his classmates, but Aidan and Alec and Lucas are definitely more competent in different aspects of magic. There's no exceptionalism in this fic except in society at large; that is, you don't get the same feeling as super-Harry flexing on regressive Wizarding Britain.

It's really fucking good though. Loved the series.

** linkffn(Alexander Dantes)

Very much in the vein of what you're looking for. I found the second and final book in the series weaker, but it's a fun read.

*** I am sorry to say this but OC in this story is absolutely useless. He does nothing at all, that means he doesn't even interact one bit with harry throughout the series. I know its cannon complaint but this story is ridiculous

**** I implied that it was an extreme guilty pleasure.

OP wanted an OC protagonist, didn't say it had anything to do with Harry. This was a fic that came very close to their criteria.

FWIW, I agree that the handling of a meritocracy in the second book is treated exceptionally badly.

** The Ghost of Privet Drive is something like that and a lot of fun to read!
