** Do you mean in a romantic/sexual sense? I've seen a lot of fics pair Hogwarts with Harry, but all of those times Hogwarts has had a female manifestation, and never portrayed as inanimate. I'm not sure that's what you're looking for though.

*** This redditor also posted a thread several hours before this one asking for Harry/Hogwarts suggestions. I'm guessing with limited responses on that one they have broadened their horizons....

** Well, there are a lot of stories where Harry uses his wand a lot.

Although I presume you do not mean a wizard-wand pair-up in your request.
