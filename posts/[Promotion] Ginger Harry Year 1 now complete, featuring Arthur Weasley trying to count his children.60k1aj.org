***** This does feature in linkffn(Knowledge is Power by robst). They replace Tom Riddle Senior's bones with a transfigured dead squirrel. The resurrection ritual thing then causes Voldemort to come back looking like a six foot tall squirrel.

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.
