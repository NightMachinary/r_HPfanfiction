Been ages since I read this and now I can't find it, hoping someone here might be able to find it for me.

It's either on A03 or FFN, I think FFN but not certain, where Harry leaves at some point after the war and comes back years later with a little girl that he has adopted. It's not The Package by pottermum - won't explain all the difference due to spoilers and such but it's fairly similar in concept.

I know that's not a lot to go on, hoping someone can help me out here.


** Maybe linkffn(The Augurey by La-Matrona)?

Hermione helps. Harry kidnaps a neglected Delphini Riddle and magically adopts her.

** Realignment is decent, but I always wished there was just a good Tom centric story covering his school years. I'll definitely write one, just not yet. Probably early next year but we'll see.
