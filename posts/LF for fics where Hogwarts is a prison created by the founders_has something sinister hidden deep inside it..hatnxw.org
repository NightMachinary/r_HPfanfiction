I remember reading a fic where they accidentally discover another building below Hogwarts, and it turns out that Hogwarts is actually a sinister entity.

Also fics where the founders created Hogwarts as a prison to contain something ancient and powerful, and the magic of students coming in every year is what's maintaining the prison. Perhaps when the school was shut down due to the basilisk attacks, some of these protections weakened, allowing whatever was trapped to attempt escape.


** linkffn(12729257) I'm not sure this isn't one of the fics you mentioned. It's a short read anyway.

#+begin_quote
  Every student knows that Hogwarts has a mind of its own. They probably wouldn't sleep at night if they knew what the castle really wants... When a number of students disappear without a trace, Minerva realises how little she knows about what goes on at Hogwarts. Sentient!Hogwarts

** The merging sort of touches on this where Merlin who is a psychopath basically bound the spirit of a girl to the core of hogwarts

*** Oh I read a similar sort of thing where some sort of powerful being had to be connected to the castle so that it fed off of the magic of this individual. In this fic i read Harry eventually bound himself to Hogwarts and became the successor to the little child.
