This question came to my mind while I was relaxing around the house. For my ten spells I would choose:

1.  Reparo

2.  Accio

3.  Scourgify

4.  Evanesco

5.  Geminio

6.  Stupefy

7.  Reenervate

8.  Lumos

9.  Aquamenti

10. Arresto Momentum


** Assuming broad categories like 'transfiguration' don't count. And apparition doesn't use a wand.

Utility spells:

- Reductor Curse (destroy objects, obstructions, evidence and enemies)

- Summoning Charm (convenient, but can also work like 'point me' to find things you've lost or don't know)

Self-defense spells:

- Disillusionment (sadly, options for disguise and evasion are very limited)

- Stupefy (non-lethal alternative to Reducto)

'Break the laws of the universe' spells:

- Duplication Charm (this is MVP. Makes you rich, makes backups and copies of priceless objects)

- Flying Enchantment (Like the one on broomsticks or the Ford Anglia. Options for mobility are limited, but at least this one lets you fly.)

Mind magic:

- Legilimency (Mind-reading is always the best superpower. Legilimency does memories as well.)

- Imperius Curse (Immoral, but too useful not to include. Supersedes Alohomora and even doubles as an offensive spell.)

- Memory Charm (Ditto)

- False Memory Charm (Technically separate from the Memory charm, unfortunately, but its synergy with the other three spells means you have to include it. Can double as a clunky Confundus.)

...and now I'm on a list.

  Hatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before; he flung himself out

  from behind the fountain and bellowed, `Crucio!ʹ

  Bellatrix screamed: the spell had knocked her off her feet, but she did not writhe

  and shriek with pain as Neville had ‐ she was already back on her feet,

  breathless, no longer laughing. Harry dodged behind the golden fountain again.

  Her counter‐spell hit the head of the handsome wizard, which was blown off and

  landed twenty feet away, gouging long scratches into the wooden floor.
#+end_quote

this is the second time.

#+begin_quote
  "Cruc -" yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead

  illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Snape blocked the spell again. Harry

  could see him sneering.
#+end_quote

and this is the third and most successful time.

#+begin_quote
  Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, “You shouldn't have done that.” As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, “Crucio!” The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor. “I see what Bellatrix meant,” said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, “you need to really mean it.”

Accio is just useful

Reducto so i can break into places while disillusioned so that's two spells gone

We don't need rennervate because the stupefy will wear off at some point and we probably didn't stupefy them for no reason

Episkey just heals stuff pretty well

Geminio like omg just get an expensive diamond and then just copy it a few times and BOOM you're rich

Silencio so I can silence my steps and scare people

Just obliviate everyone after you've used magic on them
