** This may not be what you're looking for but Kill Your Darlings by LavenderBlue is about Ted Tonks and Andromeda Black. It's one of my favorites! [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=328229]]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2429621/1/I-ll-Take-it-Shaken-Not-Stirred][I'll Take It Shaken Not Stirred]] linkffn(2429621) Same author as The Life and Times, so it has that writing style. No Marlene McKinnon although it is kind of centered around Lily.
