The basic premise was thus; Hermione and Ron didn't work out and bored and lonely, Hermione, now working at the ministry proposes a friends with benefits relationship with Snape.

Hermione is totally blind to the fact that they are falling in love. I believe it ends with them waving their children off as they board the Hogwarts express and she worries that Severus will leave her because she's old and the kids can take care of themselves.
