Hi, I am looking for any james potter and lily evans in their 7th year that is canon. I am not a fan of The Life and Times and commentarius as I don't like the writing style etc. I have read The Untold Story by Hothoney111 and The Beginning of The End by Mei1105 a million times. Also i don't like sirius and remus pairing. I know I am picky! Thanks.
