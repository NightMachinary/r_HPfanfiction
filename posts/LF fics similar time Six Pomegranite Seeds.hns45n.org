I finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12132374/1/Six-Pomegranate-Seeds][Six Pomegranite Seeds]] by Seselt last night and absolutely loved it.

Diligent world building with realistic characters! Amazing writing! Time travel is optional.

Long fics welcome (60k minimum, over 100 if it's WIP). I've been in the fandom a while so I'd prefer something written post 2014-ish otherwise I've probably read it. Unless you think it's worthy of a re-read. Thank you I'm excited to read!

Edit: fixed the link

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*

** Just finished reading Six Pomegranate Seeds and the sequel. I don't think I've seen a Peggy Sue story before where the protagonist worked so hard to keep out of the way and keep the timeline on track, while still preparing to cut loose as soon as foreknowledge ran out. And having Hermione become the consummate Slytherin, doing and saying whatever it took to achieve what needed to be done, seemed somehow very appropriate. Quite a gripping read.

I was a little disappointed that Harry and Ron never found out about her reincarnation, and both the original and the sequel feel a bit like they cut out without fully finishing. They're well done, though. The author has a very impressive vocabulary and command of language, too.
