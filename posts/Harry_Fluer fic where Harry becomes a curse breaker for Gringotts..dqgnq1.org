:END:
There's a Harry/Fluer fic I can't remember the name of. As the title says, Harry becomes a curse breaker for Gringotts, and is put on a te with Charlie, Fluer, and a few others. Can anyone remember this?

Thanks in advance!


** Bungle in the Jungle, found in ffn? However Harry is not with Fleur, but becomes a powerful curse breaker along with Bill. Fleur is still pretty awesome in this fic though.

If it's not what you were looking I still highly recommend it! Despite the strange Ginny/hermione bashing early on (ignore it), it's my absolute number 1 HP fic. Has a sequel as well.

** Isn't it the one where he's going with Charlie on a curse breaker mission and daphne is with Fleur as her apprentice? Ends up as a hp/dg fic?

Edit: found the one I'm taking about but in searching for it I realize there are actually a number of popular cursebreaker fics, so I can't wait to see the responses!

*** If I recall correctly, having only read the fic once, this one is Harry x Daphne, Bill x Fleur. A good fic with a sequel in progress.
