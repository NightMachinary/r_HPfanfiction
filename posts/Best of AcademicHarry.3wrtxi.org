Any good fics where Harry pursues learning about magic for the sake of magic, ala Hermione? Not because of the cliche of needing to "train" for anything, but rather, just because it /interests/ him?

The more AU the better!


** I asked something similar recently when I asked for good Harry in Ravenclaw fics. I really want to read stories where harry, while having lots of power, doesn't have a clue how to use it and only learns to use it by studying and more generally is genuinely and deeply loves magic for it's own sake and not just to "WIN THE WAR RARGH". In fact, it might be fun to just remove that whole evil threat factor from the story all together and concentrate on the wonder of magic and friendship, mysteries and stuff.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

*** This looks interesting but I don't like the idea of Harry being blind, or having any special abilities or powers. I just want to read a normal kid interested in learning about magic, like Hermione or Dumbledore when he was a kid.

Thanks for the recommendation, though!

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** Have you seen linkffn(the arithmancer)? It's not harry, but if you're looking for "protagonist studies to untold heights of magical knowledge" then the arothmancer (and the sequel, lady Archimedes) are about as good as it gets.

Also, and I'm just reposting the list of unfinished fics that I posted in my request thread that you replied to, there are a whole batch of unfinished (but great!) fics in this mold, including linkffn(the ectomancer), linkffn(forging the sword), linkffn(forest of valbone).

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.
