I really liked Neville, he was my favourite male character, but he had sad life story (even worse than Harry, imho). So he deserves some happiness in fanfiction at least.

I wonder who he would be like, if his parents would raise him. He was pure-blood and not poor like Malfoy, but his family didn't serve Voldemort, also I doubt he could be such arrogant jerk. But he wouldn't be so shy and insecure as in books, I suppose.

I want to find well-written gen fanfiction where his parents didn'd gone insane and have an opportunity to raise him. It doesn't matter if he is Chosen one or not, the most important he is beloved son of sane parents.

Btw, Voldemort may be forgotten.
