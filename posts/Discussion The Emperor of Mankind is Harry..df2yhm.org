Basically, the shamans of old reincarnate as one Harold James Potter in 1980s Wizarding Britain. Harry's life is 100% the same, except for a dream he has during his seventh year. In it, Harry is surrounded by a thousand people, one of whom tells him 'You will be ready soon'. During the Malfoy Manor scene,(this is in the film-verse), Harry hears Hermione's screams, and the trauma cause his powers and past lives to reasert themselves. He gains the Emperor's full powers all at once, and also gains the Shaman's memories of the history of the universe.

​

What happens next? Specifically, what happens in the immediate aftermath, and any events afterwards?

*** I mean, yes, Voldie is immediately gone, the interesting stuff lies in how this creates an AU of the 40k-verse

** Hmmm.. Firstly, in order for this to happen, we either have to have the original EoAM (as he who would become him was created around 38000 BCE) be de-aged into HP or, for some reason, redone the mass-super-duper reincarnation thing into HP (for example, EoAM has unexpected accident/demon attack, pushes the emergency reincarnation button, ends up as baby Harry, or Lily is somehow a surprise super-duper psyker who somehow traps EoAM into Harry as part of her sacrificial ritual) .

The existence of the Magical community is the result of some unforeseen event - for example, random Eldar had... party-visits to earth, magicals are Psykers and wands act as some kind of Warp-buffer, wand-magic has a source other than the Warp, etc.

Some of these cases can give alternate ways for Harry to be the EoAM, and each choice changes some of the below bullets.

​

​

1. Voldie is utterly smashed, EoAM senses and either crushes or eats the remaining Horcruxes.
2. If Harry doesn't notice the "lay low" warning in his memories, he might accidentally attract the attention of the denizens of the Immaterium, which at this point probably leads to humanity being curbstomped, leading to a bad ending.
3. In the Eldar-track, this attracts the attention of the Eldar, leading to plots such as "avoid becoming client race", "Humanity F- Yeah", and fix-fics for the original history of the next 40K years.
4. In the "Magic either is insulated from the Warp, or does not require the Warp" tracks, this leads to possible plots such as "long-term HFY against the forces of Chaos" (in particular, recall the Big Reveal at the end of, from the Neo Genesis Evangelion fandom, the fic Thousand Shinji .
