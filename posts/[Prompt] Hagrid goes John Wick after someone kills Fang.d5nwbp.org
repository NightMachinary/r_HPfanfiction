Since Hagrid had no romantic entanglement until Goblet of fire, feel free to have the dog be the last gift of his father (it can be a magical dog).

Edit: Death eaters torched his cabin in book 6. Also a good starting point.

Edit2: Bonus points-Keep Hagrid's accent intact.

Edit3: Someone kills Fluffy


** It had been a small hut. But the charred ashes of Hagrid's hut had burnt to such tiny, tidy cinders that it looked more like the aftermath of a large bonfire than arson. He was no stranger to fire; he had plenty of burns he bore as souvenirs from his time with dragons, and even more scars that he bore as the only reminder of a past he could bury, and sometimes even forget. But this- the smoke billowing up towards the looming Morsmorde, the spread of unnaturally colored flames, the sound of fearful barking from inside, and, even worse, when the barking stopped- this, Hagrid would never forget.

And after hours of digging in an otherwise inconspicuous corner of the Forbidden Forest, armed with everything from umbrellas concealing untraceable wands to quills dipped in Acromantula venom, he vowed the Death Eaters wouldn't forget, either.

#+begin_quote
  This story, as a few are in the world of Harry Potter fanfiction, stems from one of those many ideas of Rorschachs Blot, entitled "Nothing to Lose." One of the areas this story will explore is the possible impact on Harry Potter and friends of the isolation that our dear old friend, Albus Dumbledore, always fed to him: this isolation will make up its own reality.

Now Hagrid, large man, stand at the lifeloss body of his dead "canene companon" Fang. Who just got brutally /DOG/capitated.

"I'll will find out *who* got done *did* this", he says, "and exact my */ravange/*..."

We do hear dramatic wolf howling fron the distance! It's the wolf brothers of *Fang*. They are so mournful. The */FangBros/*. From */MournHub.com/*

 

Who comitted this /murder Most Foul/?? Hargrid checks inspects the dog corpse. There seams to be a BUSINESS CARD evidence.... the card reads "+JOSS WHE+ "JOHN WICK"

"Well," Hagrid grunts Hagrd says, "guess there AIN'T can't not will be *NO REST* for the *WICK*ED."

 

John Wickeanu reeves is just chiling out maxin relaxin' all cruel. In his man sion. Sitting atop the large pile of /money/ */US dollar buckes/* that he earned from staring in video game Cyberp*nk 2077. On the wall is mounted *FANG*'s decapitittied *HEAD*.

 

More like Jhon */Prick/*

if you ask me

no offence

 

Now there is */a knock/* at his door (Josh Wick's door(played for Keane Reeves)) and Johm Wick says this: "G*sh d*rn trick or treaties again, let me give them a PIECE of my mind" and when he says "piece" he does c*ck his GUN. */WEAPON/*.

 

Now Hagrid, big individual, stands in the door raining outside. He's soaked from rain.... amd *BLOOD*!

"You killed my dog Fang, you nasty MURDAR," accuses Hagrid.

"Yes," admits Johnathan Wick.

"And now *I'll* shall *kill* YOU...." threatening Hagrid says.

"But wait," John Rick preposes.

 

Big and polite Hagrid waits.

 

"See I had a comtract," explains John Wick, "from the */LIBERAL MEDIA/*. to *ss*ssinate Fang."

Johny Wick shows the contract for a 'hit job'. Requested by the *leberal media*.

Hagrid takes the dickument and reads so careful. He then says this:

"You /DOFUS..../ this was supposed to kill presidintial candy date /YANG/. Look!"

Hagrid is correct: the contract does say Andrew *YANG* not *FANG*!

 

John Wick gets so embarrased now. Can't Doesn't even /READ/ the cuntract right!

"Well....." he shrugs, "....guess it does *not* /'feel good to be a Fangsta'!"/

 

The two men share a good laugh at this humor joke! Hapy end!
