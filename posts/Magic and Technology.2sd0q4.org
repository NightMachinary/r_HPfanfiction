I have been a HP fanfiction reader for 8 years now, and I keep wondering.

With all the fanfiction available where Harry/Hermione/Someone decides to make technology work around magic, have I just missed one that offers the simplest explanation for electricity not working in magical places?

The lightning rod is a relatively new invention, so I don't expect the isolationist wizards in the Harry Potter world to know about them. At some point, wouldn't a wizard have created a spell to protect their home from lightning strikes? Might that spell work by grounding lighting/electricity?

I always thought an easy explanation for why electricity would not work in magical places was a lightning protection spell that interferes with electrical devices as an unknown side effect. A spell like this would probably make it into every do-it-yourself book about placing spells on a wizards home, so it would likely be cast on nearly every magical dwelling.

This would make getting a Walkman (remember it was the 1990's) to work at Hogwarts as simple as convincing Dumbledore to remove the lightning protection spell and replacing it with lightning rods.

As for why no one thought about it before, I think it would take a muggle born wizard or witch being as smart as Hermione to make the connection between electronics and a lightning protection spell before this time period. It was only in the 90's that it became common for children to carry something electronic with them constantly, so most muggle born children before the books might not have had a reason to think about it anyway after going without for so long before having to magically protect their first home.

Are there any HP fanfiction stories where this is used? Please link to them if there are as I would like to read one. I would write my own, but I can never make it past the first couple of chapters.


** While the canon blurb from Hermione quoting the swotty-witches bible... er, Hogwarts, A History indicates that electronics don't work at Hogwarts, this is in reference to using surveillance equipment like 'bugs'.

In my mind, it's the radio signals that can't find their way around/to the castle, as the muggle-repelling charms and Unplottable protection interfere with reception. That said, they never had any electrical wires run out to them from whatever nearest power station might be a mountain or two away. If a muggleborn really wanted to make sparks work, they'd have to build a generator, capacitors and transformers to get the current down to household Amps and Volts. Solar panels might be an option, except that Inverness is further North than Edmonton, making for a long, dark winter up in the Hogsmeade area.

The throwaway answer would be that the wizard enchant the Walkman's batteries to never run low- a version of a refilling charm. It won't let them listen in to Radio Glasgow, but they could still jog around whilst listening to Pearl Jam or the Commitments.

*** Oh, man, I just got the crackiest idea ever for some kind of HP/Commitments crossover.

Tell me Andrew Strong couldn't be an adult Ron Weasley.

**** Makes the idea of Luna mistaking Sirius for ex-Hobgoblin Stubby Boardman a little more plausible, too.

** I have an idea for a HP/SG1 Crossover and my idea is that magic generates a Electromagnetic Interference but only in places with high concentrations of magic, and because most EM shielded electronics are not really consumer accessible, is a common misconception that Elektricity doesn't works on hogwarts

*** This has always bugged me. How about Diagon Alley then? London surrounds it and there is no Electrical problems there.

**** I imagine a charm or enchanted object(s) locks-in the magical energy in places like Diagon Alley. Otherwise muggles would end-up finding areas where their devices don't work and would start to investigate.

**** arent there? i don't remember any electronics in Diagon Alley

I think it's more like spells that affect a wide area create this inerference

***** There isnt any electronics in Diagon Alley but the surrounding muggle technology isnt affected by the magic of Diagon Alley.
