"Well, if you insist, let me see your palm...oh dear, deary me, your fate is bound by wrath and pride. What do the cards predict? Revelation, downfall, a breaking with one of the fundamentals of your life...tea leaves? Sign of the enemy, of betrayal...dice? Days, months, years...months, I see. It is my prediction that you will fall afoul of the fabled curse on the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, no earlier than May and no later than the end of June. I foresee that your confidence in your authority will be broken by an enemy who refuses to acknowledge it, and a dark deed being exposed will lead to your disgrace in the eyes of many. Any questions?"
