** Both, quite unique and really well-written, with a lot of history of the ancient Britannia in Queen Boudica's times, and there's an sequel, too.

[[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129984][Splinters]] by GHL

Summary: In the secret mists of time, a truth has been shattered. The path to victory has been cursed with despair... and nobody realizes it.

It is 1995 -- the summer of their discontent. Sequestered within the grimy walls of Grimmauld Place, Harry and Ginny begin having strange dreams of an era long past and events yet to come. Are the dreams somehow real? Is fate taunting them with tragic visions of doom, or are they being granted a precious chance to survive... and fall in love? Note: this story presumes canon until Chapter 4 of OotP... beyond which things begin to go haywire.

  littlebastardreviews posted the collected facts from the 2014 UK Editions of Harry Potter: and this fact caught my eye. 'Only one non-magical person has ever managed to get as far as the Hogwarts Sorting Hat before being exposed as a Squib.' But, gosh it just makes me want a story where a squib did make it through. So here's a drabble about a squib with a quick mind and a hand-me-down wand, who refuses to be denied her birthright. -- when the hat drops over her eyes it asks, 'well what do we have here?' she's got a forged hogwarts letter with penmanship that's perfect down to the ink splatter; she's got a complicated string of owls, only half of them forged, from parents to administration to ministry that's so complicated her name ended up on the first year roll call anyway. she's got ten arguments, four pleas, and one smothered threat on the tip of her mental tongue for why the house that comes out of this hat's brim better not be 'squib' she's got a lighter up her sleeve and an eight and a half inch wand in her belt that will never, ever work for her. 'well,' says the hat, 'better be slytherin then'

If you want more unique stories, just search for "AU" ("alternate universe") and you'll find plenty.
