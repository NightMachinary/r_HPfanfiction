** I read linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856625/1/The-Return-of-the-Marauders]]) a while back. It starts in 5th year, I think, and has Harry, Lily and Sirius come out of hiding. Now that I'm looking at the first chapter, it seems really cheesy, but I liked it at the time.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

** Return of the Marauders is decent, there's one where Harry is raised by Grindelwald, and rocks up in 7th year, goes to slytherin, I forget it's name though

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.
