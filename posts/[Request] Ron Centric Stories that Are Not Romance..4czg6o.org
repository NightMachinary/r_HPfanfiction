** You know what, I found one of the greatest stories with ROn as a main character the other day, /but I found out too late that it's been abandoned for 5 years/.

I'm gonna leave it here anyway, cause you might be one of those persons who don't care about endings, or you might be able to craft your own ending, but remember, the story is incomplete. And it does drop at a fairly crucial moment.

linkffn(Mirror, Mirror by BlackHawk13)

Oh, and I mean, you said no romance, and the story is not /about/ romance, but I mean, Ron and Hermione like eachother, ha's just kinda there, it's not what the tory is about.

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

** linkffn(the book of morgan le fey) and its sequel are very early ron centric stories where he's a seer. This is pre-HBP, so we haven't even invented horcruxes yet - the most interesting thing from my point of view is how Voldemort is protecting himself without horcruxes. Anyway, worth a read, but I'm pretty sure there's some R/Hr in there too. Also linkffn(weasley girl) and its (WIP) sequel don't have a pairing and stars Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley. Slightly ooc, but one of my very favorite "change one thing and watch what happens" fics. Just a very well executed fic. Lastly linkffn(choices by random-fruitcake04) is a slytherin!Ron fic. Again he's a seer, currently a WIP but updated 2 weeks ago. It's gotten up to 5th year and has no pairing as of yet. Glad to find another Ron-ophile.

** linkffn(Invisible Circus by Sceneii) has Ron joining the pro-pureblood faction as a spy.

linkffn(War! by chudleycannonsnumber1) has Dumbledore and Ron bonding and philosophizing over a game of Castle Quest.

** linkffn(7523798) Stay Standing is my favorite Ron fic. It's mostly Ron on his own so there's almost zero romance, though the family themes and trio bonding is great. I'd definitely read it if I were you. It's also been updated pretty consistently recently.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
