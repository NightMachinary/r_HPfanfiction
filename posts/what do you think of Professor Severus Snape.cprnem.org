As far as i see him Professor Severus Snape is a bitter man caught in his past and affected by his childhood.

He keeps trying to make amends but i feel that Most Fanfics romanticize him too much, i don't think he is a kind gentle man hiding his true self, he is a grown man who while he hates children and mostly harry for the resemblance he bares to his hated childhood bully, and for him being a constant reminder of what he was never able to get.

I respect all that he has done and sacrificed for the war and it is too much, but he had time to get over it and never was able to, and he is honestly a bully himself, you can see it when he looks at Hermione who had her teeth grow because of a spell and he says 'i see no difference' Now i do believe that any teacher worth his salt should know that a 14 year old child would get immensely hurt by that. and there are several more examples of his behavior.

​

So what do you guys think?


** Snape came from an awful, shitty family, where he basically lived in a real world version of pureblood propaganda - a dirty, evil muggle hurting him and his weak blood traitor mother cause he hates and fears magic. This made him cynical, bitter and unhappy, perfect for radicalisation.

He then went to a school that segregated him from his only friend, put him in a room with hateful bigots who would attack him for his parentage and who he could only protect himself from by excelling magically and kissing their robes. Meanwhile, his only friend is surrounded by bigots of a different, less severe kind - anti-Slytherin. This drives a wedge between them, as does the fact that he is hanging out with bigots and learning dark spells for survival reasons, and the fact that he and her housemates are constantly at war. Eventually, he fucks up and it's the straw that breaks the camel's back and she leaves him forever.

He is ripe for indoctrination based on his upbringing, his anger at Gryffindor and his father, his general bitterness and arrogance that began as a defence mechanism, and pure pragmatism in the wizarding world and especially Slytherin at the time.

So he gets radicalised and partly out of rage and partly out of belief joins the Death Eaters. He then accidentally causes his ex best friend to die.

He is then basically forced by the leader of the light to teach - something he clearly hates - and devote himself to protecting Harry, a child that constantly reminds him of his own guilt and also his animosity towards James Potter.

With that backstory, it's no wonder he's a mean spirited bully and asshole. And it is fairly respectable that he broke that cycle, even if it was initally revenge motivated and he never became a truly good person.

He deserves some respect for his strength and his contribution to the war effort, but also to be held as a cautionary tale.

*** You've really put a lot of thought into this! I think you've hit the nail in the head, though; no child starts out the way Snape ended up, their upbringing and peers have a lot to do with it.

I'd also like to add that Lily was apparently the first person to show him any sort of kindness, love or affection. That would very much have given him rose coloured glasses when it came to her. She could have been a really shitty person, but she gave him love and affection where nobody else did, and that made her Good in his books.

When he lashed out, he immediately showed his remorse and she refused to forgive him, yet because of their past and her major role in his life, he still ended up eventually believing she was Good and worth protecting.

I think his radicalisation came at a time in his life when he was the most vulnerable because Lily, his pillar of goodness, his one source of love, kindness, hope and affection, had abandoned him.

And then here come Lucius Malfoy and Tom Riddle, offering something he can't resist, the chance to have all of that and more, to fit in somewhere, be loved and treated well by others, to have hope and someone to rely on, who won't abandon him like she did, who won't stop him from defending himself (or even avenging himself) against his enemies.

The Death Eaters offered something not-quite as warm as Lily's love, but they offered it with some added perks, and when Lily wasn't there for him. It was practically as good. How could he refuse?

**** You've captured my sentiments perfectly.

I find a particularly interesting contrast in Sirius.

Sirius grew up in an abusive Dark Pureblood family, and developed a visceral hate of Dark magic, Pureblood politics and Slytherin from that. He pissed around at school and picked on Snape because of those biases and his desire to rebel.

But all Snape could see was a pampered Pureblood who claims to be above Pureblood politics while benefiting from it, doesn't care to work cause he knows the world will bow to him, and mistreats Snape and other Slytherins because of bigotry.

Snape grew up in an abusive Muggle household and developed an instinctive bitterness, dislike of Muggles and dislike of marriage between Muggles and Wizards/Witches. He worked his ass off at school, learned dark magic and kissed the robes of DEs because of those biases and his need to protect himself and find success/support.

But all Sirius could see was a mean spirited Slytherin bigot practicing the Unforgiveables with the kids of the people his parents held dinner parties with and somehow manipulating kind sweet Lily Evans into hanging out with him.

Add in the wider political context, house relations, and the other characters in both Gryffindor and Slytherin, and it's no wonder they developed an instant enmity that lead to at least one attempted murder and to both entrenching themselves on opposite sides of a war. Neither is truly blameless, and Snape picked the worse side no question, but it would be needlessly reductive to ignore or hand wave this context.

***** Yes! Great minds, eh? I don't have the brain power right now to continue this in-depth level of conversation (I should also be asleep!) but I love your first analysis, and also definitely agree with your assessment of Sirius.

I also agree that you can't just take all this context and then go, ‘Yeah, but he bullied kids, so that makes him the 3rd worst person in the universe!' He never wanted to be in that situation, he never wanted to teach and never wanted to be around children, let alone in a position of authority over them, or a position where he could bully them. I understand Dumbledore wanted to keep him close, but how close is too close?

All that said, his dislike of children probably came from his upbringing. Often, children who are abused have no desire to become parents or enter professions where they deal with children. They are often scared that they'll turn out like their abuser and, due to having a conscience, they don't want to do that. (What a surprise!) Snape probably disliked children because they either reminded him of his own upbringing (Harry) or everything his youth wasn't (Ron).

I would even go so far as to say that he likely hated himself for the way he treated those kids, yet struggled to break the cycle of abused--->abuser. It is hard to break, yet in some small ways, he managed it. He couldn't exactly hug Harry Potter without risking his life and the valuable information he could feed the order, but he did what he could to keep them safe. He taught them well, and he used his skills and position to protect them as much as possible. To do any more would have probably put them in more danger than total inaction on his part.

Alright, I suppose my brain did have something left to wring out.. I'm definitely going to sleep now, but I want you to know that you and your Snape-analysis are amazing!

****** Lets add the fact that Dumbledore's response to him almost dying by Sirius's Prank was getting an abused, bullied teenager to swear he wouldn't tell anyone that his bully almost got him murdered and basically telling him that his life didn't mean S**t. I'm not sure how other people would have reacted but I personally, as a teenager, would went utterly suicidal or psychotic or both. Understanding all this context, Severus Snape became a better man than he was destined to become.

Gotta take issue with this part, though I really like your analysis otherwise. Nothing suggests that the Marauders or Gryffindors as a whole were bigoted against Slytherins or Snape. They didn't like him for one specific reason - he was completely, totally fascinated with the Dark Arts. He's specifically noted as having known more Dark spells as a first year than most graduate Hogwarts knowing. He's not learning them for survival reasons, it's his damn /hobby./ We know that Lupin was mostly a stabilizing influence on the rest, and since Snape is known to have given back what he got, it's doubtful Pettigrew was overly aggressive with him. We can pretty safely conclude that it was mostly James and Sirius in a feud with him. James was the one who sheltered Sirius from his family and gave the Black in Gryffindor the benefit of the doubt. Sirius had his harridan mother and Death Eater father and brother to contend with. They both have the entirely reasonable reaction of 'this guy is clearly obsessed with the Dark Arts - that makes him a danger' because they're aware of where people like that end up. And surprise, Snape winds up snapping a slur at his Muggleborn friend and eventually becomes a Death Eater and dooms James and Lily to death and Sirius to unjust imprisonment (which he outright rejects the chance to hear any defense against).

**** Snape and Harry are extremely similar in many important ways.

Had Harry been sorted into Slytherin, and Voldemort genuinely dead, I can EASILY see him following the same path.

He didn't respond to his abuse with the same sarcasm, bitterness and angst that Snape did, but the seeds were sown nonetheless.

He came to the magical world as a pureblood propaganda posterboy. Every insult levied at Muggles - they're stupid, violent, bigoted, mean, dirty/slovenly (Vernon and Dudley), they hate and fear magic and want to oppress wizards - is 100% true from 11 year old Harry or Snape's POV, as their only experience shows it.

Harry, thankfully, was then surrounded by good people who set a good example and helped his better nature win, ensuring he understood that not all Muggles were like his parents etc. Snape meanwhile was surrounded by the opposite, and it's no wonder he went the way he did as a result.

**** Adding to my thoughts re: Snape and Harry's similarities, I just vomited this into a word document and thought it might be of interest.

The biggest reason why Harry Potter couldn't really have become a Pureblood supremacist Slytherin in canon is the simple fact that Voldemort is still around.

Voldemort's continued existence ensures that those people who might have the desire and ability to “redpill” Harry against Muggles and Muggleborns, manipulate and indoctrinate him into believing that all Muggles are like the Dursleys and that it is his right as a wizard to dominate them, are instead automatically trying to diminish and/or kill him.

If Voldemort was truly dead and gone, this would be a different story. We get a small glimpse of this alternate reality in the first few interactions between Harry and Draco. Draco, presumably on his father's orders, attempts to befriend Harry and subtly turn him against light aligned families with his snub of Ron. Of course at this time both Draco and Lucius believe that Voldemort is gone -- which means that they have no real incentive to hurt Harry when they can instead win him to their side. Harry, of course, resists this and does so in a fashion so open and harsh that Draco and Lucius immediately (and correctly) peg him as a white knight and somehow already Dumbledore's man through and through (this is not a criticism, just a description). They, as a result, oppose him from then on, and because of that so does the rest of Slytherin. Once Voldemort is back, this only intensifies as you would expect.

But in the alternate world where Voldemort genuinely was defeated that night at Godric's Hollow, I'd argue that all you'd need to change to make Harry a future Dark Wizard and Pureblood Bigot, is slightly change the order of character introductions. Have Draco not insult Hagrid, and introduce himself before starting a positive conversation, have Harry not befriend Ron before Draco's insult, and that's it. Harry is now going to be perfectly happy sorted into Slytherin as the hat demands, and from there it's the fast track to radicalisation.

Harry's only experiences prove and confirm the Pureblood propaganda. Every Pureblood insult you can imagine is proved true by the Dursley's and the other Muggles Harry interacts with,\\
They're Dirty (except Petunia). They're Violent. They're Mean. They're Stupid. They're Bigoted. They're Irrational. They're Primitive. They Hate and Fear Magic. They Want to Oppress and Hurt Magical People. They Don't Understand Magic.

It's not going to take too much pushing for anyone remotely clever to push a narrative based on that which appear instantly accurate to Harry's undeveloped 11 year old mind. Add to that the promises of wealth, of power, of safety against Muggles and all those who would do you harm, and you're making a fairly attractive package for an abused 11 year old.

Plus, he's Harry Potter. He slew the last Dark Lord, a pretender who hurt his followers as much as his enemies and didn't truly respect the Pureblood culture, simply seeking his own power. He won't just be a rank and file dark wizard, no, he'll be powerful and respected and nobody will ever lock him in a cupboard again...and you get the idea.

This roadmap to radicalisation that I've laid out here is fairly close, in my eyes, to the way I see Snape as having been turned into what he became. It's not exactly accurate -- the whole “he's Harry Potter bit” most obviously -- but it hits a lot of the same points. Add to it Snape's generally more bitter and angry personality than 11 year old Harry, who is a beacon of light and resilience somehow, and everything becomes crystal clear.

***** Honestly, I'm in line with you with the muggle opinions! It's a theme I've been developing in my own stories... For Harry, hating muggles should -- /should/ -- be easy. The Dursley's -- and pretty much everyone he's ever known as a muggle -- have mistreated him greatly.

But this is also where the canon plot armor comes in :) Because Harry, for all the abuse he's experienced, is an incredibly well adjusted and, well, /good/, boy. And you simply can't beat that!

**** Only if you totally ignore context.

Snape is a half-blood in Slytherin whose only real knowledge of Muggles may as well have been directly taken from Pureblood propaganda. In those circumstances, a defensive adoption of Pureblood views and a desire to ingratiate oneself into the only available social group - given the isolation of Slytherin from the rest of Hogwarts and the lower status of Half-Bloods generally - makes sense.

Add to that the circumstance - Snape has been publically humiliated by people Lily is in a social group with (to an extent) IN FRONT OF the purebloods he's desperate to make like him because that's his only visible route out of Spinner's End. He's hurt, angry, bitter, and scared of the social repercussions. So he's looking to lash out at anyone who gets close with the most hurtful thing he can, and for Lily that happens to be the word Mudblood. He's also in fear that the other Slytherins will dislike or laugh at him over this, and that will only become worse if he accepts her help. So calling her a Mudblood might save some small amount of face among them, at least.

He's not blameless, and his association with junior DEs, study of Dark Magic, partial culpability in the feud with the Marauders and generally shitty personality all contributed to his decision and to Lily's reaction, but wilfully stripping Snape's Worst Memory to "Snape called Lily the wizard N-Word" is laughable.

They do so, usually, with the things they intuitively know as being hurtful to that person, and then immediately regret this and wish they could take it back because they don't actually feel that way in the cold light of day.

Had Petunia been the one to approach Snape, she'd have been called a Muggle. Had Lupin, he'd have said Werewolf. Harry, probably "orphan". For Lily, that was Mudblood.

And it's far more than just "I want to fit in with the racists". It's "these people are the only people willing to give me time of day, are constantly indoctrinating me with propaganda and promises of power and support and safety, and have tremendous power over me to hurt or help me.

And claiming that abuse played no role in Snape's decisions, personality or behaviour is just wilfully ignorant. I've never claimed that his story is prescriptive or descriptive of all abused people, and have in fact mentioned in other comments the contrast with Harry who maintained a positive, moral attitude despite equivalent suffering.

I did a real world degree in Sociology and Politics, and a large relevant topic in these fields especially in today's climate is radicalisation. I say this not to pull rank or attempt to argue from authority, but to give you context when I say that I recognise Snape's story from real world stories of neo-nazis and other radicals who were indoctrinated into supremacist or violent beliefs IRL.

If you think anyone is irredeemable at 15 when their worst crime is spitting out and immediately regretting a slur in a high stress situation with multiple aggravating factors, I worry for you.

Anyone with friends of minorities knows how tough they have it. Even when angry, you are conscious of this fact. Unless you actually believe (which Snape did) you would never use slurs like that to someone you care about.

Snape believed in this propaganda. He believed muggleborns were lesser to purebloods. Lily was the exception, not the norm. She even mentions this in the books. He would, or allowed, his friends to curse muggleborns as long as they weren't Lily.

At the end of the day, regardless of how you are raised, you are in control of your own actions. Yeah, he had a shitty life, but so did Harry and a ton others and they didn't rush off to join Voldemort.

If Snape murdered James, would it be justified? Hell no, murder is still murder, even if James had been a twat in the past. Slurs are the same but lesser. Snape had the choice to say anything else that was hurtful, instead he said Mudblood.

And Snape's choices after joining Dumbledore weren't good. They were selfish as fuck. It was revenge for killing Lily, nothing more. Don't forget, Snape didn't care that James, her husband, died. Snape didn't even care that Harry could have died. The reason he protected Harry was because he was Lily's son... Not an orphan child that needed help.

Hell, he bullied students for no reason (Neville especially) and was an utter dick to Harry because he looked like his father. That is extremely petty.

I would easily take your side if he showed actual remorse for what he had done, and not just because the love of his life had been murdered.

Snape would have remained a death eater, full stop, if lily hadn't been murdered. That, to me, makes him a bad person.

What really strikes me about Snape is that over a decade after the Potters' deaths, he still hasn't let it go. He doesn't even try to move on, find happiness, or better himself. He remains obsessed with James and Lily- obsessively hating James and obsessively 'loving' Lily. He takes out his hatred of a man who has been dead for a decade on his orphaned, 11 year old, and completely innocent son. That's just pathetic. He regularly bullies children for utterly petty reasons. He never expresses regret for any of this.

Look, I'd be willing to forgive all the shit he did before the Potters' murder because he did reform and as others have pointed out, he was basically groomed for it, but everything after that is all on him. Nothing excuses the bullying of children. I don't care how abused a character was as a child, once they turn and start abusing children themselves, they get no sympathy from me.

** Severus Snape is a cunt. And I don't mean that in a nice way.

Plain and simple the man never grew up. Of course, he had this in common with the few of his generation we get to see in any detail. Sirius and Remus also had major cuntery in their characters and none of them ever grew the fuck up.

Sirius never seemed to be able to separate James from Harry, Remus was stuck in an endless morass of self-pity, both of them believed that the sun shone out of Dumbledore's ass, and neither treated Harry with anything resembling respect.

As bad as those two were, Snape is worse. A devoted follower of Tommy-Boy, right up to the point where Lily became a target. Blatant murdering and torture are okay as long as old Sev didn't have a stiffy for the victim, I guess. He went to Tommy to plead to be given Lily, and when that deal fell through, he traded one immoral slave master for another.

Snape went out of his way to be an utter bitch to the son of someone who was mean to him in school. A kid who has no memory of his father, and then Snape's last act in canon was to make sure that Harry knew that Snape had been wacking it to Lily's memory for Harry's entire life.

And Harry's response to that? Did he piss on the bastard's corpse? Oh hell no, he named his kid for the man, and for the other man who fucked with Harry's life and tried to program him to die.

So, yeah, canon Harry's a bit of a cunt too.

** I have mixed feelings on Snape like Voldemort and Harry he grew up in a situation which might make him resent Muggles and by extstention muggleborns. Unlike Voldemort though or even Draco really he had exposure to a different persective via Lilly. So I am possibly even more judgemental of his attitude than say Draco's. Perhaps after his friendship ending with Lilly it was easier for him to be dragged into the more biggoted beliefs and become surounded by bigoted brainwashing ideaology kinda like Draco in that aspect. So while im not sympathetic that he didnt question it and went along with it, I can find myself to at least pity that. But the telling thing is what happened later.

Draco's ficticious view of this world came crashing down on him he wanted nothing to do with Voldemort but was stuck and scared. Despite this he refused to expose Harry when he recognized him lying despite knowing he was fucked if Harry got caught and there was still a good chance he would. And even before then he wasnt exactly all happy about taking the job to kill Dumbledore. And after the war he chose to be with a woman whose beliefs went against the things he used to believe in and going against his parents wishes as thr first example you really see of him rebelling. I bring up Draco to point out all those things Snape could have been but wasnt.

He still told Voldemort to go after the Potters child. He only went against Voldemort because Voldy killed his crush. There is nothing about him changing his beliefs or challenging anything. Yes he loved Lilly who was against all this. But he loved her when he joined the Death Eaters too. So unlike Draco whose partner did reflect his beliefs( Pansy liked Dracos ideas in school ) Snape's romantic interest did not. So essentially as far as canon has stated his only real redeeming quality is loving Lilly and as far as you know he still has backwards beliefs but just hates Voldemort for killing her. And loving her but having those beliefs...not really redeeming in my eyes. He also takes his anger of James's out on Harry and really all Griffindor kids. Like really he shouldnt be a teacher.

Maybe it was just something that Rowling forgot to put in the showing he changed his beliefs but its weird when this was a character she was purposely trying to make sympathetic.

Since I don't consider his love for Lilly all that redeeming alot of what i do consider redeeming is when he helps people outside of that on his own volition.

Like pretending he missed to spare George and only taking out his ear. Or checking on Sirius after Harry tries to tell him Sirius is in danger in front of Umbridge.

I mean ya he'd be really low to let Voldemort just torture Sirius. But again this is the guy who outed Lupin as a werewolf because he lost the chance to get Sirius lobotomized and since Snape is told things by Dumbledore and would most definetly demand an explanation for all this knew probably Sirius was innocent when he did.

But my mixed feelings for him dont really come from the fact that i think he is very forgivable but from the fact I wanted him to be better. I wanted to see him become a better person and be redeemed by proving his beliefs changed and not because he loved someone who was good and rejected him.

I think he had the potential to be and I think it makes a more interesting story when he did.

I dont necessarily hate him in canon or think he has no redeeming qualities but i do think he came across much less redeemable than the author wanted him to be.

** What I think is that fan-fiction need not necessarily confirm every characterizations established by canon. A fan-fiction writer can write a sorrowful, regretful, and loving Snape and it would still be okay as long as it makes sense in that writer's world if it confirms the rule and characterization established in their world.

This is why I don't overtly hate bash fic. I don't read them as possible explanation of canon events, or motives behind people involved in those events and keep in mind that manipulative xyz is manipulative within the realm of that author's version of fictional universe.

I like to think it's kind of like multiple universe theory.

As for canon Snape: His character is arguably most complex and the way JKR tried to play with "villain turned hero" and "double agent" thing with him is the actual reason that he appears such a bully in canon.

In universe explanation could be that the series is from perspective of an abused and neglected kid with hampered emotional and social development who got introduced in the world with extreme bias from giant who owed everything to a political and military leader and a kid whose world doesn't extend beyond good and evil based on color of tie has a lot to do with how we get to see Snape. I don't consider Harry Potter a reliable narrator.

On top of that Snape had a lot to do, and was stretched far too thin. He was a teacher, a double agent with far more important duties, crushing vows hanging over his heads. Cuddling an unreliable narrator straight out of abused household was probably not the most important task he had to take care of.
