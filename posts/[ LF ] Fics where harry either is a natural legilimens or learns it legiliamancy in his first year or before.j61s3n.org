** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man; The Mind Arts by Wu Gang) are the two obvious ones. I Think the Mind arts is abandoned at this point but I haven't confirmed it as I never cared for the fic.

PoS is chuck full of every trope so it doesn't focus on natural Legilimency.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  When Harry defeated Voldemort as a baby, the resulting magic was enough to blast him halfway across the world. Believed dead by the wizarding community, Harry is found and raised by the men in the black suits, with no idea who he really is... COMPLETE

  Hazel Potter has always been strange. People say she knows too much and says too little. When Aunt Petunia utters that forbidden word, 'magic', it sends Hazel on a hunt for the truth. If only the Wizarding World could have guided the direction of her search... femHarry with a focus on witchcraft

** I mean... he is a natural Legilimens in linkffn(Harry Potter and the ashes of chaos() but it isn't too much of a focus. The story does do an incredible explanation of how Natural Legilimency works, but Harry being one hasn't really been a huge focus. One of the OCs being one is focused on way more.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL
