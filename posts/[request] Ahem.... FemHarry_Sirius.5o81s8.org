*** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3694820][*/Charlotte the Great and Powerful/*]] by [[http://www.archiveofourown.org/users/Evandar/pseuds/Evandar][/Evandar/]]

#+begin_quote
  Her whole life has been about gaining power through struggle and sacrifice and manipulation of the only thing she has going for her (Charlotte's a terrible person beneath the pretty face and she knows it). Charlotte wants to be more than the girl from the cupboard and she's not above using others to gain power.
