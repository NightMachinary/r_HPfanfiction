  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

** By "usual people," I take it you mean one of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, or Snape? (Many stories out there send one or more of these.)

It's been posted to this sub before, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6581693/1/Yule-Time][Yule Time]] by Perspicacity has Augustus Rookwood as time-traveler. 7k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Augustus Rookwood, former Unspeakable, escapes capture at the Battle of Hogwarts. He develops a new form of time travel, which falls into the wrong hands and seals the fate of trillions of souls. Then, something remarkable happens.
