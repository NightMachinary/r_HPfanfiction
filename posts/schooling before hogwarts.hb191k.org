** I doubt many purebloods send their kids to muggle schools. Even pro-muggle pureblood families like the Weasleys don't seem to know much about muggles. It could be more common among half-bloods, since half of their extended family would be muggle, and their muggle/muggleborn parent probably wouldn't want them totally isolated from the muggle world.

** Only muggleborns. I'd think that even halfbloods would be a security risk, as the Ministry wouldn't want to deal with accidental magic in a muggle school. Magical kids are homeschooled, or go to small magical schools. The rich probably hire tutors.

** This is what I've seen in fics, so if I were reading it, I'd totally accept your logic.

BTW, what are you writing?

**** Awesome! I've been meaning to look into Draco fics, because I like the redeemed bad-guy trope. Normally I read Snape-centric fics for that reason, but I feel like they're largely pretty cookie-cutter, and I want some diversity!

You may have just convinced me.
