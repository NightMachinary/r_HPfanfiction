:END:
So, a long time ago, I read this fic where old Harry traveled back in time to his younger self, using the last of his magic then dying, where he gave himself a book he made to guide himself through life. Where the book only got new text when he was ready for it, and he warned himself that he would not like some of the things that would happen... I can't find this fic again, and I am in desperate need to re read it... PLEASE help me find it again

***** We see throughout canon that he can't just splurge on anything he wants. Harry even speculates that purchasing a Firebolt would set him back considerably. He probably has enough to get him through life comfortably if he has a steady job and survive uncomfortably if he doesn't. The mysterious second family vault that contains mountains of gold a hundred times bigger than his already ample regular vault is mentioned nowhere and pure fanon.

****** So a while back going by what the estimated exchange rate on a Galleon was to British Pounds and then through that to US dollars, someone calculated his wealth of the VISIBLE gold in the vault via the movie. Keep in mind that in both the book, and movie, it is implied that there is a lot more gold within the vault than the part he interacts with and that the vault is fairly decent sized.

The amount of money that is "visible" or "interacted with" (as in the single pile he grabs from), is estimated at about $1.5 million dollars.

If we extrapolate from this, using the size of the vault as described in comparison to the Weasleys and other vaults visited, he likely has somewhere between $15-30 million US dollars worth of gold in that vault. Of course, this is just guesswork. It could be a bit less, or a lot more.

But even if he just had that 1 pile (which again does not seem to be the case) that still means hes a millionare at the age of 11. Plenty rich in my book.

******* Honestly, I'm of the belief that the movies are fanon tbh. They were a director's interpretation of the source material.

Meanwhile the clues like the user above said lead us to believe otherwise. I mean, when little eleven year old Harry first saw his vault, it would have seemed like a lot to any kid never mind a kid like Harry who's never had his fair share of anything at the Dursleys. And we're seeing the world through Harry's eyes.

******** Except that even in the books it is implied Harry is wealthy. I get your point that to a child it may seems like a lot, but it does speak of "mounds of gold coins, columns of silver, heaps of knuts", and goes on to specifically say "small fortune". Mounds of gold coins is specifically telling since those are galleons and mounds is not just 1 large pile but MANY.

It certainly implies he is rich, even if how rich is up for debate. And the Potter families significant wealth was later confirmed by Rowling herself via Pottermore.

********** True but thats not the debate. The original debate this stems from is, would Harry qualify as "filthy rich", and the specific comment I originally replied to implies that hes not even rich at all, and only has enough to live comfortably if he had a steady job.

I personally think based upon the evidence we do have, that is not correct at all and that he could easily live off his inheritance with no job or even earnings, and still pass along a ton to his children. Whether or not that qualifies as "filthy rich" is still up for debate, but he is certainly rich.

Generally those are the same people that instead of just going with 2-3 names like Harry Potter-Peverell-Black, they lose their damn minds and he suddenly has 10 last names. Or instead of a nice Polyamorus 3-4 person relationship, suddenly there is a harem with 20. Or instead of him simply being a powerful wizard, he can snap his fingers and reshape the world to his whims.

And some folks read those. Hell I even have and some are not even half bad in terms of the bare bones of the fan fic, just way way way overly complicated and done, because the author just simply doesnt know when to stop lol.

** It's not the same one, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5178251/1/30-Minutes-That-Changed-Everything][30 Minutes that Changed Everything]] has a sort-of similar concept with an old Harry Potter having survived the Final War and sending a magical virtual simulcrum of himself back to his pre-Hogwarts self in order to give him the boost needed to hopefully prevent the extinction-level war from ever happening. It includes a lot of world-building and ends with harry and co. deciding that going to Hogwarts will help them make the changes they have decided are needed.

While 30 Minutes is complete (55 chapters, 350K+ words), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5480014/1/30-Minutes-II-The-Gathering-Storm][30 Minutes II: The Gathering Storm]] is sadly unfinished at 16 chapters/140K+ words. It does, however, have a great scene where Harry is forced by Snape to give a Potions lesson as a detention ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5480014/8/30-Minutes-II-The-Gathering-Storm][Ch 8]]). He promptly shows Snape up by getting his class to brew a potion that Snape admits is suitable for use in the infirmary, save for a couple of cauldrons brewed by Malfoy and Co who did not pay attention.
