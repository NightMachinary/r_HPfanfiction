This has been bothering me for a while, and now it's relevant to a fic I'm writing. At the beginning of OotP, Harry is sending owl post to Ron and Hermione, and we know it gets to them because Hedwig pecks at them to force replies. This was before Harry even knew where they were, let alone what the Order was. How did Hedwig find the house, which is guarded by a fidelius charm?


** My headcanon is that these spells apply only to humans because wizards don't think of house elves, goblins, etc when making them.

** I mean this is a bit out there but Dumbledore could have taken hedwig there before the summer so that Harry wouldn't get too suspicious about why no one was replying

** Plot hole. If the Fidelius charm works as we are told the only way Hedwig could get there is if Dumbledore told her the secret verbally (let's go with Hedwig can't read). Dumbledore could have done that anytime "off camera" at school.

Otherwise all a bad guy would have to do is get a post owl and say Deliver this to james and lily potter, or Sirius Black and then track the owl to their location.

*** Even if someone 'knows' approximately where a fidelius charmed location is, they still can't percieve the location or enter it--Harry is standing right in front of 12 Grimmauld place before being told the secret, and sees nothing there.

**** I'm thinking mundane triangulation via owls assuming the owls can fly to the fidelius charmed property. Get three or four owls release and track the first one. Record the location where the owl disappears. Then from a different direction release the second owl record where it disappears. Repeat process with remaining owls. You have now marked the edges of the Fidelius charmed property. Then either steal, acquire, transfigure, or conjure several 1000 lb muggle bombs or 2 ton boulders and drop them in the center of the marked area and then expand outward towards the marked boundary.

There's a very high probability that the protected property would be in the exact dead center of the marked area unless the caster took steps to extend the fidelius charm in an alternative pattern. (Of course, that's why you start in the center and then work your way to the marked boundary to make sure you get it.)

The above would be the reason why you want to ensure that post owls don't have the capability to fly into a fidelius charmed property.

***** That wouldn't be useful. You can literally walk up to a Fidelius charmed location and you will be entirely unable to detect or interact with it.

****** You're right that I wouldn't be able to perceive the property But i would know the specific points where the owls disappeared. Eg the property is actually there i just don't realize it is there. So I believe I could identify those 4 spots. Now there may or may not be any difference in those points. If there is then I send a bomb to the center of those points. If there isn't then I send a bomb to the identified point the explosion should hit the property.

The Fidelius charm is like an overpowered illusion. The property exists I just don't see it. So if i decided to launch Fiendfyre at #11 and #13 I believe it would eventually get #12 as it is physically there.

We don't know if that's how it works. In canon it seems more like it would be impossible to interact with the house in any way unless you know the secret.

#+begin_quote
  Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about num-ber twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had inflated, pushing those on either side out of its way. Harry gaped at it. The stereo in number eleven thudded on. Apparently the Muggles in-side hadn't even felt anything.
#+end_quote

From how it's described, Harry walking between 11 and 13, or casting spells between them, wouldn't be hitting an invisible house, he just wouldn't interact with #12 at all.

******** I too think that the Fidelius only affects the perception of those who don't know the secret. #12 is getting air, light and sound from the regions outside the Fidelius. Thus you have at least 3 methods of attacking the people inside, aerosolized poison, high powered lasers and sonic weapons. I believe this extends to all inanimate matter in general thus cannon shells and bullets would also have no problem. If you shot a cannon from #11 to #13, I believe it would hit #12.

Another thought comes to mind: If you were standing on the edge of #11 and looking at #12 while someone casts the Fidelius, would you now see the part of #13 that had been obscured by the non-secret #12? Could you use the Fidelius this way to look through walls when spying on someone? Or hell, use this to check a safe's contents and REMOVE them since you can't interact with the wall (and ONLY the wall) but you CAN interact with the items inside the safe?

I think I just stumbled upon a plot bunny...

******** when it was first mentioned it was said voldemort would not know where the potters where even if he had his nose to the window

at first it seemed less like the fidilus hid the house but the people inside it

*** The fidelius would simply block the tracking. You could follow the owl all you want, it'd vanish and you'd have idea where the secret is.

** There must be some emergency workaround for owl, because obviously owls cannot read it. Or perhaps the Fidelius Charm doesn't work on owls at all? I wouldn't dive into this too much, this way lies madness.

** My advice is don't think about it. The whole Fidelius explanation is doggy at best. Suspension of logic (not disbelieve, logic) is needed if you want to use the cannon mechanics. Alternatively you could break away from cannon and make the spell work in any other way.

** As Captain Barbossa said "You have to be lost to find the place that can't be found"

You cannot know the secret unless told .An owl does not know where it is. Owl is here. Where is here? Where owl is. Nest is that way. Letter goes other way.

** Canon doesn't help that much as it doesn't really explain how the Fidelius charm actually works. We know that it removes the memory of the property from everyone who once knew about it. And until they are told the secret they remember nothing about the property nor can they perceive it. Now there is nothing in canon that says that the property is placed into some alternate dimension.

Now that means that the property is still physically there just those who don't know the secret can't perceive it. Now canon also didn't describe what happens if someone sends magic towards a Fidelius charmed property. Does the magic dissipate when it hits the edge of the Fidelius Charm or does it continue through the edge to the property itself.

We know that the owl makes it passed the edge we just lose all perception of the owl once it hits that edge. For that reason since the owl itself contains magic I believe you can find a way to attack the property once you are able to confirm that something is hidden there.

I think the reason we didn't see that in canon is that while the bad guys may have thought a fidelius charmed property was in the area they didn't know for sure and therefore didn't know where to attack. Combining mundane triangulation via owls gives you a specific spot where the owls disappear. Attacking from above at that specific spot or passing through that spot should be successful.

Now unless the Fidelius charm is disabled/destroyed you probably wouldn't know if your attack was successful as you still can't perceive the property.

That also gives rise to the question of if the spot looks like the junction of #11 and #13 (don't remember if they are town/row homes or single family dwellings). If I send a blasting curse at that point would the buildings at #11 and #13 show that damage or would nothing happen.

Regrettably canon doesn't tell us. Which means fanfic authors can pretty much write what they want as far as how they see the fidelius charm truly working.
