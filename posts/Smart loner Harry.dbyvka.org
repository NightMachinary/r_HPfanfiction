** Haven't seen this one recommended yet, so linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning) Harry is brilliant at transfiguration, very much a loner, there's no H/G and Hermione is a very, very minor character mainly due to the fact that Harry isn't the BWL (Neville is) and is sorted into Ravenclaw rather than Gryffindor. Really fun, really dark, well written and complete.

  Harry Potter is abruptly thrown into a different world upon receiving his letter from Hogwarts. Danger stalks him at every turn, light and dark are locked in a constant, eternal battle, and weaving it all together is this substance called magic...

To be fair, most "smart loner Harry" stories are exactly that. Very rarely are his antisocial tendencies are depicted as something negative. Usually he's just too smart to hang out with the plebs.

Linkffn(13082443) might be an exception. He's studious and a loner, not because he's a hidden badass, but because he's a nervous and awkward teenager who can't relate to others well.

******* Yea the problem is that on top of being a "hidden badass" is that is usually accompanied by the "Friend of goblin nation" trope.

Edit: Just to name one of the many annoying tropes.

******* Ehhhh idk if I fully agree with your description of The Life he Leads. I just finished reading it and he's awkward.. but only when it's not kinda inconvenient to the plot. It reads like it was written by a guy who's into anime tropes but pays lip service to not making his character kinda edgy. Don't know how to explain it---I was really interested in the magic/world differences, but the romance felt really shoehorned in. Just.. what actual super hot teenage girls are suddenly going to be into a guy 3-5 years younger with not much visible personality? It feels kinda gross

Edit: also, the interactions between Tonks and Fleur felt very weird/written by someone who had an odd view of women.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
