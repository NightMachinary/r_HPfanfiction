I have a story idea that has harry/daphne and dramione(never been a big fan of draco/hermione). Harry and hermione have not spoken to each other in 25 years until they each find out their eldest children are dating each other. It can be daughters dating eqch other or sons or son and daughter. They arent speaking to each other due to whoo they are married to. Hermione is not a big fan of daphne and harry doesnt like draco cuz of him being a spoiled rich bully. Since find out about their children's relationship, hermione and harry slowly try to become friends againWould anybody like to have the idea. I didnt know what flair to put this under.
