Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right? (FemHarry)

The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent.

  I haven't seen any of these recommended yet, but these are basically my tip-top of the fem-harry folder in my bookmarks. I second Ceplma's delineation of the the two types, these are are a mix of both. Pranking the Tournament, Son of Potter, Season of Change are Genderbending during the Fic, Goblet's Surprise, Yule Ball Panic, and Future's Past are Harry-was-always-a-girl fics. Future's Past has some smut, but it's easily skippable without removing too much from the story.

  Harriet Potter died at one year old. What was left of her slogged through life, alive in body and mind but not soul. Six years later she was finally cremated. This is not the story of Harriet Potter. This is the story of the brilliant flame who inherited her place, and her journey in the strange world of humans.*****Harriet is trapped, surrounded by humans, and painfully easy to extinguish if she doesn't keep her flames hidden. After the Dursleys, Hogwarts is a step up for her, but now she has to unravel the mysteries surrounding the body she stole and fight to survive against a monster who may be even less human than she is.One by one, Harriet's friends will find that they are playing with fire, and the price of failure is greater than they ever could have known.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

  Harriet Lily Potter was left on the doorstep of 4 Privet Drive. They called her ugly and gave her Dudley's hand-me-downs. They would tell people that she went to a boarding school for troubled young women. Dudley still offered to stick her head in toilets, and she still learned to snap back, "Really, Duds? The poor toilet's never had anything as nasty as your head down it, it might hurt it," and run. Harry was the kind of girl who came home with scabby knees, who snuck the kitchen shears in the dead of night to snip her dark messy hair short. She wondered, as she curled up in her cupboard, if Vernon and Petunia would have loved a niece who was pretty instead of scrappy, who had soft hands and never burned the bacon at breakfast.

** Two recomendations for you. The first is a four book series, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][The Black Queen Series by Silently Watches]], fantastically written but dark as fuck, seriously unsettling at times and not a story for people looking for heroes.

The second recomendation is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13318951/1/][The Archeologist by Racke]], comparatively far shorter at 91k words, but well written. It has a very condensed pace and the author's writing style is the total opposite of "Day in the life of" stories, but the plot is fantastic and quite fun to read.

**** I would argue that it doesnt, having read the entire series the marks and trauma of the abuse are felt throughout, and not just by the main character. Having never suffered said abuse or known anyone who has and been willing to discuss it I cannot say if the author represents it entirely accurately, but it is not trivialized. I will say that it is not pointless or just there for shock value but it does contribute to the growth of the charcters. It is almost never represented in the story with anywhere near as much detail as it is in the beginning, and it is treated in a mature manner by the author. As for why I am recomending this story, it has nothing to do with the abuse. I am recomending the story because it is fantastically written, original in its plot and alterations to the setting, and because the cahracters are masterfully created, not because it "trvializes pedophilia" as you said. I will not look down on a story because it contains elementa or themes that can be offensive to my sensibilities, I will look down on a story because it handles those things in a flippant, irreverent, or grossly inaccurate way. However, having givem this story the benefit of the doubt and read it in its entirety, I can confidently say that it does do any of those things I find objectionable. This story is not for everyone, and I make a point to warn those that may click on the link as does the author within the first chapter. So, to answer your question, I recommended this story because I found it worth recommending.

** What's in a Name? Or a Face? by Over.Thinking.Daily.Life.

The story is a nice fluffy read so far. The premise is that the polyjuice plan in CoS goes wrong and Harry gets turned into someone that could be Theodore Nott's twin sister so Snape has him masquerade as Theo's long lost sister. There's no angst so far and real pairing yet.
