I recently read a lot of de-aged stories, so a thought hit me at one point during all that. What would Dumbledore be like as a kid or teenager in Harry's time period? I am highly curious if there are any fics like this.


** Closest thing I can think of is Dumbledore being reincarnated as Harry.

Here is more recent example linkffn(12468148).

  On that dreadful night, Albus Dumbledore is struck down by his friend and fellow staff member, Severus Snape, whilst the Death Eaters watch on in glee and Harry in horror. Seconds after the Curse strikes him, Albus finds himself waking up in the seven year old body of Harry. Reincarnated as the Boy-Who-Lived he now has to find a way to defeat Voldemort once and for all. AD!HP

** There's an incomplete and rather short Bloodborne crossover that has this. But it doesn't delve deep into it before you run out of chapters.
