Preferably from either her perspective or one of her housemates. I'll take all fics with a Hufflepuff Hermione though.

Here are my contributions:

Thanks in advance!


** I've got nothing. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bquery%5D=%22hufflepuff+hermione%22][Searching on AO3 brings up some fics, but they all have severe red flags.]] And, wow, these two fics are really scraping the proverbial bottom of the barrel, at least as far as Hufflepuff!Hermione is concerned:

- In /They Shook Hands/, Hermione ends up in Hufflepuff because the Hat can apparently be bribed when it suits the protagonist, gets bullied by Harry and his friends (though mostly his friends), then killed by the Basilisk.
- I've read the first chapter of /The Tinkerer/, and skimmed a few more, and so far, Harry is suddenly this self-taught genius who is on the first-name basis with Bill Gates. (Nobody else gets an upgrade, as far as I can tell.) And, it's not limited to computers: the narrative goes out of its way to show how much better Harry's Levitation Charm is than Hermione's, for example.

No offence intended to OP---I just don't think there are any readable fics with Hufflepuff!Hermione that don't treat her like crap.

*** Yeah, those two fics I linked were literally the ONLY stories I could think of with a Hermione in Hufflepuff. I was hoping the community had more. Oh well, worth a shot.

Thanks for reminding me about ao3's search function. They might want to work on fixing it a bit, though. I clicked on the link you sent, and while the search terms "Hufflepuff" and "Hermione make sense, somehow a K-Pop fanfiction story ended up there when it doesn't even have either term in its tags.

**** You have to put them in quotes, like so:

#+begin_quote
  "Hufflepuff Hermione"
#+end_quote

or it'll give you anything with "Hufflepuff" /or/ "Hermione" in it.

***** Yeah that's how I figured it'd work, but as I said, neither of those tags were in that kpop story.I mean all the other four works featured a "hufflepuff hermione" tag but again that one didn't. I just thought it was kinda funny is all. :)

******* Clicking on the link you provided, the story in question is third from the top (assuming only 5 stories still show up), titled "Freely" by gramanderbae.

******** Well... I stand corrected. That /is/ pretty random.
