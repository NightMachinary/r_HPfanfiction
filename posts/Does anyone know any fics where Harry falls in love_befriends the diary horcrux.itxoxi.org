*** So I only just started this, honestly I'm just one chapter in - but I remembered your post. Try [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25440826/chapters/61701526][Dripping Fingers]] by May_May_O_O. You may have read it already-it's the only one I've read so far where Harry draws in the diary. It's a work in progress-but it seems regularly updated! Hopefully it's good! I'm going to go read the rest now lol

** I am not entirely sure but I think Moratorium had pretty extensive Diary Horcrux plotline (I believe fem!Harry called Diary Tom eye-candy /a lot/)

And if you are feeling lucky, just try some of those (just a quick search, you may want to filter them with language/completion)

** There's “a dangerous game” by cybrid. It's if the chamber of Secrets doesn't happen till 5th year. But not gonna lie it gets kinda dark at times. Definitely some m rated chapters. It's a really popular fic in this trope though
