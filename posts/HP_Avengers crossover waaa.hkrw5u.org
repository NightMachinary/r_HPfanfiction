  After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry becomes depressed. He realises the only way to escape the expectations of the Wizarding World is to leave that world altogether and find a way to a new, alternate universe where no one knows him. Soon however, SHIELD starts to detect new spikes of electromagnetic energy. They decide to investigate and so they send their best agents.

** Off the top of my head, I believe this happens in both Finding Home and Harry Potter and the Aftermath. linkffn(8148717; 8282970)

Probably quite a few more, but memories are tricky fuckers.

  When Harry finally accepted the fact that he had stopped aging, ten years had passed and he knew it was time to leave. AU.

** Not /quite/ the same plot - Harry buys a building in New York and only really enters SHIELD's radar once the Chitauri show up, at which point he readily agrees to join up - but Heroes Assemble is probably my favourite HP/MCU crossover for being well-written and not having Harry solve literally every problem. linkffn(12307781)

#+begin_quote
  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.

**** Before I commit myself to such a long fic, I have questions.

Is it complete?

Is Harry paired with Natasha? (Like every non-slash avengers fic seems to pair them and it gets a bit old tbh.)

Does Harry being there actually change the plot at all? I swear I cannot read one more fic where the same verbatim discussions are taken directly from the movies at every applicable scene.

***** It's complete (the bot summary mentions this), and Harry is not paired with Natasha. I can't speak to whether it lifts movie scenes or not as I haven't actually seen any of them.

***** Completed fic, yes. There's sequel-hooks, but the main plot is completed.

Harry/Natasha, no. I won't spoil who he /does/ end up with.

Harry (and the Wizarding World at large) being there changes the plot quite a bit, though I'm trying not to spoil too much.\\
I will say that not every change is "Harry fixes things" - the crossover creates some new problems as well.

**** That helps too. I prefer completed fics over abandoned ones for sure - I can deal with anticipation if a fic is still updated regularly, I can't deal with being cliffhanger'd forever.
