I'm looking for any fics where Ron and Hermione struggle in their relationship. They can wind up together or not, date any other character, cheat, whatever. My only preference is Harry to be with Ginny and in a good relationship so as to be a foil to Ron and Hermione's. I like the idea of H/G providing support to each character but also struggling with the fact that their best friends might not work out together and the repercussions of that.

  All relationships go through hell. Great relationships get through it. The story of Hermione and Ron, the pressures of real life, and a marriage that is tested. Real love takes work. R/Hr H/G
