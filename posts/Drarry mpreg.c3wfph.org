**** No. You just don't ask that. Asking for Drarry stories are fine, but if your looking for this crap just put mpreg in the search bar, and then narrow it down to HP fanfics, and you should be good. It's disgusting to ask for this crap though. I'm completely fine with gay pairings in stories(i'm bi myself), but why the hell are you looking for this crap. Seriously.

****** Look, it's fine to like that stuff. It's a kink, everyone has them. You shouldn't ask for such on reddit in general though. Asking for a relationship is one thing, asking for a story where Drarry has kids is also fine, but it's more the way you worded it that's the problem. If you said your looking for a story with Drarry as the pairing, and you want it to be a story that has some focus on them having a kid, you'd probably get more positive results. In this universe male pregnancy is believable, because magic. The way you worded it sounds like your looking for smut, or something. Which again if you are cool, all the power to you, but don't ask for that here.

There is no rule against this unless the smut in question features underage characters.

******** It's not about following rules as much as it's to be polite. Kids use this sub-reddit, and asking for this in the way it was is not exactly "kid friendly." Like I told the OP, it's fine asking for this stuff, but try to ask about them in a more kid friendly way. I hope you know what I mean. If you read this whole comment chain, you'd know that this is what I meant.

********* I can't see the original post because they deleted it, but from I can see you were out of line. We're not trying to make this subreddit "kid friendly". Reddit in general is not kid friendly. Attacking someone for requesting something that doesn't violate the rules is not okay.

********** Please state where I attacked him. Sure I came off as abrasive at first, but as both you can see, and he can tell you, I was being helpful even when I was abrasive. I even explained how he could get more positive results depending on how he asks. While your not trying to make this sub kid friendly, it doesn't change that a good chunk of the audience is underage, and therefore just like in real life, it's up to the adults to at least try to be a little more responsible, and kid friendly. Like I said, the sub may not be trying to be kid friendly, but that doesn't mean that we just start being irresponsible idiots, because of that. If you wish to see it differently, that's up to you, but do try to understand your audience better.

If you think someone has made a request that breaks the rules then report it, otherwise leave them alone unless you have something to recommend.

************ Again, have I said that he broke the rules, no. You seem to be acting purposely obtuse in this conversation in regards to another conversation that was ended in a polite, and civil manner. I'm going to stop replying to you now. what is your problem that you can't seem to understand that this conversation was ended without anger, or hate, nor did I ever state that someone "breaks the rules" as you seem to believe.

Edit: Also I did recommend ways he can get what he wants, and suggested alternative ways to go about getting more positive results. You did read all my posts right, or are you just picking, and choosing? If so, for what reason?

  Request threads are for fic requests, not opinions on the requested item. Do not bash the requests people make. Instead, make a discussion post if you wish to discuss the style of fic requested.

**************** And while I was a little rude in my first post, did I not make a small contribution to help with his request. Telling him how he can get results in a more positive way on this sub, and how to look for what he wants on fanfiction.net. So while there was mild bashing, I was still helpful, and offered advice. I even cleared things up with him further down the chain.

You seem like a dog with a bone with this. Both me, and the "victim" have cleared things up. So your input here is both unneeded, and unwanted. Your basically acting like the white guy who gets offended on behalf of his black friend when said friend has already sorted this out, or was not really offended. Could I suggest turning your sights to people who are breaking the rules currently, and stop harassing me on something that has already been resolved.

******** Cool. Good luck finding what your looking for. Just remember that on the internet, what you type is different from what we read, because we don't know you nor do we have things like emotions to also take note of. It's why we have */s* to mean sarcasm for example. We can't tell what you mean by your tone, because there is no tone.
