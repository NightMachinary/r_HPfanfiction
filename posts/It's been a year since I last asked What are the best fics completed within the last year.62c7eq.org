** Linkffn(Not From Others) and Linkffn(The Aurors by FloreatCastellum) , I beleive both apply.

They were both written by FloreatCastellum, whom has quickly become one of my favourite authors.

Not From Others is a retelling of Deathly Hollows from Ginny's perspective. Very well written, but I actually prefer The Aurors. It's a story set about 3 years after the war, and features Harry working as an auror with his new "partner". Now, I have never ever managed to care for an OC, but FloreatCastellum actually made it happen in this story. It does have a few references to "Not from Others", but nothing you would be lost without reading it, just a few easter eggs really.

EDIT: I'm sorry, it looks like Not Fro Others doesn't actually apply, since it was completed on february last year and we're in march already. I didn't realize it had been a year!
