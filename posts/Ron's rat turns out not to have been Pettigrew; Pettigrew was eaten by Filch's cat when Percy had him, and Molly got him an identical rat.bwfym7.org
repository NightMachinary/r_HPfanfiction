**** I think all the adults in Harry Potter are able to be bashed, barring Sirius. Sirius, understandably was distraught over his best friends' death. Hagrid denied Harry to him on Dumbledore's orders and he rushed off for revenge. It's somewhat excusable if he thought Sirius betrayed them. But he didn't even bother checking on Sirius.

Mrs. Weasley just seems blind. Harry was being forced to be a prisoner and she just ignores that. She assumes the adults are handling things, which they never do and tries to keep Harry in the dark. She bullies Sirius in his own house.

McGonagall is just pathetic. She lets Harry be sent to an abusive environment, sends him into the forbidden forest, ignores his concerns about the stone. She does nothing about the student population and the parselmouth issue or the badges. Umbridge is blatantly abusing Harry and she ignores that. She's unapproachable. If I was Harry, I would have made sure to do all in my power to remove her as Headmistress after I graduated for neglect of duties.

#+end_quote

*/All/* the adults? You mean to say that Fortean Fortescue can be bashed? Tom the barkeep can be bashed? Dedalus Diggle? Hestia Jones? Amos Diggory and his wife? Frank and Alice Longbottom?

#+begin_quote
  Sirius, understandably was distraught over his best friends' death. Hagrid denied Harry to him on Dumbledore's orders and he rushed off for revenge.
#+end_quote

And Sirius didn't go to Dumbledore himself to explain what happened. Nor did he explain things to Hagrid.

And if you mean to imply that Sirius had some sort of right to Harry as his godfather, it should be noted that /godfather/ is not always a legally binding term. Historically, it was a significant role in religious education.

Yes, it sometimes means that they will become legal guardians, but not always.

#+begin_quote
  It's somewhat excusable if he thought Sirius betrayed them. But he didn't even bother checking on Sirius.
#+end_quote

Hagrid /did/ go to check on Sirius. He was returning Sirius's motorbike. But Sirius was hellbent on revenge, confronted Pettigrew, it all went pear-shaped and Sirius was imprisoned.

And this all happened very, very quickly. Hagrid literally didn't have a chance to speak to Sirius.

#+begin_quote
  Mrs. Weasley just seems blind. Harry was being forced to be a prisoner and she just ignores that. She assumes the adults are handling things, which they never do and tries to keep Harry in the dark. She bullies Sirius in his own house.
#+end_quote

Molly Weasley's maiden name was Prewett. She lost /both/ her brothers in the last war. She knows the horrors of war better than most. To call her "blind" is frankly idiotic.

Harry /never/ complained to her about what his life at the Dursleys was like. Her sons brought up the bars on his window--but they had just snuck out, stole the car, */Illegally flew it/* across the country and took Harry. Would /you/ believe them if they said such a thing?

With respect to "adults handling things" do you refer to Dumbledore's Advance Guard keeping an eye of Privet Drive? That /is/ handling things--and although she doesn't like it, she accepts it. Remember, Molly and Arthur have /no/ legal right to Harry.

With regards to "keeping Harry in the dark," I'm going to assume you mean the fiasco with Sirius escaping Azkaban. Molly understandably doesn't want to terrify Harry with the knowledge that a deranged criminal is hunting him.

#+begin_quote
  She bullies Sirius in his own house.
#+end_quote

Pointing out that Sirius is acting in ways that could lead to his re-arrest and that his interactions with Harry have an edge of acting as though he has James back might not be kind.

But Molly has a very good point--Sirius is a fugitive, and more than once, he's nearly caught due to his behavior: Lucius recognizes him on the train station and Umbridge comes /very/ close to catching him in the fireplace.

#+begin_quote
  McGonagall is just pathetic.
#+end_quote

Just because you use that word doesn't make it right.

#+begin_quote
  She lets Harry be sent to an abusive environment
#+end_quote

Not willingly, and the abuse of the Dursleys is often highly exaggerated in fanon.

And also--an abusive orphanage or the status of a red-headed stepchild are amongst the oldest tropes in English literature.

Rowling's early works are reminiscent of Roald Dahl--who very, very rarely had any sort of comeuppance for the abusive adults. At least through proper channels of police and the law.

#+begin_quote
  sends him into the forbidden forest
#+end_quote

With Hagrid leading him--and as Hagrid said, "Nothing in this forest will hurt ya if yer with me or Fang."

#+begin_quote
  ignores his concerns about the stone
#+end_quote

She had every reason to believe the Stone was secure--the Mirror of Erised was unbeatable by anyone who sought to steal the Stone.

And Harry, Ron and Hermione snooping around was /dangerous/ to them.

#+begin_quote
  She does nothing about the student population and the parselmouth issue or the badges.
#+end_quote

Most of the parselmouth stuff was whispers in the hallways, away from the teachers. The badges were able to be switched to /Support Cedric Diggory: The True Hogwarts Champion/ whenever a teacher would have noticed.

And Snape didn't do a blasted thing about any of that either--and it was his students. If anything he encouraged it by the way he treated anyone who wasn't a Slytherin.

You condemn McGonagall but don't say a word about Snape?

And you're missing one very, very important fact:

The books were set in the 1990s, not the 2010s. Quit acting like all these anti-bullying measures that have popped up in the last five years would make sense at 90s Hogwarts. And that's not even considering the Wizarding World's culture.

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge is blatantly abusing Harry and she ignores that.
#+end_quote

Harry */refused/* to tell McGonagall about Umbridge's tactics with

Umbridge is a government plant--criticize her too harshly and Educational Degree # A Bazillion is passed, and any professor too critical of the Ministry is sacked.

And did you not notice how McGonagall stood up and declared that she would assist Harry in becoming an Auror, up to and including nightly tutoring sessions to assure he got the required marks?!

#+begin_quote
  She's unapproachable
#+end_quote

Is that because McGonagall is distant or because Harry is stubborn as a mule?

He's very upset when he learns McGonagall has been sent to St. Mungo's, as he saw her as constant of Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  If I was Harry, I would have made sure to do all in my power to remove her as Headmistress after I graduated for neglect of duties.
#+end_quote

Yeah, 'cause interfering at Hogwarts worked out /so/ well for Fudge.

****** With regards to mcgonagal I'll have to disagree. While the abuse of the dursleys is often exagerated in fanon it is still canon that harry was abused by the dursleys far past the point child protective services would've stepped in. and while she had every reason to not completely trust Harry's word on the stone but just shutting him down not only ensured the stone was put at risk but in regards to harry it destroyed most of the trust he had in authority figures, leading to his later bullheadedness about telling her things. I do agree that the forest thing is dumb to bring up though, it's the wizarding world, her idea of danger is probably as fucked as dumbledore's is lol

****** I'm saying the depictions of the adults don't match the sentiment of the characters.

I should correct that to any major adult characters.

I'm not saying people should bash them. But everyone drops the ball on Harry.

I know you're supposed to view Harry as stubborn, but the adults are supposed to have their best interests at heart and often don't act like it.

McGonagall in book 5 comes across as spiting Umbridge more than supportive of Harry in that scene based on previous characterization.

****** You never saw a bashed Hermione?

- She is not really that smart, Fic love interest from another house (often Daphne Greengrass) has the same grades, if not better
- She is a mudblood, because a witch or wizard born from muggle is a Muggleborn, and they are fine, but when they try to destroy the magical society and to make everyone act just like Muggles, then they are mudbloods (so in the end, the Death Eater were not that bad)
- She is a betrayer, she did not want to betray Harry but Dumbledore asked her and it's DUMBLEDORE, as the Headmaster he obviously knows best, (or she did it in exchange for rare books, and Harry should understand that as a muggleborn she has to do everything in her power to learn everything she can and proove she is better than purebloods).

​

Can't really remember a bashed Harry, but most of Lord! Harry or Independant! Harry are so caricatural that they could be almost considered as bashing (only in this case the bashed character wins).
