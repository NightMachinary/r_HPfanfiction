Looking for fics with BAMF!Hermione as MC . I don't read romance much but it could have some like Hermione and the serpent's renaissance . With premise that dark doesn't mean evil.


** This one is always fun, but maybe not 100% what you are looking for? Not sure.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

** I love this kind of premise, there's so much room to do things with morally-grey characters

Coven by Naidhe is probably one of my favorites with Hermione turning to dark magic to help protect her loved ones during the beginning of sixth year. It has great female friendships (I'm a sucker for Hermione and Pansy kick butt partnerships) and romance is more on the back burner.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15234645/chapters/35334750]]

Aevum Praecantatio by ditzymagic is another good example of badassery, with there being a deep flaw in the wizarding magic that combusts, sending Hermione back to the 1970s, but the timeline is not how it should be. This is one of my favorite fics because of how well written it is, and it does get quite dark, with very little romance.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10675725/chapters/23634993]]

I'm not sure how you feel about Tom Riddle x Hermione fics, but Dying is a Delicate Moment by agarariddle_andhernachos is a realistically and disturbingly written time travel fic of Hogwarts era Tom Riddle and his Knights of Walpurgis. IMO, this is one of the most disturbing fics I've read just because of how it builds up to Hermione needing to do darker and darker things in order to successfully pull off infiltration of Riddle's little boy band. Truly shows the worst of humanity lol I may not have much of a stomach but don't it lightly. Everything ties together so well and lots of BAMF moments. Darkest of my recommend fics.

** I have only finish one Dark Hermione fanfic. It's a Tri-logy linkffn(The Dark Lady Rises)

I have read it for quite a long time ago. I recall that the author have reasonable way to work the plot out nicely. (When I got through the cringe of the first few chapter as introduction, the later development is much more better). I like the sencond one linkffn(The Dark Lady Rules) best.

There is also linkffn(Lady of the Lake) i read it because of the high rating (favorite and review) but I don't remember actually finish it, twice. But since it has many favorite and review maybe it's just not my type.

Wish you found the one you will greatly enjoy uwu

  Part 2 of The Dark Lady Trilogy. With Voldemort out of the picture it's time for Hermione to step up and take charge of the Death Eaters. At the same time she has to contend with keeping her dark secret from Harry and Ron. Romance also blossoms for The Dark Lady as she finally gets the wizard she's always dreamt of, Draco Malfoy. Dark Hermione!

**** I'm sorry for the previous deleted comment. I didn't know that the Bot's reply still there and make your thread longer than neccessary ;; A ;;

I just remember this one.

Linkffn(The Green Girl) might fit to your description as well. There are DMHG pairing, Slytherin Hermione, she still kill Voldermort in the end so it's not like the Dark side win.
