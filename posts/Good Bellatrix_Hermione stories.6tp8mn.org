I've never read a long and well written Bellatrix/Hermione story. Throw me your best recs, preferably over 100k words and completed.


** linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty) has been recommended to me a couple of times. It involves Hermione time-travelling back to Marauder-era and meeting teenage Bellatrix there. I've only read 13 chapters so far, but it's been pretty good

  Are Murderers born? Or are they made? When Hermione is sent to the past she is forced to become acquainted with someone she knew she'd hate for the rest of her life. Rated M for later chapters.

** "Murder most Horrid". It's an AU with Bellatrix as a hard-boiled Auror.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** I ADORE some good Bellamione. I just finished a shorter one that isn't complete that literally had me laughing aloud, For Whom The Bell Tolls by MeltingSunlight.

Fractures by N.Blackman is a fun one but the sequel has been abandoned.

Concurrent Existences by Sephyxia is also good but it takes a very...strange turn towards the end.

** Those Gilded Chains We Were linkffn(7755315) is probably the best Hermione/Bellatrix story I'll ever read. It's slow but in a way that sets up the characters nicely. Hermione and Bellatrix don't immediately have a romantic connection or anything like that. In fact. they hate each other for the first 10 chapters or so and Bellatrix is /horrible/ to Hermione. She straight up fucks her up at times.

The author is sneakily good at dropping hints that you won't pick up the first time and Bellatrix's insanity is treated like a mental disease rather than her being insane just for the sake of it. Unfortunately, it hasn't been updated in a year.

Impossible linkffn(7200246) is the second best one I've read and, fortunately, it's completed. Unfortunately, the author kinda downgrades Bellatrix from an insane murderer to merely a sadist, using half-assed explanations for her most heinous acts. Besides that, it's another slow story that nicely builds up their romance.
