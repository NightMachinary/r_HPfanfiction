I'm fine with slash or het or no pairings at all!


** I highly recommend linkffn(2580283) - Saving Connor - because it is the first book of seven, Grey!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, etc.

Linkffn(4109630) - Changing of the Guard - is my favorite Harry/Draco romance.

Linkffn(7453087) - Pride of Time - Has time travel but is not Harry-centric.

**** In that case, there's the always recomended Alexandra Quick series, but if you're looking for /specifically/ Harry, that won't really work out for you...

Oh GOd not Again actually is that long, surprisingly enough, but that's mainly a parody, not sure if you're interested...

Not From Others was just finished a couple of months ago and it has received a lot of attention, mostly positive, but that has GInny as the main character. Still really good.

I always recomend Seventh Horcrux. But agian, if you're not int he market for humor, this really isn't your thing.

Then there's always Methods of Rationality but... That's a real hit or miss if there ever was one.

I'll just link these anyway. Mayhaps you'll be interested in one.
