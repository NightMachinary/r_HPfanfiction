Hi all!

I *think* I'm doing this right. I've been working on a small-turned-big fanfic for the past few weeks, and I'm realizing that I'll likely need a beta before pushing forward with the plot any further.

It's a Next Gen fic with a Teddy/Victoire pairing. Some elements of Cursed Child have been incorporated. It's around 25,000 words right now. Interested? PM me!

Thanks!


** I wish you all the best in your hunt for a beta.

My advice to you is the following:

Be clear in what you want from them. If they don't know what they are looking for they won't be much use. Outline your vision for the story to them, so that they do more than just proofread.

Allow disagreement. In the end you have the final call as the author, but make sure you hear them out.

Find someone who is truly on board with the story and is passionate about it. Being simply lukewarm about a fic will not suffice.

And finally use voice chat. It's the 21st century, and it is much easier to talk and hear them out over voice chat than having it typed out. This allows clarification and elaboration.

Wish you the best!
