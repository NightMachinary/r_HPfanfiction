Just started reading the lost Lupin on fanfiction.net and finding it a little weird. Is it worth reading?

*** Yeah I'm finding it hard but I keep seen it recommended so I though I'd give it a go

*** No, that's this:

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10918878/1/Remus-Lupin-and-the-Computational-Error]])

It's part 2 of the Computational Error series, so it might make more sense if you read part 1 first. It could hardly make less.
