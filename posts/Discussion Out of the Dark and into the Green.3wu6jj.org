Has anyone read /Out of the Dark and into the Green/ Chim Cheree? If you haven't, it's a great twist on the /"Harry runs away"/ trope. If you are reading it, what are your thoughts?


** I really like it. Pre-Hogwarts parts of stories are usually a chore to get through but this was good. I'm excited to see where it goes.

*** Glad to hear it! And I agree that pre-hogwarts can often be a bore. I like what the author's done with A. Black's backstory.

&nsbp;

Have you read up to the latest, chapter 15?

*** Cool! I hope you like it. Be forewarned, it can feel a little slow at the beginning. The author takes the first 8 or so chapters to build up Harry's story before jumping into canon plots.

I had the same feeling. it started slow and I wasn't sure where the plot would go. What chapter are you on? Chapter 12 is where things get moving. Sirius, Dumbledore, Lucius, Voldemort and the Tri-Wizard tourney come into the plot.

 

What I like about it: Harry running off and accidentally finding a mentor has been done a lot of different ways, some of them pretty cliche. In this fic the author takes the time to develop the relationship, it has realistic flaws, the author uses a little known canon character and weaves a good story about his history. Harry is just this kid, he learns magic but isn't a genius or ninja assassin. I felt the chapters with the muggle interaction were good. It was used well to develop Harry's moral outlook and leaves him conflicted about what he's done. Chapter 13 or 14 is where Harry really gets dropped back into the wizard world and Voldemort, and the author did a good job portraying how how freaked out Harry would be with all of these people knowing about him when.

**** For me there was a bit too much time spent on the mentoring relationship for Al to just die like that. I'd rather have had him survive and pop back up with Harry or else it not have focused so much on their life together. I've read everything that's been written so far, and the place Harry is in right now is a bit scary. he just refused to sign because they had no evidence, BUT he's forgetting there are two killing curses on his wand and he's guilty of other stuff. If they search his wand or background they're going to have evidence.

That's a fair concern. But you haven't read all of the way to the latest chapter, it's addressed.

We don't know for sure that he is dead. I agree that it would be nice to see him again. Two options: he used used an emergency way to escape (portkey to hospital or something?) or Lucius decided to keep him alive.

****** I've read everything written so far, so I must have forgotten or not read or misremembered something. Time for a re-read, I guess. I have it on update notification on ff.net, so I'm fairly sure I've read the latest unless the author published elsewhere like DLP or something.

Edit: I remember Sirius offered to delay the wand search, but delay isn't halting forever.

******* From Ch. 15

  Sirius nodded grimly. "Let me worry about that. All I need to know is if there is a reason we should be worried, a reason we should keep them from looking into this as long as possible. There are ways of stalling them, legally...There are quite a few people in the Magical Law Enforcement department who still feel like they owe me. I should be able to find someone willing to let me slip in and out unbothered so that I can delete its history."
#+end_quote

It seems that Sirius is hoping to delay the search, but with the hope that it gives him time to clear the history on the wand.

** I just finished up everything today and I have to say I really like it.

I do agree with the idea that too much time was put into his relationship with Al for him to drop off like that. I do hope he comes back (and maybe even Harry helps him get his magic back, or at least we find out the story behind how he lost it, maybe from Sirius?)

I do like the dynamic of him growing up away from the wizarding world but still finding his magic. I am also intrigued to see how his moral compass continues to evolve as the story progresses.

Overall I was pretty bummed to not have any more of this story to read lol.
