You know the ones I mean: AK-colored eyes, Lord Harry Potter-Perevell-Malfoy-McGuffin-Black, Harry more powerful than the e-e-evil Dumbledore, all of the stuff that gets mocked on this sub? What are some examples of those The Worst HP fanfictions?


** When I was a tween I loved this fic and I've never reread it, nor do I want to, but I'm rather curious at how I'd view it now. I remember there are goblins (specifically Griphook) being a father figure to Harry and teaching him Goblin customs and magic; super evil Dumbledore who's almost like a cartoonish villain - I think he put hate charms in the Dursleys' home so they'd mistreat Harry, he would regularly do Occlumency on students and fed them lemon drops laced with something; Ron and Ginny gave Hermione and Harry, respectively, presents laced with a love charm and really just wanted Harry's money; Hermione was, of course, the perfect girlfriend, and they learned badass magic together; and I think Winky and Dobby served them like these weird surrogate parents??

...I don't know how I remember this so well considering it's been so long since I've read it haha. It really left an impression on me, I guess.

** [[https://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=48][The Prodigy]] by jmcgk6 has a ridiculously over-powered Harry (starting at age 7!) who is able to do amazing feats of magic just because "he doesn't know it's impossible." Note that this trope is a guilty pleasure of mine, but I've seen this fic in particular lambasted for it, to the point that it was deleted from ffn.

Another one that I didn't make it all the way through is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136172][Core Threads]] by theaceoffire.
