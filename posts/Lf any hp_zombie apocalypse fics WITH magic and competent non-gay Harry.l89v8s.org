Why are all zombie fics with either a supergay Harry, or incompetent/magicless?

just want me a competent Harry (and co?) Running around scavenging and murderizing all the zombies. No "zombies are immune/attracted to magic" "i lost my wand and am now a muggle hurr durr" "apparition and expanded bags, what are those? Combatmagic? Never heard of it!"

Where are all the competent/curbstomp/fluffy/whatever hp/zombie fics?

Please help me find some good hp/zombie fics! :)


** Why does it matter if he's gay in the fic?

*** Its the type of reader i am, (i belive its very common in male readers) we tend to identify with the main character when they are the same gender as us. Their wins are our wins, their fails are our fails.

So when the character is gay it completely ruins the immersion for us. Because we get kicked out of the mindspace of the mc whenever he does something opposite of what we would do.

As a straight male i don't find other guys attractive, so when a male mc suddenly gushes over another male my immersion is ruined. It makes in incredibly difficult to read m/m fics when you cant get immersed into it because its so jarring.

Then why doesn't it bother you when Harry acts competently?

***** Because i can see myself as competent. its not about realism, (like there is nothing wrong with slash from side characters or even irl, but as i myself aren't gay its jarring when "i" (as the mc while reading) suddenly acts with love towards another guy.

But while competent!Harry is rather ooc, it doesn't ruin my headscape/immersion because "i" as Harry could be competent.

****** Are you competent /now/? If not, that's just as much a fantasy as being attracted to dudes.

Have you ever noticed that this sub doesn't ever get women who complain about not being able to get in the head of a dude who likes ladies? Or men who complain about the same?

I wonder why that is. Honest to God, I do. Maybe it's just that the straight dudes are the only ones who read fiction in the manner you describe, but then why is that so? No matter which way you cut it, definitely an interesting question.

This is a false equivalency. [[/u/luminphoenix]] isn't attracted to dudes, and can't become attracted to dudes at will either, and neither does he want to. However, even if he isn't as competent as a savvy Harry in an apocalypse (who actually /is?/), it's still possible for him to become such given time, impetus and discipline, whereas his sexual orientation is unchangeable.

Unless you're one of those weirdoes who thinks being gay is a choice?

******* Eh, being competent is realistic, me suddenly being into dudes is not xD

As far as i know, its because most media is male centered, so we are "used" to sharing gender with the mc, with so much media having a straight male as mc, its no surprise that a lot of straight male viewers have no problem living vicariously through the mc.

Thats much harder for females seeing as there is so little media that have female leads.

But yeah its an interresting topic, at least as long as people keep any type of homophobia out of it. I think i have tripple checked each of these posts to make sure my views came out properly, and couldnt be misconceived as "against" non-straights.

******* It's because, from birth, we were raised knowing “normal” was white, masculine, able-bodied, heterosexual and politically moderate. Anyone not being one of these characteristics had to develop another way to relate to MC. That's the famous “male gaze”. Basically, if a man read only fantasy/science fiction “classic MC” they've stunned their empathy development, therefore making them dreadful at identifying with someone they aren't. That's also why a lot of women create male MC when writing, because if you didn't pay attention you were more or less “brainwashed” in thinking only white heterosexual able-bodied male could be a leader / actively pursuing someone romantically, etc, why the default male author can give reaaaally bad description of women/POC/disabled etc..

It happens less often nowadays, at least with the younger generation, since there is social pressure to create another maleness with more empathy / femaleness with more drive, to create a broader sense of what a “default” human is if you wish.
