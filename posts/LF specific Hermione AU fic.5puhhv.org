Summary: Hermione some how finds herself in an alternate reality where being a mudblood is the bee's knees and purebloods are less than trash. I remember she's riding the train back to Hogwarts with Ron and Harry when she hits her head (or something), waking up with straight hair, make up, and two best friends that are snootier than Draco. Apparently the social hierarchy has been switched and her alter-ego is at the top of the social food chain with her good looks and dumb brain. All the purebloods are treated like crap (except for the Dumbledore supporters). Draco some how pisses somebody off and finds himself locked in a cage as Ron's slave. While trying to navigate this crazy, new world (with out people figuring out she's fake), Hermione takes pity and rescues Draco. I do believe this fic was heading towards Draco/Hermione, but it wasn't finished while I was reading so... /shrugs/

This is a bit of a spoiler alert so if you definitely haven't read this fic and wish to do so in the future~ stop reading. Tom Riddle never became Voldemort, but instead built a sort of paradise sanctuary in the Chamber of Secrets. I'm a bit fuzz on the details because at this point I was catching up on the updates and the story wasn't finished. Though I do remember Draco confessing to Hermione about how he would have dreams about her in her own world. Where she was just the bookworm with frizzy hair and enjoyed studying over make up advice columns. After that, I caught up on the updates. I believe I was around chapter 43... don't know if that's relevant.

Any who~ no more spoilers. On a side note I believe the story started with a "R". Sorry for the long post and I appreciate y'alls time and help!

P.S Feel free to recommend fics if you think they're relevant. I'm always looking for new stuff to read. c:


** I think that's "Reverse"

  Hermione is unexpectedly swept into a dystopian world of opposites where Dumbledore reigns as Dark Lord and Muggle technology and the Dark Arts have revolutionized Britain. A Light wizard resistance led by Tom Riddle and the Malfoys has been left to a nightmarish fate. Can Hermione, posing as her darker incarnation, help save a world more shattered than her own? HG/DM

** I honestly have no idea why people are downvoting this post. Do you have issues with people trying to find stories that they want to? Isn't that like 80% of all the traffic on this thread? Or is it because you think helping people isn't 'cool' anymore?

Or is it something like this: "Ooooh. I /hate/ that story! How dare this other person with completely different tastes than mine want to read it?! I'll discourage them by pressing the downvote. **/downvotes/** Urrrgggh I think I just came in my pants because being a jerk on the internet gets me off."

*** People will find a reason to downvote /anything/, just because being a Salty Severus is something that they find fun.
