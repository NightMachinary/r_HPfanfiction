Harry dies and wakes up in a bedroom. Before him is a pale woman with a collar on her neck and a smile on her face. "Its been a long time darling."

The hollows were a calling card. Her lover, the three brothers father, was part of the wizard afterlife "born, live, die, reincarnation." No heaven for wizard. So death decided to put her number in 3 items. Whoever wields all three will be the true master of death. Harry snapped the wand and he died in a fire with his family cloak.

Now Harry is fighting off a regenerating Mercinary and a Genicidal Grape for a bitch he doesn't even know.


** it's odd how frequently harry meets a hot-death but they're never a pair.

**** Ah ok. I was confused because Mercenary was spelled incorrectly and I couldn't figure out what that word was. Unless that is a correct spelling of Mercenary.

*** Dead Pool and Thanos are both in love with death. Dead Pool in a romantic sense while Thanos is more in an obsessive sense
