*** Holy shit. How have I not read this before. I'm in the middle of reading Vader's job interview right now. I think this might be my new favorite fic.

Edit: I'm further along now and getting more and more disappointed as I go. It's a good enough fic, but I'm 5 chapters in and he hasn't force choked any of the students.

edit 2: A few chapters further now. Vader is too damn nice to everyone. There's no "I have altered the deal. /Pray I do not alter it further/" stuff.

Edit 3: I'm sad now. The fic is too /friendly/ for me.

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

  The powers of the immortals combine in the one receiving the Prize. In the film, upon defeating the Kurgan, Connor MacLeod receives the gift of telepathy. What if he were also gifted with magic? HP/Highlander first film crossover. Not slash.

  Professor Gandalf has been replaced, and the new teacher couldn't possibly be more different. This follow-up to "Exchange Program" has been on my computer for years, I don't know why I never posted it here. At one point I was going to have a whole series featuring wizards from other universes, but I couldn't finish the draft I started on Archchancellor Ridcully.
