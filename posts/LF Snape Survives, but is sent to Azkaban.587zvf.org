If looking to read fics where Snape survives the final battle, but no one believes he's innocent, except Harry and maybe a small group of people. Something where he gets sent to Azkaban or has to deal with the Death Eater trials or something along those lines. It seems like most of the Snape Lives fics I've read, everyone just takes Harry at his word and forgives Snape, but that just seems to easy.

Any pairing or no pairing is fine. I don't have any issues with slash or age gaps, so whatever. Preferably longer than 20k words, but I'll take shorter. Not abandoned. Either complete or recently updated please.

Thank you!

Hermione/Snape, there's a marriage law, so Hermione thinks she's clever when she decides to marry an Azkaban prisoner to escape the duties that come with the marriage law. It ends up being more complicated than that, obviously. I read it a while ago, it's not the best HG/SS I read but it's an interesting plot and well enough written. And it's 200k words :)

Oh, and that one too [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6068250/1/Objection]] It's not Azkaban but another prison, and it's again SS/HG. Hermione, recruited by Lucius, acts as a defense attorney to free Snape. I don't remember it well but I think I liked it. No really helpful haha ! But it was in my favorites, so I must have liked it.

** linkffn(The Fifth Act by oliver.snape) He's wanted for war crimes for about half of this one. He doesn't go to trial, but is in hiding and has some run-ins with Fudge and DMLE before it all gets cleared up.

*** Omg is this a SS/HP fic? Even better, is this a completed SS/HP, over 100k words, taking place after the war, that I somehow /haven't read/??? Holy crap on a cracker! I didn't think it was possible! (Is now super excited, lol). Thank you!!!

  After coming to an understanding during the Horcrux hunt, Snape and Harry spend the next year reclaiming what they never had in their lives while playing their roles in the war. HP/SS though not rushed , with a happy ending with some humour throughout.

** Oh my gosh, I finally get to recommend a trial fic! Wish I'd seen this when you posted it, but such is life. It's a little slow at the beginning, but it's a full trial with witnesses and everything. ~100K words and complete. link(a03)3993127

*** Lololol! So, I read Painted in the Worst Light last week some time, and it's actually the fic that sparked this request! I loved the way they handled the testimonies, and the legal aspects of why Dumbledore's portrait couldn't testify, and all the legalities lol. It was a very enjoyable read :-)
