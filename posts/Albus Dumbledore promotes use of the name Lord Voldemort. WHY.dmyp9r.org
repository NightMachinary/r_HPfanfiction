This is one of those situations where the characters of the story started to behave on their own. While writing a short story about Harry & Ginny are brother and sister (to my own prompt), I wrote:

#+begin_quote
  “The story begins in the end of the previous war with Voldemort...”

  Ginny interrupted him.

  “Professor, you knew him personally, you were his teacher, could we skip this nonsense about a Lord and call him by his real name, Tom Riddle, please? Actually, I have never understood your attitude. You spent so much time to persuade people not to call him You-Know-Who or similar nonsense, but then you want to call him the name which was designed to make him special and superior to everybody else? What is the point?”
#+end_quote

I watched my text editor and I wondered, why the hell Dumbledore asked whole wizarding world to bestow on Tom Riddle the fake title of nobility. It actually really doesn't make any sense?

Can somebody explain it to me? (NO DUMBLEDORE BASHING!)


** Because he feels fearing the name gives him more undeserved power/fear over others. He thought he was helping conquer people's fear of the past or some shit.

It helps that Voldemort only took control over the ministry in the second war subverting the underaged detector (I'd assume) to watch over the word Voldemort instead so he pretty much doomed anyone that he convinced to torture and death, but Dumbledore hardly could have known that would happen.

I think we give Voldemort too little credit on this sub. He's actually more competent than the order of the Phoenix, and would have most likely killed Dumbledore in book 5 had it not been for Fawkes taking a curse.

As for why, from what I understand, Voldemort's reign of terror only started around 1970. While Dumbledore knew him as a Half-Blood, he also probably didn't have the proof of his heritage until later on. It's not like he advertised it to the teachers at Hogwarts.

Not everything in the books was fleshed out, but I don't think expanding on this would have matched Rowling's style.

**** You're assuming Dumbledore was a pragmatic mastermind without any morals.

It's been a historical reality that even after you win, you let your enemies survive, because killing them would generate more bad will than letting them go. More often than not, political opposition within the same culture group would be spared, with some scapegoats sentenced to death, usually. There are several historical precedents to affirm that (Roman civil wars, American Civil War, various European conflicts that are too numerous to list etc.)

As to Dumbledore spreading the knowledge about Tom. I admit, it's strange, unless all his Death Eaters were already aware of his ancestry, just didn't talk about it in public. Remember he gave his diary to Lucius Malfoy. It wouldn't take a long time for someone with the resources of Lucius to research the name Tom Marvolo Riddle. The fact that Voldemort was Tom Riddle wouldn't make any difference to his Death Eaters and wouldn't make the public fear him less. It might be embarrassing, but again, would it be crippling?

Of course, this is grasping at straws. We KNOW for a fact that Voldemort was terrible enough that people feared saying his name. Would they be less fearful knowing of his origins? I don't think so. They might find him hypocritical, but then again he was a monster. Is knowing that the person who killed you was a hypocrite makes you feel any better?

I know I'm playing devil's advocate here, but I don't think the easy solution, that many fanfic writers use, of releasing Tom Riddle's ancestry and life story as a sure-fire, one-way ticket to defeating Voldemort is the right one.

I think people who went to school with him would connect the dots, that's true, especially with the first Death Eaters being his classmates (as confirmed by Dumbledore in HBP).

The only issue is, would they be less afraid of him then they would be if his origins remained a mystery. I don't think so. It's one of JKR's mistakes. Regardless any deliberate stupidity on behalf of the Wizarding World, they still seem to hold onto some semblance of logic (ironically the Quibbler and even Rita Skeeter), they would have found out.

**** It is never implied, at least in PS, that saying the word "Muggle" in front of Muggles would be breaking the Statute of Secrecy. On the contrary, a wizard calls Mr Dursley a Muggle /to his face/ in the very first chapter of PS.

Which makes sense, imagine if the Harry Potter books didn't exist and you overheard someone say the station was "packed with Muggles" or you heard a little girl talking about "Platform Nine and Three-Quarters". Sure you would find it a bit odd, but you wouldn't have any idea what those words mean.

** Firstly, because it makes Voldemort mad. So does calling him Tom, of course, but the fact remains that Voldemort is very insistent that only his most trusted associates call him "Lord Voldemort" while others aren't worthy to speak his name. So putting it on everyone's lips would annoy him like all hell.

Secondly and more strategically, Dumbledore may well have foreseen that Voldemort would try to use the Taboo if he got the chance. So he wanted to close off that option to him by making the name so commonplace a Taboo Curse would be absolutely useless.

** There's is the entire possibility that Dumbledore didn't know about the Voldemort-Tom Riddle connection until the Chamber of Secrets and while he might have suspected he lacked the ability to do the appropriate research. He likely had some hunches but nothing to justify looking into them until he had access to the diary with Tom Riddles name on it and Harry telling him about what went on in the chamber.

  Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “And what will become of those whom you command? What will happen to those who call themselves --- or so rumor has it --- the Death Eaters?”

  Harry could tell that Voldemort had not expected Dumbledore to know this name; he saw Voldemort's eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare.

  “My friends,” he said, after a moment's pause, “will carry on without me, I am sure.”

  “I am glad to hear that you consider them friends,” said Dumbledore. “I was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants.”

  “You are mistaken,” said Voldemort.

  “Then if I were to go to the Hog's Head tonight, I would not find a group of them --- Nott, Rosier, Mulciber, Dolohov --- awaiting your return? Devoted friends indeed, to travel this far with you on a snowy night, merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post.”

** Pragmatism. Dumbledore wants to save as many people as possible. Dumbledore himself could get away with calling Voldemort Tom because he was a badass that could match Voldemort spell for spell even if Voldemort got pissed off about it. If he got people to start calling Voldemort Tom, and worse, it spread to the papers, Voldemort, an exceptionally powerful wizard that only lost to Harry due to Deus Ex Elder Wand, would go on more killing sprees in his rage. Basically, don't poke the bear whilst we carefully make sure that we can trap and bring down the bear.

That, and he wants people to take Voldemort seriously, but not be afraid of a word. It's a word, when the Taboo wasn't around, saying Bloody Voldemort 3 times in a mirror won't make him jump out and Avada you. "You-Know-Who" saying it out loud makes him sound like a villain known for his use of Owls, and "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named" just sounds ridiculous.

** Maybe because he chose it? “It is our choices that show what we truly are..." It is possible Dumbledore calls him by that name to remind himself that Voldemort chose his pitiful existence. Also, you'll notice he doesn't use 'Lord' before Voldemort.

Now another less probable reason... with a touch of Ollivander, here. "...After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things --- terrible, yes, but great.” To respect his abilities, no matter for what despicable deeds he uses them for?

The headmaster calls him 'Tom' when he pities him, or when he is trying to provoke him. After all, in the beginning, he was an orphan, simply mistreated, misguided, and likely to head down the wrong path.
