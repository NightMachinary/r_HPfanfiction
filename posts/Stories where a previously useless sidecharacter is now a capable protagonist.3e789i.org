E.g. Lockhart replaced by self-insert, minister fudge travels back in time, Trewalny seeing a vision that she has to participate in the war efforts, Binns swearing vengeance on some Death Eaters for disrupting his class, etc.

I love stories like these, and I was wondering if you guys know some fics fitting that pattern?


** Yes!! All following recs are PG-13/Rated M (not NC-17/porn) unless marked.

Sad oneshot feat Dennis Creevey: Cauterize. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize]]\\
Adult concepts including character death.

Percy Weasley's redemption in "The Scarlet Pimpernel": [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3784000/1/The-Scarlet-Pimpernel]] Adult concepts including references to sex, marriage, and general spy like movies. Not explicit.

Lavender Brown and Dudley Dursley star in "If I Knew You Were Coming..." [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8637362/1/If-I-Knew-You-Were-Coming-I-d-ve-Baked-a-Cake]] Not explicit.

"When Dudley Met Millicent" [[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/hp_beholder/43809.html]] Not particularly explicit, and one I come back to again and again.

One of my personal favorites, another DD/MB. [[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/hp_beholder/58393.html]] Some adult concepts, not really explicit, and is generally awesome.

[[http://springtime-gen.livejournal.com/89215.html]] Individually, Marietta Edgecombe, Millicent Bulstrode, and Lavender Brown bear the scars of their experiences during the war. Together, though, they just might find a recipe for healing.

"Classy" When Argus begins working with Umbridge he gains some self confidence and goes after what he wants. (Filch/Pince, short but sweet) [[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/hp_beholder/43766.html]]

Minerva McGonagall isn't really a side character, but this fic is always worth reading: [[http://femgenficathon.livejournal.com/87549.html]] Not explicit at all.

[[http://femgenficathon.livejournal.com/94116.html]] Again, not explicit. Parvati's Boggart is unexpected. Set in the summer between GoF and OotP and in the first week of OotP. Patil twins. 1485 words.

[[http://springtime-gen.livejournal.com/62876.html]] Includes Harry, but he's not the focus. Adult themes, but absolutely hilarious and not past NC-17 at the most.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lazy_neutrino/dogged01a.html]] Who is the mystery character who manages to do magic late in life under desperate circumstances? And what counts as 'desperate cirumstances', anyway? It all depends on your point of view... Very short oneshot. Gen, Rated G.

Another one of my Dudley/Millicent favorites: [[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/hp_beholder/9836.html]] BELOW THE BELT Summary: All Dudley wanted to do was deliver the letter and return to his perfectly normal, relatively pleasant existence. Luckily for him, fate and Millicent Bulstrode intervened. Rating: R

[[http://crossover-hp.livejournal.com/8608.html]] Prophesy Fly Feat Trelawney and McGonagall, not smut, gen, very amusing. Oneshot.

Sort of unrelated, but you might like this: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z1sDPOkHNk]] "Walk of Shame" --- A Simon and Garfunkel parody by Not Literally Productions (Just to make sure you've seen this, they have other awesome HP songs too!)

NOTE: This got out of control quickly. I'm stopping here. See [[http://www.delicious.com/marytheketchupgirl]] for more links, I dare not rec my entire saved list individually.
