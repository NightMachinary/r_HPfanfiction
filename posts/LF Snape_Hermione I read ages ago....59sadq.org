I'm on a bit of a SS/HG kick lately and am looking for a fic I read forever ago. Here is what I remember:

-Snape/Hermione -probably a marriage law fix -they have to produce children (or they have children)... Hermione is pregnant. -Shape patrols wearing the baby in a black baby sling. -they love each other.

I know, not much to go on... I've been reading tons of SS/HG again lately and remember loving that one but I can't seem to find it.

Any help is much appreciated!


** Sorry I don't know that one but I just wanted to high five you. I always support reading tons of SSHG lol.

*** Haha, thanks! SSHG is what got me into fanfic so long ago and it feels nostalgic going back and rereading old favorites.

** Linkao3(Hermione Granger and the intended vessels). Marriage law fic where they have to have children. Don't remember Snape patrolling while wearing a sling and their relationship is not exactly loving in the beginning, but the fic has surprisingly good and well thought out plot. Great characterizations and good writing too.

  ((originally posted elsewhere as "Bride of the Potions Professor")) Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.The guilt from killing Draco is bad enough, and knowing she saved Dumbledore doesn't help it, but when a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. But, of course, she's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

*** I can think of lots of fics that might meet your description, but I can't remember a specific one with a sling! If it was forever ago, I suggest you try trawling through Ashwinder.sycophanthex.com which is an amazing archive for SS/HG. The top rated fics there are terrific anyway (like Cloak of Courage, which is amazing).

** I'm almost positive this is "The Mating Game" by MamaWeasley on ff.net. I'm on my phone so I can't link, but that's my best guess.
