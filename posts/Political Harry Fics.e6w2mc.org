1) Why is it that political fics, focus only on politics. I mean, it is very Interesting to see fanfiction that focuses on the politics side of things; Wizengamot, Minister of Magic and department of what what.


** I'm not sure what fics you are referring to, but most of the ones I like that include politics have it as a sub-plot or afterthought; and while they are fleshed out, they don't focus solely on the political aspect. More like "X muggle protection act forces Y characters to do Z and A happens in the story" kind of thing.

I like politically savvy characters because... well smart people tend to be interesting. Usually a political plot in a story amounts to rousing speeches and emotional appeals, but occasionally there is some good maneuvering to be had that legitimately interests me.
