** A jar of strawberry jam was set on the table, glass shining from the windowlight. Sirius looked at it confusedly then up at Severus Snape who had been the one to set it down.

"What is this?" He asked, unsure of what was going on.

"Strawberry jam." Snape replied in a tone that implied an 'obviously' after it.

"Yes, thank you, I see that, but why?" He drummed his fingers on the tabletop frustratedly. It was one thing to be trapped in his horrid childhood home but it was quite another to have to deal with his childhood enemy as well on a daily basis.

"You asked for it the other day. I said, 'I'm going to the shops to pick up potions ingredients, does anyone else need anything?' and you said 'for you not to come back but also some strawberry jam if you're so inclined.'" Snape parroted the words back at him monotonously. Sirius frowned heavily.

"That was a joke." Sirius said.

"Do you not want this then?" Snape made to grab the jar but Sirius kept it from him.

"No, it's fine. I like jam." Sirius grumbled. He did, in fact, like jam. Not that he trusted jam from Snape, it was probably poisoned. At least this way, though, if he could prove it, maybe he could get Snape kicked out of Grimmauld place.

The next day, Harry wondered into the kitchen looking confused. He sat across from Sirius without grabbing himself anything from the cupboards. Sirius was eating breakfast. Toast with the surprisingly not poisoned jam. It was delicious. The bastard.

"What's wrong, Harry?" Sirius asked, concerned for his Godson.

"Snape just read my potions homework..." Harry started, looking at Sirius seriously, "and complimented me on a job well done." Sirius' jaw dropped.

"Was he being sarcastic?" Sirius couldn't believe Snape would be genuine.

"No, I don't think so. He even pointed out something I had written and said it was clever." Harry was speaking as if Snape had walked on his hands and blew bubbles. Sirius couldn't blame him. At that moment, Remus walked into the kitchen. He also looked confused. He sat in the chair next to Sirius and took his toast and ate some of it.

"Hey!" Sirius nudged his arm but Remus shook his head.

"No, I need this." Remus ate more of it, jam smearing on his cheek by accident. "I must be faint from hunger or something. I'm hallucinating, surely."

"What happened?" Harry and Sirius asked at the same time.

"Snape. Severus Snape. He-- I-- I mentioned I was cold because my socks had a hole in them and he went and got me a pair of his own. I'm wearing them right now. But surely I must be hallucinating, right?" Remus looked wild around the eyes as he questioned them. Sirius bent under the table to check Remus' feet and sure enough, he was wearing two pairs of socks.

"What the bloody fuck is going on?" He asked, coming up from beneath the table. He caught a glimpse of Snape at the door of the kitchen before the door was shut hastily. He was smirking. That bastard. That sneaky bastard. Maybe Sirius respected him a little afterall.

Well, two could play that game.

** I've seen Fred and George sniggering that they're definitely not planning anything, which of course terrorizes their victims. I know I should be able to picture Snape, spy and occlumens extraordinaire, pulling off the same kind of stunt, but I'm somehow having trouble seeing him managing it.

** Nice idea. You think Snape has the will to be nice to people he hates though? I think he'd rather die than even pretend to get along with Sirius, he might manage it with the others though.

** i'm just imagining Sirius figuring out Snape's angle and being super nice right back at him. They still hate eachother, and refuse to believe the other is capable of being the "better man". Just a cesspool of pettiness characterized by increasingly thoughtful and kind gestures.
