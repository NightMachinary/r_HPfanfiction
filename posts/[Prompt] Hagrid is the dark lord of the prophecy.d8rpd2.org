** I would love this. Stories where some other character turns out to be a more powerful dark lord than Voldemort (Snape, Hagrid, Ron, Xenophillius, Trelawney, Filch, Ollivander) almost anyone would be perfect

*** I just love picking on Hagrid. He's such an irresponsible person in Canon that people have a running gag he's a death eater.

Edit: I'm confused why this is offensive.

** you could tie this into a tom riddle befriending young hagrid story

and eventually Hagrid becomes voldemorts equal and then hagrid betrays his friend to gain more power and then becomes the villian of the story
