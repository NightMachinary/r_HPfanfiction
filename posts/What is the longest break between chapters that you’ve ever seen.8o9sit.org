I'm sitting writing an update to a story I haven't updated in six months, and before that /two and a half years/. It's made me curious what the longest break between updates you've had/seen in a story.

So many fics look like they've gone dead and updating after a long break brings hope that a few of my unfinished favourites will still be finished!


** Hmm, I think 8 years? One from 2008 that updated again in 2016. Basically I never give up on fics unless the author specifically states they're abandoning it/leaving fanfiction.

** 11 years - [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/704082][Switch]]. The AO3 dates still read 2007 for some reason despite the recent update, but the [[https://corvidae9.livejournal.com/tag/switchverse][LJ posts]] show the dates. I was quite delighted to get a new chapter after so long.

**** I felt really bad about it for a while, and I think I lost most of my old readers, which is a shame. Most of them haven't unfollowed but I think they're just not around anymore.

Nonetheless, I really like writing my story and I'm very happy to be in a good place in my life again and to have my inspiration back. I've started promoting my fic on tumblr and in a few facebook groups for my ship and I've gained a whole new readership which has helped as well.

I've definitely learned from last time and I keep a small cushion of finished chapters in case I lose my inspiration again.

***** I think I've probably lost all of mine, but like you I just haven't been in the place to do the story justice.

This is a really excellent idea which I will have to adopt!

** It's been three and a half years since I last updated a fic I really liked and still get ideas for, just kept making excuses I guess ðŸ˜­ It's in a high demand niche though so I could probably resume it tomorrow and have lost no readers hahaha

** I suppose I had a break of 11years? I'd written and posted a few chapters of California Dreamin' in a Yahoo group and then stopped writing fan fiction in general. Came back to it in 2016. Most of those original chapters provided the base, so sorta a break?

*** I think that counts! That's awesome that you came back to it. Did you see a big difference when you came back to fanfiction?

**** Kind of, yeah! When I was actively writing, the books hadn't ended yet so some things are new. Harry/Daphne wasn't a thing at all. People definitely didn't have the view of Lupin as a wife and child-abandoning jerk. Harry/Draco was always a thing, tho---sadly that won't ever change! We didn't know for sure that Harry and Ginny would be together or what their professions would be, so Quidditch Star Ginny is new to me.

***** And I suppose you'd have had all the excitement of the 'how will it end' fics, before they became AU!

That's really interesting, thanks.

  This is the fourth, and last, in the Code Series. In order to help Harry defeat the Dark Lord, Draco has deciphered the most difficult code in wizarding history - the Merlin Code. Now he just needs to figure out how to make it work...
