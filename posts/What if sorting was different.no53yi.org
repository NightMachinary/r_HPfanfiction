What of instead of a hat you were lead individualy to a room, empty except for four portraits and a chair. You would sit down, and the portraits would talk to you, and you would learn from each of them where you would fit. When you exited, you would be announced and the banners would change with your new house.

I would imagine Luna would seek out the portraits the most.

Would it change how the war was started? Would there even be a war?

Idk, just some thoughts I had that i was hoping someone might have fun with. :)

Edit: I also want to add that there would be a portrait in each of the common rooms to help whoever needed it.


** I'd really love the Sorting to be like an episode of the Voice. Where students have to make their argument and the portraits turn around if they like the sound of someone

*** That would be hilarious. I imagine Hufflepuff as Paula Abdul on American Idol though. She always tried really hard to say something nice to everyone.

** An interesting idea. I think the Hat leans a lot on the child's wish while it makes a choice, so there would be many changes. The portraits wouldn't be able to get inside the children's heads, which means they would judge and sort them only based on their behaviour and responses to their questions. Of course, there is a chance they would simply ask the child which house they want to get into and base the whole sorting on the answer.\\
I think if the students were sorted based only on the values (so no arguments like "because my whole family went there" and "I don't want to go there because the house is evil" or "I want to go where the friend I met on the train went"), a lot would change in the wizarding world.\\
I believe the war would still happen because Voldemort would still exist, but I think we would find different people on different sides.
