Today I was reading "Partially Kissed Hero" and while reading the part about where Harry will bring the magical world to a "Golden Age". It came to my mind that there are a lot of fanfictions where there are similar premises, but the authors really don't focus on it much. And I wanted really to read a fanfic where they focus on this kind of stuff.

And i mean by bringing or I should say renovating the magical word instead of copying technology from the muggle world and making it available in the magical world I want stuff that is to put it "New" and that is helping the wizarding world. Like, let's say they make a magical phone that is absorbed in someone's magical core and they can use it to cast a spell that looks Wandless and Chantless. And they describe why and how it works.

I am reading a fanfiction that does this stuff in web novel and the author explained it like this: "The wizards use a wand to strengthen their connection to the spiritual realm. This phone does the same and it has all 12 wand movements in it. The user can save the spell and cast it in an instant. Like these the need to use wands is eliminated. To save a spell you need to input the wand movements needed for it, cast it once, and the phone will remember the movements, intent and your will."

Anyway, I am asking for fanfiction where the MC brings the magical world to the "Golden Age" by making revolutionary stuff as I described above.


** Linkffn(Significant Digits) is an HPMOR sequel which can be read somewhat independently. Harry is a genius inventor/mastermind who uses the philosophers stone to cure aging and anything short of death for anyone in his empire Hermione is a enforcer/diplomat/face for the empire. Trying to spread the ultimate cure via treaties. Malfoy is the antagonist uniting against the Tower.

  (Continuation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) It's easy to make big plans and ask big questions, but harder to follow them through. Find out what happens to Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, Hermione, Draco, and everyone else once they grow into their roles as leaders, leave the shelter of Hogwarts, and venture out into a wider world.
