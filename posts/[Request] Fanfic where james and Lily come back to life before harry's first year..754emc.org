I'm pretty much looking for something that fits the title. I should also mention that I've already read Hindsight.


** Freaky. I was just thinking about requesting this. Any James/Lily revival fics I've read begin a few years into Hogwarts.

Seconded, I'm also interested in a fic like this.

*** After some of the fics I've read I just want to see Harry have a decent childhood with his parents.

**** Seems kinda boring :P

But if you want that, you should also look for fics where Lily/James don't die at all. Those must exist somewhere.
