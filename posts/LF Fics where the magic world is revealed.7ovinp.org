Was hoping for a fic where muggles find out about muggles find out about the wizarding world. Specifically hoping for a scene featuring the Dursleys and the residrnta of Privet Drive who know Harry reacting to it


** There's a story where hermione is writing an essay discussing how harry destroyed the wizarding world after they fucked over neville. Au. I rather liked it though it had issues.

**** Trying to remember. It was on archiveofourown and he had two businesses, called illusions inc and incorporated illusions, i believe. Harry created an engine that allowed him to levitate stuff with tech then rvealed the magical world to the muggles essentially.

There's also an iron man/ harry potter crossover where harry does the same thing. That i can find easier. Brb

****** I tried to read that, but I don't know what it was, something to to do with the writing style put me off of it in the first few chapters

******* Yeah. Bouncing Soul's stories/writing style aren't/isn't top tier. But their ideas had potential. Check out James Castle. I rather liked that one the most.

#+begin_quote
  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
