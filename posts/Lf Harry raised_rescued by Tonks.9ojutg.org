** I'm writing a story where Harry gets adopted by Andromeda after the third year. Nymphadora fills a role somewhere between big sister and mother figure while Andromeda is somewhere between mother figure and aunt.

**** I have to admit, the update rate went down in the last couple of months (mostly because University kept me busy non-stop since July).

That being said, since I split the last chapter, the second part should be done within the next week (it's sitting at 2k words right now and the big scenes are done, it just need some packaging and polish).

  Loki had never really been the type to put his own life on the line for the sake of the universe, but in recent years he's found something that's worth fighting for. Separated from his new home by the force of circumstance, he's going to have to face his fears if he's to have even a chance of saving that which he holds most dear.

  Kreacher has a special bond with the Black heir. What happens when he's abused? Who will Kreacher turn to? Is the damage too great?orBefore the abuse can get too bad Harry is adopted by the Tonks family. He gains a new big sister, a snarky house elf, two parents, and much more. What happens over the course of him growing up? How will he continue to relate to his much older sister? And how will his unique "disability" affect his magic? Not to mention his interactions with a squib, a horse, and a herd of thestrals...
