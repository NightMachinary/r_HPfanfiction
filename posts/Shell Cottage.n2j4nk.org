"It is I, Remus John Lupin. A werewolf married to Nymphadora Tonks and you, the SERCRET KEEPER of Shell Cottage...".

Bill Weasley was the secret keeper of his own house.

Is that allowed?

** One of the many, many reasons I don't like to consider DH canon is because it retcons so many things. The rules for how the Fidelius works is one of them. Another is how the Patronus charm works, and yet another is the asanine addition of how you can't ever use the Sword of Gryffindor without risking your life in some sort of trial first. How Godric could have ever used the damn thing in his own lifetime when he would have had to give it to a dark wizard or dragon and then wrestle them for it first, I don't know. In any sensible universe, you'd only have to prove yourself the one time, not every time you needed it.

Quite frankly, if that's how the sword works, then Dumbledore should have insisted that Harry keep it with him at all times after he came out of the Chamber, and never give it up. Carry it on your hip or back. Take showers with it. Polish it in the bathtub. Strap it to the underside of your broom during Quidditch. Never do something that would constitute relinquishing ownership of it, not even for a moment, because then we'll have to contrive some stupid trial that puts your life in jeopardy if you need to use it. Better to just never let go of it.

There's probably a fun fic there, if anybody cares to write it. Harry Potter and The Sword He Can't Put Down.

Because my job has me sitting at a desk all day, I have a lot of time to think about pointless things that don't matter. So I have an answer to how (some) of the apparent contradictions in the Fidelius introduced in DH /might/ work. But I want you to understand, *this is all just speculation on my part. None of what I'm about to say is true. I've created rules and assumed a system we have no reason to believe exists, to try and justify obvious and clear retcons in the story. I'm pretty sure I've put way more thought into this than Rowling ever did. Take everything I'm about to say with a grain of salt.*

I'm also being forced to reply to myself, because this greatly exceeds the character count. This will have to be broken up into three parts. I apologize in advance. Bare with me.

*** I think that there is one, single charm, the Fidelius Charm, but that the circumstances and parameters in which it is cast can have an effect on what you get out of it.

We know one thing for certain: the charm itself is an absolute. If something is hidden by the Fidelius, then it is hidden, period. It cannot be found. Being hidden by a Fidelius is an on or off switch. Either you're hidden or you aren't.

We can also INFER one thing that MUST be true, because if it is not, then there is a massive plot hole in the story from the very beginning. What we know must be true, even though it is not confirmed or stated anywhere, is that a person who can cast the charm must be able to cast it in such a way that somebody else can use it, without being the wiser about anything else. By which I mean, there must be a way to cast this spell and then "give" it to someone else, like putting it in a bottle or tying it up into an object and then letting another person activate it.

The reason we know this MUST be true is because, as a thousand indy!Harry fics have already pointed out, Dumbledore would had to have known that Sirius Black was innocent otherwise. The only way Dumbledore's ignorance of the Sirius-Peter switch makes any sense would be if there's a way to just prepare the spell ahead of time and then give it to someone else to deploy as they see fit.

So we can strongly infer that a person can "prepare the spell" and then gift it to others and allow them to cast it for themselves. Okay. So why does this help us resolve some issues, then?

The reason is because it provides a potential explanation for why you wouldn't want to designate a location secret and then make yourself the secret keeper while you live there.

We know that there is no such thing as a 'weak' or a 'strong' Fidelius. But is there some other parameter that we could perhaps assume may be a variable? Yes, actually, there is. Time. Time is a probable variable for something that could change. And here's where I infer something else that we are never told, but which makes a certain amount of sense.

The Fidelius charm has a time limit. Keeping the secret and the secret keeper in close proximity degrades the integrity of the charm, causing it to fall apart. The secret keeper being the thing that is ALSO hidden degrades the charm VERY quickly. Conversely, keeping the secret keeper FAR AWAY from the secret strengthens the charm and makes it last longer.

This assumption works with what we see in canon. Some might argue that the size of what is being hidden could be what changes, but I don't think that is the case. Shell Cottage could be hidden and the secret keeper live there. I can't imagine there's much of a size difference between the cottage and the house at Godric's Hollow. Likewise, if that is what would be affected, then it makes more sense for Lily and James to live in a smaller house and have one of them keep the secret.

So I think time is the likely choice. And it makes even more sense if we examine what was happening at the end of the first wizarding war.

The good guys weren't winning. In fact, the Death Eaters were more or less on the verge of taking over. Voldemort could not be stopped, he was as strong as he had ever been, the Ministry was powerless to do anything. The biggest piece of evidence that Voldemort was winning is that the Potters were going into hiding, as were several other families. Why would they hide? Lily and James were fighters, weren't they? Members of the Order of the Phoenix? They were going into hiding because the Order was anticipating that they would lose the war, and that Voldemort was going to take over Hogwarts and the Ministry. We were never explicitly told this, but it seems obvious, given the circumstances, that the people that opposed Voldemort were preparing to withdraw from society and form a sort of hidden society within the already hidden wizarding society.

Given that logical deduction, it stands to reason that the people who were going to go into hiding and raise children and families while hiding would want their protections to last for as long as possible. Dumbledore was likely already planning some final confrontation with Voldemort, which he presumably was not confident he could win. So when Dumbledore was helping the Potters go into hiding, he and the Potters were likely assuming that not only would this charm have to outlive Dumbledore, but that Harry Potter and his own family may have to live under the charm. Who knew for how long Voldemort would rule? The spell may have to last for generations.

So having set the stage with some inferences, I'm going to make some statements for my half-canon, half-fanon rules for how the Fidelius Charm might work. Do note, this only explains SOME problems and contradictions created by Deathly Hallows, not all of them. I'll explain what it can't explain away at the end.

- Rule 1: The spell can be prepared ahead of time for you by somebody else.
- Rule 2: The only real variable to the charm is duration. And maybe size, debatably.
- Rule 3: How long the charm lasts depends on the circumstances in which the spell is cast.
- Rule 4: The circumstances that MAY affect the charm's casting include, but are not limited to, the distance between the secret and the keeper, if the keeper is being hidden by the secret, the distance between the caster of the spell, the secret, and the keeper, and possibly the connection the secret has to the location it is being hidden.
- Rule 5: The spell must be the single most difficult piece of magic we have ever seen in the series to cast, because Voldemort didn't use it to hide his Horcruxes or anything else important, and everybody seemed to need Dumbledore to cast it for them (until DH, but we'll get to that in a hot second). This must be true, because the charm's existence is common knowledge. Fudge brought it up by name when talking to Rosmerta in PoA. Which means that Voldemort would have to be aware of it, it's not like the very existence of the spell is unknown. Page 205 of PoA, chapter 10. So the limitation must be the complexity of it. Otherwise Voldemort and the Death Eaters would have used it constantly and the seventh book would have been the trio running around kidnapping Death Eaters and torturing secrets out of them for three hundred pages.

So, with these five rules in place, I'm going to state what I think the core essence of the spell is, and then give an example of what I think is a very good Fidelius Charm, and a very bad Fidelius Charm, to illustrate.

The core of the spell is keeping a secret, and the secret keeps better the farther apart all the disparate elements of the casting of the spell are (caster, secret, keeper). Bringing these things together or causing them to overlap degrades the spell.

The strongest (i.e. longest lasting) Fidelius Charm is one in which another person casts it for you, the secret (you or something you want to hide) is in a location with a strong connection to you or said object, and the secret keeper is nowhere near the secret. In this example, the Potter's house at Godric Hollow was a very well cast Fidelius: Dumbledore prepared it while totally segregating himself from the other elements of the spell, the Potters chose to hide themselves, the Potters chose to live on a piece of property they owned and that Potters had lived in before, and they selected a friend of the family to be the keeper that would stay outside of their secret.

The weakest (i.e. shortest lasting) Fidelius Charm would be one where the person who casts it uses it to hide themselves, they keep their own secret, and they have no real connection or affinity to the location at all. In this example, we'll use a wizard who sits in a chair in the middle of the streets of London and casts the Fidelius on himself with his current location as the secret, and himself as the secret keeper. I do not believe this hypothetical Fidelius would last very long at all. Maybe a few days at most. Maybe a week. It would work, but not for long.

Conversely, the longest lasting kind of Fidelius is likely multi-generational in length. The surviving "Light" (for lack of a better word) families were preparing to hide their families and wait out Voldemort's regime, they had given up on fighting and were now trying to survive. We don't know how others intended to do it, but the Potters at least were going with the Fidelius.

This explains why Dumbledore cast the spell for Lily and James, to help make it last longer for them. It was too difficult for them to cast themselves. This also explains why Lily and James didn't have either of themselves be the keeper: it would shorten the duration of their Fidelius, and they couldn't count on Dumbledore being around to recast it for them when it eventually failed.

Now that I've hopefully explain why these assumptions and additional rules help, let's talk about how they don't.

***** If that were the case, the Dumbledore had no reason to know how they were even going to go into hiding at all, and indeed it would be logical for him to insist they not tell him what they planned.

And yet it is canon that Dumbledore offered himself up as the potential Secret Keeper for the Potters. So Dumbledore did in fact know what they were going to do to hide themselves. And Dumbledore is, until Deathly Hallows, the only known person who can cast the spell at all.

Which is why everyone assumes Dumbledore cast the spell. Because it's so complicated nobody else seems to even be capable of casting it, and because Dumbledore was aware of what they were going to do, to the point that he offered to be their keeper.

******** I thought Voldemort didn't use Fidelius because it went against his nature to trust someone with a real secret of his? Not that it was too complicated or difficult, but more that he would scoff at the idea of trust and faith in people, and his belief that his own powers would be more than enough.

But thinking about it, the obvious exception to that would be the fact that he did give his diary to Lucius and the cup to Bellatrix to hide. The cup could make some sort of sense as it was hidden in a deeply protected vault in Gringotts which no one but him had managed to steal from, and it was a grand Wizarding building which would've been appropriately symbolic for him. But I couldn't say for the diary, I don't think it ever says why he gave that to Lucius and that definitely seems counter intuitive. Lucius definitely didn't know what it does, and he didn't seem to be acting on orders to one day plant it in the school or anything.

Also, if Dumbledore offered to be the Potter's Secret Keeper (which we know from PoA that he did), that meant that someone else would have to cast the spell. He couldn't be both caster and Keeper. And if nobody else was able to cast, then it doesn't make sense for him to have offered to be the Keeper. But either way, I guess my only question is if the books ever specify or imply that the Fidelius is too difficult for Voldemort, with or without DH.

********* The charm must be too difficult for Voldemort to use, because there is no other reason for him to not use it.

If Voldemort was utterly averse to the notion of trusting other people, he would never have given Bellatrix the cup or Lucius the diary. But even if you exclude that, as DH itself makes clear, you can cast the spell, be the keeper, and even be the secret. Thanks Bill. So there's even LESS reason for Voldemort to NOT be using the Fidelius to hide his Horcruxes. He could be his own keeper, and the only way to ever find what he's hidden would be to break into his mind and steal the secret.

This is why DH ruined so much. What I sketched out, the bonus rules of the duration decaying faster if the different aspects are overlapping or in proximity to one another. That makes 'some' of the things done in the story make sense. But nothing can make sense of DH.

There are four possibilities. Either:

- Voldemort didn't know about the spell
- Voldemort refused to use it
- Voldemort couldn't use it to hide his Horcruxes because they're pieces of his soul, and thus him
- Voldemort couldn't cast it

To the first point, the spell is famous, Fudge knew it by name and mentioned it in-passing to Rosemerta at the Three Broomsticks. So Voldemort must know about it.

To the second point, we can imagine no scenario in which Voldemort would refuse to use it. He was willing to trust Horcruxes with others, so it's not like he would be unwilling to store secrets in people. And under the "new" rules shown in DH, you can be the keeper and the caster, so even if he was that untrusting, he could just keep the secret himself.

To the third point, we know for a fact that you can hide yourself under your own spell, and even also be your own keeper while you do it. Bill did it. So even if the Horcruxes count as Voldemort hiding under his own spell, that's still entirely possible.

Which means there's only one possible reason for why Voldemort would not use the spell. The fourth point. He simply could not. The spell was beyond his skill to cast.

But that itself causes problems. Bill could cast it. Arthur could cast it. We can suppose that Dumbledore was responsible for the Potter Fidelius, but again, that requires us to assume some new rules about how the Fidelus works, so Dumbledore would be able to be ignorant of the Peter-Sirius switch.

No matter how you cut this, something is wrong. Something is contradicting one of the rules. Rowling messed up. She did not think this through.

The Fidelius charm /almost/ made sense... until Deathly Hallows. Now it's just fucked.

********** Well reasoned. It's true that Bill's situation completely derails the logic of the Fidelius - what we could extrapolate of it, anyway.

I'm thinking more about how you boiled it down to the last possibility: that Voldemort didn't use it because he couldn't. Maybe the limiting factor wasn't necessarily skill? Maybe it was impossible for him to cast because of something other than complexity or power.

Canon doesn't make any reference to “light” magic as far as I know, only Dark magic. But the characters do confirm that intent powers spells, especially these more complicated and emotional spells. For example, the Patronus. Harry says at the ministry that it's the only spell Hermione, the most technically skilled witch of her generation, has trouble with. So there's proof that even if you are fantastic at magic, some spells require something different than skill or power. Maybe it's soul? We don't know.

It could be that Voldemort, being steeped in Dark magic, was unable to perform a spell like the Fidelius because it required that something more he didn't have. Not in terms of power or skill, but something like whatever powers the Patronus. Is it because his soul is literally damaged? Is it because he's evil and doesn't have the depth or maturity of emotion for it? I couldn't say. But it could explain what Dumbledore, the Potters, Bill, and Arthur have in common that he doesn't. That something more - not skill, but heart or soul.

I mean this in addition to the skill. Flitwick does say that it is a very complex charm so obviously any old average wizard that couldn't pass NEWTs in charms probably couldn't manage it, but these characters are plenty skilled. Bill is a talented cursebreaker, Arthur is basically the same thing, Lily was a Charms prodigy, and James was a prodigy in pretty much everything. Technically Dumbledore isn't relevant here because he isn't a confirmed caster of the Fidelius, only the Potters, Bill, and Arthur are. We don't know who cast it for Grimmauld Place but it wasn't Dumbledore because he was Secret Keeper and the Fidelius didn't die when he did (like it did with Lily and James).

To sum up, I think you must be right that Voldemort couldn't cast the Fidelius, but I don't think it's because it was too complicated to cast. Skill wasn't the limiting factor.

**** Now, there are problems with this explanation. Surprise surprise, most of these problems come from other things in DH.

*Problem 1:* Bill and Arthur both cast the Fidelius charm. Somehow we are expected to believe that Voldemort could not cast this charm because it was too difficult for him, and neither could any of his Death Eaters. But Arthur Weasley and Bill Weasley could. Their casting of the spell for their own uses throws a massive wrench into the 'Potters Go Into Hiding' sequence of events. How are Bill or Arthur more qualified to cast the Fidelius than Lily and James? Lily was a prodigy of Charms. If anyone besides Dumbledore and Voldemort could have used the spell, it would be either Flitwick or her. But Flitwick never gave any indication of being able to cast it, Lily needed Dumbledore to do it for her, and Voldemort never made use of it and neither did any of his followers. But Bill and Arthur managed it, somehow.

Under my revised rules, Dumbledore could have given members of the Order pre-cast instances of the spell to use to hide themselves and their families if it came to that, but we are told, explicitly, that it was Bill and Arthur who cast those spells. Dumbledore was not given credit for it like he was credited with the Potter spell. So it's an unexplainable plot hole. Likewise, I cannot think of a good reason for Dumbledore to not give a pre-cast Fidelius to Harry or Hermione for their own use when hunting Horcruxes. It's a very obvious thing to do.

*Problem 2:* Ron and Bill both give away secrets they should not have been privy to in DH, namely the location of Shell Cottage and Aunt Muriel's, respectively. How they came by this knowledge is never explained and, in the case of Ron, does not fit into the allotted timeline of events we are given, because Ron could not have been a keeper for Shell Cottage. There is no good explanation for this, it's just a straight-up mistake.

*Problem 3:* House elves can just pop right through a Fidelius secret. Ron was not the Secret Keeper for Shell Cottage and indeed could not have been, but somehow Dobby knew where to take the people they rescued from Malfoy Manor. This means that house elves can just ignore the Fidelius, which completely invalidates the Fidelius as a method to hide. You could just send house elves out to kidnap or steal the people or objects being hidden. If house elves don't need to know the secret or even the real world location the secret is located at to go there, then absolutely nothing matters and the charm is worthless.

*Problem 4:* That stupid scene with Yaxley where Hermione pitched a fit and said they could never go back to Grimmauld and couldn't call Kreacher to help because Yaxley was "in on the secret" now because he grabbed an arm and got dragged into the area. That's not how the spell works. If that WAS how the spell works, then there's no reason to show anybody a piece of paper with the secret written on it if they can just be taken past the secret by a keeper or somebody else who knows. If Yaxley left Grimmauld, he would not be able to return, or remember where it was.

It is painfully obvious that Rowling did this to stop them from having Grimmauld Place as a base and to prevent them from asking Kreacher for help with anything. But it's a flimsy and stupid excuse. Especially because there's a perfectly good reason for why they shouldn't have trusted Grimmauld that Rowling could have used instead. With Dumbledore's death Snape would have become the new keeper. Since they thought he was a loyal Death Eater, they couldn't trust the safety of Grimmauld, because Snape could have told Voldemort and the other Death Eaters about it. Instead, Rowling forgot her own rules for keeper-succession-on-death and contrived some stupid scene with Yaxley instead to chase them out of Grimmauld. Ridiculous. She remembered that Hermione was technically a keeper because Dumbledore died, but forgot that this also made SNAPE a keeper as well, and that Hermione would have known that.

*In conclusion:* It doesn't make any sense. For all intents and purposes, the Fidelius from PoS and OotP is a completely different spell from what is mentioned in DH. Deathly Hallows is shit, and we honestly shouldn't even consider the last book canon. I can make 95% of it make sense by throwing huge amounts of autism at it, but it will never make perfect sense because Rowling wrote too many contradicting events into the story.

We all read fanfiction for a reason, and this is one reason. Because sometimes it makes more sense. Sometimes the audience has more common sense, or at least better manners and grammar, than the artist.

***** I'm a bit confused about some of these statements and I'd love to talk about it more. I think we agree on the base thing: that the Fidelius Charm works with two people, by a caster placing a secret in a Secret Keeper. This means that the caster can't be their own secret keeper.

Dumbledore was the Secret Keeper for Grimmauld Place, not the caster of the charm. Someone else cast the charm and Dumbledore was Secret Keeper. He had to be the one to reveal the secret (in writing) to Harry so Harry could enter. When he died, everyone who knew the secret also became Secret Keepers - the Fidelius transferred to them.

I thought it was implied the Potters cast the charm and chose Sirius, then switched to Peter, as their Secret Keeper. When they died, the Fidelius died and people could see their house again to visit the memorial. This means that when the caster dies, the Fidelius dies. But when a Secret Keeper dies, the Fidelius stays active but transfers to everyone who was given the secret by the Keeper. Grimmauld Place's caster must still have been alive.

My question to you is: do we know for a fact that Dumbledore cast the spell for the Potters? We know he offered to be their Secret Keeper and was declined (ch 10, PoA). But I can't find any quote that says he cast the spell. I'm not seeing how the spell could be pre-made for someone, that Dumbledore made the spell for the Potters to use.

The only plot hole I see is Shell Cottage, like OP says. The only way Ron could have told the secret (for which Bill is Keeper) to Harry and Dobby is if they hadn't actually cast the charm yet, only after Harry & co get there. That was a very small window of time, while Harry was digging Dobby's grave. It could be a possibility, even if it's a weird one. But there's no making sense of Bill saying “I've been getting them all out of the Burrow. Moved them to Muriel's... Fidelius Charm. Dad's Secret Keeper. And we've done it on this cottage too; I'm Secret Keeper here”. It seems he's saying that he's Keeper of his own secret, and Arthur was keeper for his own, which should be impossible - unless Bill was being unnecessarily vague and actually meant that he was Keeping for the Weasleys at Muriel's, and Arthur was Keeping for Shell Cottage. Maybe that's why Bill could give that detail that the Weasleys were at Muriel's? Any way you cut it, Shell Cottage was the absolute mess and needed clarifying.

The fact here is that this is never mentioned anywhere. Consequently, the most natural assumption is he didn't, because anything else creates plot holes.

Anyway, leaving aside that I entirely agree that DH made an utter mess of two things (the Fidelius and how underage magic is recorded) -- I don't have DH at hand, so feel free to quote-correct, but can't a case be made for looking carefully at the specific wording of the secret?

Like, if the secret e.g. is the /location/ of Muriel's, that might not preclude Bill telling Harry either that they live /at/ Muriel's, or the fact that Arthur is the secret keeper. It doesn't help you any if you know the Weasleys moved "there", if you can't figure out where "there" is.

And similarly, the secret of Shell Cottage would be its location, not the fact that Bill lives there, and as such, he's not actually his own secret keeper. Conseversely, the Potters might /actually/ have hidden the secret of "The Potters live in the cottage in Godric's Hollow", which appears to me a much more powerful secret, but with the added downside that they had to use someone else to hide it for them.

While it's true on a semantic level (something either is hidden or it's not), I much prefer a gradual approach in practical terms: Since what you hide is canonically not a "something" but a *secret*, you have to consider what a secret /is/. Something no one knows? Certainly. Something one person knows? Sure. Make a case for two, three, a small group. When it's advertised in Diagon Alley, it's certainly not a secret anymore.

From this I /necessarily/ derive a weakening of the charm. If you cast the charm, and then the secret keeper literally tells the whole world, the magic is gone, because there's no secret to keep anymore. On the other hand, it must work very well indeed if he tells no one. So between those two extremes, there's a sliding scale, and this is my gradual approach. How this manifests in practice is an interesting debate to be had.

  The reason we know this MUST be true is because, as a thousand indy!Harry fics have already pointed out, Dumbledore would had to have known that Sirius Black was innocent otherwise. The only way Dumbledore's ignorance of the Sirius-Peter switch makes any sense would be if there's a way to just prepare the spell ahead of time and then give it to someone else to deploy as they see fit.

And just like a thousand rebuttals over the course of 20 years have noted, all you need to change to make this work is letting go of the assumption that it was Dumbledore who cast the spell. This is never explicitly stated anywhere, and hence, it's a much more natural explanation than introducing either new Fidelius mechanics or Evil!Dumbledores. I'll assume Dumbledore offered, the Potters turned him down, Lily learned the charm (from Flitwick?), and cast it on Sirius.

I'll skip the rest since I disagree with your two premises, but +1 for sitting down and /thinking/ about things. More people should do that, especially if they want to write something ... ;P

** I think this is a case where carefully picking apart words is not only interesting, but necessary.

Bill could be the secret keeper of the location of a house he lived in. Dumbledore could also be the secret keeper of the location of the house that housed his Order. Secret in both cases is the literal location: 12 Grimmauld Place, or wherever Shell Cottage is (The Beach, Tinworth, Cornwall).

The question that arises is what James and Lily did. And from what we are told in Canon, they did /not/ hide the location. As Flitwick says, Voldemort could approach the cottage and look inside /and he would not see them/. So the cottage is very much accessible to Voldemort and anyone else. (As far as the Fidelius goes, anyway.)

What they hid was /that they lived there/. The secret was, "The Potters live in Whatever Cottage, Godric's Hollow". And for /that/, they had to pick a secret keeper that was not them, because they can't hide their own secret. It involves them in a literal way. Bill's only involves a house. IMO, it becomes a trade-off -- hiding the fact that they live there seems a much more powerful secret than merely hiding the location of the building, but the downside is that it requires an external secret keeper.

Presumably, the Potters weighed the odds and decided. Sadly, they picked the wrong option.

** Headcanon: The Fidelius is an obscure spell that Dumbles either found in some dusty old book or invented himself during the first war. He showed it to Lily and James, and at that time, the secret-keeper /couldn't/ be hidden along with the secret location. After the Potters died, Dumbles put a lot of effort into improving the spell, and came up with a revised version (the one we see used in OotP-DH).
