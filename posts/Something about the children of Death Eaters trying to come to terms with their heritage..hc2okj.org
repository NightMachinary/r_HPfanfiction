I'm specifically interested in them trying to reconcile the fact that their parents were loving parents and also horrible murderers (so not something about Death Eater apologists). Can be OC-centric or about canon characters, I don't mind.

This one follows Teddy Lupin in his first year. It's not specifically focused on the children of DE's, but that is a pretty major plot point/character development part of it. Super well written and very engaging.

*** This is amazing! Sounds more canon than cursed child.
