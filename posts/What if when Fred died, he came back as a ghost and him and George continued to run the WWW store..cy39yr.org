So this just popped into my head and I'm sure someone has thought of it before but I was just wondering if anyone wanted to do something cool with it. Like, Fred constantly makes customers jump by coming out of the wall. Or George invents something that can affect ghosts to prank Fred.


** My head canon is there's a portrait of Fred in the WWW shop and the twins are still inventing together

**** Yeahhhhh.... And for the first decade or two? They just switch places, one going out of the store, the other one staying to work on new inventions. As the decades pass they create a new story: due to complications related to the potion they took trying to fool the age line trying to enter the tri wizard tournament, and an invention they made later on, every other day he reverts to the age that he made the invention. This would allow them to continue switching places and no one bat an eye when they jump a few decades in age.

As time goes on, George makes modifications to his body, adding things to make him feel more human again. Being able to eat, taste things, eventually being able to feel things on his 'skin'. Then some more advance modifications... Being able to see in the full color spectrum... Maybe add a magical equivalent to a computer to his head and use it to have a HUD. Maybe some actual body modifications... Like maybe the ability to hide things in his arms and legs? And have a passphrase that activates the body mods? Like 'GoGo Gadget!' ?

**** Just imagine it, neither twin trusts anybody else to run the store so eventually when George dies, he activates a statue of himself and also comes back as a ghost. And then for the rest of time there's just a joke shop run by 2 ghost twins possessing statues.

****** Yes! And from then on they spend their time inventing and pretending to be statues so they can suddenly leap out or scare someone by speaking.

"Hey mom, these are the original twin Weasleys! Take a photo pleeeeaaaase"

"Okay honey, just stand still. Now, say cheese."

"CHEESE!" The boy smiles.

"CHEESE!" The twins chorus.

"AAAAAAAAHHHHH!" Chaos ensues, just how they like it.

** It is a plot-point in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Antiquity Link by semprini), although it's not at all the focus of the story. It plays a slightly bigger role in the sequel, but still a rather small one.

  The morning after defeating Voldemort, Harry finds he wants nothing more than to be left alone. However, angry goblins, dementors, and a well-meaning Minister make this impossible, imposing on Harry more responsibilities than he wants... and then some.

** I've only ever read one gohost!Fred fic before, but it was very good. It's pretty funny and in-character, but also isn't afraid to get very plot-heavy and intense, so I don't know if it's exactly what you're looking for.
