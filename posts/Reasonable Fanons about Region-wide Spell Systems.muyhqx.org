Wizarding World definitely has several powerful spells that cover large, but finite and defined areas:

- *Trace* - alarms government of given magic nation about magic being performed in vicinity of underage wizards and witches.
- *Taboo* - similar to one above, except detects forbidden utterings and destroys any magical defenses around utterer except Fidelius Charm.
- *Wizarding Wireless Network* - magical analogue to radio, may require password for access.
- *Floo Network* - allows to connect fireplaces into teleportation transport network or disconnect them from it, without directly casting any spell on the fireplace in question.
- *Whatever system prevents wizards from creating unauthorized international portkeys*

The very existence of these spells seem to have rather strong implications about the amount of power given magical government can exercise within its territory. Unfortunately, just like in case of other powerful magics in series, like Fidelius Charm and Time-turner, there is not a lot of deep consistent worldbuilding to work with. How exactly those zones of influence maintained? Is there some sort of system of hidden obelisks buried all over the country that is connected to Ministry and covers Britain as cell-phone networks? Or the system of hidden boundary markers?


** I like the idea that it's based on a network of sites of power. The most traditional one you see in fanfics would be "the rune stone network", but I've seen various interesting versions - sacred groves, magic islands, and magic creatures are the ones that I remember seeing offhand.

The idea is that magic is a distinct thing that is in existence without active spells causing it to exist, with flows and ebbs etc, like a form of energy.

The network of power sites is used to capture that energy and force it into what are effectively spells gone large.

There's no Canon basis for it, but as a purely fanon creation I quite like it.

*** That's my favourite fanon magic theory too. I read about that in ‘The Historical Basis of Runic War Warding in the British Isles' where the author quotes sections of a textbook in the fic, allowing the reader to learn about it. I believe her method of magic said that due to apparition/portkeys, the thing delineating a country could not be physical boundaries like muggles have, instead it was war wards. These were powered by ley lines and the blood of the people living within the country.

** The ministry of magic is shown to have a lot of workers, yet only the Department for magical law enforcement is the only department explicitly shown to be large (Arthur has one co-worker, Percy became de-facto department head in his first year of work etc.). It makes sense if a large number of Ministry workers are spending their days up keeping some sort of magical infrastructure required to support these spells. That also explains why nobody else just hijacks them, they don't have the manpower or the expertise to do so. What precisely that infrastructure is could vary, even in the same fic if you vary it by spell. Maybe the Floo network is powered by a giant fireplace at the Ministry which needs to be kept burning and the ashes are syphoned off to be sold as Floo powder, while the enchanted bricks that make it up are constantly being worn out and need replacing. The international travel restrictions are enforced by a ritual performed each sunrise and sunset on the sea around the British Isles with the location depending on the phase of the moon. Go wild.

** It is confusing, isn't it. The Ministry has means to track most means of magical transportation across the country. Their words reach every home, their eyes peer into every crevice...

It is filled with people, many of those ambitious, greedy. These people know about this magnificient power the Ministry as a whole possesses, and yet... they never reach for it. Why not?

Because, the truth is, they can't. They can't because the very magics that allow them such a wide reach, the ancient spells woven back when Britain was led by Arthur and Merlin, when Camelot towered over the Europe and put fear in the hearts of the wicked by its mere presence... They have rules. The rituals that must be observed. Sacrifices made. No, the ancients do not allow just anyone access.

So why do we not weave our own? some might ask. We can't. The Secret is hidden, after all. We know it exists. We even know where to find it. The monoliths of Stonehenge are not subtle. Even muggles recognize them as a place of power. Even without spells surrounding the structure, they never once tried to bring it down.

Indeed, they would have failed had they tried.

It is galling, that a muggle would come closer to perhaps the greatest works of magic in the history of the world than we can, but the very same magic will bar entry to any who wield power. Any who could destroy or alter the Stones, even if the chance of success would be negligible, would be forever denied entry.

So we watch, as muggle brats run around on sacred soil, ignorant. We watch as they drop trash and refuse. We watch as they stomp on the ground that hides our heritage that has been denied to us.

Teeth grinding, fists clenched around our wands, we watch. And we *HATE* them.

/// Came up with this little bit on the spot before I saw the Flair. Still, in my opinion these things are all hard to balance. In general, if all it takes is one SI with metaknowledge and no above-average powers to wreck something, it's unstable and needs some more thought XD

So, yeah. Use conditions. My answer to "Unlimited Powah!!! Works 100% of the time except..." and then comes the list of exceptions, a couple chapters worth. Ugh. Why not "It always works, but be can't really explain to the populace why we want to sacrifice seven virgins every Sunday"

I'm all for mysterious magic, but the above seems more like "Author didn't think this through."
