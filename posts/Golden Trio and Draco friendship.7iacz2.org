I'd like to read a fanfiction in which Draco and the golden trio become friends. I'd really like to read something from Hogwarts, but I'm also open fir post-Hogwarts. Romance isn't necessary, but okay.


** linkffn(9469064) the Innocent series has Gryffindor!Draco friends with the Golden Trio but Draco is still Draco. It is a long series and the Draco friendship isn't the main point

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** Huh... You know, I don't think I've ever seen it- only time Harry and Draco are friends, Draco still hates Ron- and often in those kinds of fics where it happens, well, more often than not Harry's a Slythern, or at least wary of Ron's friendship (Whether kind or manipulative, I think at least Molly, and possibly Dumbledore planned for the meeting, after all, yelling about your secret worlds platform in front of the people you're supposed to be hiding the secret from is a bad idea- and no seats, really- after two wars and the population culled there's no other seats? Ha)

Harry+Draco slash/friendships are nearly synonymous with Ron Bashing.

*** They couldn't find an empty compartment in third and fifth year, though... Also, Ron was a nervous firstie - I in his place would have chosen the one with the one single approachable-looking 11 year old in it, too.

And Molly's talk seemed more about distracting Ginny from the imminent loneliness at the Burrow.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** Well, linkffn(1297222) is about a Harry who's gay, though it's not of huge significance throughout the story.

It doesn't deviate too heavily from the stations of the canon, but it does have Harry, Ron & Hermione becoming somewhat friends with Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, and Neville. Its sequel deviates a little more when Harry & Co kill the basilisk early and Riddle changes his plans.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
