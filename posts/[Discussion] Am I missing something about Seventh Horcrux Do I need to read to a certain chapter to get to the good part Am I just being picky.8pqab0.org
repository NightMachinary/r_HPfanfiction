After hearing nonstop about how what a good fic it is, I decided to give it a try. Despite expecting good things, I had to force myself through what little I read before giving up. The characters are all irritating, and the humor isn't funny. I understand it's supposed to be a parody, but most other parody fics I read still managed to entertain me.

I can get why a person might enjoy it, it does have a consistent writing style and good spelling. It's just not what I expected out of a fic I have yet to see someone badmouth, despite being recced many times in a subreddit with very diverse opinions.

So as to my question, is there some part of it I'm just not getting? Does it "get good" at a certain point? Given how often I see it recced I'm inclined to believe there is some redeeming factor to it I haven't seen.

If I'm not just being picky (which I fully admit I might be), and there's people out there who also didn't like it, why didn't you? What were your biggest beefs with it?

Thanks!


** I think that it's all about the mindset when reading it. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, should be taken seriously. At best, Seventh Horcrux is a crack-fic that should be read late at night when you're so exhausted that your sense of humor is warped to Hell. This is coming from someone who has it on their favorites list.

** Most people find it funny from chapter 1, so no. It sounds like you simply have a different sense of humour to 95% of the population.

I wouldn't say that you're being "picky", as this would imply holding the story to higher standards. Sense of humour is more of a personal taste thing than a matter of standards.

** Plain and simple, it's juvenile, silly, and stupid. Some people find that funny, others don't. Just because someone recommends a fic, doesn't mean that you will like it. And that's perfectly OK. It's the same with Black Comedy, I'll go back and re-read them when I want something light and easy to read that will make me chuckle a few times. The problem that I see most often on here is that they're so popular and so hyped up that people expect a comedic masterpiece when those stories are pretty much just potty humor.

** Where are you up to? It only started getting good until later, I sort of skip the first chapter every time.

It's funny, that's why I like it. It's not particularly deep humour but it is funny all the same. It also is a surprisingly happy story, so not only is it funny it has that 'feel good' quality.

*** I got to chapter three. My breaking point was the part about Harry deciding Lockhart was legit, which, if we take his statement of "a small amount of research" to be true, means the Lockhart was not actually a fraud in Seventh Horcrux, which is a grave offense to me. The only time I've ever accepted a Lockhart who's not a fraud is in Unspeakable Things, where it is a major plot point, and also an au where the background of many adult characters was changed. To have Lockhart be not a fraud for literally no given reason would be like having Hermione be declared a pure blood in her introduction to Harry/the reader, or changing Molly's name to Monica. To be fair, the logic is dependant upon actually believing Harry did good research, and isn't just being fooled like everyone else.

Granted, I wasn't enjoying the story at all up to that point, so that was just the straw on the camels back.

**** Ok, it sounds like you might be missing an important part of the story. Almost all the humor of Seventh Horcrux is based on Harry being an unreliable narrator. He makes bad reads or misunderstands things, but is massively overconfident about his own misunderstandings, and then when it seems like he might be wrong he refuses to see it, no matter what it takes.

Lockhart is not legit, Harry is totally wrong and then twists himself up trying to keep himself and everyone else from seeing it.

This might not be your cup of tea. I found it literally laugh out loud hilarious at points, but it's not for everyone.

****** It comes in a late chapter why, i believe as an authoros note. Riddle was brilliant. Riddle was a mudblood in slytherin. Asking questions would be bad. So he had to accept that a pureblood would know what hes talking about even if it seems wrong to riddle. Thus, he accepts others words as truths and as he says, when he does a 'little' research, that research is the thesis of whatever he's looking up. So his research of lockhart was esssentially reading the dustjacket of a lockhart book and accepting those as truths,

Oh no, it's so much better. He read them cover to cover, immediately noticed the timeline discrepancies, and decided that, since Lockhart had to be legit, that meant he was capable of powerful magic that would let him be in multiple places at the same time.

**** He definitetly was still a fraud in Seventh Horcrux. The joke is that Harrymort doesn't know everything and often comes to very wrong conclusions (this is a running theme of the story actually, Voldemort is the same), in fact I'm pretty sure his so called research is reading Lockhart's books.

But for me I was really enjoying it by about half way through Chapter 2, so it probably is just something that doesn't sit with your sense of humour perhaps? I don't particularly like all of the often linked funny stories.

**** One hilarious part of this fic lies exactly in that Harrymort is often completely wrong, even if his reasoning sounds about right. For example:

#+begin_quote
  Ah, Severus, my most loyal servant. It was good to see that, even a decade after my disappearance, he continued to attack my enemies. I suspected this would negatively impact my Potions grade, since I currently was one of my enemies. Nevertheless, his devotion was admirable.
#+end_quote

Furthermore, that conclusion is likely what canon Voldemort would have drawn.

He would often spread false rumors, only to believe in them later himself. But because he had Voldemort's skills, he would accomplish amazing feat and make people believe in him.

** I'm pretty sure I only laughed twice while reading the whole thing but the experience was worth it because at those points it had me rolling. Harry trying to get into the triwizard tournament and how the house elves came into that scene just had me dying. I generally enjoy that kind of power fantasy stuff though so the fic had a bit more to offer than just the laughs. Give it a few chapters and if you're still not feeling it, move onto another fic imo. There's some really great ones out there so wasting time on a fic you're not enjoying would be a real tragedy

Finally someone who feels the same. I needed about 10 attempts before I was able to finish this fic. But I really wanted to get through it and be able to say that I read it, because it gets recommended so much.

It doesn't do anything for me. I didn't think the main joke was very funny in the first place, but the fact that every chapter is basically a play on the same joke ("haha, he's Voldemort and acting crazy, yet no one realizes and he has minions") really killed it for me.

Usually I don't have a problem with silly and juvenile humor, but that fic didn't even make me chuckle.

** The seventh horcrux is like mcdonald's French fries. It's crap and we know it is but it feels good going down.

It hits a lot of cliches, doesn't diverge, and is a Harry instant power up.

But it's grammatically fine has some ‘satisfying' *bashing without going over the top.

Not one of my favorites but its worth mentioning.

*bashing isn't my thing but it was light enough to ignore.
