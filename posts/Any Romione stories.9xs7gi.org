They seem to be quite rare. Are there any good ones?


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]] linkao3(6701647) is really a trio fic, but Ron and Hermione are a couple in it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7945354][The Dark Lord Never Died]] linkao3(7945354) definitely has more plot than romance, but it's quite a good read.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14818256][the end came as a cold shock to a pocket full of rocks, to a mouth full of water]] linkao3(14818256) is set in the Voldemort-wins timeline in /Cursed Child/, so don't expect it to be cheerful.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3955920/HalfASlug][HalfASlug]] has several Ron/Hermione fics, most of which are fluffy. My favorite is probably [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8187634/1/The-Night-Before-Christmas][The Night Before Christmas]] linkffn(8187634).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7562379/1/Australia][Australia]] linkffn(7562379) is set after the war and follows Ron and Hermione going to Australia.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
