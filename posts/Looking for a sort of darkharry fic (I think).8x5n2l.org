Hey there! So a while back, I was reading this fanfiction that I'd really like to find again. I don't have a whole lot of information about it, but any help would be appreciated. I believe this is a pro-dark side, Dumbledore bashing fic (I know, it's a guilty pleasure. Sue me.) where Harry becomes close with “Moody” in his fourth year. I do know that Dumbledore had been altering Harry's memories and they realize that Harry is somehow a natural parselmouth which has the effect of it sort of being his first language in his mind. He and Moody work together to find the altered memories by locating the ones that are in English as opposed to parseltongue. Again, any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance. :)
