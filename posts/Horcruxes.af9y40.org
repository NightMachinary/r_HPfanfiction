What is your favorite take on how Horcruxes are made? The step-by-step, I mean, not just the general, Voldemort had to kill people to do it.


** I don't think I have a particular favorite take, but I do have to say that if the author doesn't go the canonical way, I prefer the evil committed to be terrible but simple. No sacrificing a 10 year old virgin, bathing in their blood, eating the corpse, then shitting on the kid's grave.

*** I feel like overly explicit atrocities usually have the opposite effect on me because, at some point, it stops feeling believable. I mean, who would even invent a ritual where you had to rape a child, eat her nipples and then take a dump on her corpse precisely during the Winter Solstice? Or liquify half of London and then use the goo as skin lotion? Killing a dozen or so people sure, but when you require the population of a small country as a sacrifice, that does not seem feasible before the 20th century.

The "Black Queen" series lost me over this. Murder and rituals for sure, but the whole "black magic" seemed exaggerated as if taken from a crackfic.

*** What's interesting is most of the things we see are speculation, because there isn't really a canonical description of the exact process. Apparently, Rowling did write how to make one, but it was so vile they didn't put it in. Like it's reported her editor felt nauseous at the idea of it. Makes one think about what exactly is involved because all we have to go on is cold-blooded murder is necessary.

** I prefer that the only 'evil' action involved in creating the horcrux is murder, with the remainder of the process being some sort of complex magic ritual. I like the way [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest][Blood Crest]] handled it, where splitting the soul requires acceptance of an innately abhorrent act, but not necessarily killing a human. In that fic killing a unicorn accomplishes the same thing.

I've read a few stories in which creating a horcrux requires eating the heart of the person killed, but to me that just seems like the author is stretching for something visceral to horrify the reader because apparently murder wasn't enough to do the trick. To me that seems gratuitous and doesn't really fit with the intent of the magic.

*** It also makes it impossible for Tom Riddle to have gotten away with it if he had to cut out his first victim's heart.

**** Many fics go with the idea that Riddle's first horcrux was created when he killed his father. In that case he framed Morfin, so the condition of the bodies wouldn't matter.

** Do you mean ways to make a Horcrux or the actual process on how the soul is fractured?
