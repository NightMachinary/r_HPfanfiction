  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

**** You should stop, then, if you're not enjoying it; it was the wrong link. Problem /of/ Potions is dryly hilarious :). Also has a very well done Snape redemption arc.

Technically Harry is not a genius at potions; quite the reverse. He just loves them, and is too stubborn for Professor Snape to stop him from learning about them.

** I love it when Harry's great at potions. My favourite part of C'est la Vie by cywscross is this exchange. Though he's not really a potions prodigey just a 19 year old Harry in a 14 year old body.

#+begin_quote
  "The boy is competent in Potions," Was the first thing Severus said when Lily opened her mouth to ask. He knew she had wanted to quiz him about Hadrian Evans ever since she realized he would be teaching the boy today. "He answered my questions with sufficient detail and brewed a flawless Wound-Cleaning Potion in class."

  Lily did a double-take. "Wound-Cleaning? That's a medical potion and one not touched on until sixth year. You had your entire class brew a sixth-year potion?"

  Severus scoffed. "Of course not. A class of dunderheads brewing something far beyond their reach all in one room? Enough explosions happen when they brew something simple. I told them I would assign them different potions to brew. Most of them prepared Pepperup, and a select few made Murtlap Essence. Evans was the only one to brew a Wound-Cleaning Potion."

  Severus' lip curled. "Quite, and he spent most of that time simultaneously holding a conversation with Granger while making sure Longbottom and Weasley's potions didn't melt their cauldrons. As a result, both of them turned in borderline adequate potions today. I am uncertain whether I should keep them together or separate them."
#+end_quote

I agree with tpyrene about /Sarcasm and Slytherin/ fifth year Harry is pretty incredible with potions. In the first potions class of the year he makes adjustments to improve the potion he's working on and he helps Dean Thomas and Neville fix their own potions after they've made mistakes.
