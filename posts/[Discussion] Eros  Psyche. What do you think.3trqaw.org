I started this fic because I found it as smut fic in an archived post here.

But, as I read the first two chapters, I realized the author had really developed the story. That is, actual character development of the characters. You don't see that in a simple smut fic.


** I really like Eros & Psyche! The smut is , well , smut -- can't comment on that too much. The plot is really intriguing, and yes there is one! There's a whole lot of character too, and the relationships that form. I originally went into this knowing that it would lead to a Dramione romance (and not hate/love relationship), so I expected the same for the other pairings, but things actually take a turn for the darker side and it's not in the form of drama. There was a particular scene later on that really, really creeped me out.

I wish the author updated more though -- and I also really liked another one of her fics, a Scorpius/Rose and Draco/Hermione fic (can't remember the name) where the Malfoy line is a Veela line XD

*** I came here to say this. I'm reading it right now and I find myself skimming through the porn to get to the plot, which is a nice change. I'm excited to see where this goes.

** Its honestly one of the best smuts I've ever read. I'm impressed about the character development and how they're applied. Not with all characters, mind you. I find Nott and Seamus are unnecessary and I skipped their chapters.

The most amazing thing is that this is (maybe the only) fic where I find Hermione and Draco to be somewhat believable.

Its definitely worth recommending if someone asks for smut with plot.

*** Some of the scenes are tied to the plot -- id suggest skimming at least or you'll find yourself a bit lost in the later chapters. As I mentioned in a comment above, GinnyBlaise has a bit of plot tied to TheodoreDaphne.

** Despite the silliness of the whole idea the smut is quite decent! There was this one chapter where Draco spills his seed on her down there and massages the cum into her and that was freaking hot to read XD

** I only read the HerimioneDraco, HarryTracy, GinnyBlaise and interlude parts, unless they mentioned something interesting in these parts. Reason is that I cared little to none for all the others. What interested me the most and set this fic appart, other than the above average smut, was the HarryTracy relationship and the canon compliant and quite possible past. I also found it interesting how that Ginnys past with the CoS came into play, most fics just ignore that part of her past, but here it really made her.

Edit: Spelling error

Canon compliant. Canon complacent gives me weird mental pictures. Messing with my reading comprehension...

**** Alright, I might skim those two pairs again. (Especially since I've warmed up to Daphne, back then I was new to fanfic and really disliked Daphne because I couldn't place her in the books or movies.)

***** If it's any consolation they are my two least favourite as well -- hate the accent the author writes Seamus with, and I'm not a fan of femdom but at least this femdom isn't --- ball-busting kinda thing (I know, it's a rather broad generalization but that's generally what comes to mind). I think there isn't much in the LavSeamus part, think the only thing you need to know is Seamus's secret and also Lav cut herself with the card at some point? (I think all the girls do. I really wish they'd update so I can find out the significanceeeeee)

****** I'd totally forgotten about the LavSeamus parts, i think i just skipped them because i wanted to get to the next chapter about a pairing a cared about. Anyway,s it's years since I read it, so there's likely much more than i remember.
