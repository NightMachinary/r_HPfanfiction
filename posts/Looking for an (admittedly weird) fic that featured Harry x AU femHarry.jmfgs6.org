I think it was on AO3, and the tag I was searching under was “Female Harry Potter?” It was most likely complete, but I never actually read it for obvious reasons because that's just weird. Searching for it because my friend asked me if I'd read any fics featuring multiverse AU meets canon fics, and I mentioned it as a joke an now I kinda want to read it to see how weird it is.


** Was it linkao3(The Rose Paradox) it's honestly not bad little weird but I believe the AO3 version has artwork by the author included as well.
