I'm currently working on a new chapter for my fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28119780/chapters/75170184#workskin][Hbi Hr At]] and I'm doing a paragraph where Harry sarcastically refers to himself as the nicknames that the papers gave him after the war. Common ones that I've heard in other fics are the "Man-Who-Conquered" or the "Boy-Who-Lived-Twice" but I need another one but I can't think of anything!

Here's the paragraph that I'm mentioning it in:

#+begin_quote
  Professor Flitwick started class just as he remembered---by taking roll call. He listed through everyone alphabetically and Harry internally cringed in embarrassment when the small man reached his name. Flitwick gave an excited squeak right before he spoke Harry's name and he nearly toppled off his stack of books, just managing to catch himself on his desk before he fell. Harry could feel it as numerous students, both Slytherins and Hufflepuffs alike, turned to gaze at him when he stated that he was present.

  He was glad for the practise of hiding his discomfort because the gazes did not leave him for rest of the morning. It was just like it had been Before, when he'd first entered the wizarding world, and then after Voldemort's defeat and everyone wanted to get a glimpse at the "Man-Who-Conquered" or the "Boy-Who-Lived-Twice" or Harry's favourite, "*blank*."

I'm having trouble deciding between something positive or something negative like "dark lord in training" or something like that.

** Technically, he got this nickname during the war, but I guess "The-Chosen-One" could fit. Or maybe "The Desirable NÂ°1" as a call back of "Undesirable NÂ°1" of DH.

** That-Bastard-Who-Just-Won't-Die is one of my favourites if Harry is being particularly self deprecating. Or just The-Man-Who-Didn't-Die.

The Protector

The Saviour (of the wizarding world)

Fate's Bitch

The last one is a joke between friends mostly.

I'm suffering from sleep deprivation so I can't think of more, but if I have a sudden burst of creativity I will leave whatever my mind comes up here.

** The Wizengamot was being a collection of obtuse asshole's again, and one of them had the temerity to ask him, "Who the hell do you think you are?!"

Harry started at the one who spoke for a moment before responding, "I am The Boy Who Lived, the Youngest Seeker in a Century, Basiliskbane, Dementor's Terror, Tri-Wizard Champion, The Chosen One, Undesirable Number One, The Man Who Conquered, Stormwing and Master of Death. I am Harry fucking Potter."

** You could go comedy and say the Harry favourite was "the favourite of witches". After all, if the guy won and beat up the Big Baddie, the witches was going crazy on him.
