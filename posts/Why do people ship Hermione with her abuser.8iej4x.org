** Why do people ship Hermione with the guy who calls her a filthy mudblood and threatens her and her friends every time they cross paths?

I don't understand why people ship her with Draco even though he thinks she's shit.

(First time counter trolling- how'd I do?)

** You think Ron is an abuser?

Why?

They bicker, but all couples do that sometimes. What have you seen in canon that makes you think the relationship between them would be an abusive one?

*** It would be, just not in the direction most people think. A smart, strong woman married to a slacker is going to lose her patience eventually and, without once ever having a recognisable change in her character, become someone her younger self would entirely /despise/.

**** Is he a slacker though?

He wasn't as particular about schoolwork as she was (though really, no one at Hogwarts was as particular as she was) but I never got the impression Ron lacked inner drive for the things he really wanted.

In the canon timeframe he often serves as a foil for her when she's at her most anxious too, even if it's only by giving her another target to vent at rather than fretting herself into knots. I could see him fulfilling a similar grounding role for her as a partner - Hermione grows up to be this brilliant, driven woman, and Ron gives her somewhere solid to return to so she can recharge before doing it again tomorrow.

***** Yes, he's a slacker. Being a slacker doesn't mean you don't ever try to do things, it means in general you take the easy way out, namely on things you don't care for even if they're important (e.g. school). That said, it's hardly the worst character trait, though I'd agree (and JKR appears to as well) that overall he's not a good match for Hermione, but then again there's fanfiction for that.

** Please stop. I don't like Ron as a character at all, but no. He can be pretty mean, but "abuser" is over the top.
