One of my favorite things about this author is that she was able to make a collection of fics that are all part of a bigger universe.

It basically takes after the end of book 6 and goes from there and into the future (15 years later). Since there are multiple stories, the author jumps/skips around with time, and since it started before DH came out, the names of the kids and such are different. It's a darker take Hermione and Ron, but it's great because it does a really good job at making some flawed, strong characters who have had death and war affect them -- but ultimately love prevails. Plus, it gives some great, different perspectives on some other characters - the twins, Viktor, etc.

Here's the link on [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/678195/Chanel19][fanfiction.net]] It could also be found on checkmated (where I first read it), but there are quite a few NC-17 chapters that are restricted to those with accounts.

*The order of the fics are:*

- Turn and Face the Strange
- The Only Boy Who Wanted Me the Way That I Am (This is a Harry/Ginny one shot, it doesn't add anything to the R/Hr story line, or the rest of the story, so it can be skipped)
- Auld Lang Syne,
- Lead Me Through the Fire
- Wedding Arrangements
- Seasons Out of Time
- The Dueling Club
- The Shower
- The Price You Pay
- All's Well That Ends Well
- A Cry in the Night

** Proud to have recognized the tea in "lead me through the fire." Does that make me honorary English?
