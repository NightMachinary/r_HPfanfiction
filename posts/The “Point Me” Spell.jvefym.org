What pisses me off in a fanfic, is the incredibly common misuse of this spell. It's used in most stories to find any object. That's just wrong. It was only used in the 4th book, and is actually called the ‘four points' spell. It just acts as a compass. Your wand points North. I don't understand why people think it's a magical GPS or something.


** Agree but the Summoning Spell/Accio in canon has a lot of intelligence including summoning objects you don't know the precise location of (fishing in DH; twins summoning their broomsticks in OotP; Hermione summoning Horcrux related books from Dumbledore's office in HBP). So maybe a spell which does the inverse (take me to x not bring x to me) isn't a big departure?

** As a writer I have seen more than one smarmy review along the lines of 'this is stupid, has Harry never heard of the Point Me spell?' when it's a plot point that he's searching for some McGuffin.

I must have missed the but in Deathly Hallows when they quickly and easily located all the horcruxes using that spell.

*** Horcruxes are protected against a variety of spells, we know that you can't summon them for example.

Of course it's literally just a compass, but this also explains why there's not some other spell to detect them with (there are other spells for tracking stuff).

** I would probably say it's a basic compass without a filter (ie you cast the spell, it will hit each cardinal direction before facing north or just point straight north), but it could potentially be tweaked with a modifier, said modifier will point towards either another cardinal direction (east, say) or possibly a known object (my keys), it can't show where an unknown item is and it only gives a direction, not a distance so to find things you'd have to triangulate and even then it's going to be in x square miles of area until you start getting close enough to narrow the field.

Granted it would probably take quite a bit of poking the 'spell code' to figure out how to get it to indicate an object and said object would have to be something the caster is familiar with since doing a vague 'point me keys' would likely just indicate the nearest set while 'point me my keys' could find their direction, not location, from your position.

It might be more viable to mod the spell for landmarks than objects actually, after all, 'point me Hogwarts' would make more sense for a directional spell than 'point me horcrux', particularly when you've no clue /what/ the latter might be, much less where, at least a static location can be viably tracked.

** In my opinion, it's ok to think of such in a fanfiction. It's all imagination using Canon works, no need to stick to every aspect of Canon.

But of course, if they start saying that this was true in Canon too, then a discussion needs to be scheduled. Other than that, it's artistic liberty. Any fiction is basically AU, so you can't tell them it's wrong. It's their universe, they developed that spell accordingly.

*** Yeah.

I personally think an easy "Point Me" charm to find anything is too simple.

I envision there are probably, if such charms exist, at least two. One for personal items you've lost, as they're 'yours', and the other needs something linked to what you're looking for. Blood or hair to find a person, maybe, or for an object, something that's been close to it a long time. Sheath to find a sword, or a bit of its tassel, and so on.

**** That's perfectly fine, people can like what they want as far as I'm concerned. But a vocal minority of people get indignant when people don't conform to their personal headcanon and try correcting people on what a Harry Potter fanfic is suppose to have, often under the assumption that they're reciting material straight from the books which isn't the case.

Case in point, fanon spells like Tempus and warming charms. Near as I can tell neither of those are things that exist in Harry Potter proper, but if I wrote that Harry wore a watch or got hypothermia while playing Quidditch, I guarantee I'd get a few comments asking about why either of those things would happen when there should be spells for that.

Basically, I just think people should do a little research before they try correcting someone.

** The way I see it, you are talking about two different peces of magic here.

#1: Four-Points Spell. It points to the arbitrary direction of 'North' (because wand is not a magnet, spell probably determines position as compared to an anchor, or arbitrarily instead of using muggle science.)

#2: Point-Me Spell. AU invention, a derivative piece of magic that points toward a specified object, unless unplottable. Shares similarities with post owl magic and summoning spell.

*** The incantation for the Four-Point Spell is "point me," so they are NOT two different spells.

But that could also lead to the rant on writers who can't differentiate between the NAME of a spell and the WORDS of the spell (for example, the Imperius curse vs "imperio"), which leads to the whole parselmouth/parseltongue issue. That way lies madness.
