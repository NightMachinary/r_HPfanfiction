** I've been wanting to join for a while now, but the atmosphere of the place unnerves me. I've heard one too many horror stories about people being run out to be super comfortable with it going in I think. That being said, it does seem like a solid community to get feedback from and to connect to others within.

*** DLP has a reputation for quality. Some view that as unpleasant or exclusionary. Given the quality of your comment, I doubt you'd truly have an issue. DLP's #1 rule is to speak intelligently. Under that umbrella is the requirement to use proper English and to back up/expand upon comments.

DLP is harsh on newbies. We only want the quality contributors to be posting, and not posting for the sake of access to our Work by Author section. The "WBA" section is for authors to workshop their unpolished works with a small component of showcasing. Authors generally syndicate finalized works to FFN/AO3.

To summarize:

- be smart
- don't be brief
- read stickies and lurk

**** Thank you for the helpful and informative reply!

My biggest concern is simply that I'm afraid I may mess something up without realizing it, even after having read the stickies and various rules posts. Even someone who has memorized a driving manual can still make mistakes driving, for example. And DLP seems to punish infractions harshly, even if they are overall benign or a first offense. This is a fair process considering how poor in quality some content can be on forums if they aren't carefully curated, but it still makes me leery to interact starting out.

I'll definitely be willing to try though. DLP has a good mission statement in regards to its search for only quality discussion, and that appeals to me.

***** Banned users usually leave out the warnings they were given or the many 3-word posts in a row. It honestly does not require much effort so long as you're able to focus for longer than a minute.

The staff is not unyielding or unsympathetic. You will receive warnings before being removed. We often reverse bans upon appeal given recognition of the problem. Though, ignoring the stickies in the politics section is an excellent one-way ticket out of the forums. Additionally, creating alts to get around bans also lead to further bans.

One of the most common "punishments" handed down is removal of access to WBA for a short period of time for users quite obviously posting just to read stories. Some users consider this a "ban" as well, despite having full access to the rest of the forums.

I would like to dispel the myth that DLP is made up of entirely curmudgeons. We fully accept that we need new blood to continue to thrive. Our policies may seem extreme compared to forums with absolutely zero quality control; we'd rather have less users and better content than pages of crap. We do have threads/forums dedicated to pages of crap (e.g. Mafia games, status updates, etc.), but that's in an effort to quarantine that behavior and leave the rest of the forum with quality content.

It's becoming clear to me that DLP's ethos could be better explained to new users in a way that cannot be ignored.

You were given a 2 week tempban as you ignored the requirement to make /quality/ contributions written in proper English. This requirement was clearly specified in both the welcome PM as well as in a large font at the top of every screen on the forum.

It was clear to us you had only come to read HPBWL and not contribute to the discussion in any meaningful manner. If this isn't the case and you'd like to try again, let me know and I'll lift the temporary ban.

**** One easy tip: use capitals and don't use internet slang like "tbh". Posters are expected to write in proper English.

Other than that, the main requirement is to make sure your posts add something substantial to discussions. Don't post opinions without giving justification, for example.
