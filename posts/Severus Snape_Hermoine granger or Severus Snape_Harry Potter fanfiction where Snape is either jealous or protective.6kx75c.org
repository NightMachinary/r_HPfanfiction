** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/714361][Cambiare Podentes]] has a bit of jealous snape IIRC. Also it's a pretty crazy and fucked up story but SUUPER well written so I'd def recommend it.

**** Awesome! Glad you're liking it! There's a sequel too so make sure you check that out. The first one ends kinda on a cliff hanger iirc.
