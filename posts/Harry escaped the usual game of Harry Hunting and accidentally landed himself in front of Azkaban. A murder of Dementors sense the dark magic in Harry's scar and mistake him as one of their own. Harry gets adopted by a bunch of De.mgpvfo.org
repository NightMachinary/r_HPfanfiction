**** "Hey Harry, you left your Potions textbook at the castle. We had to be in the area, so I told the girls I'd drop it off before you got to school. Have a good year, dearest!" the Dementor (bizarrely) said cheerfully. Harry smiled at her/it, ignoring the shocked expressions of his companions with an ease born of practice. "Merci, Cher. Bon soir!" Harry said, reaching up to embrace the demon. Then, further shocking his compartment mates, he kissed her once on each cheek, and she reciprocated. "Cher" left the compartment and the train, the lamps relighting as she and her fellow guards left. Beaming, Harry turned towards the new Defense professor, who was gaping unabashedly. "What?" Harry demanded, "She's French. It's what they do.".

"Oh. Yes. I see." Remus managed. Ron patted him on the shoulder. "Don't worry, sir. I had a similar reaction. I think everyone reacts that way, actually." Ron said, cocking his head in contemplation. "Right... I'm going to have a word with the engineer. I'll be back." Remus said, shaking his head. "And I'll see if the trolley lady has firewhiskey..." he muttered soto voice.

Imagine Sirius having a near heart attack from seeing little Harry prancing around the halls of Azkaban. And further questioning his own sanity when Harry told him that the Dementors adopted him.

Also, the Dementors are very good at hiding Harry from the guards of Azkaban. The prisoners won't snitch, because Harry distracts the eldritch horrors attention away from them.

Harry's whereabout is only known when his Hogwarts letter arrived at Azkaban. It's most scandalous.

** I like the idea. This is my start while I'm waiting for food.

It was only a month into primary and it was already a familiar scene. The boy who looks too small to even be there runs from his cousin. The teachers knew the little hooligan liked to tease and bully his cousin Dudley for his weight problem. He would do anything for attention. He even somehow dyed his teacher's hair blue! So sue them they looked the other way as Dudley and his friend Piers chased him out of sight. It wasn't until that afternoon the teachers noticed he never came back. Probably ran home and skived off school. A note was sent home with Dudley informing his parents his cousin would be suspended for a week for his actions.

It wasn't until three days later his family noticed he was missing. Not that they cared. With any luck the little freak died and would never come back, but it was more likely another freak took him back to his own kind. Either way, the Dursleys would never see him again. They reported that a member of his father's family stepped up and took the trouble maker. That was good enough for anyone who would find it suspicious. Almost everyone.

--------------

When Albus Dumbledore was informed the boy was missing panic set in. The Death Eaters were not supposed to be able to get near the boy. He couldn't understand what went wrong. He had to play this safe though. It would do no good to insight a mass panic among the population. His trackers showed the boy was alive and healthy, but it could not locate him behind whatever wards they had the boy under.

He was obviously dealing with someone powerful and to leave no trace they proved to be careful as well. He couldn't even find the breach in the wards they would have had to have made. It was as if the boy just vanished. If he didn't know any better he would say the boy apparated himself away, but accidental magic wasn't that strong and it wouldn't explain why he couldn't find the boy now. The old wizard sighed. He would have to reinstate the Order of the Phoenix. Someone took Potter and he must be found before the ministry found out he was missing. There was no telling how they would bungle the situation.

‐-------------------

Sirius Black was staring at his ceiling. There were 72519 stones in his cell. After several months in this hell hole he had started to count them just for something to do. On his bad days he even named them. He was up to 20 named stones now. The sad part was they were better conversationalists than anyone else he had to talk to. The vast majority of the prisoners were insane and couldn't hold a thought together. The rambling just served to disorient him and that was dangerous in this place. The dementors didn't talk. At least not in a traditional sense.

And so he was stuck talking to Frank, but only because Bill was mad at him. He had spent too much time as a dog this week and Bill thought it was messing with his head. Frank didn't care. He knew being a dog made things easier in this place. Of course Sirius knew this was all in his head. He wasn't crazy yet. Or at least he didn't think so. But going crazy would explain why he didn't remember his trial and it would certainly explain why there was someone else in his cell. He hadn't seen another human in a long time and now he was in the company of a young boy.

That boy looked familiar. It almost looked like James. Obviously he was starting to hallucinate. Azkaban had finally won and he started to laugh.

*** Harry was confused. It had been a pretty normal day until now. He had managed to escape Dudley on the play ground, but when he jumped behind the dumpster he wound up in a small room. He didn't know there was a room behind the dumpster, he looked around the room. It was dark and a little smelly. The laughing man in the corner was wearing rags like he was. Maybe this was a room for freaks. Harry had never met another freak. As he searched the room Harry noticed he couldn't see the dumpster anymore. There was just 4 walls and a door made of metal bars.

Maybe he hit his head jumping and passed out. He didn't remember being unconscious, but he sometimes got confused if one of his relatives hit him in the head, so it wouldn't be unusual for that to happen. Maybe the laughing man knew where they were. Harry bit his lip, he knew he wasn't allowed to ask questions, but he really didn't like not knowing what was happening. Especially if there wasn't a way out. Harry decided he would have to chance it.

"Excuse me, sir?" He probed shyly. The man's laughter slowly died as it became a dark chuckle. Harry felt a shiver go down his spine, the man looked dangerous, but for some reason Harry didn't feel afraid of him. The man reminded Harry of someone, but he didn't know who. The man ignored Harry as he began mumbling to himself.

"Great Merlin, it speaks too. How long have I been in here?" Harry froze. He didn't like it when he was called an it. He may have been a freak, but he was still a boy. The man's words stopped him from commenting though. It must be a rule that he shouldn't speak. Unsure of what he should do, he stared at the man instead waiting for instructions.

The laughing man had stopped laughing now. He looked like he was going to cry, but Harry still wasn't sure what to do.

"I'm sorry James. It was all my fault. And now you are dead and I'm in prison slowly going insane." The man laughed again and a second later a dog was in his spot. The dog circled himself three times before it fell to the ground with a flop and seemed to fall asleep in the corner.

Harry was stuned. A man just turned into a dog. Did he do that? He had done some freaky things before, but never anything like that. He looked around fearfully, Harry didn't want to get in trouble for being a freak when he didn't even know where he was. Wait, prison! Did he just say prison? Was Harry in prison?! What did Dudley do to get Harry sent here? Or maybe Harry did something. He may have just turned a man into a dog. It wouldn't be that big of a stretch that he did something freakish enough to end up here.

Harry sat in the opposite corner of the dog and hugged his knees to his chest. He tried to remember what happened, but the last thing he knew he was running away from dudley and jumped behind a garbage bin. He couldn't think of anything else.

Harry sat patiently in his corner as he waited for someone to tell him what to do or what happened. After a few hours the dog remained asleep but the door was opening. Harry stood at attention as soon as he heard the door open. Uncle Vernon always complained he was being lazy or disrespectful if he was sitting down. And Harry didn't want whoever came in to think of him as that.

A moment later a tall man in a cloak glided into the room. At least Harry thought it was a man. He supposed it could be a woman, that would explain why they were wearing a hooded dress.

Harry had so many questions, but the man earlier seemed mad that he talked. He didn't want to make anyone else mad. Whoever it was took a deep rattling breath and the room felt a little colder. A sliggt shiver ran down Harry's spine and his breath turned to fog. It wasn't too bad. A lot better than when Aunt Petunia sent him out to shovel the snow off the walk without a coat.

The person tilted their head as they looked at Harry. After giving a few more deep breaths the person pointed at Harry and beckoned him over to follow them. Harry complied taking one last look at the dog in the corner as he was led out.

**** Harry looked around as he followed the new person down the hall. He had heard of prison. Uncle Vernon always told him it was where he would end up. It didn't look like a fun place. They passed many doors made of bars and through them Harry could see other people. Some were screaming. Some were sleeping. None of them paid attention to Harry.

Harry figured the person in front must be a guard here. He was able to open the doors and go where he wanted. So Harry followed his guard and tried to remember the twists and turns of where they were going.

It wasn't long before Harry was led into a room with hundreds of people dressed as his guard was. His guard gestured to the center of the room. Harry just wished someone would say something, but maybe these people didn't talk to freaks. Maybe this was a prison for freaks. Harry stood where his guard pointed to. After a few moments his guard made another deep rattling breath again. The others must have understood something Harry didn't. They were tilting their heads and looking around.

A rattling noise started to fill the room. The small boy stood in the center of 764 dementors as they all struggled to breath. Harry wondered if they might have asthma like that kid from his school. He didn't like being the center of at attention but he supposed it was better in here than out there. The screaming was starting to get loud and Harry was worried about what would happen to him.

The noise died down after a few minutes. The guards were looking at each other. One of the guards stepped into the center of the room with Harry. He wasn't sure, but he thought this one might be a woman. She was slightly shorter than his other guard and slightly slimmer. It was hard to tell since they all looked so much a like with their black dresses and hoods.

The woman approached him and lowered her hood. Harry flinched and choked down scream. The woman didn't have a nose!. Or eyes! Just a large mouth. Years with the Dursleys had taught the boy running from adults would just make things worse. So he stayed still, staring at the woman as she drew closer. When she was right in front of the boy she picked him up. She wasn't rough like Uncle Vernon, but she wasn't gentle either. Harry tried not to fidget as she brought him up to her face. Harry grimaced a little hoping he wasn't going to be shouted at, but to his surprise. She kissed him.

Harry had never had a kiss before so he had nothing to compare it to, but her mouth was on his. He felt a sucking sensation. Was he supposed to do that too? Harry took a deep breath against the sucking. And just like that the kiss ended. Harry was dropped to the floor as the woman flinched away. Tears came to his eyes. She must have figured out he was a freak after all. The kiss wasn't especially good, but no one had done it before. It reminded Harry of last Christmas when Uncle Vernon got Harry a pair of new socks. Something that was all his, but after Harry thanked him the lights on the tree burned bright and went out, so Uncle Vernon took his present away and threw them out. He spent the rest of the holidays in his cupboard.

Harry wasn't sure what was happening, but the guards seemed worried. They were moving about erratically leaving Harry and the woman who kissed him in the center of the room. After a few minutes Harry felt his eyes droop and he yawned wide. All the movement stopped.

The woman who kissed him gestured for him to follow as she left the room. She brought Harry to a room like all the others and pointed to a bed against the wall. The boy beamed. They were allowing him to sleep in an actual bed. The Dursleys never did that. The woman stood in a corner watching him. And Harry crawled into bed with a blissful sigh, it was like sleeping on a cloud.

It wasn't long before the boy was fast asleep, His nights were usually filled with nightmares that woke him several times through the night, but tonight he would sleep all the way through. Instead of green lights and screams, instead of loneliness and pain, Harry dreamed of a motorcycle. A flying one. The laughing man was taking him flying on a motorcycle. It was the best dream he had ever had.

(It is 330 and I was having trouble falling back to sleep, so here is the next part.)

**** Thanks! I have a few ideas to play around with. I was having trouble deciding if a dementor raised Harry would be a Gryffindor or a Hufflepuff. I'm leaning Hufflepuff because I think he would be very loyal to his half insane godfather and the family that took him in. But hanging around Sirius might give him the push to Gryffindor.

As much fun as Ravenclaw and Slytherin Harry can be, I don't see a dementor raised Harry getting sorted into either house.

***** I'm also leaning towards Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff is said to be the most inclusive and patient of all houses and it would have great appeal to Harry, given that many people would label him mad for his ragtag family.

I think the Dementors and Sirius (also a few other inmates) would bring the nurturing side of him to the forefront. Like befriending the house elves and asking them if he could send the leftover food to Azkaban, learning how to knit from Molly so that his family has some warm clothes, etc.

** Dementors were magical, how could they not be? The origins of these magical creatures were unknown however. Theory's have been speculated through out time but never confirmed.

However, they knew their truth.

They we created by death. Soldiers that he crafted to search for the last brother holding his Hallow. Though they never did find him, they were there when he came to Death. Death had praised the man, he had a great deal of respect for his cunningness and bravery. The man had sent Death quite a few corrupted souls so in thanks a bond was born.

The dementors protected over the Pervell line. They worked together to find the individuals who corrupted the laws of nature.

None of the Pervells ever felt the effects of the dementors. They understood each other's language and shared their abilities. The Pervells were the only wizards with the shadow abilities. They were also the only ones who could quell the dementors hunger. Their magic and very essence satisfied their needs.

When Harry Potter, the last descendant of the Pervells, stumbled onto the rocks of Azkaban from the shadows; the dementors flocked to them. A buzzing sensation bounces through them as they saw their partner. Their supporter.

Their friend.

Harry, curious of the flying creatures, tried to listen to as many of them as he could. Names, greetings, and questions were all thrown at him. One must have noticed the overwhelming look and brought a quietness to the night.

An introduction was made. An explanation followed. Then came questions. It wasn't long until they ended up outside a cell on the seventh floor.

'An innocent man resides here. He will help you.' It whispered to him. 'If we had the authority to free the wronged, we would.'

They walked into the cell. A man was starring out the window, his eyes glazed and his mouth slightly agape. Hearing the rustling of fabric, he turned to look at them.

'He never does well on full moons,' the creature informed.

"Why not?" Harry asked back watching the man walk over to them.

'One of his best friends is a werewolf. He wishes he could take care of him.' Harry nodded, not quite understanding but accepting the answer.

The prisoner had a tattered jumpsuit on and wild hair, Harry noted looking at the man. His beard was uneven and there were scratches all over his arms and face. His breath was foul and his gaze went through Harry.

A hand came towards Harry's face and he just watched him. It ghosted over him before suddenly resting on his cheek. The man stiffened.

Then screamed.

He tripped backwards starring at the boy who jumped in surprise. It took a minute for any of them to get there bareings.

"Why'd he scream?" Harry asked looking up and past the dementors cloak.

'He probably thought you were a figment of his imagination. It happens to those exposed to our presence too long.'

"Harry?" Sirius mumbled astonished. "How are you here?"

"I shadow walked." Harry responded, pleased with himself.

"Oh god, not this shit again."

**** They don't have young. They grow in dark places like fungi. It's probably asexual reproduction, I think. Or maybe they're remnants of broken souls. Dementors were first found on Azkaban island after the death of the dark wizard Ekrizdis, who had warded the island to hell and back. He trapped and tortured muggle sailors. And when he died, the wards broke. And the island was found. And so were the dementors. It's my theory that the dementors are those tortured souls, or remnants, at least. And they're searching for their souls for the rest of eternity. And they eat other souls to maybe try to find some peace and happiness in their eternal torture. But that's just a theory.... A /book/ theory! [Cue Matpat's theme song]

  When Harry accidentally apparates away from bullies school, he winds up with the one person alive he has ever felt safe with. Even if he doesn't remember it. Unfortunately a half insane prisoner in Azkaban is not someone who can be a parent to a young abused child. Luckily someone else can take over while Sirius recovers.
