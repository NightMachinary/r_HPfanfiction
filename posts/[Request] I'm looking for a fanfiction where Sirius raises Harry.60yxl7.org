I'm trying to find a fic where Sirius raises Harry instead of going to Azkaban. Something realistic to what we know of Sirius's character. And I'd prefer there wasn't too much character bashing (of anyone really) and the author isn't just tying to fix everything for Harry. Ideally it would be about Sirius raising Harry not about Harry with Sirius as his guardian (if that makes sense, like Sirius is the focus not Harry). I haven't found anything like what I'm looking for, but I'm hoping someone will have. Please and Thank you!


** I like this fic a lot. It has Sirius raising Harry, but doesn't show much how:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Lucius Malfoy outmaneuvered Dumbledore after Halloween 1981. Many Order members evacuated to France, including Sirius, the Longbottoms, and the Weasleys. Harry, Neville, and Weasley kids all went to Beauxbaton. After Ginny graduated, Dumbledore decided it was time to strike back. [[/spoiler][He instructed Snape to resurrect Voldemort, who promptly went after that traitor Malfoy]]. One of his agents sent to spy in Britain, Ron Weasley, met a loyal Malfoy enforcer, Wand Leader Hermione in a battle. Harry, Ginny, and Sirius would all play important roles later.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** The Wise One trilogy. Starts with linkffn(4062601). I've almost finished the first story in the trilogy, and it's been excellent. Sirius breaks out when Harry is seven, 'kidnaps' him and raises him while traveling the world, never staying in one country for more than a few years. Meanwhile, Neville is brought up as a kind of substitute Boy Who Lived. Features a fairly smart!Harry.

There's also linkffn(Growing up Black), where Sirius is released by his Grandfather (via legal trickery and bribes --- his innocence isn't proven) and raises Harry as "Ares Black", his supposed son.

  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II in progress.

  When Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and 8-year-old Harry Potter disappears, the world is thrown into upheaval. What will Britain and Harry be without each other, and who will face the Dark? You only THINK you've read this before. I guarantee you haven't.
