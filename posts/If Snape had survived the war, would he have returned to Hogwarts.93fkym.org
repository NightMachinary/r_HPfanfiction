Why or why not?

If not what do you think his next steps would have been?


** No, because he hates children and he hates teaching.

He's better off working at St Mungos on some cures.

*** He'll work as a consulting potioneer with the kind of hourly rates that makes the accounting department weep while pulling out the cheque book.

** I doubt he'd have returned to teach... Teaching was something he was forced to do rather than something he truly enjoyed. I think he probably would have started an apothecary or done experimental brewing. And I have a hard time picturing him staying in England for very long. He probably would have gone to Diagon Alley or Hogsmead once, been accosted by obnoxious "fans" and run far far away. Snape always struck me as intensely private, and I think he'd have found being a "hero" and being in the limelight fairly painful. I figure he'd head to another English speaking country and settle there to be the local brewer and curmudgeon.

** no. he dislikes teaching. also, spy or not, snape still did kill dumbledore on school grounds. it'd just be kind of awkward for him to still be there after. dumbledore was also one of his only allies and reason for being at hogwarts. i really don't see him opening a store or working some 9-5. how do you transition from being an infamous deep cover terrorist agent to normal life? nobody else's reputation is as complicated as his. besides sirius i guess. he'd probably travel the world or something, and live off of his magic.

** He is probably best off starting over in another country free of bad memories. Might also help him to properly move on and free him from his regrets. Also, he hated teaching, so I don't see him go back to that ever.
