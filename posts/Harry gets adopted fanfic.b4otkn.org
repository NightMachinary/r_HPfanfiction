I've read a lot of Harry gets adopted fanfics written by this guy: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4113329/Gamer95][Gamer95]]

I was wondering - are there any other HP fanfics that use what he does (Harry gets adopted and focuses a lot on the interaction with them, especially in his younger years)?


** The R Series by Greengecko has Harry adopted by Snape and their interactions. linkffn(1795399)

** Linkffn(9469064; 2109424)

Linkao3(987408)

/Innocent/ by Marauderlover7, a Sirius "kidnaps" Harry story with sequels up to fourth year as of now, ongoing.

/Living with Danger/ by Anne B. Walsh, aka whydoyouneedtoknow. OC/Lupin, the first of the Danger-verse. This series actually has side stories upon side stories, and its own AU.

/Stealing Harry/ is the first of a series called /Laocoon's Children/ by Copperbadge. Wolfstar slash, but otherwise a decent story, albeit abandoned at third year.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** Last week or so, I reply to all Fic Searches with stories by White Squirrel. So, of course, this is linkao3(14078862) in essence. And the beginning (the adoption phase) is probably the best he wrote.
