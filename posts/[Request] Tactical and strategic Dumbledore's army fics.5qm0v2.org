I've found my self in the mood for fics in which Dumbledore's army (or any other fitting group of cross-house students) actually become a magical army, with strategics, tactics, units, reconnaissance, etc., a la danger verse, or the battle clubs in HPMOR.

Don't have any pairing limits other than preferably no harems.

Would prefer Canon Harry up to whenever the plot diverges, as in sorted into gryffindor, friends with Ron and hermione, and so on.

Must be completeâ€‹ or recently updated

Bonus points if it's hinny, or if neville, luna, and ginny become part of the "golden trio."

Thanks a bunch!


** Divided and Entwined is going on pretty strong. Hermione is a terrorist.

*** In the same sense that the French Resistance were "terrorists".

*** The last ten chapters are freaking intense, and the story is not over by any means [[/spoiler][despite Voldemort gone]].

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Try Dumbledore's Army and the Spriritus Crystalus by Bobmin356, or The Refiner's Fire and The Time of Destiny by Abraxan

**** Don't really remember how I came across your post... I was looking for hinny. But I don't know what my search was. You could also try This Means War [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/]] (a comedy) where the DA is pretty prominent but it's not really a magical army with strategy, etc. and the focus of the story is Harry and Ginny's burgeoning relationship. The other two I recommended are very much about turning the DA into a 'muggle style army'.
