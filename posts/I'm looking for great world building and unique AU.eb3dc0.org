I just started reading "Children of the Sun" and I'm loving it. It makes me wish for more of these fics that have something... different. I just love the feeling of entering a magical world for the first time.

Another examples of great world building (according to me) would be "Wit of the Raven" and the "Firebird Trilogy".

Anyone has something like it?

I'm sure most have already read it, but it is a fantastic read.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5121464/chapters/11782190]]) is a series that has a lot of neat stuff when it comes to things like religion and customs of the wizarding world. The first fic is pre-hogwarts, but once you get there in the second fic and on, the world building is fantastic.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663/chapters/34132413]]) really develops what pureblood families look like from the inside and what harm magic can do when it comes to abuse. Actually the whole series it's in, [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/809346][leave no stone unturned (a series of standalones)]], has some great fleshing out of things like boggarts, magical potions, and more.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17848691]]) and linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3836023]]) both have great historical world building.

  AU, gen, Harry and Draco friendship. In a world where wizards and witches can sense each other's familiars but no one else can, Harry's impressive familiar makes an eleven-year-old Draco Malfoy take more notice of him.

  After 5th year, Harry takes charge of his own life. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war, and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Long, slower-paced fic. Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, NOT Evil!Harry, No Romance. -ABANDONED-

** This whole series (7 "books", all found on the author's profile). Features custom magic (it's cool as shit) and the first book is all about revealing wizarding society to muggles. Honestly, just check it out. I'm shit at summaries and recommendations, and this fic doesn't deserve being skipped because of my less than great review.

Oh and, this fic has some of the best OCs, imo.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
