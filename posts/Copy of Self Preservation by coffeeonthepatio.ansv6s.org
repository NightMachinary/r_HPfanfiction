Hey all, hoping someone was smart enough to download a copy of this fic. It's a Snape-raises-Harry fic where he's brought to Hogwarts from the Dursleys at 7. Involves the castle making him a bedroom, a pet Puffskein (?), and a tutoring group with other future classmates. Went to reread it to find it has been taken down from [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] :/

If anyone is able to pass on a copy I would be super grateful. Promptly going to download all my favourites so this doesn't happen again...


** Ok I found a copy in the archive at [[https://archive.org/details/fanfictiondotnet_repack]]. I'm guessing you don't want to download the 12gb HPzip. Self preservation is too big to upload to pastebin so if you have a suggestion for how to transfer it let me know

*** :OOO oh my gosh thank you! Hm, is it possible for you to try putting it through [[https://uploadfiles.io/]] and paste a link? I've used it before successfully, and hopefully the file isn't 5gb.

Link to an epub / mobi of the story on this website. If you download the epub, you should be able to view it in Microsoft Edge, for example.
