Big Harry

During chapter The Seven Potters of DH.

Hilarity ensued when the twins, Ron, Hermione, Fleur and Mundungus warped into versions of Harry himself, or it would have if Harry wasn't feeling so dreadful for his friends that were now sharing the bulls-eye of Voldemort's ire. To his dismay and annoyance, everyone was starting to change clothes in open sight in the middle of the kitchen, obviously having no qualms whatsoever about showing of his body. At least he got a little satisfaction from his workout showing, two years ago he would have been extremely shy about six nearly naked versions of his scrawny self being on display. Out of the corner of his eye he saw something he hadn't expected. Fleur -in her haughty and luxurious nature- had not prepared for the male anatomy she now possessed by choosing appropriate underwear. That meant that her silken panties had no chance to hide his “basilisk” as Susan and Hannah had called it during their short stints in the broom closets last year. It seemed to be extremely uncomfortable too, as Fleur frantically freed her version of his penis from its tight prison. Harry was about to complain about what little privacy they gave him when he saw Tonks' face. She was staring at Fleur's penis with open mouth and dreamy eyes, a little drool dropping from her lips. Fred -or George- had apparently also spotted Fleur's predicament, as he lifted the band of his own boxers and took an appreciative look. With a wink he said, “Man Harry, makes my normal self feel like half a man, and it's not even erect.” Fleur actually blushed now and turned into a corner while trying to arrange to the new circumstances.     “What?” asked Ron dumbly.     “Take a look yourself,” said the other twin with grin, doing just that.     “Blimey,” said Ron, blushing heavily after checking the facts for himself.     “Oh Ron,” said Hermione, “You don' have to feel inadequate just because... oh my, Harry, if I had known...” She also blushed but didn't take her eyes of her own new penis.     Kingsley seemed very amused and snuck a look at one of the twins package as well, “Nice one, Harry, welcome to the club.” He held his fist out and Harry realised that he had to bump it. The situation was so surreal that he just went with the flow and indulged the auror, now unable to keep a smile from his face. He knew that he was big but had never really cared to compare, but when his friends insisted of showing his body off to everyone present he was somewhat glad that one of his proudest features was included in the show.     “Stop Tonks, that's not helping,” said Fleur from the corner. Harry couldn't really see what they were doing, but it looked like Tonks was trying to give the younger woman a helping hand.     “Oh, but it is helping me,” replied Tonks enthusiastically, “But maybe, eh, Harry? Got some spare underpants for Fleur?”     “Sure,” he said and opened his trunk, Dudley's underpants were the only item that had never felt oversized.     “Thanks, honey,” said Tonks, dragging Fleur into the living room, “We'll be right back.” Giggling and an occasional involuntary moan could be heard from the living room during the next minutes, Bill and Remus giving Harry an angry look, the twins looking like Christmas had come early, Ron looking very jealous and Hermione quickly changing completely, her face flush from embarrassment. Mr. Weasley didn't seem inclined to comment or add to the situation, leaning at the counter, a feint amusement in his smile. Moody on the other hand was far from amused, “Girls! Hurry up, our window is fading!” That brought Harry back to reality, “Your plan is stupid anyway. Sorry, but the best solution would have obviously been having Tonks drive here in a car while disguised and having me join her under my invisibility cloak. Add to that whatever distraction you can think of that doesn't include 13 of you risking their life in a plan so convoluted you came up with it without Dumbledore. You know how they are, they are covering every magical mean of escape but won't give the car a second look, otherwise they would have already caught the Dursleys to pressure me with them. If anything you lot arriving her with Testrals and that motorbike will have announced what will happen.” Silence.     “Right you are, Potter, maybe that could have been an idea, but...”     “There is a moving truck outside, I'm confident that we will all fit in. Just drive a few miles and get air-bourn then.”     The rescue went perfectly if full of innuendo and tension coming from the insecure male part of his company. Unfortunately Voldemort got angry and killed Snape, proving that it was a very stupid plan to have a spy in a dangerous position as the one to deliver the final information. Harry never went to his death, but escaped Hogwarts barely with a small portion of his friends. They retired to a Caribbean island owned by the Black family. In a stroke of fate the survivors - with the exception of Harry himself- were all female. Well, Harry always thought it a stroke of fate while his wives, mistresses and concubines knew the truth, as long as there was a penis like the “basilisk” around, there was hope.
