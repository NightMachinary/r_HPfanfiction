Well title says it all.i am looking %100 canon compliant ff.like what was going on in hufflepuff during series?or in ravenclaw?or why did seamus changed his mind in ootp.stuff like that. I read minds eyes souls reflection (pov of luna ) Some ginny pov (though they were mostly fluff so i didnt like so much) I even checked some ff about life of bill weasley however it was badly written. Professors pov (it is really hard to follow the speaking lines) hermione's pov (was quite good) Ps:could be adult such as professors pov.must be canon compliant.i am lf someone other than trio Ps2:i do not want during deathly hallows. So thanks.


** There's a short little outsider POV you might enjoy: linkao3(when september comes by auntbijou). And I do mean short - the trilogy is under 3K.

**** It felt completely believable, and I liked how he got to be in on it in the end. And it was very obvious what was happening, even if the narrator wasn't clear on it himself.

I really enjoy outsider pov with any fandom that has a "hidden society" - the dramatic irony of the reader knowing what's going on when the narrator doesn't is just delicious. It's a hard balance to maintain for long, so they're usually short. I don't see them much with Harry Potter, though, which is odd.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

** I love these kind of Fics but they seem to be very hard to find, if they even exist. I think you've read the popular ones at least.

Iv read all that you have above an unfortunately don't have much to add except for this linkffn(12312469) and linkffn(12470990)

Its a WIP series which will eventually tell the series up until DH from Ginny POV. Iv only read about half the first one so far, i really need to get around to catching up. Part 1 is complete and Part 2 is WIP
