After watching Dark Lord Funk, I have a sudden desire for the craziest, strangest, goofiest Voldemorts ever written. Anything acceptable except smut. Thanks!


** In my story "Harry Potter and the Gilr Who Walked on Water", Voldemort's last Horcrux merges with the spirit of Bismarck - the battleship - and becomes humanoid "shipgirl" driven by the combined hatred of Voldemort and the sailors who drowned with her.

*** I keep meaning to read this, so now I will. Your description sounds awesome.

Edit: This story is awesome. Strange as all hell, but utterly awesome.

*** My only problem with this fic is that I play azur lane, so your description of the girls doesn't match the ones from this game lol.

Other than that, I loved it.

#+begin_quote
  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.
