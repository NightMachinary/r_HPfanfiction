Looking for fics where characters have to deal with their psychopathy. As long as it isn't Voldemort(who was almost certainly one), Dumbledore(because he's portrayed as one in many fics), and Grindelwald(he was also almost certainly a psychopath, at least before he went to Nurmengard). Anyone except those three are fair game.
