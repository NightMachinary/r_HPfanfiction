In the first one I remember that whist the triwizard tornement is going on they have an iter school quidditch tournament as well as some smaller tournaments.

In the second harry and draco are friends and play quiddege for englands quidditch team. Also harry is brother of boy who lived and has a little sister.


** No clue on the second, but the first is a pretty common occurrence in 4th year fics. I think one of the most popular is linkffn(letters), especially given the pairings you mentioned
