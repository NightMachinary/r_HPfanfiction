Are there any dark hufflepuff fics out there? I feel like their potential to go dark is largely overlooked.


** insurgere by Silver Pard linkffn(5846518) is a fic where Tom Riddle is sorted into Hufflepuff and decides to make it respected. It's a oneshot (about 6k words) and pretty solid.

  Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** linkffn(7941612) isn't dark in the end, but she's a pompous pureblood, at least in the beginning, and thinks she should've been in Slytherin. It's written from the dark side. It's an OC though. I haven't read it recently, but I remember that it was really good
