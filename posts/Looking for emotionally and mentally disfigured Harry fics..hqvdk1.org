** I see a lot of fics that say he has no emotions but then have him have friends for reasons but then protect them and ask himself why is he doing it and so he does have emotions

*** To be fair, you do not need emotions to protect people. If Harry finds them useful, he is simply protecting an investment. Everyone has emotions, though, even those 'emotionless' psychopaths. Anger and hate are still emotions!

That's the problem though. There is "no emotions". It's physically impossible. You can suppress them and ignore them. You may feel different emotions compared to other people. But not having any emotions what so ever is impossible for an intelligent existence.

Think about it. Emotions are what drive us, without them we are nothing. A person with no emotions will have no reason to do anything. It will just stand there and do nothing until it dies. Why do /anything/?

It's conceptually impossible for a self-aware being that does things to not have some form of emotion.

  How different would Harry Potter's first year of school have been if the Dursleys had successfully suppressed Harry's natural curiosity? This NARRATIVE shows what could have been.

** Linkffn(Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7)

This fic is DARK, just so you know. I haven't been able to finish it because of that, but still a really good fic showing Harry's descent into darkness.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
