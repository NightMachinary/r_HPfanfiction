"Nitwit, Blubber, Oddment, Tweak!"\\
With those words, Dumbledore declared the beginning of the Start of Term Feast, but Ron Weasley, curiously enough, wasn't interested in the food, instead paying attention to Harry, who had inexplicably startled and was whipping his head left and right as though he had just woken up from a nightmare.\\
"Um...is everything alright, Harry?" Ron tried, "...Is it the food? I suppose it's a bit of a surprise the first time it appears..."\\
But Harry wasn't listening; he was staring up at Professor Quirrell, eyes twitching, before he turned back to Ron with a carefully neutral expression, "Ron, do you have Scabbers with you? I wanted to double-check something."\\
Ron blinked, before he fished out the rat Scabbers from his pocket, "Um, here he is. What did you want to check?"\\
Upon seeing Scabbers, Harry promptly drew his wand, took a deep breath, and then clearly pronounced "/Homorphus./"\\
There was a flash of blue light and a squeak from Scabbers (and a yell of objection from Ron), before the rodent started to swell up, losing its fur, gaining clothes, in the space of a few seconds becoming a dishevelled human sitting on the roast potatoes.

"Peter Pettigrew, ladies and gentlemen." Harry Potter announced to the shocked-silent Great Hall. After a few seconds of whispering and puzzled pointing, he sighed, "Man supposed to have died years ago? Supposedly murdered by Sirius Black? Nothing left but a finger? Ringing any bells?"\\
"Accused Sirius Black of betraying Lily & James Potter? Less-than-willing spy for You-Know-Who? Anyone?" Peter helpfully added.\\
"That reminds me." Harry muttered, before turning and pointing his wand at Professor Quirrell, "/Accio Turban./"\\
Nothing happened, until Professor Flitwick, curious as to Harry's behavior, waved his wand and broke the Anti-Summoning Charm on Quirrell's turban, at which point it flew off his head and-\\
"Fuck." Quirinus Quirrell and the face on the back of his head grumbled at the same time.\\
"Quirinus Quirrell and the spirit possessing him, Tom Marvolo Riddle aka Lord Voldemort, ladies and gentlemen." Harry announced again.

Understandably, there was quite a bit of bedlam after that, as students panicked at the presence of Voldemort, Quirrell tried to evade capture by Dumbledore and Flitwick, a brigade of lawyers galloped in to question Peter Pettigrew, Ron Weasley tried to puzzle out the mystery of Harry Potter and eat his fill at the same time, Snape tried to make it look like he was helping Quirrell escape whilst actually hindering him...

Eventually, once things had calmed down, the dust had cleared, and the inexplicable flamingos had been shooed out of the Great Hall, Albus Dumbledore approached Harry.\\
"Mr. Potter, how on earth did you know that Professor Quirrell was possessed, and that your friend's rat was a hidden Animagus?" he asked, trying for a gentle tone that nevertheless came across as bewildered.\\
Harry just looked up at the headmaster, "Have you ever read a book where someone goes to sleep, and they wake up ten years in the past, in their younger body, and they have the chance to do things over again?"\\
Dumbledore shook his head, then paused, "Are you saying that you are Harry Potter from the future? Or rather, a Harry Potter sent into your past?"\\
Harry nodded, "I really don't want to do everything /again/. I'm sick of trolls and basilisks and dementors and dragons and Death Eaters and Inferi and Horcruxes and Voldemort, I just want to have...I dunno, sleep in for a whole year."\\
Dumbledore blinked, "What are Horcruxes?" he inquired.\\
"Voldemort bits. He put bits of his soul in founder's artifacts and stuff. Really hard to destroy and they make him immortal..."

And then Harry Potter explained about Ravenclaw's diadem, the other horcruxes, Barty Crouch Jr., Gilderoy Lockhart, Peter Pettigrew, Dolores Umbridge, and whatever else was important from the seven books, before he wandered up to Gryffindor tower and dug under the covers for a very, very long sleep-in.


** The title gave me a silly idea: write up a scene of Harry, after forest AK, is confronted by an entity (Dumbledore, Death personified, whatever) and is allowed a re-do from eleven. His reaction: "No". The entity replies "Very well, who should I give a do-over then?". What follows are one chapter per person he replies -- Sirius, Hermione, Remus, Colin, Albus, Severus, James, Draco, etc.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

****** I think that's the key thing - in the story he's not so much maturing as aging. He's not growing into a better person so much as just growing more experienced.

The story ends with him living a "happy ending" version of his life where he's beloved, successful, and has a family, but we're never actually told what it's like inside his head. The implication being that it's fundamentally not that much different than the time he tried to be a dark lord. He always feels detached, like others are just actors on a stage of meaninglessness.

In the classic /Groundhog Day/ movie, we see the protagonist learning and growing as a person and then putting that learning into effort to save more and more people. He catches a kid falling from a tree, but instead of becoming despondent over that "save" getting reset, he /just keeps doing it/. He even shouts "You've never thanked me! I'll see you tomorrow... maybe."

The linked one-shot feels like it should be the first of a two-parter. Like this first one is him learning more and more and eventually optimizing the best life - for himself. He then falls into depression and then pulls himself out by learning to optimize what's best for others or for the greater good, or The Will of the Force or whatever the fuck you wanna do with it. You could still do a happy ending here.
