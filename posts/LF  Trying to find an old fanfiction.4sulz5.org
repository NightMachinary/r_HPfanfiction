Hi everyone !

I'm trying to find the first HP fanfic I read. It was not really good, but you know... nostalgia. I've been looking for it through keywords but nothing came up. I hope it wasn't deleted.

So, if I remember, Wormtail is a double agent for both Voldemort and Grindelwald. Voldemort has a "clone". The Black family is part of a secret organization against Voldemort that I think is called "The white gloves" or anything with gloves (not sure, though). Nagini is an animagus (and against Voldemort too).

I know, it sounds like a bad fanfic (and it may be), but I'd just want to look at it because it was the first one I read.

Thank you !
