I would love to see a Voldemort that strategically plans every move he makes. I want some great plan that the reader slowly learns about only for the grand finale to totally take them by surprise!

A great example is Moriarty in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows; A ruthless chessmaster that slowly murdered or bought his way into every business that he needed while setting entire countries against each other so that way when war broke out he would make a massive profit selling, "the bullets and bandages".


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/][Patron]], linkffn(11080542), features a Voldemort like that. He even has his good look back. Dumbledore and the Ministry are all fairly competent, but Voldemort would still have won if Aberforth and Hermione hadn't picked up the slack.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
