Something to do with Atlantis, discovery or ancient magic, or time travel. It doesn't matter. It just has to be an interesting concept

** Now I'm trying to imagine some kind of reverse "the little mermaid" scenario. Land dwelling person uses magic to become a mer person and study lost magics in Atlantis. Meets Ariel, becomes love interest. Drama when King Triton finds out the guy is not a merman.

*** You thought Little Mermaid...I thought of Disney's Atlantis (best Disney movie, IMO). Both are excellent ideas. Can you imagine a group of magical explorers going to the bottom of the ocean, only to find an ancient civilization in an air pocket under the water?

  Harry finds himself waking with a broken heart and a hangover. Apparently he's put an ad in the Quibbler at some point the night before. "Wanted: Diversion. Will do anything for up to a month. Serious inquiries only. Send an owl to the Quibbler Attention: Suitor 435138."

** Atlantis is very important to the lore in the heavy AU linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality). Apparently it was an advanced past civilization responsible for building the Mirror of Erised and possibly the Philosopher's Stone, but it experimented with time-travel so much it erased itself from time in the end. It is speculated the "source of magic" was some sort of machine built by the Atlanteans, though apparently the author says the characters are wrong on this point. Atlantis is never actually visited, though --- only in the sequelfic by someone else, linkffn(Draco Malfoy and the Practice of Rationality), and even then only at the very end.
