Reddit has ruined me. I started reading A Study In Magic. It's so painfully good and I can't help but think there is nothing else this good. Prove me wrong. I adore Sherlock and I am swinging back into the Harry Potter fandom. Some stipulations:

- No romance. I love Johnlock and I like more than a few slash pairings for Harry but I would really prefer stories with Romance not the main focus. If it must have romance...Harry can't be in the main relationship. I am really picky about him and the wrong pairing will just distract me.
- No character bashing. I don't mind if the characters don't like each other - I like Snape but not everyone else shares my sentiments- but the authors changing the characterization of a character they hate just so they can bash them is not my cup of vanilla cupcake latte.
- Keep OCs to the minimum. Don't care too much about them but if used in a meaningfulway or non-too obtrusive, they are cool.
- No stupified characters. I love wish fulfillment ficts as much as the next girl but dammit, have people actually do shit other than just marvel at Sherlock's brilliance.

I have a small wishlist of things I wish I can find [or write] a fict for:

- Any interactions between the smart people in the HP universe [Voldemort/Snape/Hermoine/Dumbledore/etc] and Sherlock [or Mycroft]
- Sherlock mixing magic and deductions to solve a case in a non-immediately obvious way

I have read Incantations and Deductions on DA and it was great and I wouldn't mind more of the same but right now, let's just focus on ficts with the above parameters- Sherlock and John interacting with Harry and the Wizarding world. I don't mind them being muggle or wizards and anything over 200k [or over 60k and still actively updating] is welcomed.

***** Sweet. Found it. Kind of short but not a bad premise. Thanks.

** Voldemort looked around the large, empty warehouse, watching the last of his Death Eaters be carted away in shiny, black cars. Standing before him was a thin man wearing a well-tailored suit, leaning on an umbrella, his right leg tucked behind his left. The man looked entirely too relaxed.

"Avada Ke-" before he could finish, 50 men in all black appeared, popping up from the floor and repelling down from the roof, quickly disarming Voldemort and trussing him up tighter than an Easter leg of lamb.

"And that, dear brother, is why you can't fight the government. And by government, I mean me."

.

.

In all seriousness though, I wish there were more HP Xovers in general.

*** Man that would be sweet.

I agree. Most out there are just John and Sherlock are hogwarts students and solve mysteries but I want more like Sherlock and John raising harry or Voldemort versus the sherlock cast and so on. No one really wants to explore anymore.

** This is probably not exactly what you are looking for since there is little interaction between the actual worlds, but [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1115333][Friend]] by esama is a very well written oneshot that fits most of your criteria.

Also, if you can bare with a Harry/Mycroft pair (very off screen) you will most likely love [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113600][Magnificent]], also by esama.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9640595/1/A-Scandal-at-Hogwarts][A Scandal at Hogwarts]] mixes the two worlds beautifully. Also, it balances the casework and the (johnlock) romance very well.

Those are all I can think of for now. I hope you'll have fun reading!

*** I need to look over esama more. I know her for YGO [and having the bad habit of putting her ficts in place undownloadable and deleting them] and I did read this one really short Harry Potter fict of hers that was excellent but...whep I have some digging to do.

I was going to overlook magnificent since it has that odd pairing but esama so....

Scandal looks good if kind of short [Damn you study of magic for setting the bar oh so very high] but I have a weakness for Johnlock and Sherlock in Hogwarts.

Thanks for the recs. :)

** Answering my own question- sorta- I did find something digging through the sherlock fanfiction subreddit [which is grossly disorganized but at least they have a wiki proper set up with some recs].

[[http://one-windiga.livejournal.com/4785.html][C/O 221B Baker Street, Muggle London]]. The authoress has meclimbing a wall because she says she has an AO3 account with all her stories on it BUT I can't find a story with that name and I HATE dealing with places that I can't download offline versions of ficts from and dammit it's a novel length Sherlock and John raising Harry story and AUGH.

anywhoo. The Game is still on.

*** Oh man, if you find that let me know. Is that not finished? I'm always weird about reading stuff on livejournal because I've had the bad fortune of stories suddenly disappearing and accounts suddenly being locked down mid-read, and there is no good way to archive them short of copying and pasting into a text document.

**** It's not finished and that bugs me becuase it goes up to book two and it hasn't been updated since 2011. Man Livejournal drives me up a WALL.

There is a program where you can grab an RSS feed and turn it into an ebook but LJ doens't have an easy feed that you can filter based on tags and that just bugs me.
