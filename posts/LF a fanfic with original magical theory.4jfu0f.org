basically the title. anything with a new idea of how magic works besides the old magical core etc.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/883762/Taure][Taure]] has written several stories that contain extensive theories of magic. If you're okay with fem!Harry, you should definitely try linkffn(8299839)

You might also enjoy reading his [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/edit][Headcanon Document]]. It's crazy how much thought he has put into the HP universe.

** linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) goes into the nitty gritty of the arithmancy that underpins the Potterverse's 'point-stick-say-words' model of magic. Also goes into wandcraft somewhat, though that isn't focused on as much compared to the maths.

Not precisely 'new' as much as 'trying to force canon magical stuff to make some lick of sense', because I don't think Rowling had any idea what magic /should/ be capable of at any given time, she just made stuff up when she needed to. Which is bad, when you're trying to make coherent magical models, by the way, because your results will be completely inconsistent and run on the rule of whimsy.

It's not Harry-centric, hope you don't mind. Good luck!

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry Potter dies trying to save her life, Daphne Greengrass takes his place to prevent the wizarding world from collapsing into a panic at the return of Voldemort and the loss of the boy-who-lived. Can she keep her secret and pretend to be the hero the world needs long enough to find a way to bring the real thing back to life? Or will she eventually stop needing to pretend?

*** Unique idea, indeed. Replace Daphne with Hermione, Ron, or Ginny, use polyjuice, and turn Harry's death into a coma of some sort (basilisk, maybe?), and it might even be feasible.

** Then I would point you to linkffn(blindness;knowledge is useful, but power is power)

Blindess has a unique look on magic that I have yet to encounter in other fics. The second one's title is self-explanatory.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
