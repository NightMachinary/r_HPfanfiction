"Harvest Moon: A New Beginning" is a farming simulator where the player character builds up their farm, basically builds the town from scratch, and woos marriage candidates. I'm inspired by one of those recently posted prompts about Harry starting a farm in the game Stardew Valley, but I'm thinking of tackling it from a different approach, where the PC is already working hard to rebuild the town and farm where Harry Potter (and his godson, Teddy) move in to carve out a new life.

I'm thinking this will be somewhere between 6 months to 2 or 3 years after the war when Harry chooses to leave.

Do you think anyone would be interested in this kind of story?

** You could make it so harry owns a farming supply shop and the main farmer is his best customer (do some romance)

*** Yeah, I'm definitely considering a possible romance with farmer. It'll just depend on the personality they end up with.

** Personally I wouldn't, simply because magic would make having a farm really really easy and if harry didn't use it for whatever plot related reason it would feel forced and that would be off putting to me.

â€‹

But that's just me, plus, I've seen plenty of popular fics that would match the tone for a fic like this, I'm guessing slice-of-life/family since there's not much else to do, unless you took it in a PTSD!Harry direction but it would end up being the same in the end, taking care of a farm/godson with not much else to do.

*** Oh, I don't know if my post was clear about this, but Harry is moving to one of the game towns, but not necessarily becoming a farmer. I plan to have a different character farming, most likely.

I am considering that type of approach with Harry, but I'll just have to see where the muse takes me, I suppose.

Thanks for your feedback!

** Probably not. The worlds those characters live in are just too different for them to pull off 'always in the same world'. I say the same for most crossovers that involve saying 'oh yea there is those whole bit of reality that co-exists but we never mentioned it'.

HM is just a bit too fantastical to believe it just exists in the muggle world (and if you cut everything that makes it HM, then why not just do "HP retires to a farm", no need to make it HM). And if it was say, magical, you would think someone would say something at some point.

(This goes for a lot of 'they always coexisted' crossovers. DCU/HP crossover? No-one from HP ever mentions Superman? Really? Or Zatanna?). I really only go for those when it is clearly reasonable that the two would would have never interacted. (HP/Xanth? Sure!).

Not to discourage you though, a lot of people don't have that problem and there are a ton of those fics around :).

But personally I prefer the 'sucked into an alternate dimension' (stuck in a game, whatever) as a means for a crossover. Or the 'our storyline is different, because the Muggle game was somehow based on our magical wizarding farming community without knowing' Or something :).

*** I never realized until just now how much I would LOVE to see a HP/Xanth crossover. Spell for Chameleon is one of my favorite books ever, and that crossover has so much potential.
