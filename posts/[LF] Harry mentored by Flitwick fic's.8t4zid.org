  What would happen, if after the fateful night of James and Lily Potter's murder, the Dursley family were out of town, with no one to take baby Harry? How would being raised by a Master Dueller affect the child of Prophecy? Slightly AU. (Revision Update: 2/13 done)

** There's some in A Different Beginning, although it's really more along the lines of Flitwick being a really involved head of house.

** I love Flitwick too and I think there's so much you can do with a half-goblin character. I couldn't find anything so I decided write my own. The fic I'm writing has him in a mentor role, but not necessarily as the sweet guy from canon. I can't believe a goblin can forget his roots completely...

  What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.

** There's a bit of that in Harry Crow, I believe. Part because Ravenclaw, part because Goblin.
