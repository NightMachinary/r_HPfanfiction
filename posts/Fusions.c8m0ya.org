I think it'd be interesting to see a fanfiction where two characters who are enemies come into contact with some kind of artifact that fuses them into one human, and they have to work out their differences and work together to find a way to go back to how they used to be.

â€‹

Bonus points if the fused form is an interesting blend of the two characters both physically and mentally. They speak to each other in the head of the fused form and in order to actually DO anything, they have to agree on what they are gonna do. The way the fused form speaks could be an even mix of the two peoples speech patterns


** Like Alien X in Ben 10? Would be a nice detail maybe to put a lot of petrified humans around the artifact that never did manage to agree on anything.

Where were Alien X born anyway.... Creation Womb.... Something like that.

*** Yes! Exactly! And Celestialsapians, the race Alien X is, were born in the Forge of Creation, which sits outside of the universe.

**** Yeah, when Omniverse was still on all this knowledge used to sit at the top of my head. Same thing with The Vampire Diaries universe. Now pretty much the only Fandom I obsessively remember is Harry Potter.

Ah, I can feel the good old days when the trio went to the Forge of Creation to stop that Osmosian who then Kevin defeated by absorbing the Ultimatrix.
