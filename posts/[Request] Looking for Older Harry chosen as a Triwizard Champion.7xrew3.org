Older Harry could be Non-BWL or BWL. Either way, I'm looking for a fanfic where Harry gets legitimacy chosen as a champion for the Triwizard Tournament.


** linkffn(Hallowed by Shinysavage) fits your request perfectly and is actually really good. Sadly no update since more than a year. The tournament is basically concluded, though.

  Once upon a time, three brothers came up with a plan to change the world forever. Centuries later, wizards still fight over the scraps of their power. However, only one person can truly lay claim to their destiny. AU. Harry/Lisa Turpin pairing in later chapters.

** Linkao3(Consuming Shadows by Child_OTKW)

Consuming Shadows has what you're looking for. Harry's 7th year I think from Beauxbatons so his participation in the tournament is legit. It's set in a Voldemort wins AU and the tasks are different from cannon. It's really good and even the hp/lv slash isn't extreme
