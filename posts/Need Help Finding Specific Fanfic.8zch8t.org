Hello,

There Was This Fic I Read Where Harry Is Not The Boy Who Lived But Still Was Selected As A Triwizard Champion. I Do Not Remember Much Except The Following Points:

1) Draco And Some Slytherins Ganged Up On Harry And Harry's Wand Was Broken.

2) There Was No Bashing Of Dumbledore And He Was Helping Harry.

3) After Harry's Wand Was Broken Dumbledore Gave Harry The Elder Wand But Harry Did Not Know It Was The Elder Wand Until Fleur Told Her Sister A Story In Which The Wand Of Destiny Was Mentioned.

4) Pairing Was Either Fleur Or Tonks (Not A Set In Stone Pairing)

5) The Last Thing I Remember Was Harry Had Killed The Dragon.
