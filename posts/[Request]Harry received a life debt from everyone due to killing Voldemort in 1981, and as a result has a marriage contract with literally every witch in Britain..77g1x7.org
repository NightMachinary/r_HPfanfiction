Harry's goblin lawyer, showing a toothy grin, replied to the increasingly-worried Pansy Parkinson /et al./:

"Typical. Surely your parents'... /unfortunate/ allegiance does not fully stop you from realizing the risk they were taking working under the one you call You-Know-Who? Look at the statistics. 27.5% of You-Know-Who's Death Eaters died either at his hand for being deemed rebellious or weak, or as a direct result of You-Know-Who's disregard for his minions' safety while planning out attack strategies. In fact, strictly speaking, from a mathematician's point of view, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was more of a threat to your parents than they were to the common folk."

Pansy, Daphne and her friends paled and shrunk down under Lord Potter's satisfied glare.

*** I don't think so, Hitler attacked the UK not Grindlewald. And the only attacks that Germany did on the UK were Buzzbombs and sea attacks, and the UK declared war on Nazi Germany, the Germans did not declare was on the UK until the UK declared was on German first.

Also, Grindlewald was the magical attack in Europe countries and not UK. Really, Dumdledore attacked Grindlewald, not the other way.

So if Dumdledore, and that's a big if, has any marriage contracts or life debts it will be in Europe mainland countries and not in the UK.

In my opinion.

** I don't think it's that easy to get a life debt. It seems, from the little information we have about them, that you have to personally and purposefully save somebody from some form of immediate life-threatening danger. Or inherit a debt from someone who did that.
