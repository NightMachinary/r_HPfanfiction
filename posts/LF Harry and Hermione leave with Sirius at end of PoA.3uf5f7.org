Does anyone know of fic where Harry and Hermione decide to leave with Sirius as he flies away on Buckbeak at the end of PoA, showing us what comes after? I saw it mentioned in the author's notes of a fic I was reading and I'd love to know if something like this actually exists! Thanks!


** The only time I've ever seen it is in chapter 5 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8527691/5/An-Incomplete-Potter-Collection][This Collection]].
