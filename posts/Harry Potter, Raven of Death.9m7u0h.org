Sounds super emo, but I have been looking for a story for a while now. Here's what I remember:

Ignotus made a bargain with Death that his descendent would serve him.

Harry eventually finds out he is in the lurch and becomes Death's raven.

Harry finds out Sirius is Death's hound and his grim form was no coincidence.

Can't remember if it was on ffn, ao3, ficwad, or some other site.

Harry has his Raven animagus form and Sirius's Grim form.

*** Negative. I don't read Hermione bashing stories. I don't think she is a paragon of perfection, but the idea of her betraying Harry is as logical as Ron making all O's on his OWLs.
