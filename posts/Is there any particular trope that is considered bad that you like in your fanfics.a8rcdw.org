title, sometimes I feel many tropes have a bad rep surrounding them, is there anything like this that you guys and gals actually like, either by having an actual good implementation or by being a guilty pleasure of yours.

*** There's a German parody of the first two movies where Dumbledore is a pedophile rapper, the chamber of secrets is used to make child Pornography, Lockhart is a porn star and Quidditch is teleshopping.

And it's great because it doesn't take itself seriously. Unlike the average bashing fic, it does not try to sell you the characters interpretations as the truth. It's just there to laugh at Wood's Super Duper Shop and ridiculous porn titles.

**** on the same vein, OP Dark Harry fics are a guilty pleasure. they're pretty standard; he finds out he's a wizard early, gets away from the dursley's, somehow takes control of his gringotts account (discovers dumbledore has been stealing his money), uses a blood heritage test at gringotts, finds out he's lord of like 6 blood lines and is powerful and loaded, etc.

they're not creative and the best writers don't gravitate there but something about Harry being this kid who's secretly crazy strong and manipulative gets me

** I often enjoy Snape as a mentor fics even if usually they're pretty predictable. Really any mentor fic is great because as a teen I felt very isolated and seeked out mentor type figures. I just have a special weakness for Snape ones though even if it's so not canon compliant.

I also really enjoy characters becoming OOC, Snape in particular. I don't usually love the characterization magically going from him being an asshole to the only voice of reason but I don't always love waiting 20 chapters for him to stop being a complete jerk either.

I also really enjoy drug addict/self harm/mental illness fics even though they really don't mesh that well with Harry Potter. It's probably just because that's where my reading interests are. My reading style is much more an angsty teen even though I'm far from high school days now haha

** I guess Lord!Harry fics?

I don't like when he's heir to like 10 different houses, but when he has House Potter and Black under his belt, and Harry makes use of the money and power that comes with it, I really enjoy the fic.

** - too-mature-for-their-age children: as long as it isn't too over the top political intrigue I prefer it over reading about pulling pig-tails.

- magical cores: can be a good addition. As long as they aren't just there to describe the awesome length of Harrys magical penis.

- bashing: I've always liked applying critical though to JKRs characters (I understand how people disagree who for some strange reason like -- as in "think they are nice" -- most of her characters). As long as it's a valid extrapolation of what we see in canon I'm on board. Just don't give me things that make no sense "... and of course Ron has been stealing Harry's money for years"

- optimistic and unrealistic relationships of mutual trust and understanding ("too unrealistic"). Melodrama and relationship-angst do nothing for me ("does he/she really love me?").
