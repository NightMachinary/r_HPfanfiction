So I've read me a good handful of Harry Potter fanfictions, but I've spent almost no time in any Harry Potter fanfiction community discussing them. It seems like every time I turn around, there's some other very, very common, even overused trope that people are discussing and everyone knows what's up. But I'm still left a bit lost.

Is there a primer or a list or something of the types of fics that commonly get brought up, tropes (I know TVTropes, obviously, but I mean tropes that are intrinsic to Harry Potter fanfiction) and like, commonly used plot threads, a pairing dictionary, dear god would that be helpful, and like, explanations of what fic types and tropes connote to an experienced Harry Potter fanfiction reader?

Like: Indy!Harry means blahblahblah. Fics using this trope frequently are of this type and that genre and often culminate in thingy.

** Hmm...there's a lot of detail on the page that Starfox linked, but I don't think it has a pairing dictionary. Here you go:
