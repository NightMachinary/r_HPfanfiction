So many Slytherin Harry stories has him be SUPER cunning/ambitious/smart and other such traits, I'm just curious if there are any where he's not.

Can be on ANY site, am fine with het/slash/femslash.

Would rather not have Lord Harry or Harem Harry stories if possible.

Am fine with characters disliking or hating each other but would rather not have authors bashing a character (if it's possible, which I know might be harder to work with Slytherin Harry stories, so if possible I'd rather not have Weasley bashing?).

Bonus if Harry doesn't become friends with Draco Malfoy (Common thing to befriend them), AND Harry doesn't become friends with Hermione (Too many stories have Harry become friends with Hermione regardless of what house they're in, and I'm just kind of over it). Though it's not mandatory.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine too.

  Harry, tired of trying to get along with his housemates, spends his Christmases at Hogwarts with Hedwig in the Owlery. There, he makes a friend who will stay with him for the rest of his life, and eventually become so much more. HP/NL, other side pairings.

Magical relations in which Harry is in Slytherin and his character is more or less like Canon!Harry. Sadly, it seems to be abandoned.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

He'd been sorted into Slytherin. Could it get any worse? He refused to become a dark wizard, but he didn't want to become some arrogant, dunderhead like his father. Everyone assumed he would be one or the other. Why did he ever think being a wizard was going to make it better? SLASH TNxHP NOT A DARK!HARRY! (Thanks to Zakyla for Summary!)

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.
