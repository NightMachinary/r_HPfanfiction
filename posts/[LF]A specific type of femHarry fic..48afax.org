Well fem!Harry is a bit of a misnomer, I'm looking for a fic where the potter child is a clone of Lily rather than James. Specifically I want to see how Snape responds to this.

  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

"A while back, I wondered what might have happened if, instead of being stuck with a child whom he viewed primarily as James Potter's, Snape had to protect a child he considered predominately to be Lily's."

** There's Arya Lily Potter. It's mostly fluff and i love it to death. It's not very far yet, most of the things happening are pre Hogwarts but it has a fair bit of Arya&Snape interaction in the later chapters. It's quite well written in that regard. I think Snape's character is very well done in this.

Oh btw, i'm gonna quickly hijack this post and ask for anything similar to this story. Anything with fem!Harry that's fairly fluffy will do, really.

  Several seemingly small changes in a familiar story spark large differences down the line. James and Lily Potter welcome their new daughter to the world on July 31st, instead of a son. Amelia Bones corrects an old mistake, and an innocent man is released from prison after six years.

Many fics portrait fem!Harry as Lily's copy and yet still have Snape reacting the old way. That's just NOT plausible.

*** Whether it's "plausible" or not depends entirely on what you think about Snape's character and thus cannot be so categorically dismissed like that.

In my own story I have Snape acting hatefully towards a female Harry who looks like Lily, and I do it for very specific reasons. Snape is motivated by more than just hate for James. In particular, he hates himself for the things he's done and had to do. However, most people afflicted with self-loathing do not engage in the normal actions associated with hate because it's so difficult to attack oneself. Instead, they tend to transfer such behavior to some external object or person - usually anything that reminds them of themselves and/or the reasons why they hate themselves.

And what reminds him of all of the worst things he's done more than a mini-Lily? This makes her the perfect target to work out his self-loathing.

Furthermore, all of this assumes that he genuinely loved Lily, which is highly debatable. All evidence suggests very strongly that what he cared most about was how Lily made him feel, not about her and her feelings. He cared about what he got out of their relationship, not what she got. That's understandable, since it was an attachment he formed as a very young, immature, and abused boy, but it's still not love. In that case, he has a further, albeit twisted, reason to hate a mini-Lily: she reminds him of how the likely only source of good, happy feelings for him rejected him. Any sort of love or affection can be twisted into hate, and if the "love" he felt was only the love of how she made him feel, that would twist much more easily since it was only ever about him and his needs in the first place.

So a female Harry that looked like James would be hated, but a female Harry that looked like Lily would, I think, possibly be hated /even more/. Snape is not a good person - he has not shown an ounce of kindness or affection to anyone in his entire life aside from Lily (and maybe his mother, but we can only assume there) and that fell apart when she rejected him. A female Harry's connection to Lily makes her a bigger target for his nastiness than she would be if she were just some random girl who happened to look like Lily - and such a person would not be the recipient of random, unexpected politeness from him.

And that's why Snape is nasty to the female Harry in my story. It's just not in his character, not even in canon, to treat her well.

Not plausible? Quite the opposite, I think.

also the entire reason he protects harry

so he evidently cared enough about her feelings to reform himself and sacrifice his life for the cause she risked her life for

and you can reasonably read that he cared about dumbledore. he also has a rapport with filch, is implied to be friends with the malfoys, and stans for the slytherins in general

he hated harry because his similarity to james led him to project his hatred of him onto him, it's not unbelievable to write that someone that looks like lily may cause him to be kind to her to atone for his sins

nor is there anything to suggest he resents her for 'rejecting' him.

I'm talking about what's in the actual text of the actual books, not the author's extra-canonical commentary. Her failure to communicate what she was thinking is just that - her failure.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Where "protects" somehow means "makes his and everyone else's life miserable." He's a nasty, vile bully. That he happens to be a bully who also wants to see the end of Voldemort doesn't make him a better human being.

Granted, there were worse people in the world than him, but that's not exactly a high standard to meet.

#+begin_quote
  for the cause she risked her life for
#+end_quote

Risked? Correction: she /died/ for it. And the "cause" was the protection of her son. Snape didn't "sacrifice his life" for Harry, he constantly made Harry miserable. Do you think Lily would have approved of how Snape treated her son? Of course not. Would she have approved of his attempt to save her at the expense of the lives of her husband and son? Again, no. What exactly did he think would happen to her - would she have been allowed to just walk away, free as a bird? Not likely. Her fate likely would have been worse than death.

All thanks to a "reformed" Death Eater who avoided being punished for any of the things he did before turning spy.

Some atonement.

#+begin_quote
  he hated harry because his similarity to james led him to project his hatred of him onto him
#+end_quote

...which is sufficiently unacceptable from /any/ adult, but completely beyond the pale for a teacher. Harry at his worst was more mature than that. And it doesn't excuse similarly vile behavior towards... almost everyone else.

Your "defense" of the nasty little man only makes him look worse, not better.

With "friends" like him, who needs enemies?

hmm. that snape is reformed and performatively heroic while still being callous and loathing his job /is/ accepted by others, and by the ww/harry in-text. all of that can be read from canon. i'd argue that for narrative and thematic coherency...it should. though i agree that it wasn't explicitly portrayed (evidently)

'protects' meaning 'work towards destroying major threats i.e. voldemort and other boogeymen', etc.. and yeah, a jerk who works towards saving lives and destroying a fascist is much better than a jerk who doesn't do that.

the 'cause', was the cause i.e. anti voldemort, anti-muggleborn discrim. he consciously devoted his life to fighting voldemort and protecting harry, but didn't including basic civility as a part of that.

she wouldn't have approved of how how treated harry. she might have approved of the safeguarding of his life/the lives of others and the destruction of voldemort, i'd imagine. snape made the impulsive decision to ask for lily, likely assuming james and harry were dead anyway. he did agree to save them when it was pointed out to him, and i think he would have if he was thinking clearly, which he wasn't. the justification being that he agreed to protect harry for lily when dumbledore framed it that way to him

he didn't go to azkaban because he made a deal with dumbledore to turn spy. retributive justice is pointless at that point.

Yet, you provide nothing from canon to base your arguments on.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

He was following a magical vow he gave to Albus, and is regularly shown being upset when asked to do things based on that vow. At no point in time is he depicted as actively and consciously believing in such a cause.

Voldemort took away from him something he wanted, even after promising not to. At no point is Snape shown having any other motivation against Voldemort and Voldemort's cause.

#+begin_quote

Because Dumbledore had the authority, all on his own and without input from others, to forgive him of every single crime he committed before and after taking the vow to obey Dumbledore? Hardly.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It's better than no justice whatsoever, and none of those wronged by Snape are shown as having received justice of any sort.

#+begin_quote

Yes, he was specifically an unmitigated ass and a bully. Having such reasons to mistreat a child isn't a "defense" and offering them only makes him look worse.

i mean, neither do you. he agreed to protect harry out of love for/to honor lily. he shuts down anti-muggleborn slurs when used in his presence. he's aware of his job and it's relevance on the order, and you can infer he takes pride in it.

#+begin_quote
  “That is just as well, Potter,” said Snape coldly, “because you are neither special nor important, and it is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is saying to his Death Eaters.”

  “No---that's your job, isn't it?” Harry shot at him.

  He had not meant to say it; it had burst out of him in temper. For a long moment they stared at each other, Harry convinced he had gone too far. But there was a curious, almost satisfied expression on Snape's face when he answered.

  “Yes, Potter,” he said, his eyes glinting. “That is my job. Now, if you are ready, we will start again.”
#+end_quote

he places value in saving lives. all of those are in opposition to voldemort and everything he does.
