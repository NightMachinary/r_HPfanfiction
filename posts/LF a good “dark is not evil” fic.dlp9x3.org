Something like linkffn(No Competition by EvilGoddss) but with Harry taking a more active role in things. Lots of dark community building with Harry as a prominent figure in that would be a massive plus.


** Harry Potter and the Unforgivable Tournament linkffn(10707993)

Surely there are some instances where the Unforgivables are forgivable.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

** linkffn(saving Connor by lightning on the wave"

*/Extremely/* long 7 book story. Harry is gay, lots of dark magic building and pureblood etiquette and traditions. My only real complaint is Connor pisses me off a lot but I guess he's supposed to. Overall a very different take on the whole HP story than most fanfics.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** A really great "dark magic culture" fic: linkao3(20049589)

Harry is re-sorted into Slytherin and finds himself drawn to dark magic. It is a Draco/Harry story as well as a WIP FYI.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he'd been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12723942/1/Out-of-the-Night]])

While it does use a lot of cliches prevalent in Dark Harry fics, it doesn't actually make harry an edgy Mary Sue or a pureblood supremacist.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

** I don't remember the name :( but there was a brilliant fic where the govts tried to wipe out dark magic and it ended up destroying /all/ magic, HP had a family and a daughter who tried to help the marginalized “dark” ones (either racial or a natural affinity for dark magic), and HP goes into the past.

I don't even remember if it was finished.

But what I read of it, especially one short scene with the daughter, was very good.
