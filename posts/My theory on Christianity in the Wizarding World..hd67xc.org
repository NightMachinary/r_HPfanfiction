It is likely that anti-magic parts of the bible were magically added by Wizards after the Statute of Secrecy. Or, since there are many Christian wizards in IRL history, Dark wizards placed them there to divide Muggles and Wizards, and erased everyone's memory of pro-magical Bible passages.

Eventually, Wizards rediscovered the original Bible, and thus they follow it's teachings in Wizarding Britain, and the Wizarding West.


** I prefer the explanation in chapter 16 of linkffn(Thou Shalt Not Suffer by TheWizardsHarry): there are horrible problems with our translations of the verse, because all Bible translators were Muggles, and they just couldn't grasp the subtle differences between various types of magic described in Ancient Hebrew which we barely understand (/hapax legomenon/ phenomenon).

Also, alternatively, that verse was more intended towards Muggles. For us, Muggles (at least, I suppose, only tiny minority readers of this note are wizards or witches), trying to do magic is trying to do something which was not given to us, and that is true occult, which is forbidden to us. Whether it is a pure swindle and it is just pure waste of time and effort, or whether occultists somehow gain some unholy power from some demonic forces, is immaterial, it just shouldn't be done. The only example of somebody going against this prohibition in HP canon would be then Mr Filch with his Kwikspell program.

So, TL/DR: I don't think it is necessary for Bible to be changed, and yet I believe that it is possible to be a Christian/Jewish/Moslem(?) wizard/witch (I actually don't know, what is the Islamic position on this verse and magic generally).

  I was eleven years old when I first heard about Hogwarts, but my faith told me everything about that school was evil. This is the story of how I reconciled my religion with the truth about what I am.

** My personal view is that it's unlikely to have happened happen - the Statute of Secrecy came in a few years shy of the 17th century. So we're really only looking at 300 years ago. If we're assuming that 'eventually' wizards discovered the bible then the time frame between the bad reputation and difficulties experienced by the wizarding populations are smoothed out very quickly.

Bearing in mind that wizards theoretically live over 100 years on average (despite dying off early through illness and war in the books), you have people who remember exactly what happened at the time, followed by their children and grandchildren up to the present time.

It seems more likely that the wizarding population simply wouldn't return to Christianity and would have either become secular whilst carrying on some favoured traditions or developed a different religion.

I can imagine that wizards would be particularly keen on Christmas because a mere 50 years after the Statute, Cromwell cancelled Christmas. It seems likely to me that either the minister (or similar role at the time) would either have heard this from the king, or else there were enough older wizards still flaunting just a little bit for the idea to leak in and thus make 'Christmas' and anti-muggle celebration. By the time muggles reversed the law, I presume the tradition could already have been set.

Furthermore, the witchhunts were one of the reasons the Statute of Secrecy came into existence. Witch hunting had been taking place for a century before the statute had come in, most likely resulting from the Little Ice Age. Consequently, it seems unlikely that a Dark Wizard acted after the secrecy came into play.

*** They celebrate Christmas and Easter. They're not following some pagan religion that died out centuries before the statute of secrecy came into effect.

Yeah and I don't really care about the realism, I said that I just felt like they would be pagan.

** I don't remember the fic but I remember when someone asked why wizards celebrate Christmas it was because muggles were worshipping a very powerful wizard because wizards could do things that are in the Bible.
