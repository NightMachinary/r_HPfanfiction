Everyone knows that Charlie Weasley and Nymphadora Tonks raised hell together during their Hogwarts years, but we never got a to meet Bill's best mate , a prankster of such legend that he inspired the twins long before They ever heard the name marauders. Jonathan Rosier, was Bill's Slytherin blood brother, his fellow explorer and the best mate that saved his life

He was the man that should have stood beside him on his wedding day but instead was chained as prisoner in the dungeons of Rosier Manor being kept alive by an elf.

This is not the story of the golden trio but of this dangerous Duo. This is the story of Bill Weasley and Jonathan Rosier the legendary curse breakers and best friends. The marauders may have mapped the castle but these two charted the black lake and liberated the entire Mernation( merpeople).

This is the story of Johnny Row and Bill Breezy the Breakers of the Iron Code. John was the reason Bill Weasley Brought down the wards around Malfoy Manor Single-handed in one night. While Bill was the Reason Johnny made a deal with a djinn to cure Lycanthropy ( it didn't work out as intended Bill just got the ability to change at Will painlessly, But at least he kept his mind after the deal) in exchange for his favorite hair pin.
