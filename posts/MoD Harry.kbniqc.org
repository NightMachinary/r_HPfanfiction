Any fanfics where Harry is the Master of Death? Fanfics where he travels back in time, summoned in another universe or a crossover, any is fine.

Bonus if its slash and completed.


** 1) tell me whether he is dead LullabyKnell Summary: Post-DH AU: Harry suffers a few side-effects of dying but not dying. “Hey, can someone help me with this? The mirror in the bedroom's stopped working for me." “What do you mean ‘the mirror's stopped working'?” Gen/MOD Harry [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637]]

2) Harry Potter and the mountain of pure diamond By Maximonstre Summary: Many, many years after the defeat of Voldemort, Harry has accepted the truth : he is what can only be described as a god. To relieve his anxiety of eternity, he travels between worlds. One day, he stumbles upon one which is far too similar to his first one for his peace of mind. And in which lives one little Tom Riddle, determined to pierce all the secrets of his new guardian...(MOD, au Harry) (slash)

4) Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The_Carnivorous_Muffin Again from the same author phenomenal MOD concept with a lot of surrealism and interesting philosophical questions

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831]]

5) When Harry Met Tom by The_Carnivorous_Muffin its a master of death Time travel Tomarry story Harry is female and usually I don't like gender-bending fem Harry story but her characterization is fantastic, dynamic, and fun.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15676317/chapters/36419703]]

6) you belong to me (i belong to you): Bamf Harry Potter who takes no shit from Tom deals with the Mod aspect amazingly! (One sided attraction Tom has a huge crush on Harry) slash Child_OTKW.\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Child_OTKW/pseuds/Child_OTKW]]

7) What He Grows To Be (angsty but lovely) Severus_divides_into_H Summary: Time travel MOD story were Harry raises Tom with all his optimism and care but still has to deal with Tom's dark side and obsessive traits its very nuanced and written with care. (Slash)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19042240/chapters/45228508]]

8) His Twenty-Eighth Life Lomonaaeren Summary: Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death, some of them not human, none of them exactly like his old one---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now he's Harry Potter again. SLASH

9)*** Pride of A Graveyard Flower by watchingvfall_n_drown Summary: the concept is Harry's necromancy and how he deals with it in a new body he is the mod its slash. Its a super underrated fic Harry doesn't immediately become OP but he is strong determined sassy resourceful and just as willful as canon Harry

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25467943]]

10) Resurrect The Living fascinationex Summary: Circumstance makes Harry an offer he can't refuse. Additional Tags: * Master of Death Harry PotterSlow Burnlike very very slow burnViolenceNecromancyMental InstabilityOther Additional Tags SLASH

11) for as long as you need us ballerinaroy Summary: “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. SLASH/HET

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16957743]]

12) October The_Carnivorous_Muffin Summary: It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. SLASH

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October]]

***13) Harry Potter and the Immortal's Playground May_May_0_0

Summary: When Harry decides to die one to many times, his decision is declined yet again and Death has a (terribly confusing) conversation with him.

-- I CAN SEND YOU ANYWHERE. BACKWARD IN TIME. FORWARD IN TIME. ELSEWHERE.

“Elsewhere?” Harry asks, interested.

YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND.

Harry feels himself beginning to tingle and feels his feet lifting off the ground.

“Now just wait here a minute, I never said I wanted to go anywhere, I just wanted to know what my options were, I was asking a question, and --” Harry's eyes were beginning to close.

HAVE FUN MASTER. MAKE FRIENDS. SEND POSTCARDS. -- SLASH

14) On a Pale Horse » AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse]]

15) Petrichor BlameMyMuses Summary: In attempting to stop Sirius from falling through the Veil in the Department of Mysteries, Harry goes half through it himself before being dragged back into the living world. After the battle, things should have gone back to normal...but they don't. Something about Harry is changing, and he doesn't know why, what to do about it, or just what it means for his future confrontations with Voldemort. GEN

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/690222/chapters/1268184]]

***16) Blood Crest » Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings. BLOODY BRILLIANT STORY!!!

**** Your welcome! I hope you like them! Just wanted to say that the characterizations of Harry is written very well in these fics so no obnoxious indie or Lord Hadrian here which I like occasionally but not my preference. I know you said primarily slash but I hope that you give Bloodcrest a chance too the world building is absolutely phenomenal the first few chapters are a bit dark but then it gets fascinating. Highly recommend it

** Oh! Just read one that checks all of these boxes. Harry, in another dimension/alt universe where the wizarding world doesn't exist uses his MOD abilities to work as a medium in London. Mycroft Holmes hires him for some consulting. It's Harry/Mycroft and I had no idea I would be into that. The same author also does some Newt Scamander/Percival Graves stuff that works really well too.

Here's a link to the Reddit page about the story (which includes a link to the story): [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3s2nk9/harry_potter_as_a_medium_also_a_mycroftxhp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf][HP/Mycroft Story Reddit Promotion Page]]

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)
