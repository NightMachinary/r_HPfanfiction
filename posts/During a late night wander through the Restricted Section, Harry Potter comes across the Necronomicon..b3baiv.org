** It was another late night in the Restricted Section. Harry frowned as his wand poured light over book after book that would likely offer no lead. Who was Nicolas Flamel? Why was he so important? Not having the answers to these questions, Harry searched on.

​

He rounded about a dark corner, and suddenly he felt a chill run over him. He looked around, he didn't quite trust this cloak just yet. No one was there. His eyes went back to the stacks to a book tucked away. He felt strangely drawn to the book. The last thing he remembered was touching the spine.

​

Harry awoke in his bed in a pool of sweat. Was he so obsessed with finding Flamel that he had dreamed of searching the stacks? It made sense, he had never gotten to search a library in such detail before nor had he really wanted to. He gathered his bearing for the day and went to classes like normal.

​

That night, he gathered his wand and cloak and went back into the halls. At the very least, all these excursions meant that Harry could now find the library easier. His eyes were long used to adjusting to the dark, sneaking food from the Dursleys at midnight went a long way to keeping him alive. As he walked down the halls, something felt off. His heart started racing as he walked towards the library, his ears started pounding with the sound of his own heartbeat.

​

Was that something in the distance? A teacher? A prefect? Filch? Harry's breath became uneven but he tried to calm himself down. He walked a different way, not letting his fear take control. Better be Gryffindor indeed. He trusted his gut and found a classroom door that seemed welcoming. Was that whispering behind him?

​

He carefully stepped into the classroom, closing the door behind him. It was then that he turned around and his mind went blank.

​

Waking up again was weird, especially when he found a Carving knife in hand.

*** My try at an opening to an Arkham Horror-esque HP, I see this HP becoming a cultist and eventually creating a ritual that sacrifices Voldemort and Horocruxi to Yog-Sothoth and leads to the opening of the way
