We had a bug there where bot downloads were outdated, in some cases. That should be fixed - all downloads should be up-to-date with the story, now.


** \o/ Yay updates :P

** I prefer [[http://www.fanfictiondownloader.net]], since I don't have to rely on anything but my computer. I prefer PDFs over epub/mobi.

*** Just curious - why do you prefer PDFs over epub/mobi? For mobile devices, at least, I've found PDFs to be atrocious.

**** I don't have a Kindle, and mobile screen feels too small to read anything. Compared to that, I can read PDFs much more easily on my desktop (Windows). I guess it's a habit from college when I used to read PDFs of textbook.

*** [[http://www.fanfictiondownloader.net/]] only has an online version for kindles tho. The bot has direct download links so can be more convenient for people who aren't on their home computer when downloading fanfictions.
