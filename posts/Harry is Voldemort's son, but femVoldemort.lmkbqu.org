Exactly what the title says. I'm looking for fics where Voldemort is Harry's mother, if there are any such fics out there. After reading a fic with fem!Voldie for the first time and reading a ton of 'Voldemort is Harry's father' fics, the idea just popped into my mind.


** I never knew I needed this so much.

Even though this fic isn't exactly Harry being Fem Voldemort's son, but we do have Voldemort being a mom and trying to bond with a moody teenaged Delphini

  Not all wars are black and white, as Harry learns when the second war with Voldemort seems to be painted in nothing but shades of grey. In which Harry is confused, Tonks is overwhelmed, Barty is a genius, Snape hates everyone, Dumbledore is trying his best, and Voldemort is having the time of her life. fem!Voldemort

** I doubt there's one that specific out there. It rare enough to find a fem!Voldemort fanfic in general. Half of them have fem!Harry, which I have no interest in. I would 100% read a fanfic like that if one is ever made though.
