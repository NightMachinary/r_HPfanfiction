Hullo again, Zee's pampering her little self with whatever you find, found or going to find. Typos are to be expected, SwiftKey hates me still. Not a top notch of wording too, but if you want to blame me, simply downvote, have not yet broken a rule AFAIK.

Pleasantries are over, straight to the business. I want no Guest Star type of fic (aka "Vash or one of other characters gets to wizarding world"), yet feel free to suggest one if G.S. is not much overpowered in comparsion to native characters. Stampede with magic? Too op, for my liking, he is dangerous with no weapons, give him magic? What for. Millie is a witch? Okay, let her be, let her fly, she is not that much if treat as far as human powers go. Priest can wandless magic his way out? Thats OP for my picky pricky self, but him with a wand should be alright. Also sorry, smoking hot smoking priest, for the love of god you believe in, cant remember your name.

I want a blend of characters, switcheroo of main, active heroes, golden trio as golden quartet with priest, two girls and Vash, or maybe the opposite, with Riddle being put in place of Knives and so on. Such niche, rare stuff, which i can't afford to look for myself. The cast of one series being put in place of, or together with, cast of others.

Once again, G.S. Fics are not precisely what i want her, but they are acceptable too. Kinda...

Many thanks and kuddos for knowing, or finding out, about this jem of a title, Trigun. Such nicely written stuff, such glorious stuff..
