:END:
I don't remember where this fanfic is from but its snape taking care of harry. I remember a part where harry got caught by Voldemort and forced snape to take harry's eyes out with a knife and they escape but when harry is in the medical room in hogwarts he gets a nightmare and starts screaming for snape because he trusted him and felt safe with him.

I want to read it again, does anyone know where i could possibly find this story? please let me know.
