** With regards to DL;DR, I feel that you have to differentiate between criticism aimed at the execution of a story, and criticism aimed at the basic story idea itself. As I see it, DL;DR is aimed at people who complain about Harry being gay in a Drarry story. If you don't like the basic plot of a story, you really shouldn't read it, but at the very least you shouldn't complain about it. Criticising how the plot is delivered is another thing.

I think most readers will have at least some expectations after reading a rec, or a summary.

*** I have found 'DL;DR' style 'warnings' as being a great arbiter for if I would even want to read the story in the first place. In an ideal world, yes, this warning should be used towards deflecting people away from complaining about the stated plot of the story. In reality I have often found it being used to deflect from how the plot is delivered.

I don't really know how to comment on that without coming off as rude, but seriously, my point was that his comment can easily be taken by people as “someone trying to make a ruckus and not at all wanting to be constructive” which counts point-for-point as a comment that doesn't contribute anything to the discussion as far as people see it. So I don't really see the point in you attaching this comment to mine as if you were trying to explain that I am somehow wrong.

But maybe I'm just mistaken and you are trying to elaborate for people who would miss that point ... I don't know, I don't think so, but it's a possibility.

** Re: DLDR: It's the Internet. If you put your stuff out there, you should have a default expectation that someone will shit on your fanfic for whatever reason: it sucks, the reader had a bad day, etc. There are always trolls lurking. Also, someone might enjoy reading badfics to then shit on them.

Re: reader expectations: why the hell not?

Re: Patreon (and other such associated shenanigans): People who do that are cunts. I thought we were agreed that fanfic is not for profit and exists in a morally and legally grey area. Let's not poke the freaking bear, eh? Because by the law of sufficiently large numbers, a day will come when someone will go, "let's shut down the cunts who are profiting from our IPs".

Re: writer expectations: I think I'm entitled to expect feedback and whine about the lack of it in the privacy of my head, but I would never announce it because I find it embarrassing. As for the free entertainment angle, I direct your attention to the word "free". Look, in the age of memes, if you do something that people like, word of mouth will spread and you'll look cooler for not having e-begged for reviews. Sometimes it just takes time. Sometimes your stuff just doesn't find a big audience. Take what you get, I say.

#+begin_quote
  Quite a few fics have DL;DR (Don't Like; Don't Read) written in their summaries. This is a way of writers shielding themselves from negative reviews and criticism. What do you think of it?
#+end_quote

I don't have a big problem with that. Many reviews are worthless, criticizing for not living up to /unreasonable/ expectations, or praising chapters so awash in spelling errors that they're nearly impossible to read. If you want constructive feedback, get a beta reader.

#+begin_quote
  Do you think a reader is entitled to have expectations from a story they click into?
#+end_quote

Yes, but mostly from reading the summary. I expect slash or MPREG to be mentioned if there's any. I don't mind slash, but many do, and MPREG is definitely not mainstream. Unexpected slash leads to bad signal/noise ratio in the reviews.

Personally I +expect+ /demand/ the use of a basic spelling checker. I can understand the HP-specific parts can be difficult to proofread, but there's no excuse for misspelling regular English. I also expect a bare minimum of basic knowledge, like what kind of currency to use. Dollar bills in England is inexcusable. Jumper/sweater and trainers/sneakers mixups are acceptable. I'm undecided about pancakes for breakfast or S'mores.

#+begin_quote
  Some writers set up Patreon accounts, where readers can donate money to them and get early access to chapters and stories. What is your opinion on writers doing that, and does that change your opinion about expectations in any way?
#+end_quote

Don't care too much about the money aspect. If the story is good, I can wait for the next chapters. If it's /very/ good, then ... but that rarely happens. I usually stay away from WIPs anyway. It's a completely different can of worms to benefit financially from another person's intellectual property.

But it raises my expectations sky high. The story had better be technically perfect. No homophone mixups as in their/there/they're. No misspelled incantations, like "stupify" or "alohamora". No misspelled names, as in McGonagle or Hermoine.

#+begin_quote
  Finally, do you think that writers are entitled to reviews/kudos/favourites from readers that fully read their stories since they basically provide free entertainment to them?
#+end_quote

Yes. The worth of that depends on the reader giving it, so it's definitely not a mark of quality. But it's nice for the author to feel appreciated.

** 1. I think it's fair enough, to be honest I probably won't click on it because it sends a signal of a certain type of fic/writer, but I think it is reasonable to just view fanfic as a hobby and not want criticism. Not everyone does want to improve their writing and not everyone has a thick enough skin to handle the often very blunt way people can respond. When you're writing a fic with drastic changes or themes people like to shit on, like mpreg, or something, its probably very dull to have to read the same old criticisms over and over again.

2. I think it depends. It is reasonable to expect clear English and for the fic to follow the warnings it has given - I don't want to read a fic with rape in, so I avoid those that have that warning. It's horrible when it pops out of nowhere and the author hasn't included a warning tag for it. But I don't think it's reasonable for people to expect professional quality writing. Let's be honest here, the vast majority of fanfic writers, myself included, are amateurs and hobbyists at best. Perhaps they have ultimate ambitions to write professionally, but if they were at that level they would probably be writing some original stuff rather than fanfic. I know there are odd examples here and there that buck this trend, but at the end of the day you're getting free content from hobbyists.

3. I am very uncomfortable with this. I won't elaborate for now because I've had this discussion multiple times and I don't particularly enjoy it. But no, I would never pay.

4. It's funny, a few months ago I would have said that while obviously readers aren't obligated to review, it's the least they can do after finishing a fic. I still feel that guest reviews are almost always worthless. However, my latest fic, though it's getting a decent lot of favourites and follows, has low traffic and low review numbers. My last chapter got one review. This is directly after Aurors which was getting ~20 reviews per chapter. My goodness it has been freeing. I thought it would bother me and it did slightly, at first, but there's so much less pressure and I can write it just for me now.

***** You are kind of missing the point.

It's not all that hard to make a story that is an original story simply inspired by one that already exists, even if it would be fairly similar, rather than just a fanfiction. As such, it really wouldn't take all that much effort for any writers who want to get money for their stuff to write an original story and not just a fanfic. This means that if they wanted to get money, which they should in no way get for a derivative story, they should instead get it for an original story writing which is guaranteed to be within the realm of their abilities if they managed to write derivative works.

/That/ is what makes it unacceptable: with just a bit more effort they could be getting money for a story with which there would be no issue, but instead they are jumping through loops like that and that is something that, if or maybe when noticed, could result in a huge mess.

******* This sounds like you have quite a big bone to pick with them. And that makes you sound very biased, which in this situation only serves to show you as someone who came in to complain and throw eggs at other people.

There are people here whose behaviour I find grating in one way or another, sure. Everyone has people like that. But I do try to not hold a grudge because sometimes it's not intentional and so being hostile serves nothing and in the cases when it is intentional actually caring about it is a waste of energy. If you find that people being “self-righteous” is grating for you then so be it, but trying to put them down for it really gives you nothing but a negative public image.

That said, ScottPress's way of expressing his opinion about the “money for fanfiction” bit is a bit out (rude, that is), sure, but that's a problem with the attitude rather than with the belief that made it appear; and honestly, even if I do not agree with the attitude, I can agree with the sentiment as trying to get money for fanfics is a very shitty idea that can actually have very bad consequences not only for the writer doing it but for many others too. TE7's comments, on the other hand, all seem very sensible and not at all rude here, so your attempt to include him here really doesn't do you any favours because given the choice between him and you I am very ready to say that you are the person with foaming mouth and bloodshot eyes.

Also, I happen to actually agree with them that trying to get money for fanfiction is a fairly bad thing to do, because as an actual author I am well aware that if someone is able to write fanfiction then they are also able to write original works and with minimally more effort they could be getting money for that instead of putting creations of a lot of other people at risk.

***** Would it really be that bad if they started selling unregistered handguns out of the trunk of their car to pay for the essentials of life?

It's still illegal. It's still infringing on intellectual property. Right now, most Authors who have gone on the record about fanfiction find it distasteful but accept that there isn't much point to do anything about it because the other creator isn't profiting from it. Websites like Fanfiction.net do have a large disclaimer you agree to before posting siting spefic fandoms they will not allow fics in at request of the author.

When profit comes into the equation it changes the dynamic completely. The creator of the pirated work has no leg to stand on in the event that the original creator decides to do anything about it.

It's not out of the realm of possibility that say as an example, JK Rowling would say "wait X amount of people are making X a year using MY intellectual property with no credit given back to me?" she could, in theory, have a lawsuit against Patreon for funding the theft of intellectual property, Fanfiction.net for hosting and profiting via advertisements from the theft of intellectual property, and the writer of the pirated content.

If JK Rowling said 'Remove all Harry Potter fanfiction from your website' it would be gone in minutes and the writers of Fanfiction accept that when they agree to the terms of posting.

While this is an extreme case, it's an example of what could, rather easily, happen if a cottage industry of profiteering from fanworks existed.

As a whole it's a very slippery slope that is, for the most part, ignored because it's not big enough to really matter to the original creators of the content. And it's best for everyone involved if it stays that way.

Also if you have enough time to create enough fanfiction to warrant being paid for it. You also have enough time to get a part time job somewhere to help with your bills.

In another fandom I'm in, the creator has explicitly stated they don't want people to profit from 'merchandise'.

** 1. I can't imagine discouraging someone from reading what I've written. Seems counter-intuitive to me.

2. Yes and no. Expectations about plot and pairings and what not are some of the worst things in fanfiction. The 'expectation' that lead characters will wind up in a romantic relationship, or instantly fall in love, is annoying and leads to a far worse story. But quality wise I think the writer is obligated to, at least, do their best with the story. Of course, every writer has a different best.

3. It is, at best, unethical and at worst, illegal to accept money for fanfiction. Even going about it in a round about way is sketchy. This is the exact type of thing that if it grows more prominent could lead to a crackdown against fanfiction. This is exactly the kind of thing that if it becomes prominent, will lead to the people that own the copyrights on the original works to be upset. And that could easily lead to say, JK Rowling's Lawyers approachign Fanfiction and saying 'remove all Harry Potter stories from your website' and they would do so immediately.

4. No. Just like the writer owes the reader absolutely nothing, the reader owes the writer absolutely nothing.

** 1. In terms of DL;DR, I like to think that it's not so much to do with criticism as it is to do with 'flaming' or just being an ass in the reviews. I've received anonymous hate in reviews on my work and I just censor them, as I don't think of "hur dur this is dumb" as a valid criticism. I do think that you should be able to express criticism in spite of a DL;DR notice, but that said criticism should aim to be constructive, and then everybody wins.

2. I think a reader is perfectly entitled to have expectations, everyone does, but they should try and keep them in perspective - fanfiction is a hobby, a work of passion for the subject more than anything else, and expectations tend to adversely affect the reader most, as they'll be the one that's disappointed when they aren't met. Open-mindedness is better (in my opinion) for a reader's enjoyment of a story.

3. For fanfiction, they shouldn't take any money - whatever the size, scope or quality of a story, if it's fanfiction it is in my opinion unethical to accept money to write it or for any reason related to it. Period.

4. I think that writers are perfectly entitled to expect feedback - if you didn't want people to see/read your work, you'd never post it online, after all - but that it still remains the reader's right whether or not to give that feedback. If you don't get enough feedback, just let it go, because there's nothing you can do to force readers to give you feedback across the internet. Well, nothing except refusing to post chapters unless you hit milestones, which has happened a few times that I've seen, and kind of disgusts me with the desperation that it implies.

** I can understand putting a "DL;DR" on your story, but a lot of the time I see them, it feels more like an author forewarning people that the work might not be quality. "DL;DR" is something I do anyway, like if I find I don't like where a story is going, I'll just close the tab. Putting it at the end of your summary or in an author's note just feels like an author not wanting to hear anything negative, no matter if it is constructive or not.

I think that it's okay for a reader to have expectations, but they should understand that if a story goes in a direction they don't like, they can give their opinions on why they didn't like it, but do it in a respectful way. There's no point in simply posting a review on a story blasting the author for being a piece of shit who should die because his story isn't following your expectations. Basically, just don't be an ass about it. The only expectation I have from stories is proper spelling, grammar and consistent characterization. One thing I really hate is when an author presents their characters in a certain way, then has them suddenly acting completely OoC for the story or holding the "Idiot Ball", just to reach a plot point (especially if they include an author's note saying, "I'm sorry, I know it doesn't make sense, but I didn't know how to get the characters where I wanted them otherwise").

Patreon is something I don't really have an opinion about.

I think writers should ask readers to "Please read and review", but not expect it from them. Just like you aren't getting paid to write your story, they aren't getting paid to review it. It's fine to complain in your head, but I'd draw the line at complaining in the story itself or holding updates hostage until you get the desired amount of reviews.

It should be common sense. However, humans are bad with that, so a reminder by the authors is good. I'm not sure if it helps, but saying "I don't want to be ripped apart in the reviews on this site" is something okay to say. After all, as you say, it's done in their freetime.

I'd only subscribe to something like this if it's a story I found truly exceptional, that I expect to get a lot of enjoyment out of.

** Excellent questions! I feel like over the years my expectations have been set higher and higher, mostly due to coming across some fantastic works which really raise the bar. The bonus of that is it also raises the quality of my own writing, but the downside being is its a lot harder to find fan fiction at the quality I've come to expect.

In response to the questions: 1) Personally, I tend to skip author notes in stories. It breaks the continuity for me. I would feel that DL:DR is pretty safe to assume - I can't understand why someone would continue to read something they don't enjoy purely so they can hate on it in a review. I am also strongly irked when authors explain what's happening in the plot in basic terms (I should know what's happening by how you wrote it, if you need to explain further, edit the chapter) and I don't like being questioned about where I think the story is going purely so I leave a review.

2) whether you're entitled to or not, I think everyone has inherent expectations. I think it's fine to know what you like and what you're looking for. And there's no story that everyone is going to love anyway. I've seen rave reviews on stories that I've found painfully bad. People's tastes are so varied, it doesn't matter if you don't meet some people's expectations.

3) this is the first I've heard of Patreon accounts. That certainly changes the game. If I was paying for a story I would expect updates fairly frequently, and I would be after a quality of writing that you'd find in published books.

4) I don't think that everyone that reads your story needs to favourite / review it. It throws off the search results when filtering stories by popularity. Just because a lot of people read a story doesn't mean a lot of people liked the story, but if everyone favourites it it will rank higher than another story that is possibly better written. If I really like a story, I'll review and add to my favourites because I want to thank the author and give them a boost.

** Everyone is entitled to their own expectations, but you really can't hate on an author when they don't live up to those expectations.

I definitely think writers should be allowed to use Patreon accounts. The majority of fanfiction authors that use Patreon write a lot, so they should be allowed to ask for donations.

Writers shouldn't be entitled to reviews, favorites, or kudos if a reader reads through the entire story. But I do feel that if a reader really enjoys a story they should let the author know.

If they write original content and not fanfiction, then do as you like, but Patreon for fanfic should be met with extreme prejudice and hostility until whatever cunt set it up is cowed into shutting it down.

** 1.) DL;DR is IMO imperative unless they decide on not bashing anyone, not giving Harry a pairing, and not making Harry female. Although, if I see a story that I think has potential and I tell the writer that they're doing a pretty garbage job at making their vision come to life, DL;DR isn't an excuse that works on me.

2.) Yes. What is the point of writing stories on the site and publishing them if the quality is sub-par? I get that they write it in their free-time, but in all honesty, they can write in their free-time in Microsoft word if they have a problem with critiques of their work.

3.) If someone was doing something crazy big, like creating a giant expansive world, re-working the entire series, adding pictures for each chapter, etc... Then yes, I think Patreon is worth it, as you're paying for quality. But some of these writers are so entitled, they think that just because they're the #1 writer of Hermione/Severus one-shots with overgrown cliches, that they can hold their stories hostage because no one subs to their patreon. I've yet to see someone make a good au Harry-centric fic, not going to shell out for someone who can't even compare to Taure.

4.) Firstly, reviews don't have to be positive. In fact, most of the most reviewed stories on ffn have terrible reviews. Secondly, no, they're as entitled to likes and favourites as a youtuber that actually gets paid for them, which is to say, not at all.

** Everyone has expectations, everyone judges. They're lying if they say they don't. What matters is if they act on that. Personally I tend to judge stories for having a DL;DR in their summaries and tend to stay away. Any story where someone feels they have to justify their work tends to be full of the justification instead of story and plot. There might well be examples of good stories with it in but the DL;DR suggests a certain frailness with the author that can negatively impact the story.

Reviews, what do authors want from a review? For everyone saying I like this there will likely be some that don't. People who take the effort to review are either doing it because they're kind or they're a little bit more extreme on either side of the like dislike spectrum. A review could be criticism on a story or an observation, are either of which going to change much? For example I didn't like some of the decisions in 'The Merging'. I stopped reading it, it was my choice and the author has every right to write however they want to regardless of my views. Should I have left a review saying I loved it until this point? Does that help, the encouragement might be nice but I'm also saying I'm, abandoning their story as a reader. Does that cancel out the praise? To some special snowflakes they'll take it badly whereas some people might say fair enough. Either way I doubt they'd change their story unless they are writing it for me not themselves.

I don't review. Its because I tend to be quite a blunt (tactless) person, without knowing the author I wouldn't want to leave anything but praise because I don't feel I have the right to say anything potentially offensive when it's their story.Maybe I should be posting a quick thank you if I finish a story I enjoyed but what if the story has been out for years? Is there a cut off?

The moral of the story is 'don't actively try to make money on it and we'll ignore it'.

As a whole, the fan creator will almost never be able to win a lawsuit against the original creator. Parody has some differing laws that apply, but the vast majority of fan work is not parody.

As for the great area you mention in another post. I've not done much research into the specifics of it but agree that I wouldn't touch it and you would have zero chance of winning in court.

I did once have someone offer to have me ghost a fanfic for them and pretty much said I wasn't going to go there. Of course that was more because I didn't think that the person would actually pay >.>.

Now that's a legal grey area I really don't want to think too hard about. Someone paying me to write fanwork in their name for them. I think I'm going to go get a drink rather than think about that any longer.

It's just being hired to do work and forgoing the rights to the results of your work; if would be illegal if someone offered you after you finished the work because then they wouldn't be hiring you but buying the product, but if you got paid to write it for them from the get-go then it's all theirs (in the legally feeble way that a fanfic can be anyone's) from the beginning.

** 1. Like some others already wrote, I am fine with it when the author means that people shouldn't read if they dislike the basic plot idea; that said, if it's the actual writing quality that is shit then such an addition in the summary will make me add the author to a “never give another chance again” list because they're clearly lost cases.

2. Well, yes. That said, having expectations is one thing and one can use them to judge whether or not to spend time reading a given story, but having expectations does not make anyone entitled to demand things from the author. Likewise, it's all fine and stuff to have expectations regarding writing quality, but it's really realistic up to a certain level as expecting people who write to actually try writing something that isn't shit is common sense but expecting every single work to be a masterpiece is not.

3. I am fine with people doing that when it comes to writing, sure. But make that /original/ writing and not /derivative/ writing (which fanfiction is). And it really isn't hard to write an original story inspired by something that already exists rather than just go for a fanfic, especially when most people's use of characters and setting when writing fanfiction is fairly loose in its canon-accuracy. As such, I find such things to generally be not good; there are exception but with the ones I remember the authors have both original and derivative works under their belt (or only original works altogether) and release content fairly regularly and the donations are just for people who want to use money to express their gratitude and don't really give them any special treatment.

4. Not really. It's nice to get a sign that people like what they read, but feeling entitled to things that depend on other people is fairly selfish and arrogant. If people don't do anything of that sort then so be it, it's their choice and if they want the author to create anything similar in the future then it's probably the worst choice they could make, but yeah, no entitlement to them choosing to do one thing or another.

** - DL;DR is worth about the same as a disclaimer: absolutely nothing. It also screams uncertainty and amateurishness about one's work -- no one is free from criticism.

- Readers should expect something /readable/ ... and that's about it. Quality is a crapshoot when it comes to free shit.

- Asking for money in exchange for fics is a bad idea. Beyond bad. Fan fiction is a legal grey area that is allowed to thrive because it /IS NOT MONETIZED/. Fan fic writers are using the IPs of creators by the grace and/or willful ignorance of those creators. Anyone who does try to get money or goods for writing fan fics is at risk of ruining the whole thing for everyone else by breaking that trust -- and they're risking legal troubles too.

- Writers should get feedback or favorites if readers want to give them. Some fics simply don't deserve them.

  What do you think of it?
#+end_quote

It should go without saying. I expect literally nothing from any fic. As you said, these are stories written by people for the fun of it, without thoughts of profit or fame to their real name. So if you don't like what you read, leave; close the tab, maybe leave a bit of feedback as a review if you feel strongly about something.

#+begin_quote
  Do you think a reader is entitled to have expectations from a story they click into?
#+end_quote

Only in terms of not being tricked into reading something the reader hasn't looked for, meaning that fandom, category, summary, rating and all that stuff should represent the story. That also includes to a lesser degree certain basic things like not bloating your chapter count with 500 word chapters, not doubling your wordcount with needlessly long AN, and so on and so forth.

#+begin_quote
  Some writers set up Patreon accounts, where readers can donate money to them and get early access to chapters and stories. What is your opinion on writers doing that, and does that change your opinion about expectations in any way?
#+end_quote

The moment people pay them to write, I think you also have an obligation to produce at the very least semi-professional standards. At that point a typo, grammar mistakes - basic freakin' editing, should be the very lowest of requirements. In general I don't have a problem with writers asking for Patreon donations, but I do have a problem with those writers who then don't follow up in quality and dedication.

  Finally, do you think that writers are entitled to reviews/kudos/favourites from readers that fully read their stories since they basically provide free entertainment to them?

No. Its fair to a writer to review his story when it entertained me for hours on end, but they certainly aren't /entitled/ to it.

** When I first discovered HP fanfiction about two and a half years ago as a reader, I suppose I did have certain expectations. I expected to find that the majority of it would be compliant with canon events and would be written in a way that felt fairly compatible with the original material. I expected to find more older writers exploring aspects of the world in mature and interesting ways. I expected to find more of the sort of thing I was looking for (stories about the adult characters who, clearly, I find more interesting than most people do), and I expected very popular stories to be very good. What I did find is that those expectaions were pretty misplaced on the whole.

#+begin_quote
  Quite a few fics have DL;DR (Don't Like; Don't Read) written in their summaries. This is a way of writers shielding themselves from negative reviews and criticism. What do you think of it?

Irrelevant. Who reads something they don't like? And if you're just a troll, DL:DR isn't going to stop you.

** 1. Others have already properly explained it. I don't like Harry/Draco either, but I wouldn't go around finding those stories and flaming the authors about it.
2. On one hand, fanfiction takes a lot of work to write and a fair amount of readers are obnoxious shits about this wonderful free entertainment that they get, so I'd say readers aren't really entitled to anything. On the other hand, if you write a story labeled "Harry/Hermione" and then you spend most of it bashing Hermione and then killing her off, you probably deserve some hate.
3. Nobody should profit off fanfiction. Period. This is complicated though because some writers write original fiction in addition to fanfiction, and it gets blurry when the Patreon is "intended" for the original stuff.\\
4. I think if you enjoyed a story, leaving a review/kudos/like/etc is a small courtesy that encourages the writer to keep going.
