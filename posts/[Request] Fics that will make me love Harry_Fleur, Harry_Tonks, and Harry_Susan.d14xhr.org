There are countless fics that I straight up don't even look at despite their amazing premises simply because they have one of these ships. No multi or bashing, but anything else goes. I just want to be able to read these fics.


** For Honks I always rec Grains of Sand, but Teddy's Excellent Adventure is also fun.

** Harry/Fleur: Follows an OOC Harry who was raised by Sirius Black. This is good, because I don't see canon Harry with Fleur. The story is in first person, features a great Dumbledore, and fun interactions between the subjects of the pairing. As is the nature of fanfiction it is incomplete, but not quite fully abandoned I think. Ignore the author's summary (I realize this is usually a bad sign, but also one of the biggest reasons I don't think the story is more popular)

linkffn(13123652)

Harry/Fleur: Old and often recommended. James Potter's memories meld with a thirteen-year-old Harry after the events of the third book. Also in first-person, and the author is talented enough. Some people don't like it too much, probably due to a mixture of tone and POV.

linkffn(3384712)

Harry/Fleur: Set during and after fourth year. Biggest gripe by many is the infamous “I do not forgive. I do not forget,” line by Harry. Long and complete, rose to prominence because it was well written technically and updated frequently and regularly by the author. Seems people have a love/hate relationship with the story, but fans of rare pairings can't be too picky.

May come back and add more later when I get to my computer, but doing this on mobile is very slow.

  There have been many rumours surrounding me and my life---especially my love life. So, after due consideration---and a few well-aimed words from our resident bookworm---I have decided to publish my autobiography.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** linkffn(8135514) His Angel. One of, if not THE best romantic development Harry and Fleur get in a FanFic, the sad sing is:

1.- It's Discontinued

2.- The autor gives us a "final" and it hurts to read it, The best Fic with the saddest finale.

It's my favorite and the one I hate the most at the same time.

  Starts off from the Quidditch world cup, Harry finds a more important reason to fight for and that sometimes, a fairytale or legend is a lot more than it seems. Discontinued. Sorry.

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.
