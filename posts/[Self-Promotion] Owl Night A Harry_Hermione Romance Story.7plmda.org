I started publishing my newest story, Owl Night, on October 23 of 2017 via FanFiction. As the title of this post suggests, it can be categorized as romance although there is a web of mystery as well that encompasses the characters and the story itself. Shards of horror and action are splintered intermittently. The aforementioned Harry and Hermione are the main players, though Cormac McLaggen, Ginny Weasley, Arthur Weasley, Molly Weasley, Ron Weasley, Eduardus Limus (the Exotic Symbol Analyst of Minister Shacklebolt's Support Staff), and an OC take part with short appearances from Rita Skeeter and Sybill Trelawney.

Summary: Harry Potter's feelings for Hermione Granger change when he learns she's sheltering an orphan child during a troubling time of domestic terrorism and political persecution. Epilogue compliant.

*While it is epilogue compliant, it takes very little hints from the Cursed Child. Also, Ron and Hermione's second child, Hugo, does not exist.

It's updated regularly, about twice every week and it's running towards its end. There's about six or seven chapters left or so. Feel free to check it out if you're interested and let me know what you think. Cheers!

*** No, actually, she's not Minister in my story. However, at its beginning, she does have a job in the Ministry. Therefore, I guess my story is quasi-epilogue compliant then.
