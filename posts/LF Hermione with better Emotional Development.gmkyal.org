Hermione in most fics is dreadful. She's written as literally flawless, or as a horrible character whilst the author defends her, or bashed. She's sometimes written with a Victim Complex where whenever someone calls her out on her bullshit, she starts crying and then suddenly she's in the right (seen fics where she betrays Harry and then starts crying and everyone expects that Hermione is right because she cried about it)

I want to see a fic where Hermione develops better emotionally. Where she accepts she can be wrong. Where she apologises, and isn't massively heartless at times. Even in Canon, she never has to face any consequences for her actions (She should have lost her Prefect Status for scarring Marietta, Snitch or not, you don't permanently scar someone, especially without warning them of the consequences)

Hermione in Canon pretty much mocks Lavender for believing in Divination after Trelawney warns her about something, and then her Rabbit dies. Refuses to believe that Scabbers could have possibly been eaten by Crookshanks (It's a fucking Cat and everyone thought Scabbers was just a long lived Rat at that point) went behind Harry's back about the Firebolt (Harry, you don't just get *insert price here* Brooms as gifts. It's a trap. Ask for a receipt, get it checked on, please, I don't want you to be riding it and thrown off from a curse, I don't want to lose my friend) - would have been how a normal person would have dealt with it, rather than "IMMA TELL TEACHER AND GET THE BROOM TAKEN AWAY WITHOUT TELLING YOU!"

I want to see a properly developed Hermione with an EQ Higher than Walter from Scorpion. Where she comforts Lavender about her Rabbit, and though Hermione doesn't believe in Divination, she holds her tongue and isn't a bitch about it. Where she deals with things properly. Heck, First Year Hermione in canon thought being expelled was worse than dying. I want to see her as a well written character, not as a mary sue or as a Female Walter.

I agree with the paragraph after this, but when you're running a secret, rebellious organization under a Ministry official's nose which basically undermines their dictatorial policies /and/ proclaim yourself as the personal army of their biggest opposition, drastic measures are necessary.

Agree with everything else tho...

As for fics, /Renegade/ linkffn(11302568) has Harry telling Hermione off for pushing her own views onto others, and it's quite well-written. But character growth isn't really emphasized on.

/Defiance/ linkffn(12516323) also addresses this, but it doesn't show any progress/growth in her.

*** I'd agree with the premise if it prevented Marietta snitching as well, but it was just a punishment, it didn't actually do anything but get revenge and tell them who ratted them out. They'd know that anyway as Marietta was there as an informant, and Kingsley modified her memory so she couldn't do any extra damage anyway.

Now if they werent' so stupid as to call it Dumbledore's army and instead called it "We want to Pass our OWLs Club" then Umbridge would have never been Headmaster in the first place.

**** What you are asking for would have required the jinx to activate /before/ Marietta broke the contract. As it was, the jinx deterred her from telling more than she did, since there are some indications that it was incremental.

Also, punishing a traitor after the fact is useful in itself, as a lesson to others who may be tempted, so Marietta got off easy.

If you can make boils appear on a person's face as soon as they snitch on you, you /should/ be able to shut them up before they successfully snitch on you.

And then she says wizards aren't logical.... /sigh/

Maybe. But notice how even the unbreakable vow just punishes you from breaking it; it doesn't prevent you from doing so.

In real world law, there is a principle of contract law called efficient breach theory. This principle states that parties should be free to break contracts, so long as they are willing to face the consequences of doing so. It may be that magical law shares a similar rule.

Why should you? That would require Divination that's far more reliable than anything we see in canon. By analogy, you can't sue someone before they breach a contract, only after.

******* As far as I know, all Hogwarts students, including Marietta, know how to write, so /Silencio/ isn't going to work. Unless the silencing magic actually damages one's vocal apparatus---in which case it'd be a far nastier punishment than the pimple jinx---an ongoing spell effect like Silencio is probably relatively easy to dispel.

On the other hand, the pimple jinx is did exactly what it was supposed to: Marietta clamped up and didn't say anything more after it activated. It sends a message to the traitor and anyone else considering betrayal that there will be consequences.

As I wrote in another reply upthread, she got off easy. They were at war and getting Harry or Hermione expelled and their wands broken would literally jeopardise their lives and, particularly in Harry's case, the fate of the wizarding world. Marietta either knew or should have known this.

In a typical war, that sort of act earns a public hanging, unless it's a Communist regime, in which case they prefer the firing squad.

** A lot of people have been arguing your points against her in the comments and I agree with them. But, I want to add that to EVERYONE'S knowledge Harry was being targetted by Sirius Black mass murderer of 13 people. She knew it was odd for Harry to be given a broom randomly. McGonagall got him a broom first year and Hermione knew Harry would not think about his own safety so she went to McG. If McG had sent him the broom again then the mystery would be solved and they would know it's safe. If not then a skilled professor or two would look at it and assure that it wouldn't KILL one of their students. Hermione had every logical right to turn the broom in. It may have been frustrating, but she absolutely did the right thing. Imagine how people would tear Hermione apart if it had been cursed! "Oh Hermione's so smart why didn't she argue more with Harry about the broom, it's her fault Harry died!" Come on.

** She was a teenager for most of Canon. Adults have a hard time doing and saying the right thing most of the times, and you expect a teenage girl to be full zen??

Binky the rabbit - Her loyalty to Ron caused her to act that way. She didn't want to add fuel to the fire that Trelawney could be right at times. She came off as twisted and it certainly looked like she did not care about Scabbers or other people's pets, but she was trying to be logical about Binky because she didnt want Ron to be scared that his best friend was going to drop dead.

The Firebolt - Yes, you have a point. But she was a thirteen year old girl. She couldn't be expected to do the job of a parent and try and convince. There's also the fact that Ron who was at loggerheads with her would have egged Harry on to try the broom out anyway. So she did a pre-emptive strike and went to McGonagall.

Marietta - She had it coming. In Hermione's defense, she had seen her best friend get attacked by dementors and tried by the Wizengamot for defending himself. She had seen him get physically abused (getting your hand cut is abuse) for sticking to the truth. She had seen him get banned from Quidditch. I'd wager that she was as frustrated as Harry and it came into prominence when she was thinking about what could be done if one of the DA snitched. Again, this was a fifteen year old girl. She was clever, but she was not wise. She can be forgiven.

** You know, we keep having these discussions and fic requests about how mean Hermione is, but nobody seems to be actively looking for fics in which Harry or Ron grow to be nicer and more considerate of others' feelings. I wonder why...

Anyway, here are some in which Hermione's social skills evolve:

- linkffn(Palimpsest by Larry Huss) is probably the most canon-like fic that has Hermione actively work on her social skills. Unfortunately, the author has passed away.
- [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is a non-magical AU in which Hogwarts is a school for superspies, and while social skills are not Hermione's specialty (They are Ron's.) she more than holds her own. Completed.
- linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) and sequels, Hermione develops along these lines, though she sometimes backslides---especially when severely sleep-deprived. (Completed.)
- linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk), Hermione develops her social skills in response to her circumstances, though not quite in the /nicer/ direction.

A few more thoughts:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Unlike halfblood BWL Harry and pureblood Ron, for Muggleborn Hermione, expulsion mean no more magic. Hermione has time and again risked her life for her right to magic. Why would you want to take that away from her?

#+begin_quote
  I want to see a properly developed Hermione with an EQ Higher than Walter from Scorpion.
#+end_quote

I've never heard of Walter O'Brien before, but he sounds like he has more in common with Gilderoy Lockhart than with Hermione. A low-EQ Hermione would be more like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperance_%22Bones%22_Brennan][Temperance Brennan from /Bones/]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_Nor%C3%A9n][Saga Norén from /Bron|Broen/]]. Speaking of Walters, why not [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_White_%28Breaking_Bad%29][Walter White from /Breaking Bad/]]? Starting small, getting into small trouble, and escalating to get out, only to find herself escalating more and more as the consequences catch up with her---that seems like a very Hermione thing to do and an interesting character arc.

More generally, I think that Hermione's rough edges are a part of what makes her an interesting character rather than an actual Mary Sue. Other things being equal, I'd prefer to see more fics in which she responds to the consequences of her viciousness or insufficient EQ not by becoming nicer and more restrained but by becoming more careful and sneaker, becoming the full-on Anti-Hero of the group.

What Harry and Ron don't know can't hurt them. You're only in trouble if you get caught. Memory Charms, Legilimency, Confundus, and Occlumency are a girl's best friends. The ends justify the means. Dark Arts... are probably still too dangerous to practice without expert supervision, but it's important to know the theory, just in case.

I would like to see Hermione lose out on the Prefect badge not because of what she did to Marietta, but because of worse stuff that McGonagall and Dumbledore strongly suspect but can't prove. If the fic gets to that point, I would like to see Harry be worried about sharing Half-Blood Prince's Potions book with Hermione, because of how she might use the knowledge in it. Or, have Harry and Ron learn that both Dolohov and Throwle committed suicide a few months after Hermione obliviated them at the diner---and then wonder whether they should talk to Hermione about it or whether they'd rather not know.

#+end_quote

Put bluntly, this is confirmation bias. It's only true if you ignore all instances of this on one side and exaggerate all instances on the other side. (I wonder why?)

Harry's the lead protagonist, so of course his actions have more consequences than those of the others, but he gets rewarded for his flaws (impulsiveness and recklessness) just as or more often than he is punished, starting with the Quiddich lesson. After his disastrous leadership at the Department of Mysteries, Sirius is killed, Hermione is cursed half to death, others get broken bones, and Harry's punishment is to feel bad about it. After Harry breaks the Taboo in DH, Hermione's the one who gets tortured and gets her wand broken. That was rather inconsiderate of him.

Similarly, what consequences did Ron face for getting Harry and Hermione involved in Draco's idiotic duel? For badmouthing Hermione behind her back (or so he thought)? For exploding at Hermione at the Yule Ball? For turning from Harry in the same book?

For her hectoring of Ron, Hermione is humiliated and almost killed by a troll; for the Firebolt, she is ostracised by her only friends for a good part of a year. She endures being a laughingstock and loses valuable time for her SPEW efforts (which, by the way, is an example of her developing: she learns from her mistakes there). More generally, Hermione does develop more empathy over the course of canon.

And, this doesn't really address my point about demanding "Emotional Development" (in the nicer and more considerate direction) for Hermione but not for others.

#+begin_quote

Fair enough. Harry has just as much reason to fear being expelled as Hermione. And, like Hermione, he repeatedly risks his life to stay in Hogwarts. If it's a good thing for Harry, why not for Hermione?

** I absolutely agree with you. You know, there was a tread calling out Hermione's flaws (similar to this one) just a few days ago and it got down voted so much because apparently some people don't like the fact that Hermione Granger isn't as perfect as they think she is and that she can have flaws too!

I /sirius/ly recommend you to check out *Golden Bullets* on Ao3. It's a beautifully written work of art where Hermione faces the consequences of some things that she has done. It deals with her first ignoring the consequences, then slowly realising the effect of what she had done. The author does not bash Hermione particularly, she/he just makes sure that Hermione isn't let out scotch-free from a punishment for her actions.

I stopped reading when Ginny wrote a letter with stutters, repeated words etc, like it was dialogue? Makes no sense. It also completely villainizes Hermione (Harry literally compares her to Petunia), and the characterisation of Harry(where is the stoic-ness and level head?) and most other characters is completely unbearable.

There's adding nuance to characters and then there's this. Hard pass.

Unlike Harry's, Hermione's flaws are exceedingly difficult to write well, because their consequences are subtle and long-term, and because they can be virtues just as often. This is one of the few fics that manages it without resorting to outright bashing.
