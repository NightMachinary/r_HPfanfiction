I've spent the last hour or so searching, I just can't find it. Hopefully you guys can help me out!

- Pretty sure it starts out post-Hogwarts

- Hermione travels to Marauder Era

- She ends up disguised (paler skin, curly black hair)

- I believe she was a cousin of the Blacks (as her fake identity)

- Mysteriously goes missing (returns to the present)

- When she returns to the present, she's working in the Ministry

- A prank played on her by Sirius has her showing up to work looking like she did when she went missing, thus revealing her identity

- May have been working with Regulus in the present.

For the life of me I can't remember any of the actual plot, I can't remember if it was HG/SB or some other pairing, I can't even remember how long it was (likely 100k+ but...). I'm fairly certain it was on ff.n but that's where I just spent forever searching to no avail.

If anyone knows what story it was, I'd be forever grateful.

*** I think you might be right! I didn't realize it was so short, but flipping through to a random +chapter+ part and it seems to be the right one. I don't remember it being all shoved into three chapters, but hey.

Thank you!

*** Now I kind-of-sort-of want to read this. It sounds like a very interesting plot.
