I, myself, am thinking about starting writing because there are stories that don't exist that I want to exist. Plus it sounds like a fun confidence builder, right until I post it and have everything burnt out of me by particularly critical critics.


** I first began writing TERRIBLE fanfic when I was about 12, because I was bored, heavily obsessed with Harry Potter and wanted to practice my writing for when I became a "real author". This continued until I was about 17, when I suddenly developed a social life and a sense of shame about my nerdy hobby.

Now, within the last few months at the age of 22, I've returned, with absolutely no shame and hopefully better quality fics. I mostly did this because my mum was diagnosed with cancer at the end of the summer, and I kept reading my Harry Potter books to try and escape, before returning to fanfiction after many years once I'd exhausted the books. I wanted to read about Ginny in DH because I was desperate for a strong female character and wanted to see those missing moments, but I was a little disappointed with what was out there. So I just decided to write what I wanted. It's a five and a half hour train journey to visit my mum roughly every other weekend, and I write from the second I board the train til the moment it pulls into my station at home.

Don't worry about critics - the community is overwhelmingly supportive, and when they are critical it's usually easily fixed with a beta.

*** Did you ever make the step to original work or just stop writing all together?

That sucks, my family have just been through a cancer nightmare too, my auntie said that our visits meant more to her than we could ever realise(sorry for the unsolicited support but its an emotional time right now and I imagine your visits will mean the same to her. Sorry that sentence wasn't coherent.) I'm glad you've found comfort through writing, we all need an escape sometimes. Mine was/is reading fanfiction so it all works out nicely.

I'm prepared for my first few fics being terrible and have accepted that they will be and there is nothing wrong with that. The bit about the critics was mostly in jest but I'm glad to hear that the community is supportive.

**** I tried, but I've never really struck on an idea that I feel is good enough, you know? There's still hope for the future I suppose!

I know now that my mum will be okay and she's responding well, but writing really has been a wonderful escape. I hope it becomes the same for you, and I'm sending my best wishes to your family.

No matter how terrible you think your fics are, there are thousands of others so much worse. ;) Only write if it makes you happy, and make use of the community for advice, support and proofreading :) Can't wait to see what you come up with, keep us updated when you publish!

*** I just wanted to make sure someone had pointed out ffn(dumbledore's army and the year of darkness) for you. It's really a Neville fic, but Ginny features very prominently. it's a great and cannon compliant look at life at Hogwarts while the trio are gone.

** I probably have a couple hundred thousand words of various stories in a google doc, but I've never published anything I've written. I just use it as a creative outlet and to improve the quality of my writing. It's fun to compare what I've written recently to what I had written years ago, the difference in quality is astronomical.

** I read one too many Marriage Law stories or their summaries, where Hermione simply goes along with what is basically a rape law, and decided to write a story about how the people who fought and beat Voldemort in a bloody civil war would deal with a government who tried to decide who they would have to marry and have sex with.

** I wanted to know what happened between voldemort's defeat and the epilogue. Now, I write, either because I see a shitty story doing something interesting that could be done better, or I see a lack of a specific type of story and can fill in a hole.

** Good luck! If you're worried about critics, start with one shots and post in a forum like DLP. You'll get lots of feedback to incorporate into your next story, and you won't get burnt out and leave your story incomplete.

After a few one shots your most heinous problems should be fixed, and a longer story won't draw as many horrible reviews that would get you down.

Writing well is a skill, and a skill takes practice. Always remember, if you are getting lots of constructive criticism, that means those giving it think you can get better with practice and you are worth their time to help. It's a complement of sorts!

*** Starting with one shots is really /really/ good advice. Especially the combination of oneshots and DLP's WbA.

I'm guilty of doing a lot of writing and getting nowhere fast with any story in particular - but completing a one shot and getting all the feedback and appreciation from posting it is just absoloutely fantastic and makes writing in the first place so very satisfying.

** Everything I've written has been written either to avoid a doing work or so I stop thinking about the plot bunny and sleep.

Oh, I have to hand in a lab report at the end of the week? That's ages away I'll spend the next couple days working on a fanfic instead...

** I'm about 30k words into writing a fic, a doctor who xover. I saw an article where a fundraiser tried to get David Tennant and the movie trio to make a fundraising short, which I thought would have been ridiculously awesome. (Spoilers, scheduling conflicts, it didn't happen). I then read a (really great) xover fic called "that which holds the image", and in it, the doctor says to Hermione " you were always my favorite ". And I thought yeah, she would be his favorite. She'd be a great companion, quick enough to keep up with him and totally unwilling to take his sass. I LOVED TWHTI, but it was based on harry and it was really a hp fanfic with the doctor in it. It happens exclusively in Hogwarts, etc, and I decided I wanted a fic that was a) Hermione focused where they b) actually use the tardis.

So I did.

** It was/is a nice sideproject to hone my english writing skills. Since its not my native language, a lot of the finer details elude me. You know, the stuff that you just hear during your teenage years.

Writing fanfiction was the logical choice. Worldbuilding and character creation isn't necessary there and I prefer to put the time for that into my main novel project (which is in german). Fanfiction is something you can just start writing from nothing, if you want. The worlds there, you just gottaplay with it.

** I always enjoyed writing at school and was fundamentally dissatisfied with my GCSE creative writing piece.

While I didn't manage to finish the second one in time to submit (thank God, because the original one was significantly better), it did get finished.

I posted it on fictionpress for feedback and realised it was a ghost town. Discovered they had a sister-site for fanfic, which had a much better chance of finding a reader.

Chose Harry Potter because it had the most stories, thus most readers, thus higher likelihood of getting feedback.

More years than I care later, I've written a great deal, finished very little, posted even less.

But I have, at least, got better, even without much of the feedback I originally started writing to receive.

** I asked the following question:

#+begin_quote
  Stray thought for a BTVS SI, but it could probably be adapted for a variety of settings.

  I was thinking that being abruptly inserted into a world like the Buffyverse could have some fairly unfortunate consequences if Drusilla 'Sees' your arrival.

  Has anyone written or read an SI fic where the SI becomes the villain? On purpose or otherwise?
#+end_quote

No said they'd seen any such thing, but the idea refused to leave my brain... Stuff happened... and then my first story was born.

** I found a notebook stashed deep in the bowels of my bookcase not so long ago. Turns out, it contained the first ever bit of fanfiction I'd ever written. I think I was nine, which would have made it 2003 - long before I actually knew fanfiction was a thing or that other people wrote any.

The story was about Harry's secret twin, the girl who lived! Oooh, imaginative. My spelling was atrocious, as you can imagine. It was all done in felt-tip, too.

** When I was in middle school my mom grounded me by not allowing me to read books anymore, even at school. In the past I had written a little, but when it was my only option at school (as opposed to paying attention in class, which was not an option) I got really into it then. There are so many what ifs and parts of the story not yet diverged into, so the Harry Potter fanfiction writing is tempting. Not to mention that it's probably the only use for all of this HP knowledge I have, and the only real excuse for all of the research I do.

** Well, I started writing my first fic 3 months ago. I wrote about 8k words and asked my friends for feedback. I got positive feedback from people who don't read a lot. The one that does read a lot told me he would give me detailed feedback on how to improve my work. After waiting 2 months for his feedback(which never came) I decided to criticize my own work in detail and inform myself on how to improve my chapter 1. I figured out that Harry for all his abilities can't smile words at people. Now I re-polished that chapter about 5 times completely, cutting out and refining things here and there. I hope that it will be good enough so that I can ask the DLP forum for feedback. I want to write something good, something worth reading. I have a couple of ideas and questions of how to approach certain story concepts, I assume I will be able to discuss those with a beta reader once I have one.

** Much like yourself it started with reading fanfiction. Actually thinking about it, it was about this time last year. Having found a forum on FFN that suited me I read voraciously and chatted with others and discovered I had a particularly deep and detailed headcanon and while there were some stories I loved there were many more that drove me insane. Even in the ones I loved there were things I couldn't reconcile with how I viewed the source material. So I began working on a piece that illustrated some of my own theories and headcanon. I also kept reading and acting as a beta to continue learning about the medium.
