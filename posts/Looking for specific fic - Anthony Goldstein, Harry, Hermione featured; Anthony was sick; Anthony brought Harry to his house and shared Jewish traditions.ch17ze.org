:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Can anyone help me out with recalling the name of the fic described in this post title? I don't remember many other details - I think Anthony had an unrequited romantic interest in Hermione or vice versa. He had a serious illness and was overweight. It wasn't the focus of the story but I believe Anthony brought Harry to his family's home to celebrate a Jewish holiday.

â€‹

The only story that's come up in my searches is "Goldstein" linkffn(10847788) which is a good Anthony-centric fic but not the one I'm looking for. Thanks for any help!
