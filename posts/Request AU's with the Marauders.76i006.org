So I admit I don't particularly care for the Marauders Era, there's nothing wrong with it; there's quite a few characters that I like to love from that Era, but the rehash from that Era can be a bit tiring after a while.

It just ends up feeling like you're reading the same fic at one point. (At least to me).

So I'm looking for AU's, specifically AU's with the Marauders as part of the story.

The Marauders can be the main character (or one of the Marauders can be the main character) or another character can be the main character, but it must have the Marauders as part of the story.

It doesn't have to be set in the Marauder Era per say, but they have to be focused on (Lily, Severus and whoever else from the Marauder Era can be in it as well of course). And the story involving them must be AU as I said before.

So they have to be in the story a large portion of it at the very least.

It can be as AU as possible or just a little bit AU.

Do not like character bashing, would rather not have it in the story unless it makes sense and it's not just the author hating on the character.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine

Am fine with most pairings except for Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, no offense to anyone who likes the pairing, I just don't.

  At the Order's third clandestine meeting, Dumbledore pulled Severus aside. Severus kept to the edges in these meetings, anyway, so Lily didn't even notice him go.Out in the cold side alley, Dumbledore put his hands in the pockets of his robes and watched Severus slowly. Severus felt weighed. After a long moment he lifted his chin and looked back."Severus," said Dumbledore. "I am going to ask something difficult of you. It would mean not coming to meetings anymore. It would mean... a lot of things." In the decades they would fight this long, quiet war together, Severus would come to know Albus Dumbledore better than most. He would see him tired, see where his enigmas faded into exhausted despair. He would come to know that this hesitancy was something the headmaster would grow out of-- one day, when asking children to give their lives for the cause, there would be no stumble to this man's voice.

** Linkffn(The Debt of Time)

This is a four part AU that complies with most major canon events, but it rehashes very little. It starts at the end of HBP goes forward to Voldemort's defeat then jumps back to Marauders Era before returning to present.

The Marauder's Era is the majority of the fic. It's complete on ffn, but the author is finishing a major revision. The first 105 revised chapters are up on ao3 uncensored and chapters are being added a few at a time every few weeks. 154 chapters total.
