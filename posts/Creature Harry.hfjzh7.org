Generally looking for interesting creature fics. More prompt-y details would be Harry being Fae on his mother's side. I got the idea of Lily being a changeling, which would explain her striking hair and eyes, and how different she is to Petunia. It could also give an alternate reason for Harry surviving the killing curse.


** I expect you have already read this, but here it is:\\
*Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay*\\
Not only is Harry a dragon atending Hogwarts, but more non-human creatures also join Hogwarts later, and they have to deal with both Blood supremacists that obviously are agains them but also normal "things made for humans only" issues, like a three-headed dog having problems writing for their exams.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Try these:

linkffn(Teeth by hathanhate). Harry is part-creature from an animagus accident.

linkffn(To Ride Upon Svadilfari by Evil Is A Relative Term). Harry and Hermione are hit-wizards, and get converted into part-creatures and shifted into the Marvel universe by their current target.

linkffn(At The Heart Of The Matter by volleygirl). Don't really remember anything about this one.

linkffn(Raw Power by Laume). Crack. Harry is part-creature on his mother's side.

linkffn(Monstrous by The Mad Mad Reviewer). Very good story, but maybe not close enough to what you're asking for.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Siren's Song by hermyd). I haven't read this one yet, but my notes say it involves a creature!Harry.

linkffn(LA Blue Wizard by canoncansodoff). Harry is part sex-demon.

** Elflocks: linkao3(23395243)

Harry has fey blood from Lily's side of the family, and as a result the fey take something of an interest in him. It doesn't seem to give him any /powers/ (at least, not yet - the fic series only covers first year so far), but due to prolonged exposure to the profound /weirdness/ of the fey (poetic speech patterns, etiquette rules etc) he does have a decidedly different mindset.

  Harry Potter has non-human blood. In childhood, he is contacted by his kin and given support and instruction. How will these changes affect his Hogwarts career? He is not the bold Gryffindor saviour people were expecting. He is ready to love the wizarding world, but will it love him back?I expect there to be pairings in later stories, and for the rating to rise.
