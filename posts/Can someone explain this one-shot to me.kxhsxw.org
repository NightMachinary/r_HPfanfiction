#+begin_quote
  autopoiesis. (from Greek, Modern αὐτo- (auto-), meaning 'self', and ποίησις (poiesis), meaning 'creation, production') refers to a system capable of reproducing and maintaining itself.

        Harry James Potter goes back in time to kill Tom Marvolo Riddle. For once, he actually does it. (It's really too bad, what happens next.)

** The prompt from which it is written appears in the comments to the work. It does explain what's happening in that ending, sort of, although I believe it has been written to be deliberately ambiguous. The date from which the time-travel starts is significant, I would say.
