I've read plenty of Harry and pretty much any other relevant Hogwarts girl pairing where they start dating and end up marrying. I'm looking for something a little more realistic where Harry dates a girl for a while and then they break up, either through an argument or peacefully. Then, he eventually gets another girlfriend and so on and so forth until he finds the 'right' one. Basically a more typical teenage dating experience. No slash and I suppose harems work. And no lemons, not because I dislike them but because they lack a decent plot. Preferably 100k+ Thanks in Advance!


** Too Many Dates

What if Harry's friends tried to help him out in getting a date to the Yule Ball and he suddenly found himself with too many dates? Hilarity and romance ensues of course. Harry/Multi and eventual harem.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

*** I would read it but... Starforx5, this guy has a tendency to "upgrade" Hermione to V2.0 while Ron and Harry stay in V1.2 or so, and honestly, that makes his fics kind of "meh" for me

**** In most of my stories, Harry, Ron and Hermione are on an equal level. In this story in particular, Harry and Hermione are pretty evenly matched - and Harry and Ron grow into the best Aurors in the force.

**** That's fair but his stories are usually well written and he completes his fics.
