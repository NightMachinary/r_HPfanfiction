I'm talking about in stories where, logically, they should appear. Do you write them out? Do you work around it (scene ends when the person shows up)? Do you suck it up and give them an important part anyway?

How do you deal with a character you don't like?


** Reinterpret them. Make them more interesting without changing their function. Perhaps Gregory Goyle has a side-interest in architecture, so when he spaces out while gooning for Draco, he's usually looking at all the archways.

Give them pets, hobbies, personal peeves ['I hate chocolate' "I'm sorry, that's just wrong. I was thinking of going easy on you, but I'm going to have to kill you now."], unexpected moments of clarity. Make it fun for yourself and it'll be fun for the readers.

This is great advice. It reminds me of Vonnegut:

  Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.

** Usually I try not to make them the focus. For example, I don't really like Rita, so when I wrote my most recent year 4 fic, I barely showed her at all. It might show weakness in my writing ability, but it's mostly my own personal thing that I don't like reading about characters I can't stand, and it's exacerbated by the fact that Rita's not really a villain, just an morally-ambiguous reporter. It's the same sort of reason that I don't really write Umbridge or Snape into my stories either, and I'm not so weak-willing to resort to bashing. I just won't write them.

*** Reducing them to small parts is definitely the best, IMO, if they really have no need in any particular story. Certainly better than bashing.

I've done the same with Rita in my currently-being-posted fic; an OC owns the Prophet and has power enough to stop articles getting published, which gives me chance to just render Rita redundant and not bother with her as even a minor antagonist. But in a couple of other fics, I've had her get carelessly killed while in her animagus form, once by getting trod on and once by getting eaten by Trevor. It's not a major point, but I just spare a sentence or two for it. I mean, if you're going to run around as a beetle, it's an unfortunate risk...

***** They stay dead in their animagus form, namely a smear on the floor and digesting in Trevor's gut. Admittedly, that's the easy way out and I could have had her turn back human after death, but the fallout from that wasn't something I wanted to deal with in the trod-on fic, and it would mean killing poor Trevor in the other one. Personally I think that would be a more terrible loss than Rita dying.

Vaguely related, but in the trod-on fic, I have werewolves turn back to human if they die while in animal form. I'd argue that a magical person reverts back to their natural state of being in death, and animagi are, in essence, still a natural form. It might not be human, but it's still a form they're suited to, and one they entered in by choice, so they're not forced back to being human after death. Werewolves, on the other hand, are forcibly transformed and being a wolf is very much an unnatural state of being for them, so when they die they revert back to their "normal" body.

****** This is something I've been thinking about lately. I was reading A Difference In The Family (linkffn(7937889)) and it got me wondering about magic and death, but specifically about polyjuice. In that story, at some point during 4th year Snape begins to suspect Moody is being impersonated, but he can't think of who it might be. If he had just killed Moody outright, then Voldemort would not have regained a body after the events of the Triwizard Tournament. But how does a dead body behave under the influence of polyjuice? Do they stay in the same form, or revert back instantly, or revert back after the potion would have worn off normally? It would be tricky if you killed someone you thought was an impersonator, but had no evidence because they retained the form of whoever they impersonated.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

******* Because it's a potion rather than a spell, I do think it'd be different. It would depend on why the Polyjuice wears off in the first place. Is there a time limit to the magical power within the potion? If so, that would suggest the potion would wear off after the designated hour regardless of death. I doubt that's the case, because we've already seen that something as simple as non-human hair can make it overwhelm the time limit.

Is it a biological issue then? That the potion needs to run it's course, so to speak? If it's reliant on a living, fuctioning digestive system, then it probably wouldn't wear off at all. Unless the stomach acids are continue functioning post-mortem long enough to wear away the power of the potion, so to speak. I'm not that educated about human biology and decomposition to know. But then, could the process of decomposition itself affect the potion, making it wear off sooner/later?

If it's more reliant on something like circulation--using the cardiovascular system to pump the potion around the body--then it could go either way.* It might rely on the blood to carry the potion around the body to power the transformation, in which case they would change back sooner than the time limit but probably not immediately, or it might just need to be in the blood to work, in which case they'd probably stay transformed. (At least until they were embalmed, although I personally headcanon that they use spells for preservation rather than embalming fluids.)

*Slight tangent: It'd be kind of interesting if Polyjuice is treated by the body as a weak infection and the effects wear off because the body has healed the "infection". That would certainly affect whether it wears off post-mortem, but it always generates some interesting questions as to how different people react to Polyjuice. Would the time it takes to wear off differ based on an individual's overall health? What happens if your immune system is incapable of fighting it off? Would you get stuck as the person you changed into? Would it kill you, whether immediately or gradually?

** It depends /why/ I don't like the character.

I'm not a big fan of JKR's treatment of the press in the second half of her series, so I tend to write the Prophet as more neutral than its canon counterpart. To that end, I usually just omit Rita Skeeter's involvement in any plot. My OC for that is usually a 'Constance Goodword' in the byline, which I hope is appropriately Dickensian for the HP universe.

Many wonderful people love Draco and Lucius, but I can't stand them so I tend to make the Malfoys rather unpleasant people.

I think neglecting a character just because you don't like them should be avoided unless you have no other choice or they play a bit part.

** The only character I absolutely loathe and can't write without bashing him over the head repeatedly is Snape. Most of my work is post-Hogwarts and next-gen so I'm lucky that he's dead by that period. I had Neville cringe over poor Albus Potter's middle name and comment to Hannah that they should name their future children after more deserving people.

There's one story where it makes sense for Snape to have some what of a role and I know I have to address the issue at some point, but I've been dragging my feet over it. It's a re-write of the series from Harry's sister's POV. I have two scenes that Snape's in and he ignores the OC, speaking as little as he can get away with. The way I re-wrote POA didn't need him at the climax of the arc. I'll probably write his motivations in more of a negative interpretation, without fully bashing him. Like show that his "love" was more of a one-sided obsession that Dumbledore used to gain his loyalty.

** In my stories, Ron is always removed somehow. Sometimes the new situation puts him on the sidelines by force, sometimes hes unable to do something, sometimes he's dead.

But I can't really write him very well. Its always been a walk along the edge between boring and bashing with him for me, so I decided that I just won't deal with him alltogether.

** I typically try to make sure that they won't be necessary for the needs of the story. If that's not possible, then I include them but limit their 'screen time,' since I am trying to write them in character but might fail because of my personal feelings. The less they appear, the less likely that is to happen.

When /that's/ not an option, as is often the case with, say, a character like Dumbledore (someone who is a major player, I mean), I try my best to write them fairly - balancing the good and the bad. It's difficult, but I try my best.

I never kill anyone off because I don't like them - I kill them off because it fits the needs of the story. The story is all-important. My feelings should always come second to it. Otherwise I'd have written a bunch of stories about Umbridge's violent death, hahaha.
