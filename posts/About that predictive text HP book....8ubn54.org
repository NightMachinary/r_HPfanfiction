There's a hilarious animated version of it.

Here. [[https://youtu.be/x-uDnlGJRdk]]


** There are /dozens/ of animated versions, comic versions and dramatic readings of it. For a week or two after it went viral you couldn't type the words â€˜Harry Potter' on YouTube without being flooded by a dozen versions of /Large Pile of Ash/.

**** Hey, hey, I'm not the people who downvoted you. I sure didn't. You meant well and I'm not disputing that, it's just that it was kind of funny that you were annoucing "Look! /A/ hilarious animated version of it!" like it was big news even thought they're dime-a-dozen.

***** I'll be honest here. This wasn't really the reaction I was expecting to my post. I knew it was old and all, but a downvote (thank god it was just one) may or may not have bruised my already hurt ego because of real life issues. So when 2 am me saw your comment, it, er, made me sad to say the least. So my apologies for the passive-aggressive shit I left here.

By the way, thanks for the links, I love them all.
