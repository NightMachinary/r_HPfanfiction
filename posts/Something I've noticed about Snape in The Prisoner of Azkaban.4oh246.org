  And then Snape later on would "accidentally" let slip that Remus is indeed a werewolf, despite his promise to Dumbledore, in a class full of students
#+end_quote

Quite frankly, that part of it I agree with Snape. Albus "Second Chances" Dumbledore probably wouldn't have fired Remus at the end of the year- and no matter what you say in his defense, Remus ran off on a full moon night without taking his potion and endangered 3 students and another teacher.

And sure, he was emotionally compromised- seeing peter's name on the map- but that doesn't excuse it at all in my opinion.

Honestly though I might be a bit biased. I hate Remus. He whines and whines about his affliction, he's supposedly smart but apparently not smart enough as a half-blood to get work in the muggle world- even with his affliction he could likely get on with temp-jobs or medical excuses and confundo charms- it's not unethical if it's just making people follow the law of non-discrimination.

More over, he's the supposed friend of James and Lilly, yet he not once checked up on little Harry? Not even to just make sure he was alright? I can't imagine that. My own best friend committed suicide leaving a pregnant girlfriend who hates my guts by the way- yet I've made sure to visit their son a few times a year as an unofficial godfather.

Strong agree with this. I love Remus but only in Marauder-era fics. I think he must have been really fucked up after James and Lily died, which would explain his absence in Harry's life. However in PoA he is a kind man and a great teacher, so in retrospect it makes no sense.

Also, if he was so smart, as I agree the books try to tell us he is, why would he think his baby would be a werewolf too? He has to know that isn't how it works.

I always thought he probably spent ~10 years barely getting work, probably kept losing his home. Dude was probably too busy trying to survive. And the first several years was probably spent rather drunk.

As he says in DH, werewolves rarely have children. And if they do, I'm guessing it's with other werewolves. Add in the fact that Tonks was a metamorphmagus, and who the hell knows what would happen. Plus, he wasn't entirely rational about it, since one of his greatest fears is infecting someone.

That part I can understand- apparently werewolfs are complete outcasts and the idea of a werewolf having a child was absurd- and no one knew what would happen.

And considering werewolfs are infected by biting- from saliva- whose to say what other body fluids will infect another? And even though this didn't happen on the full moon- Bill's scratches didn't either but still didn't heal right- so who knows what side effects there will be?

At the very least I agree with the fics that show Teddy- Lupin's son- having a taste for rare meat or being uncomfortable on full moons.

Two things about this. First, we don't know the employment laws in the wizarding world. For all we know, they could have no mat/pat leave, sick leave, etc. So we cannot say this is guaranteed. Second, I think in the 5th book they said that Remus would need to disclose this information before being hired, which would limit his chances of a position. I don't know if it would be illegal to discriminate like it is for disabilities, but realistically if someone doesn't want to hire someone for this reason you can do so without letting them know. So I could see how hard it would be for him to get a permanent job. Perhaps if he applied to 'sketchier' places that have a connection with the dark arts it might have been easier. But Remus is pretty anti dark magic so I don't see this happening.

We don't know if he did before Lily and James died. I think i read something that said James had a slight suspection that Remus may have gone bad since he was away so often (missions with other bad werewolves). This is why they chose Peter as secret keeper after Sirius. Although I may have heard all this through fan fiction. After James and Lily died I was under the impression that Dumblefore forbidden everyone from visiting Harry. Probably after 12 years Remus thought it would be ackward to see Harry, or he wasn't in a position to do so.

From the way I read it, Hermione was the only who did.

As for Snape letting slip, you might not say the same if it were any other teacher. One who thought something reprehensible was not being adequately dealt with by Dumbledore, then they /should/ speak up and take action.

You may not think Remus was a danger, but Snape did, and while he has a grudge from bad history I can't say it was a great injustice. Plus with the DADA curse and Remus' personality it was virtually guaranteed he would resign anyway.

Snape isn't a nice guy, and it is commendable to find so much empathy with Remus, but frankly you seem just as biased as you think your friend is.

** 1) The actual quote from the book has Snape requesting the essays to be turned into HIM, not Remus, because when Lupin is sick, it's not just for a day, but a whole week leading up to and after his transformation nights. There is no evidence that Remus ever saw these papers.

2) Snape doesn't assign this paper until after Sirius breaks into Gryffindor dorm, leaving the portrait of the Fat Lady shredded. Snape saw those claw marks and likely thought that Remus was running around the castle in werewolf form. I imagine he went to Dumbledore who wouldn't do anything and felt he had to take matters into his own hands.

*** Snape's unlikable nature is definitely why I like him. He's a hero only by the most technical of margins; is a genuinely awful, bitter, vindictive classroom tyrant; and has a personality that can't make up for his face or lack of hygiene. But he is also undeniably skilled in magic, intelligent, and committed to a cause larger than himself (even if it was for entirely selfish reasons).

The juxtaposition of "heroism" and "repulsive human being" gives him a complexity that seems much more true to life, like the beloved and formidable Dumbledore turning out to have feet of clay.

***** Well, I mean, who /wouldn't/ be depressed? Dude is responsible for the death of what he believes was the love of his life. He straight up got this woman who he had idolized for the vast majority of his life killed. It can be pretty much laid on him, Voldemort wouldn't have targeted the Potters like that if not for him. This is the same woman who he fucked up with as a teen (and according to JKR /somehow/ had a chance with before that), who ultimately married and had a kid with his biggest rival/tormentor (depending on whose side you're on).

Oh, and they had a kid. A kid who you owe a magical debt to, because that same father that got the woman of your dreams saved your fucking life. So you have to watch out for that little cunt who looks just like the father that you /despised/.

Also, you're ugly and a former hated death eater, and everyone knows it. You're basically unemployable, besides for this school positioning, teaching bumbling and moronic children. Also, you hate even being there, because it brings back all the horrible memories of not only you as a student, but also the family you helped destroy.

And lets not forget that Snape wasn't particularly cheery beforehand either.

Not that I'm a Snape lover. Fucking hate that cunt, but lets not pretend he doesn't have serious reason to be bitter and hate everything, including himself.

** Actually snape telling students how to kill or defend it recognize a werewolf was the single most responsible thing any teacher did during year 3.

And the thing is: snape was proven absolutely right.

His fear was that lupin, a werewolf, might forget to take his potion and might attack one or several students. Imagine if he forgot to take the potion inside the school and not outside.

And snape "slipping up"? To be honest this is more dumbledores fault than anyones. Snape shouldn't have to do that because dumbledore should have fired lupin himself immediately after finding out that lupin forgot to take his potion.

** Maybe Snape gave the essay so if Lupin ever did forget his potion (which happened) and students were about to be killed (also happened) they would have a fighting chance. The only reason the trio didn't die is time travel, and there's no way snape would predict that turn of events. Like it's a mean thing to do to lupin and telling the slytherins about lupin is a werewolf is indefensibe, but teaching a defence class to defend themselves from something they may face? Like he practically faced a werewolf when he was a student? This is understandable.

** When Remus returned, he told the class they didn't have to do those essays. Only Hermione was disappointed because she'd already completed hers. So you don't need to worry about him being sad reading through those essays. Although if it was in the textbook then I'm sure Remus himself taught it at some point to at least one of the years.

I'm with those who say Snape was kinda in the right about letting it slip to the students. Without Sirius there, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would have been murdered when Lupin transformed. Remus showed himself untrustworthy by not drinking the potion no matter what else was going on. Next time someone really could have been killed. Besides, the curse on the DADA job would have gotten Lupin in some other way had Snape not dropped hints. Perhaps it was kinder this way, some other teachers have not left that job alive!

The degree from the ministry was written by Umbridge, not any parents of students. Umbridge hated "half-breeds" and would have written this law as soon as she had power to do so, regardless of what happened at Hogwarts. Besides, I don't think Snape told everyone Lupin was loose on the grounds, only that he was a werewolf. He let existing prejudice take over, he didn't create new reasons to hate werewolves.

Your friend probably meant they love Snape's character because he's an intelligent, ruthless badass when it comes to taking revenge. He doesn't fuck around. Your friend is attracted to competence and power.

It doesn't matter Sirius was innocent in the end, this just showed how irresponsible Lupin was, willing to let students be in danger just to not admit he broke some rules as a teen.

That being said, Snape was definitely a total douchebag. I still like his character, it made the series more enjoyable. Liking a fictional character doesn't mean we agree with everything they do.

*** Has there been a fic that explores the idea of Lupin telling Dumbledore that Sirius is an animagus at the start of the year? Because he could in theory install protections that would thusly unmask Peter too, much earlier and in a more controlled environment where Dumbledore would be in control. Then the story would depend on the dumbledore interpretation and whether he would be evil and sweep it under the rug to remain in control, or be a good guy and get Peter arrested and tried.

*** Eh, I'd say that's more an argument for inconsistent writing, unless some very messed up associations are going on inside Neville's mind here. You'd think it would be his uncle, all things considered, even if that was played up for comedic effect earlier on (it's a childrens' series). Or maybe some sort of caricature of Bellatrix Lestrange?

I did see a good argument that Neville's terrifying experiences with his uncle causes the bullying by Snape to trigger a fight or flight response in Neville, therefore poor Nev basically piled all of his emotional baggage onto Snape while he was at Hogwarts. Snape doesn't understand this, he just wants to taunt Neville into proving him wrong, because he behaves like a 1960s teacher, and 'You suck, prove me wrong' was a legit teaching method. I can't do it justice, I'm afraid, but it exists somewhere on the net.

In all honesty, though, it was probably put there because Rowling found Snape picking on Neville to be funny. A lot of the bad things that happen to Neville are expected to be funny. They are not, and are quite horrible, but schadenfreude is a pretty important part of Rowling's comedic arsenal. It's meant to appeal to children, and the horrifying implications are there but not examined.
