** Writers want Lily and James to be alive but still want Harry to grow up neglected like canon Harry. WBWL is the usual way to accomplish that. Note how either Lily or James are usually redeemed (at the cost of the other or Dumbledore) because they were duped/drugged into dropping Harry at the Dursleys.

** Most people have siblings and understand sibling rivalries. Harry /doesn't/ have a sibling, so anyone who wants to write about Harry and Sibling Relationships is SOL unless they add an OC. Harry also is, as far as I'm aware regarding Rowling's intentions, the /everyman/ the audience is supposed to root for. Mix that all together, and it's easy to say, "Let the other brother be the BWL so Harry can be the relatable normal guy."

An aside, as I wrote that previous sentence, I couldn't help but think of the [[http://gamnamno.deviantart.com/art/The-other-mother-399699839][/other mother/]] from /Coraline./ Not the most relevant of ideas, but my brain is weird. Imagine it: Gary Potter, the demon from another universe pretending to be Harry's brother.

I digress.

The problems then come as a result of people creating ridiculous plots or lacking in the writing skills needed to pull off those plots. The OC just for the sake of /bashing/ the OC is one very good example of bad writing - no matter how much you put down one character, it doesn't make others more sympathetic in response.

** It's not really adding an OC brother for no reason.

- the brother shows what Harry could have been like if he grew up with his parents

- you have the comparison of Slytherin!Harry with Gryffindor!Harry

- there can be sibling rivalry, jealousy and competitiveness

- Also, the brother means you can have everyone think he's the BWL when it's actually Harry (with Neville I don't see how they could make that sort of mistake).

**** I don't really know. But if I had to guess, it's so that Harry can be the one who the story is about, the one who kills Voldemort, and can also be sent to the Dursleys and "discover" magic aged eleven. Or maybe it's so he's more of an underdog.

I think I mainly read them for the other reasons. If there were any stories like that where the correct one was identified as the BWL I would probably like those as well. But since WBWL has become a thing, I just enjoy reading those.

**** Why did Lockhart have to be a fraud? Why didn't Harry train after the battle in the graveyard? It's likely that it is just added for plot convenience, or giving the audience a reason to make Harry Prodigious and Powerful, as most people wanted him to be in canon. Having a brother you have to live up to allows the author to give Harry sufficient motivation to take magic seriously, instead of the very anime-ish fics where Harry just 'decides' he has to become super powerful to take on an enemy leagues ahead of him.

** It's a weird mixture of a few popular ideas in my opinion that together don't really add up.

I imagine someone wanted to compare Harry with another person with the situation of being the boy-who-lived thrust upon him but wanted Harry to come out as the stronger person at the same time. At this point, it gets mixed a bit with how Snape see James Potter and imagines the brother as being arrogant for his fame, in contrast to Harry.

Then the problem arises of how to compare Harry's twin with this good childhood with canon Harry. It results in the strangest scenario of James and Lily loving one son but ignoring the other, so Harry is effectively canon. (Maybe with abuse exaggerated because fan fiction loves doing that.)

Then you want Harry to still be the real boy-who-lived so you get this weird situation where Dumbledore comes in and announces his twin as the boy-who-lived wrongly, combining the other idea of Dumbledore being another villain.

All these ideas mix together in some really strange combination, often adding a few more cliches, like Harry having a little sister who idolises him. The writer wants to come to the reveal at some point that Harry is great while his twin isn't, to prove everything wrong etc.

** For every clich√© out there there's usually someone who can make it work. The problem, as many have already have pointed out, too many plots depend on everyone else being so OOC and doing so many 'stupid' things that the fics crumble under the weight of their own contradictions.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** It allows for a Harry with a tragic past, who can be an underdog in the eyes of others. Leads to him being underestimated, etc.

Also allows Harry to go through school without having the Boy-Who-Lived status hanging over his head.

Oh and in most of these stories Harry ends up talented and all that.

Imo the fic you were recommended isn't a classic BWL story but it's still a good fic. However to ease you into the trope I'd suggest first reading a Non-BWL Fic linkffn(Knowledge is Power by Nkari127)

** There isn't much appeal. It grew out of the indy!Harry phase of FF as a way of allowing Harry to show how great he is in contrast to his twin. The story has already been written, and the trope has been successfully subverted with Santi's fic. I don't know why people are still writing them.

*** Maybe someone will get it right, or get it better. Santi's fic was okay, but it felt a bit too long winded, and the world itself felt extremely limited. Usually, a common occurrence of giving Harry a magical life is allowing more world building. But that is figuratively stomped out in the first two seconds.

** Whats the appeal of anything? There are always those intrigued by different plot lines.

While I am not a big fan of that type of story, I still enjoy reading them from time to time. Its fun to see how Harry would have grown up with parents, or a brother/sister. Or maybe simply or out of the lime light, or perhaps looked down upon. Sorted into a different house, different friend possibilities, or maybe even abandoned.

You have to realize the amount of possibilities opened up by having him grow up as not the boy who lived, yet still connected to the surrounding situations it causes. Could you have Neville be the boy who lived? Sure.. but then who have a story focused on Neville unless you completely ignore that entire aspect of HP.
