What did y'all think of *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/][The Denarian Renegade]]* by /Shezza/? Let me know in the comment section down below. Spoilers are fine; this is a book club!

The next fic is *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4772789/1/][Six Years, Six Applicants]]* by /Sarah1281/. It's a short fic that retells all the times that Professor Snape interviews for the Defense position. Sorry for the late thread, I've been busy as of late and there wasn't much feedback, but we'll pick things up with a longer fic in February!

Hope you enjoy!

** I honestly enjoyed it way back when I first read it. I attempted to re-read it recently and was unsuccessful, though.

Characterization was why, I think. Harry is almost entirely unlikeable and Meciel reads more like a plot-device than a character.

The fights are well written and the magic thrown around is fun. The Harry/Amanda part I also enjoyed.

** I have a lot to say about this story. Actually, I pre-wrote this entire review when I saw that this was the next fic being put up here. I just want to say that this story is probably in my top 5 favorite fics of all time, but it does have loads of problems.

I do like how you really don't need to know anything about the Dresden Files to read it. Hell, I probably hadn't even heard of the Dresden Files when I first read the story, and I know there are many like me. I would not be surprised if Shezza was responsible for thousands of sales of Jim Butcher's books. I heartily recommend those as well, though they're not without problems either

However, listing problems is always far more interesting than listing what is good about a story, so that's what I'll do here. 1) Grammar/spelling. Honestly, it's all over the place, and you'd think with how many people Shezza had reading it over, it would end up a bit cleaner. Shezza even mixed up the characters names a few times.

2) Fight scenes are good, but most of them are just too damn long. And there's /tons/ of them. It just gets kind of tedious, and it gets even worse in later stories when the fight scenes take multiple chapters. You know it's bad when you're skimming fight scenes to get to the character interactions.

3) Some of the fights aren't actually choreographed all that well. And I say this while saying that the ending fight scene is my favorite scene in all of fanfiction. Some of it is just /lazy/ for lack of a better word. Like, for how good the third task fight is, the second task is the exact opposite, and the fault of that lies in something that is done throughout the whole story, but is deluged here. It's how Harry is described when he's fighting. His eyes glint darkly, he hisses spells, barks, grunts, barks some more, snarls, bellows, etc. It's super generic descriptors that feel very out of place. They're the type of descriptors used as a crutch to make it feel like the moment is dark and gritty, but it's really not.

4) The beginning of the story. Honestly, it's a mess, and quite arbitrary. Like, Harry carrying a cross - A bit too on the nose. And then the method for Harry actually getting to Hogwarts? Way too convoluted. Like, Harry arrives, asks to enroll in the school, but it only ends up being for a single day anyways as he completes the debt, only to have to stick around anyways for the tournament. At least the scene with Harry trying to get out of the tournament was entertaining. “I don't even know what the fuck is going on, I just got here!” or something to that effect. Also, I wasn't a fan of the actual time setting - HP was born in 1980 so would actually be near the same age as Dresden. It worked out ok, since Amanda was kind of interesting.

5) Harry's character. I get that the story is a perfect example of DLP's grimdark era circa 2007, but some of it is way too over the top and a bit too tryhard. It just makes Harry come off as just not very interesting at times. Some of the snark and sass is on point, but that really is only true when it involves the characters in the story who are more interesting than him. Namely, Dumbledore. I love the Dumbledore in this story. He just feels more real than pretty much any other version that I've seen. Same with Meciel. Despite existing solely in Harry's mind, there's just something tangible about her, which makes her my favorite OC in any fic. So, I guess Harry maybe ranks as the third most interesting character in the story, at best.

6) The actual crossover mechanics. It's just not necessary to have split up the magic systems. Wand-magic and true-magic is just so damn convoluted to the point of it being a major detraction from the story. I've just never understood what so difficult about combining the two systems, and all the reasons people come up with just seem minor at best.

Yet, despite all this, I still consider the story a masterpiece, and one of the best in the fandom. I've read it probably ten times, the first in 2009, the most recent being last month.

*** No offense but i disagree with almost everything you just said. The grammar mistakes are pretty easy to just ignore even for a "grammar nazi" like me.

Fight scenes were all good, the story is just some good old action and an interesting plot. If you want a story about characterisation and with a sappy harry read "harry potter and the Days of future past".

The beginning was meh, i will agree on that. Harry is an arsehole, but it makes the story more interesting and it breakes away from sterotypical harry who is a wimp and still shaken from abuse, which while realistic isn't very entertaining. It comes down to personal preference, and honestly would a nice harry fit the story at all? He grew up with a fallen who isn't exactly the epitome of morals.

The magic system... merging them would require shezza to concoct some complicated explanation for 1. How it works and 2. Why exactly other wand wizards don't use true magic. I know i am not explaining it right but point is there would be too many plot holes nitpicks like you would point out.

TLDR; again i am not trying to offend anyone, but this is my opinion. It is all down to personal preference whether you like this fic or not. In the end, it is fanfiction, enjoy the story instead of trying to hold it up to the standards of professional writers.

****** "Nice" and "sympathetic" are entirely different. If a character is sympathetic, they're easy to sympathize with. You can understand how they'd get into their situation and root for them in some way. It takes effort to write a character who is, for instance, both malevolent and sympathetic, but it's possible. And you can write unsympathetic nice characters.

/The Denarian Renegade/ features a protagonist who is both unsympathetic and a jerk.

Yes i agree with you that harry was a jerk, but it was kind of understandable as to why. Jerk harry! Isn't for everyone, but he does become less of a asshole throughout the story.

I don't care about how he acts all that much because he does do nice things occasionally. that gave me the impression that he was unsympathetic and acts like an asshole but is still a (somewhat) nice person. That for me is more interesting than the average harry.

Alright, it's good. The combat scenes are great, the OCs are great (especially Meciel), it has the best Dumbledore I've ever read, there's a very interesting concept of magic, however... /It's not a Dresden Files crossover/. There's very little from the Dresdenverse in this fanfic. For God's sake, Dresden himself appears in, like, two chapters.

Also, Harry should have died about after the Nicodemus fight.

** I gave this one a try four or five times and I think the best comparison I can make is to Prince of Slytherin. I hear from many people that once you get past a certain point it gets good, but I have to get to that point first.

Perhaps I should be more forgiving with this fic, given when it was written, but it has to be said. The writing is just /terrible/. There must be more adjectives shoehorned into the first chapter alone than in some entire works of fiction. And the tryhard is cranked up so high you could build a space elevator out of it.

I keep meaning to try to buy into it on the strength of recommendations, but perhaps some fics from the 2000s just aren't worth the effort.

It had a good dumbledore instead of your typical "i am manipulating you, stealing from your vaults and spying on you with ron and/or hermione" or the mass of contradictions that is the "i care about you but manipulate you anyway, for the greater good" stereotype.

Fight scenes are FANTASTIC although some are a little bit overdone. I still remember the feeling when I read the 2 vs 2 battle at the Ministry, boys if it isn't EPIC. Merciel is also one of my favourite part of this story. When she sacrificed herself at the end of the series (was it, I don't remember that exact part), I was honestly extremely sad and unable to read it for days. Finally, the sass on this fic is ON POINT. All things considered, this is a brilliant series and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for one hell of a ride.

** I've reread the whole Denarian Series a lot of times, for specifically the Denarian Renegade though? One thing that you Have to understand with a Dresden crossover isn't the differing magic systems or Outside or any of that. The big one is God (Catholic) and all other gods exist (like physically tangible) and things that to a reader of an ordinary story you'd say "Well isn't that convenient?"

In the Dresden verse and D Renegade verse are "Well some upper power, God, Fey, Daemon or otherwise, that is is messing about. I hope the main character can overcome it." you have to be much more aware of the possibility of outside manipulation than just the standard Harry, Voldemort, Dumbledore, and OC baddies.

Maybe it's because I'm a big lover of Jim Butcher's series and I don't mind that. But to a HP fanfiction reader it may come off as odd. But faith is tangible and effects things just like magic does. Both are forces that act on the world about them. And Harry as a character interacts with the mixing of those forces in his day to day life in this story.

As for Harry himself, he comes off as a total arsehole. Because that what he wants to be seen as. Sure pretend to be something long enough and that will change the way you actually feel. But for this story, I'd say Harry's key feature / flaw is his will. Time and time again he has to put his willpower over Angels, Outsiders, Fey, Dracon, and he comes out on top because of his will and his ability to think on his feet (with some help from Meciel when he needs it). Exactly like Harry Dresden himself.

Harry is a huge jerk face, Harry says racist, misogyny purporting, hilarious things, Harry says anything and everything to keep people away.

He lives most of his life alone and because of that, is fulfilled most by conversing with Meciel. And only because of that is he such a ridiculous character. He wants to be loved. And getting her to laugh at his (to her) hilarious antics are what he does through this story.

At a certain point you can see where he realized Meciel loves him for him not because he does such unexpected things. And he mellows out, we'll for him. He's still a right bastard, for his own amusement and Meciel's but less so to get her to love him. I think their relationship is one of my favorite things about this story, even more than the Fallen in the Cannon Dresden series.

Now let me be clear it is not a perfect story. But it is most likely one of my favorite Harry Potters created. Because he is one of the few I can actually see as powerful through his own merits. Sure Meciel gives him hellfire, but really hellfire doesn't actually do anything but strengthen your will artificially giving your magic a perceived boost. The whole story he talks about how easy it is to lose yourself in it. And how people go mad. What's the point in that powerboost if you can't focus it? But he does because his will IS enough.

It's like punching a wall, most people could swing and do a bit of damage. Some people if told to swing as hard as they could, might do some more damage. But if you were being chased by daemons from hell you'd break your own bones to get through that wall. You always had the strength to do so, but sometimes that mental visceral push is needed to actually break the wall.

Hellfire is the same thing but mentally with magic, the real asset to picking up a coin is another consciousness to help you with combat and their ability to heal you while you're fighting. Angels can think much much faster than mortal men.

Last thing to be said is Dumbledore, a lot of people think this is one of the most realistic ones ever written. They are correct. Also the action scenes are pretty damn good.

Give this 3 part Denarian Series a chance if you haven't been able to reread it in awhile. It really is good.

** I have read only the first 4 chapters according to the ffn app.

I don't keep much memories of it, it is nice but not really memorable, I remember that I was afraid of Harry becoming über-super-op, in a wish fullfilment sort of fic.

Other than that, I think it is a nice introduction to the other fandom (Dresden files). I say that as I never paid much more than a passing glance to the title and so am completely lost in the fandom. Despite that, I was not lost in the story, which is always nice.

Technically speaking, I think it is quite nice, having also read is Naruto fix.

** In between when I first read this and now I have since read /The Dresden Files/. Is there anything to be gained in a re-read?
