:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This fic is after the deathly hallows and follows Harry and Ginny's life together being semi-hunted by Crabbe or Goyle's mom. She doesn't actively hunt them in the sense that they are on the run but sends them threatening anonymous messages and says that she will take everything from them. I believe she also affected the birth of Harry/Ginny's first child.


** Story is Bound by Yellowitchgirl on SIYE, and there is a sequel
