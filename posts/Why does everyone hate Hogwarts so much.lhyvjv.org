Okay, I'll admit, I've only been reading fan-fiction for a few years, but I've probably read a few hundred stories by now. One of the strange trends that I've noticed is that nobody seems very pro-Hogwarts, relative to other schools. The number of times that I've seen Harry threaten to leave Hogwarts for another school, or see characters from other schools complain about a terrible Hogwarts curriculum is outstanding. Now, this does make sense in some situations, if a major theme of the story is how terrible Dumbledore is for instance, but I can't think of a single comparison between other schools or any canon reason why this would be such a widespread commonality. I see it in just about any story set during fourth year, and I've never seen a story where the opposite is true. Now again, I haven't read that many stories, and I'm sure that there are examples of this going the other way, it's just a trend that I've noticed. Is there some reason for this, or is it just another thing that's caught on over years of fan-fiction writing?


** Even in canon we see mixed views-- Krum thinks Hogwarts is phenomenal, it's bigger and more beautiful than Durmstrang. To be interested in Hermione, he likely also agrees more with Dumbledore's teachings than his own headmaster's so that likely appeals to him too, though I don't think it's ever stated outright.

Fleur, on the other hand, thinks it's freezing cold, with bad food and bad decor. It's really all a matter of perspective! I guess it depends on the fic, but I could see a description of Hogwarts as the best place on earth or absolutely terribly equally compelling depending on the quality of the writing and POV, and either could still be canon-compliant.

** Because JKR wrote Harry Potter to serve the story first and world build second, and as a result if you try to dig deep into anything it either rapidly falls apart (exactly how many wizards are there again?) or becomes deeply horrifying (why are love potions legal? Why are the national prison guards Eldrich monsters?).

Hogwarts also suffers from both of these the standard logistical problems (is the student population only 240? Why does everyone have to get the train from London? When /do/ the letters get sent?) are generally a result of JKRs bad maths and "rule of cool" world building.

The more horrifying problems, like how Harry's end of year exam seems to consist of "survive a murder attempt by Voldemort", are an inevitable result of the fact that Harry the protagonist is stuck at Hogwarts, the Plot needs to happen, Harry needs to face this books big bad and the adults need to be completely useless so our 3 teenage protagonists have something to do.

However, most fanfic authors prefer world building over plot and seek to fix this, except they don't have the skill or patience to re-write Hogwarts from scratch so instead they just complain about everything they find wrong, and say how everything is better in school X.

What do you mean?

Probably because they told what happened. Although it was the most stupid idea someone could possibly have, they didn't steal the car because they didn't feel like taking the train - it was because something happened and they were unable to access the platform. Besides, they were 12, which justifies part of their stupidity.

Honestly, I don't think expelling them would be necessary. McGonagall or Dumbledore (or both) could have a serious conversation about how what they did is dangerous and irresponsible, and if something out of the ordinary ever happens again, they should contact either the school or Ron's parents, instead of solving it on their own.

This is what lacks in Harry Potter: adults talking some sense into kids. Dumbledore should have told the trio what they did in PS was very brave, but also very dangerous and they shouldn't do it again. Dumbledore should have told Harry and Ron the same in CoS, and he definitely should have not sent Harry and Hermione to a dangerous mission involving time travelling. This type of recklessness is indulged in Hogwarts. If anything, the trio took matters into their own hands in PS and got praised and rewarded, so in Harry's and Ron's dumb 12-year-old heads, it made sense to solve the problem on their own again.

** Honestly based on the years Harry went to hogwarts, it's an objectively bad school and a dangerous environment for children. Even if you ignore all the crazy things that were allowed to happen because of Voldemort/death eaters (which you really shouldn't, the school has awful security, and Dumbledore knowingly and willingly put the students in danger with many of his actions).

You have a ghost for a history teacher (who does not take control of / interact with the class). Hagrid was allowed to teach despite not having any completed formal education (which despite his experience as grounds Keeper, really should be a requirement for a teachers position). Lockhart after the first week of teaching would have been fired by any competent headmaster (for a failure to teach the actual subject). Snape is verbally abusive to his students and literally is the cause of dangerous accidents because he can't be bothered to actually do his job and teach. Additionally he, and the other teachers,are negligent and don't stop the bullying of students (and not just Harry, who is treated awfully by the whole school on several occasions). Flitwick failed in his duty to protect Luna, full stop. McGonagall repeatedly ignored the concerns of her students (year after year), and gave crappy advice that basically boiled down to “deal with it” when Harry was being assaulted. Harry was sent back to what could charitably be called neglectful guardians, even after outright making it known that there was a problem with his home life. That is just a small sampling of the problems with the professors of the school.

Many of the children (if not the whole school) should haven been receiving counseling for the situations they were put through (possession/kidnapping, murder attempts, repeated attacks by dangerous creatures, subjected to dementors, petrifications, torture, supposed mass murderers breaking in the school, the death of class mates, an adult male sleeping in the same room/bed as young boys who did who knows what,etc). The students didn't receive proper mental and health care treatment for what they went through. (And it seems like the authorities were never really called in, to investigate any crimes or situations.)

These are just a few of the reasons why Hogwarts is an objectively bad school. The teachers failed in their duty to properly care for their students. (And many of their failures had nothing to do with the circumstances of the surrounding events, but in their responses to them, and in the day to day school life). Harry may have felt like hogwarts was great, a real home. But honestly living on the streets away from the Dursley's, would have been preferable to living with them to him. So, that's a pretty low bar, and not indicative of a good school.

**** I think he means when the other, older Ravenclaw girls were bullying Luna her entire first year by hiding her things, calling her "Looney Luna," etc. By the time Harry meets her she's been experiencing that for at LEAST two full years without any teacher intervention, and Luna decides Harry's a good friend not because he steps in and helps, but because he just ignores the issue, keeps his distance as much as possible, but doesn't push her away when she wanders into him. In other words, he's her very first friend simply because he shows her common decency with minimal interaction.

****** I'm not denying that. I'm just providing an explanation about why fanfic authors tend to dislike Hogwarts.

On the flipside, I rarely see fics where Flitwick is evil or incompetent, usually he's just busy and thus ignorant unless things are brought to his attention.

There was one abandoned fic I remember where Harry, Ron and Hermione ran into Flitwick before McGonagall in PS, and so he ended up dueling Quirrelmort while Harry protected the Stone. It had some glorious setup for a tactically genius Ron, a strategically surgical Hermione, and a jack of all trades/magical powerhouse Harry, but it only had like two or three chapters.

Anyhow, the main point isn't whether or not a Professor noticed, it's whether or not the school encourages students to speak up when bullied or worse, and from what little we see in canon it's made abundantly clear that the professors are far too busy to deal with frivolous things such as "minor spats" between students.

Because certainly, if a problem is never spoken about it can't be solved, but if the perpetrator acts contrite enough then it's simple to brush off as a trifling matter.

After all, the only times detentions have ever been handed out to anyone in Harry's circle of awareness has been due to transgressions that are too overt to ignore or brush off. Such as sneaking out part curfew to see a baby dragon.

*** But if you look at it from a storytelling perspective, all of the things you listed only happen to make the story interesting. On the other hand we are explicitly told that Hogwarts "the best". If you were to write a "realistic" Hogwarts fanfiction, you'd have to remove much of the problems you list:

- Lockhart would never have been hired after an interview (where he would botch a mock lesson) or actually be able to teach a little. The first would of course cost the books a gag or two which would probably not improve them.
- Snape would tone it down and be much more insidious about his attacks so nobody could report him.
- McGonagall ignoring students' concerns is such a plot device. After all, if she listened the whole interesting part of the book in question would dissappear.
- Same with the Dursleys. It's just more interesting the way it is, but not realistic.

As [[/u/I_love_DPs][u/I_love_DPs]] already said, counceling was (probably, no first hand experience) less common in the nineties. And, the wizarding world would totally be behind on such an improvement. Judging the past by todays standards also isn't reasonable.

I totally disagree on Hagrid. If you turn down the danger to realistic levels (which, again would take away from the books) Hagrid would be a good teacher. Can only broaden the students horizons to learn from somebody so down to earth.

TL;DR all of Hogwarts flaws are there to make the story interesting. If you want to judge Hogwarts by realistic standards, you'd have to take away those flaws to also make Hogwarts realistic. Then, it isn't so bad.

**** Bullying and even bullying from teachers (maybe I don't take Snape so seriously because I had teachers who were far worse than him ranging from publicly mocking a student's background to sexual jokes about girls entering puberty) is still a common thing happening in schools. With awareness programs and everyone having a camera on their phone, maybe things have improved a bit, but I'm always baffled by how outraged people are by the bullying that goes on in Hogwarts. It's like they've never went to school. Not that I think this phenomenon shouldn't disappear but until we learn to become better people, it's going to be part of the school culture no matter what.

Also, they force everyone to talk to the schools counselor at least twice a semester to see if anyone needs help. So when I hear about teachers who bully their students, I always get mad that no one is doing anything about the situation. It's more likely then that people who don't see bullying often that get mad at it.

** I don't hate Hogwarts, and I don't know if other magic schools are better, but historically it's been a rough place for Harry. He's placed in life threatening danger almost every year, a teacher outright bullies him (two if you count Umbridge), the other teachers don't listen to him or they place him in danger (McGongall, Lockhart, and Fake Moody all come to mind, and even Lupin in a round about way). Defense curriculum is mostly terrible, as is History of Magic, and Divination and Care of Magical Creatures aren't much better. And we see people (mostly Draco, but also the Inquisitorial Squad) have basically free reign to bully whoever they want.

If I was Harry, and I had an adult looking out for me, I'd be thinking about transferring schools too.

Harry views Hogwarts as a good place to be because it gets him away from his abusive relatives. That's not a high bar.

** From Harry's perspective, every single year someone's tried to kill or torture him (intentionally or otherwise - Remus Lupin might be a good guy, but one forgotten potion and there's your murder attempt), and very rarely did the teachers or the Headmaster do anything about it - in fact, one teacher in particular goes out of his way to make Harry even more miserable, year after year.

It's a decent narrative for storywriting, but it's very fridge-logic-inducing from a worldbuilding perspective - which J.K. Rowling didn't really do much to fix even with Pottermore (which has its own share of problems). For a while, then, it was enormously popular to call out the fridge-logic - hence, Hogwarts-bashing stories where Harry decides he's literally better off anywhere else.

The phenomenon you're finding, however, tends to have more to do with Indy!Harry type fics, or anti-Dumbledore ones. That's more of the impetus, I find - where people dislike Dumbledore or some of the less logical/objectively bad aspects of Hogwarts (usually the teachers/curriculum/organization) and want something different.

I think that looking at other magical schools would be very interesting too, as long as they're not following JKR's sketches of canon for them (her non-British aspects are... not good, IMO). They shouldn't be /perfect/ by any means, but exploring how they're different from Hogwarts is certainly fun.

We are routinely told Hogwarts is great and then shown it is not. JK Rowling did this a lot with her world building- Say one thing, show another. I can't tell if this was intentional or not but it makes the whole wizarding world look like it's nice on the surface but has severe structural deficiencies underneath.

Two core classes, history of magic and defense have serious problems. History is nap time and defense has a 50/50 chance of being useless.

I'm not sure to include potions here. Snape may be an asshole, but canon aside, he's not horrible at teaching. Both Harry and Ron, two potion slackers, manage EE's on their OWLs.

For electives: Divination is useless. Care of magical creatures is debatable, they seem to spend most of the year dealing with blast ended screwts.

I won't spoil it but his final plan to defeat Voldemort also hurts the entire british magical world except for a select few and ron and hermione were not part of that. It's not even a bashing fic harry is just completely uncaring about what it did to everyone else

#+begin_quote
  After Sirius dies, Harry is isolated and feels betrayed by everyone who's been around him recently and leaves to figure out what he should do. An "old friend" is sent to look after him and try to bring him back. Together they search for a way to kill a Dark Lord and maybe fix society too.

** Because people hate J.K.Rowling and they hate the world she created, so they feel like they need to mangle it a bit everywhere. Hogwarts is the best school in the world, you say? Well then, I refuse to do that! Dumbledore is a kind but pretty fucking old man that's at his core a secretive child, who's lived all his life hailed as the greatest, and as such is prone to error? Nah fam he's just a bitch.

That's the gist of it. Pure contrarianism and dumb hate on the writer.

** I've seen some fics like Hogwarts. No I don't remember their names. But it's more common in fics I read now because I don't read bashing stories. (Bashing Stories bash Hogwarts 60% of the time. The other 40% Harry finds his ReAl friends and spends a bunch of time in the room of requirement.)

** In the fics I read with Hogwarts bashing, it often sounded like the American author wanted to feel superior to the British, but I have no idea how common that is.

Really, this makes no sense. Krum said that Harry knew how to do things he didn't, and as I recall, everything Harry used in the Triwizard was available to him in library books.
