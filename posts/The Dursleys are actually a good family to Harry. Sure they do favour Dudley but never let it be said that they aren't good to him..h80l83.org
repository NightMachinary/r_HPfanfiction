This includes everyone; Vernon, Petunia, Marge and Dudley. Everything else is the same but it's clear that Harry is family.


** I reckon this would be really interesting, because then Petunia might actually talk about Lily to Harry. The lack of information about Lily, including her friends, her relationship to Snape etc, was kept under wraps for the whole series till the end. For Harry to learn more about Lily, and also Snape as her friend, would change the trajectory of the whole series.

*** In some ways I think it would make Harry's relationship with Snape worse. He would either be pissed that his mom's friend was so nasty, or he would go in knowing that Lily and Snape used to be friends but then stopped being friends...and would be even more wary of Snape since his mom cut off contact with him.

** I've searched so long for a good fic like that, actually I look for one where Harry and Dudley are really close and Harry thinks of them as his real family. I've even started to tell my kid this (so far unwritten) story. If someone knows something, I'd be so happy!

** I read one once where the Dursleys were so okay with magic that Vernon ended up at Hogwarts, I think he was teaching Muggle Studies. There's a great scene where he shoots a death eater in the face with an old fashioned blunderbuss, does anyone else recognise this? I can't find it again on AO3 or FF and I know I didn't dream it.

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

  At age seven, Harry wants to control his "freakishness". A book in the library calls to him. He finds that he needs to get stronger in order to control what is probably magic that causes all those unexplained events near him. That brings some unexpected changes to his life.

**** Started this, it's very tropey but I like Petunia.

What I dont like is how by chapter 19, Harry and Hermione are discussing whether they should have sex, and showing each other their bits, all apparently with parental leave. Eleven year old kids are curious about the human body, sure. But they don't tend to engage in sex and I think it's really creepy to write about, especially the scene where Petunia tells Harry that "in a few months" he might be ready. He's ELEVEN. His balls haven't even dropped.

****** It's the one thing that is guaranteed to put me off a fic and for some reason there's tons of it in the HP fandom. It's a shame because I was really enjoying the way Petunia was written, and then suddenly it's BAM, two eleven year old kids are discussing their potential sex life. Hermione even refers to her "tits." At eleven. I cannot even.

***** God seeing that in fics never fails to disgust me. Even if the author is like 15 - 16, what are they doing writing about children like that? And if the author is an adult then that is even MORE disgusting. Never fails to squick me, never fails to amaze me at how anyone thinks it's appropriate to post what is basically softcore child porn on a fanfiction site.

****** My rule is always if it's shipping any of the Hogwarts era characters with any hint of the sex, then it has to be sixth year or above (age of consent is 16 in the UK) and tbh I don't want to read graphic sexual content anyway, not about these characters who have been a part of my life since I was a child myself.

I just don't understand why there's so much fic out there that has them sexually active as children. Not teenagers, actual children. If you wanna write about Harry and Hermione getting it on, just make them seventeen for god's sake...

But if they said that Dumbledore would place him elsewhere. So lily and james put in their wills that Harry never was to go to them because of their hatred of magic knowing that Dumbledore would then send Harry there.

Problem is I don't remember what else happened in the story (after a couple thousand fanfics they start to blend together) and my search terms are casting a very wide net.
