I'm looking for stories where Harry gets an Overpowered or Interesting wand, it can be The Elder Wand or even the wand of some long forgotten Wizard. As long as it fits my criteria I'll read it. I would also like for there to be an emphasis on the wand itself. While Harry could be a Prodigious or Powerful Wizard, having a powerful wand should at least be noted (in too many fics do I see Harry getting an OP wand just to cast it aside during battle as a "Harry picked up his wand and shouted 'Expelliarmus'"). Or him getting a Wand that is supposed to be "Great for every subject" but still gets outshone by Hermoine because she gets the spell on the first try.


** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw]]) has an interresting wand. Some time spent in the gathering of the components and their symbolism. Also, the first /muggle-made/ wand I come across.

Described as an excellent wand. Not necessarily overpowered. More like a very powerful wand, good for a lot of things and exceptionnaly atuned to Harry.

Harry's seriously OP in this fic, though.

** Thestral hair's getting more common in fics. Usually not much more exciting than 'cool I have a wand I guess' on the MC's part, rarely if ever represents their characterisation like canon wands.

I did once see a Sueish fic once where she made a wand with copper wire in it, with thunderbird feather. Every spell was Sith lightning in intensity lightning strikes.

I'll see if I could find it, was basically a 'my lightning is superipr to your magic I will kill Voldemort' fic
