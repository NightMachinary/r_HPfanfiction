Abuse as in make ridiculous amounts of money off of producing perfect diamonds using magic, or instantaneous drug running, etc. Just a fic that has any character abuse the hell out of an overlooked or underestimated aspect of magic.

Harry does drug running in the muggle world to earn fast cash in linkffn(dodging prison and stealing witches: revenge is best served raw). Harry sells his services openly as a wizard in the marvel universe during linkao3(the spellist by esama).

  The new reality had no wizards or magical nations -- but it had a whole boatload of powerful and occasionally inept sorcerers. Who were usually semi-public and sometimes very popular in social media. How it worked, Harry had no idea.

** linkffn(The Evil Overlord List by boomvroomshroom) has Tom Riddle's Jr (and the genre-savvy voice in his head) conjuring carbon and using compression spells to turn it into diamond then imperiusing muggles to sell them for him.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
