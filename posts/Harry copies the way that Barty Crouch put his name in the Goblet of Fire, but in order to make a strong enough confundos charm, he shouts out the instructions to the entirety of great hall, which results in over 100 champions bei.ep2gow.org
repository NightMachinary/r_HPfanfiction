** The candlelit Great Hall was packed. The air was full of excitement and anticipation. The Halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual. Everyone in the Hall craned their necks, impatient expressions on their faces, only to see whether Dumbledore had finished eating yet.

Harry felt an elbow poking him in his rib cage.

"Hey Harry," whispered Ron from beside him.

Harry turned his attention from the still eating Dumbledore to his best friend. "What?"

"Do you reckon what- ehm- happened yesterday... will have any consequences? You think Dumbledore will find out?"

"About us putting our names in? How would he?"

Hermione looked at them, annoyed. "Honestly, you two! You are as subtle as a ton of bricks. With how loud you yelled /Confundus/ in a hall full of people, I wouldn't be surprised if Sirius had heard you. We'll probably read about it in the Prophet tomorrow!"

"We had to," Ron moaned. "We can't do it non-verbally yet."

"You shouldn't have done it at all. What if they expel you? What-"

"Shhh," Harry whispered, "it's about to begin."

And indeed, at long last, the golden plates returned to their original spotless state; there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the Hall, which died away almost instantly as Dumbledore got to his feet. Dumbledore proceeded to give a little speech that barely anyone listened to.

The flames inside the goblet turned red. Sparks began to fly from it. Next moment, a tongue of flame shot into the air, a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it --- the whole room gasped. Dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at arm's length, so that he could read it by the light of the flames, which had turned back to blue-white.

“The champion for Durmstrang,” he read, in a strong, clear voice, “will be Viktor Krum.”

“No surprises there!” yelled Ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept the Hall. Harry saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch up toward Dumbledore; he turned right, walked along the staff table, and disappeared through the door into the next chamber.

The clapping and chatting soon died down. Now everyone's attention was focused again on the goblet, which, seconds later, turned red once more. A second piece of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames.

“The champion for Beauxbatons,” said Dumbledore, “is Fleur Delacour!”

“It's her, Ron!” Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.

It did not take long for Dumbledore to announce the last champion.

“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric Diggory!”

“No!” said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar from the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them, grinning broadly, and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers' table.

"It didn't work?" asked Harry, just as disappointed as Ron.

"Just because you put your name in doesn't mean the goblet will choose you. It obviously thought you two cheaters unworthy," said Hermione, sounding rather smug.

“Excellent!” Dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down. “Well, we now have our three champions. I am sure I can count upon all of you, including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster. By cheering your champion on, you will contribute in a very real ---”

But Dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking, and it was apparent to everybody what had distracted him. The fire in the goblet had just turned red again. Sparks were flying out of it. A long flame shot suddenly into the air, and borne upon it was another piece of parchment. Automatically, it seemed, Dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the parchment. He held it out and stared at the name written upon it. There was a long pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands, and everyone in the room stared at Dumbledore. And then Dumbledore cleared his throat and read out --- “Harry Potter.”

*** There was no applause. At first, the only thing that could be heard were to simultaneous "Uh-Oh"s coming from the Gryffindor table. Then, a buzzing, as though of angry bees, was starting to fill the Hall; some students were standing up to get a better look at Harry.

At the top table, Professor Dumbledore had straightened up, nodding to Professor McGonagall. “Harry Potter!” he called again. “Harry! Up here, if you please!”

But before Harry could get up from where he sat, the fire in the goblet turned red again. More sparks and another flying piece of parchment followed.

Harry turned to Ron in shock as a Dumbledore who grew paler by the second reached for this fifth piece of parchment.

"Ronald Weasley."

"Mum's going to kill me,"Ron whispered, pale faced, as a wave of outrage crushed down over them.

Harry tried to avoid looking at the head table, but he could feel the gaze of several of his teachers boring into them.

“What is ze meaning of zis, Dumbly-dorr?” Madame Maxime said imperiously.

“I'd rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,” hissed Professor Karkaroff. He was wearing a steely smile, and his blue eyes were like chips of ice. “Three Hogwarts champions? I don't remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed more than one champion --- or have I not read the rules carefully enough?”

Harry dared glancing at the head table. Dumbledore's face betrayed nothing, but the absence of a twinkle in his eyes and a smile on his lips told Harry everything he needed to know. The headmaster was livid.

The goblet's fire turned red again and another piece of parchment shot into the air. Dumbledore looked in Harry's direction, before he caught it and read, "Lee Jordan."

Harry and Ron stared at each other, jaws almost hitting the table.

"Subtle as a ton of bricks," Hermione mouthed.

A discussion had broken out at the head table. Harry could hear his name and saw them wildly gesturing in the direction of the Gryffindor table.

Dumbledore had meanwhile caught another piece of parchment. "Cho Chang."

Again, the Hall was eerily silent, before it erupted in angry chatter.

"Fred Weasley," continued Dumbledore, ignoring both the ruckus before him and the one behind him. George Weasley... Vincent Crabbe - you spell Crabbe with two Bs, Mr. Crabbe... Romilda Vane..." Dumbledore sighed and conjured a chair, sitting down in front of the goblet. "A- Argus Filch?"

"How?" whispered Ron, but Harry just shrugged his shoulders.

It was hours before all champions had been chosen and Dumbledore joined the discussion at the head table. Almost all of Hogwarts had been named a champion - all those who were old enough to cast a Confundus and were too young to enter their names the official way - and Argus Filch.

At last, the discussion at the head table died down and Dumbledore stood up to speak again. He cleared his throat. " We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament. The goblet constitutes a binding magical contract. As it is, this year's Triwizard Tournament will see 680 contestants." He turned around to leave, but stopped, and added, "I would like to see Mister Weasley and Mister Potter in my office." With those final parting words, he left the Great Hall.

I'm fairly certain this is a fanon interpretation of how the Goblet of Fire works. The book only describes it as a "binding magical contract," with no extrapolation as to how it binds the participants or punishes violators.

More importantly, a non-magical person would (presumably) be unable to enter into a binding magical contract in the first place, so the potential consequences of welshing are a moot point

******* Yeah, the exact wording is pretty ambiguous. It could be as simple as "legally binding with enormous fees/prison time/execution for not participating" or as complicated as "the goblet manipulates casualty to create a situation, no matter how unlikely, in which the contestant competes" depending on the author.

Not sure if this is canon, but in my headcanon there is a world of difference between muggles and squibs.

******** There's basically no canon info about squibs, and what bits of information do exist contradict each other. E.g. it's strongly implied that Mrs. Figg can't see dementors in Book 5 when she struggles to describe their appearance to the court, but Filch is able to see ghosts and exist at Hogwarts when a muggle otherwise wouldn't be able to.

In Book 2, Ron describes squibs as: "A Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any magic powers. Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards." That's really the only canonical description of squibs we have to go on, so that's what I'm going with. But it's really a blank slate for whatever headcanon you want.

********* I buy into the whole "Magical Core" ideal. Squibs have magic, just not enough to do focused casting.

And Filch wouldn't be able to see Hogwarts because of the Muggle Repelling Wards.

And Filch does have Mrs. Norris. She is his familiar in all but name.

********** All of this is contradicted by Mrs. Figg's implied inability to see dementors though. If squibs had magic and were simply unable to cast spells, that wouldn't be the case. In my own headcanon, I find it more likely that Dumbledore was able to make an exception in the wards to allow Filch into Hogwarts.

He's obviously skilled at sneaking up on people (dragon), he could use scuba gear and have to rescue Mrs Norris from the lake, and all his common sense and stronger mundane skills could see him through the hedge maze easily enough.
