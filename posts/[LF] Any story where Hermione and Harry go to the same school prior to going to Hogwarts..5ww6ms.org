I am looking for any story where Hermione and Harry go to the same (primary?) school before going to Hogwarts. It can be a Harry/Hermione future romance story, or just as platonic friends, or as pseudo-siblings. Thanks in advance.


** In "The Perils of Innocence" they are in the same Institute, growing up with Dean.

*** The story is certainly above average, albeit unfinished and from the looks of it, abandoned. It has much elements White Squirrel tends to put in his story.

#+begin_quote
  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

#+begin_quote
  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. Rating & Genres may change later.

  Here's an interesting fact that I just made up. In a strange universe slightly disconnected from this one, Harry Potter was born premature on the 31st of July 1980. In this story, he wasn't. Born 27th of September 1980 this is a Harry Potter with no scar, new classmates, a sinister looking wand, and somehow he's got a strange diary belonging to T. M. Riddle.

  Harry and Hermione are child musical prodigies and discover their talents before starting school. A close friendship develops before Hogwarts and the magical world will not be the same. A/U for the most part, with very little canon content. Friendships will be different but no character bashing. Well maybe Draco, but nothing untoward.
