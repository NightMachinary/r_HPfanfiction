So I mean something like Thanos level endurance and power. As if Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Voldemort can duel for ages without drawing a simple drop of blood from each other. Of course it would have to be balanced across all wizards and witches for this stuff to make any sense. Bonus if its really about skill and practice and not about being born right even if it does play a part.

Honestly, I am not sure if what I want can even be made to be enjoyable but I'd love to be surprised.


** I read that title as Katrina-scale hurricanes being caused by epic battles between ultra-powered wizards & witches dueling each other in the eye of the storm. Like eventually they lose their human shape kinda like obscurials and their very bodies shape the storm clouds, and the tornado funnel is where the two or more persons clash.

Powerful witches and wizards that become forces of nature.

** So just to clarify, you want a fic with a really high power ceiling. Cenetered around people at the top?

Is really the only one I have read and enjoyed and fits your criteria.

If you're willing to look beyond the HP fandom, the web novel 'Mother of Learning' has magic users and wizards that gets very powerful towards the end game.

*** Yes, indeed. That is what I wanted. I'm perfectly willing to look outside HP Fandom though the summary of Mother of Learning implied a groundhog day style story which I am not very interested in usually. Re:Zero particularly had some nice story but the repeating cycles lessened any impact it managed to have on me.

**** Mother of Learning avoids most of the groundhog stuff, for the most part. There's some dodgy stuff that you usually get with those loops re:dating, but other than that I would recommend it.

***** I reread it quite recently, and I have to ask what dodgy stuff you're talking about because I consider it one of the best written time loop stories around. Since you mentioned dating, I can't remember it ever being a thing in the story, on account of Zorian hating people.

****** Zach dates. Zorian only hated people at the start. He's gone on... At least two dates. Maybe 3 if you count giant spiders.

******* Zach is a social guy, and more than dating he has one-night stands. Like, a lot of them. He's probably the closest one to the stereotypical problematic time-looper, but even then there is nothing really condoning his behaviour? Especially since we see everything from Zorian's perspective, and he doesn't seem to care much for it.

​

Zorian is very much antisocial even at the end, even if he's mellowed out. He had what, one outing with Taiven, where he decided he was over his crush? Or are you counting being dragged to the ball, because I'm not counting that as a date. He literally spends most of the time being annoyed that he was dragged there and looking for excuses to leave.

​

I don't count giant spiders, but even if I did there wasn't anything resembling romance with his interactions with them. Though Seeker of Novelty is certainly the best.

******** Novelty was the spider I was referring to yes. And that was mostly a joke, but I think he actually has been on 3 dates. Taiven. And two others, though I don't remember their names. Zach even comments on it (this is before he knows about Zorian timelooping). MoL is really long. I think there's quite a few scenes you're forgetting. There's probably some I'm forgetting as well. The Taiven date late in the timeloop is probably the most serious date Zorian has ever been on. But it's far from the only one.

** Yeah, this is something that I have a problem with in "canon", as well as a lot of fanfiction.

When the high of power is restricted to waving a stick while yelling some words to throw a relatively slow-moving and tame projectile (or creating a lion), it's really underwhelming.

And when authors write really long scenes like that, it's also dreadfully boring.

The only story I can remember is Mastermind Hunting, but that story was pretty bad in its own right.
