I want to read some good time travel fics or some where the "dark side" isnt that dark at all. Thank you!


** Time travel wise, one I really like is linkffn(Timely Errors). It's my favorite one involving Harry going back to and interacting with his parents time. However, if you're looking for one with a lot of plot it might not be the right choice. It is completed as well - though in my case I just wanted more interactions between them :(

Another time travel one that I've recently enjoyed is linkffn(Time and Again), which has Harry going back to an AU version of his 4th year as an adult (has some trope-ish elements, but involves Harry as a professor and didn't have anything stand out as a deal breaker to me) - but it's distinctly still ongoing and I'm not sure of the update speed or lack thereof.

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

  Time Travel fic. In a war torn future, in the burning ruins of Konohagakure, Naruto fights Orochimaru and loses as the world collapses around him. From that ending comes a new beginning and a new chance to set things right, if only he can figure out how..

  "I can't go back, can I?‚Äú Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?‚Äú Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,‚Äú he said after some time."You could,‚Äú Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. ‚ÄúBut there is something you want more than that, don't you?‚Äù‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,‚Äú Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. ‚ÄúI cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.

  Broken and angry after losing Sirius fifth year, Harry recklessly puts himself in harms way, dragging Hermione along for the ride. Now they are stuck in another time with some all too familiar faces. Will the time with lost loved ones heal Harry or end up doing more damage?

**** Ah, okay. I know I've seen a few threads around for that recently, so if you google "Harry Potter fanfiction Dark Magic isn't Bad Site:Reddit.com" without the quotes, you should get links to a few things. I'd search them myself for you, but I'm about to go to bed and give a man a fish and all that.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
