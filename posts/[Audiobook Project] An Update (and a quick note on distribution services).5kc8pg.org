Hello, all,

I hope you are all having a good Christmas.

Chapter 1 of *The Accidental Animagus* is uploading to SoundCloud as we speak. I will post another update when it is finished uploading. I just wanted to talk about distribution services.

Unfortunately, SoundCloud only allows up to 6 hours (360 minutes) of upload time for a free member. I am a free member (that is to say, I use the free version of SoundCloud), and SoundCloud Pro Unlimited costs 15 dollars a month (or 135 dollars a year)

To solve this problem, I will be switching my distribution service to YouTube.

Best Regards,

ThePianoProdigy

Edit: I just woke up (one of the benefits of being on winter break is being able to sleep in) and checked the download. It somehow managed to completely grind to a halt overnight. Trying again now.
