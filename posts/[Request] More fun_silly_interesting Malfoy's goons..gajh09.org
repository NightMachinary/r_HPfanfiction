"The pleasure's all ours, I'm sure," offered Harry. "I haven't any head for names, though, so I hope Greg and Vincent will forgive me if I call them Mr. Loom and Mr. Stalk in the future."

Ron choked on a guffaw at that.

"What?"

"Well, Greg looks like he's stalking something, and Vincent keeps trying to loom... actually, from where I'm sitting, it looks like pretty decent looming. Keep up the good work, Mr. Loom," cheered Harry.

"Mr. Malfoy, Sir, we'd like to request that you refer to us by our professional monikers from this point forward."

Draco stared at Goyle. Harry and Ron did, too, which was a nice change of pace.

"What?"

Goyle cleared his throat, and clarified. "We have mutually agreed that we want to be called Mr. Loom and Mr. Stalker, until otherwise noted. Mr. Loom will remind you if you forget."

Harry and Ron stared at each other, then turned to the goons again in astonishment.

"But those names are ridiculous! My father will never approve of such drivel!"

Harry leaned closer to Draco. "They've unionized, Draco. There's nothing you can do."

Draco narrowed his eyes at Harry. "What do you mean 'unionized', Potter?"

"They're teaming up to make you do what they want, but they still work for you. It's weird."

"Alright, fine, you can have your stupid new names," agreed Draco. "But when we're around Father, you'll answer to Crabbe and Goyle. That's final!"

"Agreed." The goon formerly known as Goyle took his seat next to Ron, while Mr. Loom just kept looming next to the door.

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.

**** General intelligence upgrade like most characters.

The first part of chapter 16 covers it well.
