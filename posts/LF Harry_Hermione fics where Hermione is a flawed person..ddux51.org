  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

*** Is it acknowledged in the fic (as in the character flaws are commented or thought about)? Because I'll give it a boost on my reading list if it is.

Shame I know what happens.

**** I'll tell you right away that you won't like it. There's no blatant "look how flawed she is" scene/arc. Hermione, Sirius and Harry all are flawed people in the story, and all make mistakes, but the kind of moral lesson/comeupance you want doesn't happen. Things simply aren't that clear-cut since everyone makes mistakes. Harry fucks up his prior relationships in various ways and learns from that, but not with some big catharthic moment where he realises that he took people for granted and vows to become the perfect boyfriend next time. (He simply grows up.) Hermione never realises that she didn't control her animagus transformation's mental side effects as she thought (arrogantly) she would, and so is acting and thinking far more like a cat than would be healthy for her. (And that won't change.)

Sirius, Hermione and Harry all have to confront their biggest mistakes in the story, but they are imperfect people, not moral lessons, and the arcs/scenes ultimately aren't about how wrong they are, but how they deal with it and move on. And their smaller sins? They skip on them entirely, be it pickpocketting or peeping.

And, as a final spoiler, Hermione's biggest problem is not due to her (cat-enhanced) arrogance, but happens because of her loyalty to her friends and mentors.

***** I'm not asking if there's a comeuppance, but rather a negative effect on their relationship with others.

So rather than a big reveal, other people become standoffish towards them, etc.

****** Nothing that isn't temporary. People mess up and people get over it. Harry's breakups with his girlfriends are messy, but he isn't left with a hole in his heart forever, or even for months. Hermione does stupid things as a cat - which does, ultimately, betray her cover - but that doesn't mean she's doomed.

If you're looking for "lasting consquences" and characters getting punished for their flaws, this isn't the story for you. It's, at it's heart, about a thief, an Auror, their family and friends, and how a bunch of corrupt people get robbed and/or arrested in a series of daring capers and raids while the two protagonists sort out their relationship.

******** On some of their issues. Hermione never really realises how she messed up with the animagus transformation - that's the drawback of mental influences. But all of them are functional, competent people - not some bundles of issues unable to function in society.

** You should read my fic:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13387005/1/My-Life-as-a-Teenage-Gladiator]]

Loosely based off of a prompt I found where Lavender Brown's name was pulled from the Goblet of Fire instead of Harry's.
