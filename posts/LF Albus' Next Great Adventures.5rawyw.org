Among the myriads of dimension hopping fics, I find the sub-genre of Albus Dumbledore going on his next great adventure to be particularly great. These usually find place after his death, and he is sent off to many of the same worlds that MoD-Harry has a tendency to visit. They usually contain a straight-man centenarian Albus in contrast to all the smirking, wise-cracking twenty-somethings Harries out there. I love the calming effect of an old wise man with power to spare on the worlds he enter.

I have links to only two such crossovers on the top of my head:

- Dresden Files ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-next-great-adventure-dresden-files-harry-potter.359091/]])

- Familiar of Zero ([[http://forums.spacebattles.com/showpost.php?p=6182933&postcount=184]])

What others do you know of?


** This is the only such story I ever read.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon).

** Is there not anymore of the Dresden files one? That story was pretty sweet.
