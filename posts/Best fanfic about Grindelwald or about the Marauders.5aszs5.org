** Reading /The Life and Times/ right now. Marauder heavy 6-7 years

/Against the Moon/ is Lupin centric with the Marauder 1-2nd year

/The story of four Friends/ Marauder story haven't read yet

/You want to make a memory?/ Marauder story described to me as their origin story

Don't have the links because I'm in class and trying to take notes

*not sure if these are the best, but my most recent reads that weren't terrible*
