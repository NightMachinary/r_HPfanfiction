:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Here's what I remember:

- Harry is pretty powerful
- Harry is sort of friends with theo
- This is set during the triwizard tournament
- Theo is the Slytherin liaison to Harry during the tournament. Slytherin is backing harry to win the tournament and theo constantly checks in on Harry to make sure that he is actually trying to win and studying.
- In chapter 9 I believe harry has a transfiguration battle with Lisa and Micheal(I think) but the crowd is broken up by Theo. Theo is super upset that Harry is not studying or taking the third task seriously. Harry tries to make him understand but Theo continues to make sure that Harry studies.
- Theo warns Harry that he might be in the lead during the tournament but it doesn't mean that he's won.
- Harry and Padma go on a date sometime in fourth year I think. The date has to do with a muggle movie. Padma is described as stunningly beautiful.
- After the date Harry doesn't really talk to Padma for a while
- She confronts him at the beginning of 5th year and is furious. Harry is a smooth talker and calms her down. She is no longer mad at him but she denies it and says something about the movie being interesting. Ron and Lavender and a few others (maybe Dean and Seamus) are at the scene when this happens and none of them can believe that Harry calmed her down.
- I don't remember what happens after that
- The fic may also have some years other than 4th and 5th but I don't know for sure.
- Like I said above, Theo is constantly on Harry's case about prepping for the tournament. I think there may be money involved?

Any way if anyone could remember this fic it would be great.


** Please post if you do find it. It's now irritating at my mind as well. I know I've read it, because I remember the Padma scene exactly, but I can't find it either.

If you remember any specific phrases, try a google search for it. In case you don't know: Put your phrase in speech marks "Slytherin representative" and finish your search with 'site:fanfiction.net/s/' or 'site:archiveofourown.org/works/' sans quotation marks to get only links to actual stories on those sites with that exact phrasing. Anything outside the speech marks will be searched for too, but it won't look for that exact phrase.

So, you could write:

harry padma date bad muggle interesting "slytherin representative" site:fanfiction.net/s/

and get story pages on FFnet with the phrase 'slytherin representative' and as many of the other terms as possible. I haven't found much, but maybe you'll have better luck than I. :)

**** I think I read it recently too - and since I get 90% of everything I read from this sub, it implies that it's from a thread that's popped up here before.

I've been trying the google search thing from my last comment on and off since yesterday (when the OP posted the first attempt at this fic-search thing) as possible search terms occur to me, but nothing thus far.

*** Gryffindor or Ravenclaw maybe? In that Padma scene I talked about he was friends with Ron but he also talked to some of the others in Ravenclaw. My best guess would be one of those two but I'm struggling to find the fic.

** Might be linkffn(3933832) - Harry Potter and the Invincible TechnoMage.

I think it is Harry/Padma, and it was nice but I remember it dying shortly after Padma cheats on Harry with random guy her dad invited to their home might have been a mind-whammie... but that story beat really annoyed me to the point of me ending up not liking the fic retroactively^{which is what really annoys me tbh}.

and now it's dead or dormant, and no resolution provided -.-'

*** I'm not OP, but I don't think this is it. I've search-term searched the fic and couldn't find the confrontation/interesting muggle movie scene anywhere.
