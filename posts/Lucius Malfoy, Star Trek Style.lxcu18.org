I originally posted this on my Tumblr, thought it would be worthwhile to post it here too.

Imagine, if you will, an alternate universe where Lucius Malfoy lost his magic and decided to become a starship captain, dyeing his prized platinum blonde hair black and changing his name so that no one will recognize the fallen pureblood. Edit: Yes, I'm referring to Star Trek Discovery. I wanted to see just how far Lucius Malfoy would go to escape his checkered past and become someone completely different.


** You mean, Star Trek Discovery?

*** Yes. But I wanted to see how someone made that happen. Connecting the two characters somehow.

** Lorca is not half as dainty as Malfoy but Jason Isaacs is awful in that he makes very evil characters very attractive.
