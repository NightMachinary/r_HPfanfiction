A new form of quasi-immortality is invented: Artificially creating a body and remotely controlling it from a safe location.

Pros:

-Allows the user to have multiple avatars and switch between them

-If the avatar is captured and is about to be interrogated/tortured, the user can just cancel the connection and leave the capturers with an empty husk

-If the avatar is killed, the user still has his normal body and can easily make a new avatar (no floating around as a spirit in an Albanian forest for a decade)

-There's no way to kill the user without attacking his safe location

Cons:

-The user's real body still ages --> not truly living forever, just not killable, Philosopher's stone required for true immortality

-If the safe location from where the user controls the avatars is breached, the user can be killed

-Powerful enemies could disrupt the connection, leaving the avatar vulnerable

-Making new avatars takes time and expensive resources, although a Philosopher's stone could make it easier

-Powerful artefacts that the avatar has on him are lost if he's killed

What do you think about a fic where someone invents/uses this type of immortality to take over the world?


** You should flair your post. Also, this isn't a prompt.

This isn't immortality at all.

It could be a powerful ability, but the wizard using it would have to already be powerful for it to matter. In and of itself, it's not world-conquering ability. If Mediocre McShittyWizard keeps making avatars and trying to take over the world, it won't really matter much.

Your character still needs to have some combination of talent/skill/knowledge/intelligence/power/etc. Enough that they would be a real threat on their own. Then on top of that you have them invent/discover this type of magic, and it takes them to the next level.

The idea is fine, and it could be a very interesting to read, but it's only a pretty small part of what's important. You'd still need a good story to fit this into.
