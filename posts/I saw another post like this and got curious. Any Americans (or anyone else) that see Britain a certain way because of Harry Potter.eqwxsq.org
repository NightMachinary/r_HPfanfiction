****** Pumpkin pie is a delicious North American treasure. (Canadian here) yes we do eat it on/around Thanksgiving, and it is wonderful.

What you should keep in mind is that there are regular pumpkins which taste like squash, and sweet pumpkins for use in tasty treats.

I imagine pumpkin juice isn't just “juiced pumpkin” but something magical is involved, but yeah.

** No. Mostly because:

1: I've lived there and know the people

2: I know recent history.

Brits would have told Voldemort and his merry band of to go fuck themselves.

At his height, Voldemort had (maybe) 150 followers. In a society where EVERYONE is armed at the age of eleven. This is a recipe for dead terrorists. Dead ordinary decent wizards and witches too, but if the general public had only managed to kill one of Tom's buttbuddies for every 20 civilians, the death eaters wouldn't have lasted a year. And there are LOTS of ways to do grievous bodily harm without the 'soul staining' killing curse.

And that whole "you know who" bullshit. In world war 2, where people were dying on an industrial basis, the Brit general public was singing silly songs insulting Hitler. They weren't afraid to say his name.

There are piles of fics who make great use of the 'There is a Taboo on his name" nonsense with Harry and co setting traps for the idiots who show up when someone says "Voldemort".

Which of course raises the question, why did Tom go to the trouble of coming up with a Nom de Stupid and then go out of his way to keep anyone from using it?

Rowling's depiction of the British people is insulting.

**** I was speaking as a citizen of the US. Blaming abject cowardice on magic doesn't make any sense to me. The Brits have a long, long, history of dealing with terrorists (also patriots, the difference being who ultimately won the fight). To have the entirety of Magical Britain, aside from the 3 dozen or so named characters, most of them being children, being terrified of the ineffectual Tommy-boy and his Death Eaters is an insult to the Brits.

****** I don't know. Somehow, the older generation had managed to pass down their fear of Tom's name to the next generation who had NEVER HEARD IT.

No one said "Voldemort" ever. Getting Hagrid to say it was like pulling teeth in the first book. It wasn't even written down in the newspapers, yet Harry's generation reacted to Voldemort being spoken, despite having never heard it. Even the Muggleborn started reacting to the name when they heard it when it would have absolutely no meaning to them, at all.

I mean, as far as anyone from Harry's generation would know, Voldemort's name might have been Sniffy Butthole, because all they ever heard was 'You Know Who" a full decade after he was disembodied, and 6 months to a year after Fudge forgot that he was fully aware that Tom hadn't died when publicly discussing it with Minerva in a pub in Harry's 3rd year.

*** I honestly don't see Rowling's depiction as cowardice. Magic is like a loaded gun for everybody but actually mora than that. Say you have a firearm and go to civilian shooting training on and off, how comfortable you are going into a life or death combat with a special forces member? Magic creates a whole new set of equality and imbalance. And regarding to the you-know-who part, my home country's internet is heavily censored. Publishing something “sensitive” will result in the account being suspended or deleted. People eventually give up using the actually name and use some nickname instead. Not really fear for their life but to avoid inconvenience. I totally can see British wizards avoid the usage of Voldemort if you see it this way. And they are facing more than “inconvenience”. Hitler himself is far away and his attack was't directed to single person. Death eaters' attack are more “personal”. Besides you may have heard of in some culture people avoid mentioning certain things in fear of bad luck. For example, some sailors in my home country won't say “roll over” (which is the same character as “sink”) because they believe saying it will cause their ship to sink. Rowling's wizard may think similar.

**** During the Blitz on London, more than 20,000 people died. Bear in mind that this was JUST in London and that other cities were being bombed as well, most especially the industrial cities. Hitler may have been 'far away' but death came in the dark of night for pretty much anyone.

The reaction was most certainly terror, but also mocking the Jerry bastards. A generation later, some fool so inept that he was being held at bay by Dumbledore managed to terrify the population to the point where they couldn't say his made up name.

** being a heathen american, I would say that I tend to make comparisons in my mind between the death eaters' beliefs and american evangelical fundamentalism that maybe other audiences do not

this is definitely one reason why some of us found validation in the books and reading HP became a way to stick it to the man after some people tried to ban them

ETA: just realized that this answer was totally off-topic, sorry my ADHD is really acting up

anyway, HP was my gateway drug to british comedy & pop culture because of references in the OG books and fics so thanks JKR you're doing the lord's work

**** oh man this is a rabbit hole so I will try to be succinct

when I say evangelicals (although this is likely not the dictionary definition), I'm talking about people like Mike Pence whose devout protestant beliefs are entwined with the Republican party platform. if you're in the UK, I would say along the lines of Arlene Foster & the DUP.

when I say fundamentalism, I'm talking about people like the Duggars (from the TV show 19 Kids and Counting) who basically live in a world of their making that is nothing like the common secular American culture. the kind of people who picket abortion providers and pride parades.

I definitely cope with things through sarcasm and dark humor so those elements in UK books/TV have always appealed to me. But when I lived there I did have to get used to the amount of piss taking, like sometimes it felt kinda insulting but then I realized it wasn't. Ugh that sounds so reductive but I can't think of a more precise explanation.

** The closest story I have about this revolves around Pokemon. The new Galar region is based on the UK, and the dialogue and descriptions are peppered with Britishisms such as "mum" and "telly". One of the main NPCs is described as "pants with directions" by his brother. Someone says they're "having a chin-wag" instead of getting out and fixing the problem at hand. Stuff like that. And I've apparently read enough Harry Potter fic to smoothly take it all in without a second thought, because the pants thing (for example) has been the subject of more than a few confused comments.
