I think that Hufflepuff is underrated as a house, its the house of hard work and friendship. I think that harry would do really well if he had a house that was willing to stick with him through thick and thin. Hard work could be used to make harry a more rounded character.


** Perhaps not what you're looking for (because this Harry's /thing/ is laziness), but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][Harry the Hufflepuff by BajaB]] and its [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7330591/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff-2][sequel]] are hilarious.

*** Oh my god this story actually had me laughing hysterically. It's one of the most humorous HP stories I've ever read. It's too bad the author won't do all seven books!

** Not the greatest fiction, but possibly readable: Cwycross's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/C-est-La-Vie][C'est La Vie]] has Harry sorted into Hufflepuff. 108k words, last updated May 2013. (Probably abandoned; the author is notorious for never finishing stories.)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change][To Shape and Change]] has Harry sorted into Hufflepuff if my memory serves. Sorry for the messy link, I'm on mobile.

Edit: Fixed the link.

*** I gave that one up when Harry started healing for Pomfrey with /parselmagic/ two weeks after getting sorted. I really enjoyed Snape back in time and mentoring Harry though. Should I give it another try?

**** There's definitely a bit too much overpowered/too smart Harry, which the author tries to explain that away with him just having a better support network. However, Voldemort and the Death Eaters aren't exactly easy to beat in the story, so that prevents it from being boring.

It's a decent story to while away an afternoon with. At least Harry's not obnoxious like he often is when made smarter or more powerful than canon.

**** Might be referring to [[http://corvidae9.livejournal.com/344634.html][Switch]]. Good fic, unfortunately abandoned midway through third year (unless it was continued elsewhere that I don't know about).
