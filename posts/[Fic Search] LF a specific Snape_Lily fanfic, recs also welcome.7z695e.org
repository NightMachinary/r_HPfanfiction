Hi everyone :3 I'm trying to find a Snily fanfic that I read sometime last year and forgot to save or bookmark. I cannot even recall if I read it on AO3, FF.net or somewhere else.

What I do remember:

- It was set year or two after Hogwarts, during the war.

- Lily was with James (engaged to him, I think?) but she wasn't sure she loved him. She found out she was pregnant and so left James and the wizarding world.

- I think Lily and Petunia reconciled and she left Harry with her?

- Afterwards Lily returned to the wizarding world and to the Order but everyone - except perhaps Lupin - distrusted her. James outright hated her (and started drinking a lot?). She didn't tell anybody about the baby.

- During all this she somehow started being friends, and then more, with Severus.

- Severus was Death Eater and later he became a spy.

- At one point the Order got Severus and were holding him captive somewhere (in Moody's trunk??).

- At the end Lily somewhat reconciled with James. He was pissed at her she didn't tell him he had a son.

I'm pretty sure I didn't dream this fic up but then... I searched for three days and did not find it anywhere T^{T} At first I thought it could be A Dream Carved in Stone since the description sounded similar but it is not.

I would be really grateful if someone could tell me the name. Also, if you know about some good lesser-known Snape/Lily fics, tell me! :3

*** Thank you so much! I somehow have it fixed as a time-travelling fic but I forgot about the second part where Lily returns back to her timeline. No wonder I couldn't find it :D

** Ananke and A Dream Carved in Stone are both great! Have you checked out linkffn(puzzle by we-built-the-shadows-here) yet? It's a new, really good and realistic Snape/Lily fic that updates pretty often. Also I'd recommend linkffn(obscura nox animae) as it has a pretty unique premise. Old standbys are linkffn(the moment it began by sindie) and linkffn(come once again and love me).

  Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters. AU Sequel posted: The Moment It Ended.

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE
