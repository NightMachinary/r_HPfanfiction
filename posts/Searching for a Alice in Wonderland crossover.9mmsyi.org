The fic was set pre-Hogwarts and was either a WIP or abandoned when I read it. I'm pretty sure it starts with Harry seeing the white rabbit racing through the Dursley's garden and finding it's pocket watch. He takes the watch and it actually allows him to open portals to other universes. Harry goes to wonderland and the watch was able to show him the time that's passing on Earth.

​

The watch also allowed him into the Soul Eater universe where he finds a young weapon girl whose a sword or maybe able to take multiple forms and she comes with him as he moves onto other universes. I'm also pretty sure he ended up in Final Fantasy, abducted by an evil organization and experimented upon, where he learns that maybe this universe hopping thing isn't all fun and games. Peter Pan may have been another world he visited but I'm not too sure on that one.

​

Any help would be appreciate, thanks!
