I just had the worst idea. In "Raise Your Glass" by P!nk the chorus has the line "dirty little freaks". Young Harry hears this song and decides to take the lyrics to be the creed for how he lives his life.


** The video popped up 1st on a television set in a sainsbury's we know he had been walking past. Something new the muggles had invented called MTV Was featured on the small screen in the window the speakers blasting, as a woman dress as Rosie the riveter started to sing,about dirty little freaks, making harry pause , that was what his uncle always called him when he was angry or would mutter under his breathe if they were in a train station with other people around... the woman seemed to be celebrating freaks not cursing them So Harry stood transfixed and listened to a song that would Alter the course of his life.

To the point that when he was 11 just hours after turning it he smuggled what little pocket money he could muster over the last few years down to the local record shop the only one within walking distance of privet drive just after dawn before he even noticed the owls, The old man who owned the shop was just opening up when he arrived with his pocket bulging with change and a loose 5er found on the railroad tracks just behind the churchyard.

The old man had seen the look in the young boy's eyes and pointed him towards the album he requested and then offered up suggestions most from the punk and classic rock section , Not entirely appropriate for children but something the old man thought the young man needed to listen to at this moment... Harry's stack of cassettes and records towered nearly a foot tall by the end of it everything from The Beatles to Nirvana, guns and roses and the rolling stones, even the smashing pumpkins was amassed in the collection. And when Harry heard the total his heart sank but for the old man offered quietly for him to pay what he could and take the rest as a birthday present, from one freak to another... the old had actually laughed and smiled when harry explained why he wanted the original album he had woken up so early to purchase...

The man even gave Harry his old footlocker to hid the cashe of music in Along with a slightly weathered walkman that had seen better days but was still perfectly functional.

Harry spent the last hour of the morning before the dursley's awoke ride around 10 burying a metal footlocker full of the most precious music in existence behind the garden shed where even Uncle Vernon dared venture Because of the persistent wasp investigation At the neighbors just near the fence that they never bothered to call in exterminator for.

Harry risked it and spent tbe morning of his birthday in a The cupboard under the stairs listening to a disguised music player And discovering the wonder that was the punk and rock movements of music... Understanding now completely that freaks or everywhere and he was one of those special people that could create and do things ordinary people couldn't... he was special in a good way... He was a freak and it was glorious.... The music told him that..... The owls that started showing up a few hours later just confirmed it.
