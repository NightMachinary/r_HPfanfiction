So I love reading fanfics but these days I find myself sadly kinda picky about what I read. I for the most part strongly dislike bashing (especially dumbledore) as I see these characters as flawed but not evil and have read this trope so much I can't stand it. If anyone has any links to fics where Harry is more mature (in the sense of understanding and not 'i never forgive' and where he gets that he doesn't always know best), and/or where Harry is in general capable and thinks logically. I also typically dislike cannon rehashes so bonus points for AU or Canon-Divergence! Thanks to any and all who reply I look forward to reading your recs :)


** Have you read linkffn(methods of rationality)? That's one of my very favorite ficus and it had a very mature powerful Harry but it's done extremely well

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

  Having spent over fifty years as a notebook the fragment of soul who still refers to himself as Tom Riddle regains influence over the mortal plane and finds reality to be an ephemeral thing while Harry Potter, a young boy of eight, discovers that things both are and are not what they seem. AU
