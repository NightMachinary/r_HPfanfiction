Hello,

I am looking for Hufflepuff Oc centric stories. I don't care if they are female, male, genderneutral, or anything else. I am also ok with gen fics, romance beween a canon character and the oc or even other oc's.

I have read some Hufflepuff reader x Draco and also some Reader x Fred so if you know some of those please tell me!

Thank you

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship.
