I just finished my newest batch of fanfictions and updates and now I'm looking for something more to read but the search didn't offer anything new :)

Mainly looking for good canon rewrites (maybe different house ?), finished Serpensortia yesterday but sadly that was ended early.

Otherwise I read the Resolution fanfic by Slytherin's Dragon and liked it but it seems like it's abandoned (Blaise and Harry both as aurors travel back in time, teach people, are experts on their field and start a position business) which was interesting to read because it was the time travel without being pretty much a "rebirth" fanfiction.

Recommend away :)

*** I might give it a try, though I am not a huge FemHarry fan, maybe I just haven't read a good one yet. Thanks!

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister. Harry/Ginny, Rose/Cedric
