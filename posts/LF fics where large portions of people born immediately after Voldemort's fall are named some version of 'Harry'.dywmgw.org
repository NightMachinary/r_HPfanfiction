I really wanna see a fic where half the people in Ginny or Romilda's year are named some form of Harry. Or 'Lily' or 'James'...or if Neville is the BWL then I wanna see a lot of Nevilles, Alices or Franks. Silly premise, I know, but the fics can be serious fics too! No ship restrictions either.

Thanks in advance!


** Ugh. I remember a scene describing this in a fic, but I have NO clue what it was. I described it 7 months ago.

  I have no idea what it was but I remember one fic had a scene set in 2nd? 3rd? year about how most of the incoming students had (some variation) of either Harry, James, Lily, Or Potter in their name.

*** I feel like it was this fic. There was a kid named Harry Planter or maybe I'm confusing it with another fic.

**** It certainly could have been [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/][Harry McGonagall]], it does fit in the right time frame for when I would have read the scene I am thinking of.

*** I remember the very same scene, I think, but I can't seem to find it specifically.

Could it be linkffn(9863146) chapter 86 "Fourth Year" ?

#+begin_quote
  There had been a lot of celebrating after Voldemort was defeated the first time, and for months and even years afterwards, couples who had been holding off on having children (or more children) had at it, so it was unsurprising that the birth rate skyrocketed nine months after victory was announced. That day was the first of August 1982, which meant that the largest chunk of the subsequent baby boom was starting Hogwarts this year. Ron was right: there /were/ about a hundred of them. Many of them were waving to older siblings at the tables. From the awkward waves back, it seemed like practically everybody had a younger brother or sister in this year.

** It is mentioned in linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel), chapter 87:

#+begin_quote
  Harry was still incredulous: “But there are really that many of you out of---how many first-years are there?”

  “Ninety-seven, by my count,” Hermione said. “It is a little out of proportion.”

  “I wonder how Gryffindor got so many,” Neville mused.

  “I think maybe it's because...” Natalie started, and then trailed off. The older students gave her and expectant look, and continued, “a lot of them tried to be more Gryffindorish because they're named after you, Harry.”

  “What?”

  “You or one of your parents,” the small girl said nervously. “I thought you'd noticed. I asked around, and out of twenty-eight first-year Gryffindors, fourteen have some form of Harry, James, or Lily as either a first name or a middle name. There's a lot of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, too. I've heard Harry, Henry, Harold, Harriet, James, Jamie, Lily, and Lilian, and there's one boy whose first name is Potter.”
