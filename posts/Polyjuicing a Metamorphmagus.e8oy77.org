What would happen, say if you tried to use a hair of a metamorphmagus in polyjuice potion???

What would happen say if someone impersonates Nymphadora tonks, which form would they acquire???


** Probably the base form that includes a pale, heart-shaped face and mousy, brown hair.

** Since canon is silent on this, you could set it up a number of ways for the sake of a story. Of note: hairs aren't the only thing one can use as source material for a person's form.

1. Polyjuiced person gets to be a metamorphmagus for a while - overpowered, cheap way to appropriate the talent, but not improbable

2. Polyjuiced person appears as whatever Tonks looked like at the time the sample material was taken - since Polyjuice is reactive to current condition (Barty Crouch lost his eye and leg while polyjuiced into Mad-eye Moody), this seems most plausible

3. Polyjuice 'steals' the metamorph talent from Tonks while in effect

4. Metamorph material is incompatible with Polyjuice - the imbiber randomly shapeshifts into someone else, perhaps based on their subconscious, or into a half-version of themself and whomever they're thinking of, or something... horrible

5. as above, except it's permanent

6. as above, except it causes uncontrolled changes every few hours

7. imbiber changes shape into something like George R. R. Martin, because that's Tonks' "true form"

All sorts of possibilities; don't limit yourself.

** Polyjuice seems to copy the basic form and physical capabilities. That would mean they are physically a metamorphmagus but don't have the skill to use it properly or even control it. Poly Tonks is walking down Diagonally and every time they see a new person they involuntarily change into a copy of that person and so on.

** Great question! I imagine it has a lot to do with how the trait is passed genetically... I mean, is it like Hagrid's giant blood that is resistant to polyjuice magic? How did Tonks come by her metamorphmagus abilities? Was it passed down through the Black side of the family or the Tonks side?

** polyjuice must only mimic the superficial appearances or crouch jnr would have been suffering whatever damage moody was from being locked in that box all year.

** Maybe whatever form they are in at the time the hair (or other bit) is taken.

** There's a similar question as well: what are the effects of a metamorphmagus imbibing polyjuice potion? Do they retain their metamorphing ability?

** - Base Form
- Whatever their current form is (There's an OC-SI/Tonks fic that features this. Trivializes the second task. Gives everyone a hair of their current body + gills.)
- Potion Explodes from the instability
- They get the powers, but they run out of control

Pick one.
