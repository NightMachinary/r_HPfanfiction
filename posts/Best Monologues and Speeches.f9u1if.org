As the title says, I'm looking for great speeches and monologues throughout fanfiction. Can be about anything, or for any reason, or in any context, but they have to be 'Great' (capital G vital :D). Could be quiet things like Robin Williams' 'your move, chief' in Good Will Hunting, pretty much anything from Shakespeare, The Helm's Deep Charge speech from Lord of the Rings, etc. I'm curious if any fanfic writer has nailed that emotionally evoking thing you need to make a good speech or monologue, quiet or loud.


** It's been six months since I did this... Can I help it if I'm proud of my own work?

Context: in this variation, Harry is taught Occlumency by a better teacher. The unfortunate consequence is that he doesn't find out about Nagini attacking Arthur outside the Department of Mysteries, so he isn't shocked awake in time to inform the Headmaster about it. Arthur isn't found as quickly, and eventually succumbs to the venom and dies. A few days later, the Weasleys host a wake outside the Burrow.

#+begin_quote
  The gathering grew in size, spreading out to fill the garden, the orchard, the pond and down the lane towards Ottery St. Catchpole.

  Many people who had arrived just past the sunrise were still there by midday, as if they wouldn't leave until told to do so. Harry was sitting with Ron when he asked him about it.

  "It was like this when we lost Uncle Bilius. They come until they feel everyone expected has arrived, then they shuffle off. I s'pose it's meant to show how much someone will be missed."

  "And you're supposed to just... mingle all day?"

  "Some people like to make a speech, but no one has to." Ron nodded towards a makeshift podium where a wizened old warlock was babbling about bendy billiard cues.

  Harry stood up. He had no reason to do it. No one had asked him. Being the center of attention certainly wasn't his favorite thing, but in this case, for this man, he'd discovered a need to speak.

  He strode over to the podium. A minute later, the man noticed Harry waiting and hurriedly ended his reminscence with,"Ah, Arthur, I'll miss you."

  The warlock nodded to Harry while tapping his own throat with his wand, and then walked off. Harry took his position.

  "Sonorous." He felt a swelling in his throat. It didn't obstruct anything but was an odd sensation nonetheless."Uhh... hi. You may not know me but I'm Harry Potter."

  Harry looked up at the crowd and suddenly was caught by waves of pressure that seemed to be coming from them. Every person there was looking at him, and there were a few hundred at least. Emotions were rolling at him in discordant tones and rhythms and it made him dizzy for a moment, until he could center his mind. Once he'd caught his breath, he re-invoked the Harry he wanted to be at that moment, then spoke.

  "I haven't known Arthur Weasley for as long as most of you. In fact, he could only convince me to call him Arthur a few months ago. But I'm absolutely blown away -- I mean, overwhelmed.

  "There are so many people here today. I mean, I knew that Arthur was a nice guy. Very pleasant. Able to put even a really nervous kid like me at ease by asking an odd question about the meaning and function of a rubber duck." Harry chortled, but then took a drink of water to cover for it.

  "That was Arthur to me- the man who couldn't quite understand muggles, even though they fascinated him. It's no surprise that he would make it his job to protect them from jinxes and the like.

  "A nice man, was Arthur. Mind you, the rest of the family is a bit batty... ," he paused to allow some titters to subside, "but Arthur never minded that. I think he liked that about them.

  "Yet that doesn't explain all of you being here."

  Harry paused again to change the tone of his delivery to something more forceful.

  "Nice men die all the time. They die at home or in hospital or when falling victim to something, whether accidental or, uh, malicious. Nice men like that are missed. Their family grieves for them, and friends offer a pat on the back and shot of whisky and the usual, 'Ahh, whatsisname- he was a nice fellow. Cheers.'"

  Harry noticed something in the corner of his eye; the previous speaker was grumping a bit. Harry gave him a nod to apologise for using him as an example.

  "That doesn't explain all of you coming here. I think the difference is that Arthur Weasley was a good man. Good. Loving, kind, patient with his family and with strangers. Good with a quick joke. Willing to offer advice, but wouldn't be offended if you chose to ignore it. Arthur spoke as quietly as needed but firmly when necessary. He represented his ideals in his every action.

  "That's why you're all here. He was a Good man. And I think you're also here for the same reason I am; there's a hole where Arthur was. I... I'm going to miss him. You will, too. Because he won't be there to add his honest opinion any more. His jokes will need to be told by someone else. Someone else will need to disarm the traps and protect the unwary and say nice things to strangers... and calm down frightened young boys with a silly question.

  "That's what I wanted to point out. Missing him isn't enough. We need to carry on with his work. If you came here to find a way to deal with the loss of Arthur Weasley, here it is; be him, every once in a while. Add the intentions of a Good man to your life, for Arthur. I don't know how many of you will do it, but let me say that if just a tenth of you strove to add a good Arthur-like deed every once in a while... well, we might be able to keep up with all the good that Arthur Weasley could have done, that he can't do now that he's gone.

  "As for me, I've already vowed to do my 'Arthur'-best to improve the lives of those around me, starting with his family. Starting with this speech."

  Harry was tempted to stop there. He probably should have, but...

  "There's one thing, though. One un-Arthurish thing that I feel I have to do."

  He felt the tone of the audience change in response- a hint of curiosity. He could feel their attention building towards him. He let it collect for a few seconds.

  "I'm going to track down the creature that did this to Arthur and burn it until it screams," Harry declared, "And I'll keep burning him until he can't scream any more."

  The rage was kept in control. He let the heat simmer away from his face and consciously relaxed his shoulders.

  "Thank you," he said, invoked a silent Quietus, and then left the podium for the next speaker to have their say.

  Of course, he had no idea who came after him as he was enveloped in Weasleys soon after.

***** How inappropriate/explicit are we talking? I'm very asexual, so I find most overly smutty fics to be either baffling or appallingly scandalous in that "You do /what/?!" sort of way and I'm trying to debate if I should add it to the To-Read list. No offence intended - I'm sure it's great, but if there's too much fuckin' I end up skipping over most of the fic out of boredom so I have a habit of checking first. :D

** Well to be honest it sounds like your not making much distinction between "quotes/quips" and speeches or monologues, which itself is vast. Here are some speeches I remember in particular:

- Harry reliving the memories of Dumbledore in Ch. 1 of linkffn(The One He Feared). Absolutely nails both the sense of awe at the beginning section as well as the Dumbledore-ness of the character
- Ron's explanation to Harry in Ch. 1 of linkffn(Contractual Invalidations). Absolutely nails the best friend Ron that most people forget in the fandom, and Harry's response is totally on point: "you're the best friend ever."
- The part where Neville comes out and reveals his greatest fear in linkffn(Oh God Not Again!) is actually Harry as Minister of Magic, and the corresponding Boggart. Cancel Tuesdays indeed.
- Hermione's commentary on Harry's growth during the memory chapter in linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher).
- When Ron, Hermione and the Weasleys finally sit down and ask Jasmine about her experiences in the last 5000 years in linkffn(The Long Journey Home). The nonchalance is just so...believable and honest.
- Several monologues by both Voldemort and Verdandi on how the Dark and White Arts are both opposite and identical in linkffn(The Crown of Metis).

YMMV

*** Yeah. I'm trying to focus on the big speeches and monologues, but I found that if I try to get too specific with my requests, they somehow end up sounding like something other than what I originally intended, so I was trying to keep it simple. All the things I mentioned were definitely speeches and monologues though, so I hoped that would be enough. Guess not. C'est la vie. :D

The only ones I've read are Contractual Invalidation, Oh God Not Again!, and A Long Journey Home, and the only one that really fits is the latter. The first two are definitely more quips than speeches or monologues.

** There's a really insightful bit in, of all things, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10836553/6/Harry-Five-0][Harry Five-O]]:

#+begin_quote
  "I can't believe anyone would do this to him, why?" She practically wailed.

  Harry conjured a small sofa and sat her down with him.

  "Before I was born there was a seer. Someone who would sometimes see glimpses of the future... prophecies." Harry told her. "She prophesied about someone being born who would be able to defeat the Dark Lord. This Dark Lord was killing and torturing people because he enjoyed it.

  "About a year later, I was born. I fulfilled part of the prophecy simply because I was born 'as the seventh month dies'." He said with finger-quotes. "The Dark Lord heard part of the prophecy and knew of my birth. He came to my home and killed my father whilst he tried to give my mother time to get us away... but he just breezed through, killing my dad.

  "When he reached my bedroom where my mother was hiding with me, she begged him to leave me be. But he killed her without a thought. Then he tried to kill me."

  Harry lifted his fringe to display his scar. "This is all I have left of that night. The curse backfired and destroyed his body and completed another part of the prophecy that said 'he will mark him as his equal'.

  "That just left the final part of the prophecy. 'Neither can live whilst the other survives.'

  "Now... you could say that it was prophesied and meant to be and blame the whole thing on fate or destiny. But really it boils down to the fact that the Dark Lord was a bastard who should have been strangled at birth. Unfortunately there were no prophecies about him back then.

  "I suffered a lot from the time I was fifteen months old until I moved to America a few years ago. Each and every person who inflicted that suffering on me did so for the same reason: Power.

  "For some it was monetary power, others, political power. The worst did it because they enjoyed the feeling of power they got from hurting and controlling others.

  "The reason I am telling you this story is because Ian was killed for the same reason. Power. It could be the money, the influence he had over young people like you, or it could be that some stupid idiot felt threatened by him and they wanted to take back a non-existent imagined power.

  "Ian is gone. It is going to hurt for a bit. But when all is said and done you will be able to look back on the time he spent in your life and the time you spent in his and smile and laugh and tell your friends and family about those good times. But for now, focus on finishing his case and remember to lean on the rest of us."
#+end_quote

It was the inspiration for a vaguely similar speech in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12498125/31/Umino-Iruka-and-the-Will-of-Fire][one of my own fics]]:

#+begin_quote
  "Why did he do that?" Harry's voice was faint, small.

  "Power," Iruka answered. "Ever since they took custody of you, all three Dursleys had a lot of power over you. For a man like Vernon, and I've seen plenty of them before, power is one of their greatest cravings. Some rise to high positions where they have tremendous power, but some end up lower on the ladder. They're always aware of the fact that there's someone above them, someone that has power over them, and it chafes worse than sandpaper underwear. To have someone like you available, someone over whom he could exercise near-absolute power, would have been intoxicating for such a man."

  "The first problem that cropped up was magic. Ever since last summer, he'd been feeling the threat of magic-users hanging over him. That was a kind of power he couldn't match, couldn't overcome, so it left him scared. He also had to worry about whether /you/ would have that power when you came back, and take his power away. Instead, /I/ took his power away at that first meeting, and I did it inside his home, one of the places where he should feel safest and most secure and powerful. The day after your birthday, he tried to exercise power over you, and I stopped him with an even greater show of power, again making him feel weak and helpless in his own home."

  "His fear from that incident kept him at bay, until today. I don't know what tipped the scales, but somehow his hate, anger, and most importantly his need to retake his power overcame his fear of me. Most likely, after killing or incapacitating me, he'd have called in the police and told them I forced my way into his home and threatened him. Then, once I was out of the way, his attention would have turned to you. There's no telling how exactly he would have reasserted his power over you, but the cupboard would probably have been part of it; almost certainly, he'd have tried to keep you from returning to Hogwarts."

There are a few monologues/lectures in my fic, probably as a result of my own tendency to lecture.

*** I have not read either of those fics, but they sound brilliant. Definitely adding the Hawaii Five-0 one to the list.

Iruka sounds like a familiar name (though I think that's an Avatar/Korra character?), but I don't really know much about Naruto aside from Vegeta having a ridiculous name. Would I, as a Naruto neophyte, be able to keep up with your fic, or would I have to see some of the series first?

**** For most of the fic, you could get by with just having watched the first episode (or read the first chapter), since that's the biggest place Iruka's featured. A lot of the terminology would be less confusing having watched through the first ten or so episodes (shorter than it sounds if you skip past the copious recap at the start of most episodes) or read the first couple volumes of the manga.

That, plus occasional references to the wiki, should leave at least most of the Naruto-content easy enough to follow, though you'd have to read/watch a bit further to encounter most of the characters that are referenced. Then again, the first couple seasons / first few volumes are most of the series's best content anyway.

***** Ah, okay. So, basically the old 'read with a dictionary' method. I getcha. I'll add it to the list then, see what I can follow along with.

*** Oooh. That's nicely threatening. Very reminiscent of some of the more... vengeful fantasy literature out there.

From the summary, he's met a weird fuckin' Goddess, but I suppose 35,000 words of paedophilia is tolerable for a good speech (Harry being 15 in '96 when Sirius dies). Is the romance as... unfortunate as the premise? I'm guessing from a T-rating it's not too... vivid or explicit.

EDIT - In rereading that sounded way more aggressive and disappointed than I intended, so I thought I'd add this to say that I'm thoroughly grateful for your rec and just questioning whether the fic is viable for me. No aggression intended.

  Harry's subconscious pleaded in desperation "Please! Anything! I'll give -- !" and a goddess heard his plea and offered him a deal. She will save Sirius, if Harry agrees to marry Severus Snape in return. Mild Slash.
