:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi guys! I've been lurking in and out for a while but this is my first post, please forgive/correct any mistakes.

Wealthy!Harry is my guilty pleasure genre, and they tend to meld after a while, so I'm hoping someone can help me find this one (or maybe two, I may have conflated them.) One is definitely a Lord of Azkaban fic, the other might not be. For the Azkaban one, there is a community on the island, and my main memory is Harry bringing some of the children to Hogwarts as a cultural exchange. I'm 98% sure they get their own house. The other, I remember very little detail of, just that Harry was exploring his manor on a broom, there was a town and a beach/seaside and some kind of industry, maybe weaving of some kind? I know that's really nothing to go on, I'm sorry!

In general I'd love to read anything where Harry inherits a community of some kind, if you can think of anything. Thank you!


** The first is "Lord of Caer Azkaban", I believe.

** I also believe that the first is Lord of Caer Azkaban by Rorschach's Blot

For the second There are a couple stories that could possibly be "it" but to me it sounds more like Harem War by Radaslab

  A letter causes Harry to learn some surprising things about his lineage, a different twist on the usual Harry in Azkaban story line.

  AU post OoTP. Poor Harry. Sirius left him far more than a house and some money. Dumbledore is the Dark Lord? And what is he supposed to do with the women he was left? Sometimes, Pranks suck and others they are opportunities. H/Multi

**** Harem war seemed right at first, but I don't usually read fics that explicit, so I'd say not. Thanks for the rec, though! I appreciate it.
