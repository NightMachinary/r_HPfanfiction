So far my opinion of Remus boils down to "Meh, with a side of cowardly". I've only seen two interesting Remus.

- Where he becomes a private investigator. linkffn(6275865)

- Where he used to work as an arms dealer, and gives Harry a rocket launcher in the TWT to turn the dragon into chunky salsa. Can't remember which fic it was, but the focus wasn't on Remus.

If you have anything Remus-related that it's worth reading (And hopefully completed/updated not too long ago?), I'd be thankful.


** Oh, arms-dealer Remus sounds interesting! I hope someone's able to track it down.

  Remus had the Dursleys whacked. Tactfully, of course, and well after Harry left the house.

  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.

*** Emperor. The fic I always say I'll read, but never do. Not even sure why.

I'll give it a try. Someday.

Thanks!

**** It's massively AU, but if you can get into it, it's great.

For whenever you do choose to read it, I'll just say that you should at least skim the authors notes, there's one particularly important piece of info about the political state of Europe that affects the starting conditions of the AU in the first place.

**** I read until about chapter 8. It's not bad. In fact I quite enjoyed it. But... It's alot of effort. Its a huge world, and its very AU (yhe nuggle world is even rather AU). There's just so much and each chapter is huge. Read it, but only if you have a good couple hours, and only a bit at a time. Normally I abhor unfinished stories, but I feel this was one that would have been better to read a chapter at a time.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
