Im looking for a story I read a while back (3+ years).

Things I remember:

Harry/Hermione, Hogwarts age

Harry was owl animagus and had marauder name based on his animagus

He had left Britain and was living in France with Sirius and possibly Remus

I know there was a seen where Harry as an owl delivers a letter to Hermione who doesnt know it is him, think its at Hogwarts, but may not be


** I don't think this is what you are looking for, or at least not all of what you're looking for, but this has an owl Harry named Puck.

  Remus was so shocked at seeing Sirius fall through the veil that Harry had raced past him before the boy's intentions even registered with the werewolf. Screaming "Sirius!" Harry followed his godfather into the veil before anyone could stop him. H/Hr

** There's one I can think of like this where Harry delivers a letter, and Hedwig comes along. But Hedwig is also a human animagus, so both she and Harry turn back into humans in Hermiones room and they all start a relationship together... is that the one you're looking for lol.
