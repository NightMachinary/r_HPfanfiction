I am looking for some stories that include a young Severus Snape as a major character. He does not need to be the main character or the narrator. By young, I mean anywhere from 10 to 25 years old.

They can either be set in the past, involve time travel, de-aging, whatever. Romance is a plus, and I'm okay with smut that has a little substance. Het, Slash, or Gen. Any rating. I would prefer longer fics.

I am especially interested in characterizations of Snape where he has ties to Muggle life or lifestyles (Muggle clothes, music, habits, etc).

Any suggestions?


** There's the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][Snape Chronicles]] except for the fact it's Snape's life from his birth to his death and not 10-25.

You can skip the first parts of course but it's entirely worth it to read it all.

It's not time-travel or slash or anything but pretty canon-compliant.

Oh and you said you preferred longer fics right? Look no further.

** By the same author [[/u/Rawem]] mentioned, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8046304/1/Severus-Snape-The-Middle-Years]]) is about Snape as a teacher between '83 & '85; it's the same universe as the Chronicles.

Edit: Had the years wrong.

  When you are by several decades the youngest professor at Hogwarts and have, in addition, one foot in the muggle world, it is only natural that the Headmaster would turn to you for certain 'tasks' he would not trust to others. Just for fun.

**** The others -- Reflections in the Silver Mist, and Elementary 1 & 2 are all in the same universe as well, though Elementary 2 is abandoned. Still, they're good reads and I know that whole universe ran the gamut of my emotions.

This is probably why my favorite character is Snape, these were the first HP fanfics I read.

** I'm kinda obsessed about writing about Severus so I have a lot of short oneshots about his life at various points on my profile.

However when it comes to longer fics, I would recommend [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11241424/1/When-One-Door-Closes][When One Door Closes]]. It involves Snape just after the first war, but I'm still working on finishing it.

I also really enjoyed [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9993319/1/The-Young-Adventurer-s-Club][The Young Adventurer's Club]]

** One fic I really enjoyed but have never been able to rec before as it never fit anyone's request is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2446736/1/Better-Angels][Better Angels]] by lmk05. The premise is that snape was born a slave and bought by Lucious Malfoy's father. They sent him to Hogwarts to be trained as a potions master, but when hung upside down at the end of his 5th year by the Marauders, everyone saw his slave tattoo, and the Malfoys pulled him out of Hogwarts. James felt so guilty that he bought Snape from the Malfoys, and the story starts off with Snape getting to know James as a master. There is no romance (or sex at all - other than references) in this fic in any way, it is just a really unique look into the mind of a magical slave and a nice characterization of James. It also mostly follows canon even though this is obviously a big change. Linkffn(2446736)

****** Okay...Apparently I needed to clarify myself... I think Not a fairytale fits your description the most, Lily and the Halfblood Prince are both excellent fics that have a lot of chapters written by very dedicated writers, and they are actually compliant with canon unlike all the au's. For me that is a merit however most prefer au. All of Our Somedays has an unique perspective and writing style, despite having short chapters. But it's also in line with the book story. I wanted to delete this post because of my own story, that isn't really a recommendation according to most people, but whatever. Edit: I meant to include Always but Lily and the Halfblood Prince does have a sequal
