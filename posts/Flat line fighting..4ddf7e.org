What are you favourite stories that involve a chapter where Harry is pushed until he snaps, or something happens that makes him go all Equilibrium on his enemies?

(For those who have not seen Equilibrium, shame on you, but here is the scene from the movie: [[https://youtu.be/4weEXyoXZKs]])


** I don't understand this at all. His brainwaves stop or something? What are they measuring?

*** It's supposed to show he's no longer showing emotions, he's reached Equilibrium and can now act as he's expected, a weapon without emotion slowing his reaction times. It's a very fun movie. It's thematic sequel, Ultraviolet, has great gun play too but isn't as good. There's supposed to be a thematic trilogy of gunkata films but Ultraviolet's poor box office, I believe, killed the third film.

*** "His brain waves" Not his, but definitely the director's. It's hard to watch that scene and not imagine how stupid it would look from a bird's eye view. Just some guy doing backflips while a couple dozen dudes in helmets inexplicably miss tons of easy shots at point-blank range.

** The Equilibrium movie's fighting style is very different from the HP series'.

In equilibrium, gun kata relies on absolute knowledge of the environment, mobility and two weapons capable of sustaining a very high rate of precision fire for longer than a minute. The idea being that you're using one bullet for one target, every time, whilst fighting at ultra-close-range. It's partially why gun kata is one of those awesome, yet wildly impractical ideas-actually getting to the point where it becomes a useful skill implies a ridiculous amount of training. As in, you're better off basically going through military training until you can gank an SAS squad instead of trying for this, it's so impractical-not to mention that ultra-close-range means that, probabilities-wise, you're not long of this world even as a Grand Master of the style. All it'd take is one dude with an unpinned hand grenade and 20-30+ years of demanding, heavy training gets blown out the window with your cerebellum.

Magical fighting relies on one ultra-versatile weapon whose capabilities depend on the knowledge & memories of the one wielding it. It's probably why magical fighting is so rare-sustaining a functional picture of the battle in progress in your mind to use as a decision-making tool whilst simultaneously determining what the best spells to use in the fight for the foreseeable future (which is, at most, five seconds therein) whilst also trying to guess what the other fighters are going to use spell-wise whilst ultimately trying to cast a spell whilst on the move, under fire & under threat from every angle, ground included, with no time to react, recalculate or reinterpret decisions made two steps & three-quarters of a second ago means that a magical fighter places a significant strain on themselves during a battle-or they die quickly. The fact that Voldemort could do /just that/ whilst being heavily outnumbered with a level of skill sufficient to walk away victorious without a scratch anywhere to be seen on him would go a long way to explaining just why the man was absolutely feared. He's basically Vader storming a fully staffed Jedi Temple with two batallions' worth of backup, day in, day out, over and over again, and walking away with an air of bored petulance about him every single time while the Temple exploded behind him.

So when a wizard who isn't Tom Riddle snaps and starts tossing magic around, he or she dies very very quickly. They have a weak spot, a single point of failure that would turn them from vengeful killing machine to dead meat if you manage to hit it-their wand. Once that's gone, the wizard or witch will soon follow.

So if you want to apply gun-kata ideas to this situation, you need someone who doesn't snap. You need someone that goes into a cold, analytical fury and plots out the best way to hit where it hurts in such a way that by the time they raise their wand, all the other people in the room are already dead by the numbers.

There are only a few that could do that-Auror!Ron could if he applies the skills he learned playing chess to fighting with a wand. Hermione Granger could as well if she so chose. Harry's used to basically screwing the odds, but he's a mostly reactionary fighter-he's uncanny at finding and going down the road that'll lead to an exact victory (socking Malfoy, ganking Voldie, Basilisk & Horcrux double kill), but he's had a lifetime of learning when & how to attack for maximum effect so even if he did want to do this, he would know not to give into temptation unless the situation absolutely warranted it. He would let them fire first, dodge and then lay the smackdown, but he won't do anything except maybe goad them to that point.

Malfoy and the other pureblood sympathisers could potentially get there, but their instructors would be death eaters. So they would get the skill, but at the cost of their sanity.

Luna, Neville & Ginny? Maybe.

But yeah, fics that manage to do this right? I don't know, they'd be pretty rare. So rare that I cannot really think of any except maybe linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool) where the character snaps in the last battle and basically proves just what being a Dark Lord's Equal really means when you piss them off.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
