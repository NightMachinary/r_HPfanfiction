Bonus Points if Hagrid is actually very op, and can defeat Dumbledore in battle, he just loves magical creatures too much to fight.


** linkffn(More Equal Than you Know) has an OP Hagrid in one sense as does linkffn(Hagrid's Fame).

Not what you're asking for, but I felt it was somewhat relevant.

  The Chamber of Secrets had been a mystery for as long as its legend was passed on from one generation to the other. When students started to be petrified, its horrible reputation was made much more real. But what if somebody managed to put the clues together?
