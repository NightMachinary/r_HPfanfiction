Does anyone happen to know of any decent stories where Voldemort has a sibling please?

Thanks!


** I don't think it's finished and doesn't get any updates anymore but if you don't care about that stuff then "The Darker Sister" is a good Fanfiction

  The past holds some dark secrets. Anyana Riddle is one of them. Sister to Lord Voldemort, she will stop at nothing to get what she wants. Blood running cold at the mere mention of her name. Family matters more than anything. Blood is thicker than water...

** Twist of fate by firephoenix8. Harry is Tom Riddle's brother. It's very well written but tragically abandoned. The end game was slash but the story was abandoned before it reached that point

  Harry is taken the night Dumbledore is about to leave him with the Dursleys. With forces meddling in the timeline, Harry and Tom become the Riddle brothers. Follow the boys from the 1930s, WWII & Grindelwald, to canon years and a much changed future. Slash.
