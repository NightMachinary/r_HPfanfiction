The next fic will be [[http://unknowableroom.org/39/1/][Prelude to Destiny]].

What did y'all think of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1536120/1/Secrets][Secrets]]?


** I really enjoyed Secrets, I thought it was well written and a good insight into Ginny's character in CoS. I thought the [[/spoiler][dream sequences for when she blacks out]] were great. When she started putting things together and realizing what was going on I just wanted to help her. I like that it ended with her [[/spoiler][having a bit of PTSD,]] that seemed very realistic.

Personal note: For some reason the name [[/spoiler][Apple]] really bothered me. It's just really hard for me to imagine that being a legitimate character name.

** Never before has the cut throat world of eleven year old school children been so intricately portrayed. The complexities of schoolyard politics were rather simplified in the early HP books: Harry was all good, Draco was all bad. Not so here: the author's cast of OCs are all complex and realistic. No one's completely in the right, least of all Ginny. The first year social structure is easily the highlight of the fic.

Oh, and Voldemort's in the book as well. He's not too bad, I suppose. He's just got nothing on any of the eleven year olds.

  CoS according to Ginny: Nobody noticed anything wrong for an entire year. How did she slip so far from her family and friends? Angst and betrayal, but also mysteries, jokes, an enchanted suit of armor, and a guaranteed happy ending. COMPLETE!

*** This is how the person who recommended it described it:

#+begin_quote
  Complicated story about how Lily Evans grew up during sixth year, grew away from most of her childhood friends (who are amazing Gryffindor OCs, some of whom decide to avoid the war) and emotionally prepared for war. Falls for James too but he does some crappy things along the way and she holds him accountable but eventually forgives him. Really, really great ride and Lily's three best friends are truly awesome OCs who I've never forgotten. Some great anti-Voldemort Slytherin OCs too.

*** I recced it for the book club! PtD was written before the 7th book, so Snape and lily weren't childhood friends, and the prose can get a little meta at times, but it's great writing covering the end of Lily's 5th year to 7th year and how friendships are made and break in times of stressors like war. The real strength of this fic is the characters, though there are some unique twists in the James/Lily romantic development because of (slightly contrived) situations.

It's very readable and the OCs are really great. The worldbuilding is nice too! It focuses on Lily's year mates and her eventual acceptance of peer leadership and political resistance. Lily doesn't spend her weekends training for the war against Voldemort but she becomes emotionally ready to take on Death Eaters while her friends all make their own decisions on how to handle what is happening to their world.

** I really, really wanted to kill Ginny pretty early on, I found it impossible to have any empathy with her character. I'm glad I've never been an eleven year old girl if that is an accurate portrayal of their interactions.
