Like in linkao3(The Problem of Potions) where Voldemort's an irredeemable, scary psychopath who's still trying to kill Harry and people but he's generally quite amiable about it, likeable even.

Humour is fine, but not so much that it veers into crack-fic territory. Gen fics preferred, do not want to read slash or romance. Or bashing.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
