Any good Neville Fanfics where he is a main character or plays more of a role. I've already read 'Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness.

However, I don't want to read a fanfic where Neville becomes the BWL.

Thanks!

  In response to marthapreston4's "From Boggarts to Family" challenge: "After Lupin's class where Neville's Boggart turns into Severus Snape everyone laughs it off as childish fear, everyone but Snape. He slowly realizes that there is more to Neville's fear than just a mean teacher. Neville is emotionally and physically abused at home by his grandmother and his uncle." No slash!

  The Firewhisky became a habit after that, though they would both insist that it was a friend, not a crutch. The kindly intermediary that moderated their visiting across the bar on busy nights, slow nights, work nights, weekends. It loosened their tongues. Post-Hogwarts, Epilogue-Compliant.
