Besides Parseltongue, I mean. If possible, I don't mean having Voldemort's /memories/ (let alone speaking to the Horcruxes), though I have a cursory interest in those too; what I mean is getting others of Voldemort's magical skills unconsciously, like he did Parseltongue. Such as unsupported flight, very good control of his accidental wandless magic, etc.


** What discrete powers /does/ Voldemort have other than Parseltongue? Unsupported flight was, in all evidence, a learned skill, since Snape could do it as well.

*** Snape learned it, yes, but Parseltongue is (in my view) an innate magical knowledge, such that it's conceivable that if that knowledge was transferred to Harry, other lore might have passed on to him as well. It's probably not at all Rowling's intention, but a clever fanfiction writer might even make an argument that Harry's skill on a broom is partially based on subconscious memories of Voldemort's very hands-on experience with flying.

****** I'll say so! We don't know how many things he did with it, but what he had, he had exceptional control over. He seemed to have it totally in check, so that he could reliable cast the same "spells" over and over, rather than just cause magic through his emotions: and what's more, the spells he could do seem to be /wandless Unforgivables/. "Control animals without training them", I have a feeling that's a rough Imperius. And "make the other childre /hurt/... if I want" sounds like a basic Cruciatus Curse. Also, he seemingly managed to Side-Along Apparate two of the other orphans with him into the cave, or if not that, then definitely used /some/ sort of magic to get into the cave.

** I wouldn't be surprised if Voldemort were resistant to the Unforgivable Curses, due to having a split soul. For certain the Killing Curse didn't function right against him. I doubt Imperius would be effective even normally, but as far as the Cruciatus, Voldemort only ever seemed to feel pain when Harry's emotions were affecting him.

** linkffn(11752324)

She gives him everything she knows, magical and otherwise. Although his using them is not particularly the focus. He does use her signature spell at least once though.

He does most of it not quite realizing where he learned it. Mostly though I agree with [[/u/turbincarpus]] in that voldemort doesn't really have any 'innate' powers and his abilities are all taught and learned skills.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** What about POSSESSION?! Because yes voldemort could do it even during OOTP when he had a body! So maybe it's like a TECHNIQUE like in dragon ball z? :) What if harry trained with it and then specialized in jumping in and out of people's bodies? He could like jump into a death eater and sneak into a meeting, or do something horrible like make them jump off a cliff. But he could also possess like Snape and then learn secret Dumbledore meeting stuff too! Or he like if a friend is far away and in danger he could possess them and then use his superior skills to get them away safely! :)

Yes Achille I think you could make an entire stealthy type spy story with that! :)

  "Clear your mind!" wasn't actually the best advice. Harry is fed up and takes things into his own hands and discovers a way to end the war on his own terms. No one was expecting this of the Gryffindor Golden Boy.

*** That's interesting, but I think Voldemort could only attempt to possess Harry in this way thanks to the Horcrux-based mind-link between them, and he couldn't have done it on anyone else. Mind, it is possible that there might be other Dark Magics to achieve such an effect, but this particular use of Possession in OOTP wasn't some general skill.

**** I took it as a specialization of Legilimency, or possibly a side-effect of having Horcruxes. Voldemort effectively possessed Quirrel toward the end of the first book; he also possessed Nagini in order to attack Arthur Weasley, and while he was body-less he would possess animals that would venture too close to his hideaway in Albania.

***** I'm leaning towards the latter. First off, these three examples of "possession" strike me as different things.

- With Harry and Nagini, he was exploiting the mind-links due to them being Horcruxes of his, and assuming control of their body. /This/ might be related to his knowledge of Legilimency, but he could presumably not do it on some random wizard.

- When he possessed small animals, he was a formless spirit, and was wholly taking over their body to survive. This isn't something an incarnate being could do, and has nothing to do with the above mind-link-based Possession.

- Possessing Quirrel was similar in theory, but very different in practice, from the above. In Albania, Voldemort only took over the animals' body, not make them sprout his face on the back of their heads and then order of them around. Remember, Quirrell's will wasn't at all suppressed.

****** I think the difference between his possession of small animals and Quirrel is that small animals have a correspondingly small life force that Voldemort essentially snuffed out. I don't know that Voldemort had a physical presence until after he started drinking the unicorn blood and growing stronger. I think of him as a parasite that started out merely as a presence within Quirrel, but gained corporeal form as he grew stronger.

I'd like to know what would have happened to him (and Quirrel) had he managed to make the Elixer of Life.

What I imagine is that first Quirrell would have drunk a bunch of it to counteract the curse of Unicorn's Blood; then he and Morty would set up a variation of the Fourth-Year ritual with an Elixir-based potion in the cauldron rather than the bone-blood-flesh one, in which Voldequirrell would have dived, and Quirrell and Voldemort emerged with separate, healthy, rejuvenated bodies.
