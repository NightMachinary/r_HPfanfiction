How do you plan out your stories? I'm curious as to the different methods people use, especially with stories that are completely AU


** Okay, so here's my creative process

1) Have an idea

2) Keep that idea in the back of your mind for around a month, continually tweaking and developing it.

3) When that idea is ready, start writing. You'll know when it's time.

4) Work on the first several chapters until you have a good grasp of the characters and how they act. With that in mind, try to figure out what direction your story is going and how it will end.

5) With that knowledge in mind, keep writing. Be prepared for unexpected twists, as some characters don't like to behave. Don't fight them --- just let them be themselves and adjust the story as needed.

It works for me, but I have ADHD, so...

** It usually starts with an idea, often from the middle of the story, and then I start constructing plot backwards and forwards so that it makes (in-world) logical sense. I.e., getting rid of all the "why didn't he just ..." moments you know as a reader. That's always a sign of bad planning. It's basically a puzzle where you create your own parts -- I have character X in situation Y, but he's currently in situation Z, now how can I get him from Z to Y while keeping in mind aspects A and B, which I need at a later time for character C etc.

Like that, the whole of the story is constructed, until every single scene is a bullet point or twenty. Half of it in my head, half in actual docs. In the process of doing this, I notice things that don't work out, things that I don't like after all, I get better ideas, I shift plot around etc.

And once all that's done, the story is finished, and the only thing I need to do is to write it. I pick the scene that appeals to me the most, and start writing it. That's one of the things I appreciate with this approach, because all pieces of the puzzle fit, I can write in whatever order. Usually, I jump around in the story like crazy.

â€‡

Keep in mind though that this is super-individualistic. Everyone has to figure out their own approach. I couldn't write a single word without a plan, because I wouldn't know /what/ to write. And for other people, it's exactly the reverse.

** I usually have a pretty good idea of where I want to end up and a few specific scenes that 'stick out' but often I find myself doing quite a lot of fluid re-writing to get it how I want it.

For my current AU fic in part one it pretty much happened in parallel to canon so I only alluded to book events on the edges of it. Part 2 is seeing a real change in how stuff went down so that is taking more thought.

** Once I've mulled the idea around in my head for a bit I write a coupla sentences for the first and last chapter, then fill in the blank in between, again just a couple of sentences per chapter, that process tends to find glaring plot holes but also helps me figure out where the chapter boundaries are.

If any chapter requires some research then I flesh out those chapters first, then flesh out the rest, then rewrite the whole lot because it's inevitably a pile of incoherent crap.

** It's been a while since I've /actually finished/ anything other than a one shot, which I usually bang out in one drunken sitting (no planning), but here is the ongoing process I have with the Witcher crossover longfic I've been playing around with for... oh... way too long.

There are some good organizational writing apps like [[https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview][Scrivener]]. Personally, my motto is "where it's free there's me," so I just have chapters in a Google Doc with a spreadsheet to link / rearrange / give descriptions to individual chapters.

- I start by writing some exciting scenes first, in any order in terms of "plot" or where you think they might end up (they won't end up all in the same place you expect, at first). This helps me because I'll be very inspired to write certain things some days and have no motivation on others. Writing "from the beginning" is actually pretty rare for many professional authors.

  - This also helps me get a feel for the characters. It takes me, on average, 3-5 full chapters worth of material before I feel like I actually know what's going on with the story. I treat these scenes as completely optional to the plot / story; they're just things I /like/ to write and think would be cool to see, but I'm totally okay with scrapping any and all of them if the story needs it.

- I ascribe to the advice of Jack Bickham from [[https://www.amazon.com/Scene-Structure-Elements-Fiction-Writing/dp/0898799066][Scene and Structure]] which gives an excellent blueprint on storytelling structure. I look at the overall story... what is this /about/? What's the main motifs, and how can I structure the story around that? For the most part, when I'm not writing, I'm /thinking/ about the story and what should be in it and where it needs to go to be satisfying. *Set up: Pay off* routine is crucial to a good story.

  - With my crossover, I like to take ideas from both universes. So, in the Witcher series, there's a lot of prejudice and racism driving the story, from the character level all the way up to the political level... guess what? Harry Potter has the same thing! So, it's fairly simple to make sure I've got these little moments where CONFLICT can happen early on in the story, to be referenced throughout, and addressed at the climax. You've also got the dynamics of magical power, body modification, sacrificing humanity, etc. All these little things I try to sprinkle in as much as possible.

So, I think about *Plot*, *Character*, and *Setting*, a lot, and try to make sure that every chapter is advancing one or more of those pillars, while also just being interesting. It's hard, if it was easy anyone could do it, but it takes a lot of writing and re-writing until things are coherent and in decent shape.

I no longer publish until I'm confident the story is in a nearly complete state. Too many times I've started a story and got to chapter 5-6 and been like... yeah... this isn't good or what I was aiming for.

** I usually have ideas at really inconvenient times- at 2 am when I'm in bed, at work, in class- I grab my phone and write it down. Then when I have time, put it in a word doc titled: /HP Prompts I'll Never Write,/ then spend the next hour brainstorming.

It will stay there and rattle around in my brain for the next month while I slowly expand an outline. I'll write key emotional moments (because those are easier), and then upload it.

The most valuable part (I've found) is figuring out how your character thinks. For example, in my TMR fic I've got pages that go:

- Tom's relationship with magic: /(insert pages of rambling)/
- Tom's relationship with Mrs. Cole
- Tom's relationship with physical touch
- Tom's relationship with money
- Tom's relationship with his idealized father

If I can't think like my characters I can't write them. I only do that for characters like TMR because we don't get a strong sense of his character in canon. With Harry, Ron, or Hermione- I know how they feel, and don't have to think much about it. But with Ginny? I'd need to write that shit down.

** Once I come up with an idea, I then start brainstorming some of the big plot points, themes, and character relationships so that I generally know what I want to do with the story.

Then I start writing.

I'm not one to do a huge outline or meticulously plan things out-- some of the most fun time I spend writing is when the characters start surprising me with ideas that I didn't plan when I sat down at my computer.

I'm sure some people might criticize my way of doing things, but it works for me.

** It depends what kind of story I'm writing. In general though, I tend to write character-driven stories so I have a loose idea of certain plot points I want the story to hit. I write down an outline a chapter or two in advance with the ending in mind.

As more characters become involved, I keep a separate doc of everyone's motivations and impending story points. I edit it as I move through the story and weave it into my outlines.

If there's a central mystery to the story, I write down the answer to it as a reference guide. I end up expanding this doc to include backstory, since there's usually a lot of overlap.

This method seems to work whether I'm writing something short or long (I definitely tend toward long). The longer the work, the more concentration is required to keep everything consistent.

I'm gearing up to start the final part of a series that's already running at ~775k words, and I find myself taking longer breaks between parts to refresh myself on the past material and prepare for the next leg of the road. Especially now that I'm writing the end, I want to make sure I give the readers closure on everything as well as stick the landing.

** Write the summary in three word lines. Don't bother with grammar. It should be around thirty words total, but anything between 21 and 60 is fine. This is an OUTLINE.

--------------

Example:

Bob lives orphanage Bob run away Bob meet Timmy Bob not trust Bob Timmy argue antogonist Ben appear Ben fight Bob Timmy help Bob Timmy and Bob Bob like Timmy They win fight

--------------

Now, read through a few times, and make any little changes.

--------------

Bob lives orphanage Ben threaten Bon Bob run away Bob meet Timmy Bob is wary Timmy is angsty Bob cry, haha antogonist Ben re-appear Ben fight Bob Timmy help Bob Timmy and Bob Bob like Timmy They win fight

--------------

Start writing little bits of the story, not necessarily in detail, just as it comes. If you feel like you won't use a part, save it to the end of your Google doc, or whatever anyway. Also, writing basic personality traits out for characters, ie. sarcastic, girly, immature helps. After you got all that, you might wanna write a blurb that's less than a page long just to see if it all makes sense. If yes, continue writing your story. If not, go back to your three word thing.

Also, use Harry Potter stuff for this. Y'know...

Harry lives orphanage Tibby (OC) threaten Harry Harry run away Harry meet Ron Harry is wary Ron is angsty Harry cry, haha antogonist Tibby re-appear Tibby fight Harry Ron help Harry Ron and Harry Harry like Ron They win fight it

--------------

I kind of just used Ben-Timmy-Bob as a general formula. Also no, i don't mean use this is your plot. This is an EXAMPLE. I mean, you could use this as a ploy bunny or whatever, but i don't suggest it. So yeah. Hope that helped.

Since I tend to get side-tracked while writing, I creat chapter by chapter bullet point outlines for each chapter so I don't veer off course in my writing.

** 1. Has idea
2. Keep idea in head and tweak it for weeks/months on end
3. Write idea down
4. Come up with various pivotal scenes and major plot points, tweak over time
5. Write out first chapter or two, then get stuck
6. Tweak in head some more, more major points
7. Make a spreadsheet to plan the chapters, else it will never get done
8. Procrastinate even more

I am currently at step 8.

** I have terrible problems with it. I just usually have no clue about the whole plot and outline, I just start telling it, and I hope for the best. At least, I first write whole thing, rewrite it, and modify it until I am happy with it, and only then I publish it. I still hold that serial writing is the root of all evil.

** I write the bits which are living in my head in my notebook. Most of these will not make it into the story, but it anchors /what I found exciting/ about the idea in the first place.

Then I write from the beginning. I've found recently that starting a new document for each scene is really helpful, because it's easier to scroll up and down in it. I also tend to insert more scenes earlier on after I've written awhile, but I find that if I write out of order for the "actual draft", I end up explaining the backstory over and over, because I don't want to forget to put it in.
