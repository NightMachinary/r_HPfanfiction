I saw they reached their [[https://www.patreon.com/brainthief][patreon]] goal. Was the story abandoned? :(


** To be honest, I liked the story, but I don't agree with accepting any form of money for something based off of someone else's work. The author of HPMOR, I heard, also tried to make or raise money from that fanfiction.

It's not only a legality issue, but it also goes against what J.K. Rowling wants for Harry Potter fan fiction. I would rather that one or a few people /not/ ruin being able to write Harry Potter fanfiction (without Rowling turning into Anne Rice) for the rest of us, just to make a quick buck.

It would be a different story if the author donated the money to Lumos, but it's for personal gain.

I just view it as unfair, scummy, breaking Rowling's guidelines, and robbing Rowling of her fair cut, especially considering writers are using her characters and universe.

******* Parody is generally protected, isn't it (/Scary Movie/ 1-13,202)? What's not protected is using the characters and situations created by someone else and then trying to turn a profit based on it.

I can write as many /Rendezvous with Rama/ fan fictions as I want with the /Endeavor/ crew, the ship, and /Rama/ itself. Maybe I can write about Commander Norton and how he juggles having two different wives living on different planets.

What I can't do is profit from that for the simple reason that it's not mine and I don't have the publishing rights to it.

******** I'm not talking legal precedent. I'm not a lawyer, I don't pretend to be a lawyer. What shocks me is that people in this thread seem to be against the idea itself, not the legality of it. Books are old but fanfiction is new, before the internet communities couldn't evolve around fandom like this. We should all want our favorite authors to be able to make money from writing fanfiction the same way our favorite youtubers/streamers can make money from games.

********* Fanfiction is actually older than internet. Your examples are wrong because youtubers put out original content and a good analogy for ff in the gaming world would be mod creation. You take someone else's world, someone else's creation, and you modify it. You didn't put in the work to come up with the original idea, you didn't built the foundation upon which you are basing your shallow creation. You didn't code the game itself, so to speak.

Now, fanfiction is a work of love. You're taking someone else's child --instead of raising your own-- and you're giving it new clothes. The parent, the one who actually did all the work, the one who had the idea, who nourished it, who made it grow into that which attracted you in the first place, /tolerate/ it, like JKR does.

Ultimately, no matter how good a ff author is, they are still a reposter, to use a language you would understand. Idea theft is a thing. And so is plagiarism. And so are things like intellectual propriety. And for good reason, I say.

And to end this, even though it might sound a little mean, if they are good enough to make a living out of writing, they /are/ writing original content and making a living out of it.

**** Thanks for your reply, [[/u/capitolprostitute]]! I personally believe that publishing and selling hard copies of a fanfiction on a larger scale is acceptable, as long as the original work's author (or his/her representatives) is okay with it, and no profit is made. Or, if profit is made, then the O.W. author will have paid for licensing fees; part of the profits (royalties) go to the O.W. author; or the entirety of the profits are donated to the O.W. author's choice of charity. I believe it is also acceptable if people commission, or pay an artist money to create on a one-time basis, a hard-print copy of their favorite fanfiction or fan art, for the commissioner's own private use.

  The sexually explicit content of the fan fiction available at [[http://www.restrictedsection.org][www.restrictedsection.org]], which is plainly based on characters and other elements of the fictional world created by Ms. Rowling in the Harry Potter books, is a matter of serious concern to our client. In addition, our client Warner Bros, which owns the film and merchandising rights to the children's series of Harry Potter books, is concerned to protect the integrity of its Harry Potter properties. For the avoidance of doubt, our clients make no complaint about innocent fan fiction written by genuine Harry Potter fans

...I don't think its integrity is in any danger from a site that specifically required you to confirm your age as 18 or older before reading. You know, like every other porn site out there?

****** Not just impossible; it outright /is/ impossible. There is already a wealthy of MA-rated Harry Potter fanfiction on the internet, both crack and otherwise. People are going to write and publish them, whether or not Rowling likes it or not, unfortunately. Rule 34 applies: "If it exists, there /is/ porn of it - no exceptions."

I think Rowling, like Warner Bros., is mostly concerned about children under the age of 18 unwittingly stumbling across Harry Potter-related MA fanfiction on the world wide web, and then facing a lawsuit filed by angry parents. To Rowling, it seems to be a pre-emptive condition, given to try and protect herself from such liability.

However, again, many children, especially preteens and teens, often times seek out MA works anyways, even if purely out of curiosity. There's also a "reverse psychology" effect involved, or, by telling someone /not/ to do something, it makes them more likely to want to do it anyways.

*** A little late, but I couldn't agree more. Not just out of moral reasons (though there is that), but mainly out of worry for fanfiction.

Even one or two of cases like this could /easily/ kill a new fandom, by provoking the author to pull an Anne Rice. In something as large as the HP fandom, JK would probably take it on a more individual case, but you never know. She could hear about a couple cases and just say, fuck it, I'm done with this shit.
