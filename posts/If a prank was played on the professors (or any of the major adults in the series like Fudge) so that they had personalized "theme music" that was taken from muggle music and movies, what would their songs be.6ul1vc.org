#+TITLE: If a prank was played on the professors (or any of the major adults in the series like Fudge) so that they had personalized "theme music" that was taken from muggle music and movies, what would their songs be?

This was something we were discussing in the Discord/IRC chat and I wanted to see what you all could think up.

Examples: [[https://youtu.be/CbIhYhrOJAg]["It's a Small World"]] played for Flitwick, the [[https://youtu.be/ZvCI-gNK_y4][theme to "Jaws"]] played for Snape, or [[https://youtu.be/35WgpMq6e3o][You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch]] plays for Filch.

Please link to the song and keep them time period accurate, meaning nothing after the mid 90s.

** There was a similar scene in a Worm fanfic's omake. As a prank whenever someone entered the meeting room their theme music would start to play. If my memory serves me right it was 'Trolling the Multiverse'.

*** I was watching an older parody movie and the guy was walking around with a small band behind him, playing his theme song. It sounded like a good prank for the twins to use.
