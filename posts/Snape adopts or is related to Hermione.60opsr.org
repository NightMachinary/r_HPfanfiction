  An unexpected connection is found between Hermione and Professor Snape, but that's only the start of her headaches. Being her father's daughter is one thing. Being her mother's daughter is something else entirely.

** linkao3(Surprise, Bitches!) Not complete and sadly quite short. Not sure what's up with the title or the summary, but right now it's a short story about Hermione being adopted by Snape at a young age and their somewhat dysfunctional relationship with each other. It is kind of sweet at one point so there is that.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione's parents were killed by Death Eaters just before the fall of Voldemort and she was adopted by Severus Snape as part of his reparations to the post-war Wizarding World. Hermione grows up with a distant father, a library full of Dark magic, and the knowledge that Voldemort has taken away her one chance for a happy, loving family. With a father who is the Head of Slytherin House, a Muggle-born being sorted into it isn't all that surprising - even if nobody knows she is one.However, her plans to steal the next generation of Voldemort's supporters, usurp him, and take his throne as the Darkest Lady of the century, might be a little surprising. But only a little.The fact that Dumbledore doesn't bother to stop her is possibly the most surprising of all.
