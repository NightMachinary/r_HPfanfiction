Im a big fan of the unconventional pairings, and recently i found a fic where daphne tought harry occlumency, and i wondered, is there a fic where daphne (or another female) is teaching harry occlumency, but discovers his childhood/lack of knowledge of lordships etc and helps him fix things?

Additionally any fic where occlumency is developed in-depth ( like core threads) would be awesome too, as long as it isn't snape. (Mindscapes ftw)


** That sounds like every daphne fic.

*** This is the third such thread I've seen today. As a general rule, I avoid all Harry/Daphne these days
