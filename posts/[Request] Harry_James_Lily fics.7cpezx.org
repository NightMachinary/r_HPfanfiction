I'm looking for some fanfics about Harry going back in time to the marauder era and meeting his parents. Or his parents go to the future. Or they're actually alive. Anything with some good Harry/James/Lily angst/humor. Preferably with Harry/Ginny in it even if it's only in the sidelines. Or with the trio having some part in the story. No slash please. Thank you!


** I thought you were asking for a threesome going by the title.

*** So is that his parents, his kids, or a mix and match kind of situation?

** I know a fanfic where Harry goes back and steals Lily from James and fucks her in the guys dorm room and the marauders peeps in on them. It also has a Harry/Lily/Alice threesome in one chapter.

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.
