Owing to the Horcrux, Harry experiences a strong connection to both his and Voldemort's soul mate - he's damned if he knows which is his, mind.

There are so many directions this could go in. Fluff? Crack? Angst? Drama? Go nuts!


** So... Harry's most common soulbond/soulmate is either Ginny, Draco or Hermione. Pretty standard. But /Tom's/ most common soulmate is Harry...

Snape: You are /just/ like your father! He too was exceedingly arrogant and self-absorbed!

Harry: Well he certainly had the right idea, we're both amazing.

**** That's... eleven of my NoTPs at once. I'd be impressed if I didn't find it exceedingly cringe. Eh... someone else might like it.

***** Sorry about that!

Also, just to assure you I didn't mean it as a smut-setup. More from the thought that if the bond made it so that people felt they had to improve the lives/existences of the bonded, then it might be really interesting, to watch Harry trying to shift Bella's whackjob obsessions ti something productive, or Hermione trying to explain a better way of doing things to Voldy. Maybe Bella finds herself trying to give Harry a better life than he'd have had with the Dursleys (by threatning to kill anyone who harms him) or Voldy influenced to try and teach Hermione knowledge he thinks might improve her life. Could be crack, or not.

I'm actually not a pairings fan.

Anyways, again, sorry for the cringe! I'll leave it alone, now.

** Just like Harry's love for his friends burns Tom's mind like fire, Tom's attraction to Bellatrix makes Harry cry out for brain bleach.
