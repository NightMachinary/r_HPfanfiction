[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4973167/1/The-Curse-That-Killed-Thousands][The Curse That Killed Thousands?]]: What would have happened if Sirius's appearance in the hospital wing was not received as relatively calmly as in canon?

** Not /quite/ what you asked for, but anyway:

Harry hides from the Wizarding World, in the middle of the Wizarding World. Abandoned, 260k+ words. Well written story, but the plot seems to go weird in the last few chapters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations][Realizations]]

The Wizarding World turns /worse/ after Voldemort's death. Harry leaves, rescues as many friends as he can, and takes revenge on the Wizarding World.

** I think Harry Potter Mercenary kind of fits the bill (but correct me anyone if I'm wrong).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4544334/1/Harry-Potter-Mercenary]]

Harry is wrongfully sent to Azkaban so when he gets out, he wants nothing to do with his traitorous friends, although they try to force his hand.

He doesn't give up on magic though.

I read it a while ago so I'm fuzzy on the details, but I enjoyd the story a lot

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3918135/1/The-Sniper][The Sniper]] is also a good one.

Both /The Sniper/ and /Mercenary/ have sequels.

** It's a bit more lighthearted than most of the stories in this thread, but I'd suggest nonjon's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7395979/1/Whatever-Happened-to-the-Likely-Lad][Whatever Happened to the Likely Lad]], 20k words, complete: Hermione Granger has to locate Harry Potter or she'll lose her job. She's more than a little curious what he's been up to the last few years. Perhaps, she'd be better off figuring out where he's going rather than where he's been.

** It's rare that a story written way back before the series even finished would still feel relevant- this is one of those.
