I'm pretty bored with seeing this idea popping up in fics. Particularly when its used to dis the Wizarding World e.g. giving a wand to an 11 year old is equal to giving them a gun.

How else are they going to learn magic? Also, guns dont have a stun setting. So, if anything, there like the phasers in star trek.


** Not a gun, the tool to alter the fabric of the universe by sheer will and correct wand movement. Wands are infinitely more dangerous than guns.

Yes, they eventually have to start using wands to control magic. However, for the sheer variety of destruction, mayhem and carnage possible with even the simplest charms, safety measures are extremely lax at Hogwarts.

I mean, for some reason its required for an OWL to be able to cast a spell that rips the upper body off a person. Reducto.

  "With this powerful curse, skilled wizards can easily reduce obstacles to pieces. For obvious reasons great care must be exercised when learning and practising this spell, lest you find yourself sweeping up in detention for it is all too easy to bring your classroom ceiling crashing down, or to reduce your teacher's desk to a fine mist."

I feel like magic is subject to the Manton effect, though.

**** Wrong universe but the idea has merit. I've seen it used in fics before where reducto works on inanimate but animate objects aren't affected, a different spell must be used to damage a person.

**** It is a nice explanation of why magic isn't more looked over in Hogwarts, but it is still fanon.

But then again, you need a lot of fanon to make sense of canon, so there is that.

**** In some cases, yeah definitely. It would be an easy explanation as to why nobody even tried 'accio horcruxes' after all-the magical version of the Manton Effect could/would have prevented it. On the other hand, It may be that overpowering a spell can jailbreak a spell, though that would require some pretty hefty experimentation...

Also probably why the Unforgiveables are the only three spells that carry a life sentence when cast-they either have to Manton limit whatsoever or they do, but only on a macro level (as in, casting the Killing Curse at the ground does not kill the planet and Imperiusing a blade of grass does not allow you to mind-control the entire field's worth of grass) that completely ignores a human, for instance.

*** The amount of idiot kids looking for spells way outside their capabilities and accidentally blowing up themselves, a room or a bully is not shown as much as it should be. I always imagine Malfoy as bullying everyone not in Gryffindor not just Harry and Co. so the fact that it took until their sixth year for someone to almost accidentally kill him astounds me.

** Wands equal multitools.

But in america, in soft canon, you need a permit for one, so the analogy is apt.

And what else is a phaser but a sidearm? Just because it can stun doesn't mean it's not a weapon.

** It's like saying that we should remove everyone's hands because people could get strangled to death otherwise.

Yes, wands can be used for killing but they can also be used for a lot of other things, both good and bad. Guns were literally created to kill, wands were created to channel magic.

*** The difference is that it's far easier to kill someone with a wand then with hands. I'm not saying wands shouldn't be given early but with how much training you're supposed to give in Gun Safety, I feel like wizards are a bit remiss in how they handle wand safety.

A good parallel imo is how the Boy Scouts handle knives or fire. Because it's systematically expected that all scouts learn how to use knives and fire, there's a strict safety code and scouts must demonstrate they can abide by this code (under supervision) before they're allowed to use those tools unsupervised.

** It's ridiculous, because wands have a use other than killing. They're a tool, as well as a weapon.

If anything, the comparison would be that wands equal /knives/. Even that is wonky, but at least they're both tools and both can be used for something other than violence.

I don't know about you guys, but like every other young boy growing up in the eighties and early nineties, I was given a pocket knife by the time I was six or seven years old. My parents thought it would teach me responsibility, and taught me to respect the usefulness and danger that it represented.

I think it's perfectly appropriate to give a wand out at eleven, if anything it's later than I'd prefer.

*** Eleven is too early in my mind. If an eleven year old, when killing someone, is not going to tet a life sentence because their brain is considered undeveloped then giving them an incredibly powerful tool is a terrible idea. Wait until they're legally liable for the da,ages they can cause

**** Their laws in HP are not the same as ours. Who says they wouldn't be legally liable for it? Just because Harry gets favouritism? They mention that he's lucky not be sent to Azkaban for nearly killing Draco in their sixth year. Which only didn't happen because it was never reported - the entire staff hid that it ever happened.

**** It's a difference of opinion, and probably in how we were raised as well. I was given a collection of knives at seven, and was taught to shoot by ten years old. I inherited my fathers gun collection at 14 (though they were kept in a gun safe in our house of course) after he passed away, and was often taken/went to the shooting range as a teenager.

You don't need to be an adult to be taught responsibility.

** The wand=gun analogy completely forgets at least 2 important points : the culture and the use.\\
On a cultural standpoint, we have a society based on the capacity to use magic; in HP magical society, the wand is, primarily, the mark of a citizen: it proves that one has the mean and will to be a part of the society. A parallel can be done with the citizenship status in Starship troopers (with the distinction that this status is obtained through choice more than through birth as in the HP universe), where while the civilian is afforded a measure of freedom and protection, the citizen has the power. Your wand is a mark of status and your status gives you the inalienable right to the wand: the best proof in my mind, is that the expulsion from the magical world, as seen during HP trial, is done through the breaking of ones wand.\\
On the use aspect: not that long ago, in most western societies, and still today in many societies, your knife never left you; you used it to eat, to work, to craft a wooden toy, and, when you had to, as a weapon. But your knife primary usage was not as a weapon.

The authors who use the analogy wand=gun frequently tend to orient their fanfiction characters into a dominant/dominated direction: the character (indy harry) who makes the analogy is there to help <Hermione/any other of his harem member> that they should not be afraid, that they should keep their head high, stop cowering and kill the fu**** DE (and comes into his bed 2 at a time). Well, this is maybe a little extreme, but fundamentally, the analogy is one of the elements used to build a world fundamentally different from canon, where violence is far less prevalent than in fanfiction, where the society has far more common points with modern England than with Victorian society (well, maybe 1920s Germany, but you get my point).

** Imagine if your mobile phone was attached to your car keys and had a gun strapped to it.

One of the more important properties of guns that determine how society treats them is that they are exclusively for causing harm.

Knives are a deadly weapon, yet every house has at least half a dozen sharp ones. Baseball bats are common, as are (in some places) hatchets, saws, chisels, and hammers. Bleach, ammonia, sulphuric and hydrochloric acids, /fuel and alcohol/ -- all of these things are common in normal Muggle settlements, and though they /could/ be used to kill someone, they're useful or convenient enough that it's not worth trying to regulate them.

Murder is disturbingly accessible, but that's just how our society operates. It feels odd when you look at it, but the system /works/. The kinds of things that are regulated -- dedicated weapons and dangerous tools -- are because they either have an exceptional potential for damage (explosives, firearms), or are dangerous to the user (heavy machinery, restricted chemicals).

Wands are neither of those things.

Yes, just like ordinary household tools, with time and effort they can be turned to the purposes of damage and killing. But with the ordinary wizard's repertoire, there's no more potential for immediate, widespread damage than a whipper snipper (line / lawn trimmer).

More relevant to children is the very small danger to the user. In all seven books we never see a wizard or witch accidentally strike themselves with a dangerous charm. Additionally, the capacity for danger is limited by the /knowledge/ of the user, so the dangers grow along with the user's ability to manage them. Medical capabilities in the magical world also allow for much quicker, more complete recoveries from any injury, and wizard and witches are at least a little bit inherently sturdier than muggles (Quidditch is not a death sport) so children who do end up injured are easily healed.

** There are several arguments that revolve around guns vs. wands, though few acknowledge a crucial difference in their intended tasks: a wand is a tool. An incredibly dangerous tool, oh yes, but a tool nonetheless. A gun is a weapon. Indeed, it is the primary classification of any weapon that uses a chemical reaction to propel a purely ballistic projectile from its barrel to the target-pistols, rifles, artillery, sniper weapons, fully automatic squad support weapons, the main armament mounted on a tank and multi-barrel ultra-fast vulcan style weapons loosely fall under the classification of a gun.

Thing is, when you hand a wand to an eleven-year-old, you are in a sense taking the same risks as if you were handing them a gun-to wit, you are giving them something that, if abused, can kill themselves and others very easily. This is somewhat canon mind, given Malfoy's use of serpensortia when it became clear he didn't really understand what summoning a venomous, pissed off snake into a room full of teenagers could entail and, four years later, Harry's use of 'sectumsempra' on Malfoy without a true understanding of what the curse actually does. So, annoying or not, the argument is sound since doing such a thing /is/ dangerous, sometimes incredibly so as in the case of Riddle, and without a structured learning environment like the one found in Hogwarts, the results would undoubtedly be even uglier than they turned out to be.

The thing to remember when seeing that argument though is simple-a wand's primary purpose is to channel magic. A gun's primary purpose is to ignite a chemical propellant and direct the projectile sitting on top of said propellant down range as quickly, accurately, cleanly and efficiently as possible. Giving either to someone who has never used one before is to take a risk that they'll abuse it. That risk, that danger, never goes away.

In a gun, though, the risk stays constant. Accidental discharges, intentional use of other people as targets etcetera etcetera is a thing. Even people who have handled weapons responsibly for decades can very easily get in a situation that sees either themselves or others dead by accident. Training can help mitigate but never nullify the risk inherent to handling a gun. Only the gun's user is capable of doing that and not always successfully either.

With a wand, however, the risks increase as training increases. Miscasting magic can have dire consequences at beginner's levels. As the complexity of the magics being cast goes up, so do the risks of things going very badly wrong and so does the number of ways in which things end up doing just that. Combine that with the unfortunate reality that a fully trained wizard is on a completely different level to an untrained one when it comes to sheer lethality and you get a situation where the malicious use of magic scales up in expected lethality very, very quickly. An untrained wizard, after all, doesn't have a hope in hell of summoning and controlling fiendfyre. A trained one, on the other hand, could very easily turn that one spell into a city killer. So if a bunch of gun users go off the rails whilst having access to high-powered guns, you get mass shootings such as columbine, Virginia Tech and so on and so forth. If a bunch of wand users snap and decide that murder sounds like a fun way to spend an afternoon, you can very easily end up with a smoking crater where a major city containing millions of inhabitants had been living a scant few hours beforehand.

So there are similarities between the two, enough of such to vouch that the argument, as tired as it may be, is still viable enough to use.

However, as time goes by, the threat of what a pissed off guy with a wand can do rapidly dwarfs what a pissed off guy with a gun can do. This is something that's rarely touched upon, mind.
