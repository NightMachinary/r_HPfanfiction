I don't mean big things that can ruin a fic completely, like Lord Potter-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-...,friendly goblins or 11 year olds being adept politicians. I mean the small stuff that kind of throws you out of a story, stuff that you can stomach but really wish wasn't there.

For me it's:

Literally everyone being gorgeous.

Relationships that are completely without disagreement, even if it's over something little and then fairly easily resolved.

Big, eloquent emotional speeches, especially when they seem to come out of the blue. I get it when there's an actual moment for it, but when there isn't it really throws me. Maybe it's just me but I have never once heard anyone speak like that.


** When you have 10 characters in your fic and everyone's reaction to every little thing has to be presented.

#+begin_quote
  Harry lifted his bangs to show his scar. Daphne gasped. Draco shifted uncomfortably. Ron snickered. Hermione rolled her eyes. Ginny stared wistfully...
#+end_quote

Decide what the story's about and write that. No need to include the whole year and their cousins.

Also, when the descriptions are bland and inane. I don't care that everyone knows what the castle looks like, paint a picture and set the scene.

*** I personally ‘describe' food when it's important. My OC is French and from a rich family, he spent a whole year in the UK to better his English before going to Hogwarts. When he goes back home in France, I describe his first meal because it's kind of ‘emotionally' important, it feels like home, he missed this and this in Britain, yadi yada. You get the gist. I also described food once to really show the family's opulence during a feast. Other than that, it's pretty much just casual mentions to remember the readers that the characters are eating like sipping apple juice or putting some lamb on his plate because it's Samhain and lamb is a traditional meal. I feel that occasionally mentioning someone finished their mouthful before talking is essential, otherwise the discussion seems a bit to fast considering what they are doing is essentially stuffing their mouths to feed themselves. The conversation's flow shouldn't realistically be able to be the same as if they weren't eating. But I don't describe everyone's meal, nor have I ever read a story like that, maybe I'm just lucky.

And that's not going into pants/trousers, boot/trunk, and other cases where the word is completely different in British English.

Not the really horrible sort, but the more subtle --- forgetting commas, quotation marks, putting an apostrophe where an apostrophe doesn't belong (e.g. Dursley's instead of Dursleys'), USING "OF" INSTEAD OF "HAVE" (I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS, WHY CAN'T YOU JUST USE THE RIGHT FUCKING WORD, GODDAMNIT), accidentally misspelling certain words because the author can't be bothered to proofread their work, etc. It just feels as if I'm walking in a swamp, as opposed to a grammatically correct fic, where I'm flying through the sky.

I consider this the really horrible sort of bad grammar.

They're my favorite characters so seeing them written badly like that just sort of ruins the story for me.

2. Mugglewank. Technology able to overcome or circumvent magic, Muggle science being relevant to the use or understanding of magic, wizarding society criticised for its practices in a way which does not account for the existence of magic.

3. Super Hermione. Any depiction of Hermione with a level of magical competence higher than "Snape tier".

4. Weak Harry. That is, a Harry who is weaker than his canon self. That includes his magical ability, his intelligence, and (most relevant to fanfic) his level of emotional resilience. If Harry has a panic attack, I'm quitting the fic.

5. Pairing Harry romantically with someone I would consider unattractive. Includes Harry slash, but also includes stuff like Harry/Bellatrix.

**** Speaking as someone with an anxiety disorder, I can say that yes, it's a pretty annoying weakness that I would prefer not to have. I don't think anyone who struggles with anxiety /values/ that characteristic.

Conversely, Harry's canonical ability to keep a cool head in dangerous situations, and to go through traumatic experiences without any impact on his mental health, is definitely a strength. To take those characteristics away from Harry in a fanfic - to remove one of his strengths - is to make him weaker, pretty much by definition.

While I agree that Harry's ability to push forward in difficult times is one of his strengths, I think the fact that his myriad traumatic experiences had no impact on his mental health is more due to a lack of realism in a children's fantasy series than it is an inherent strength. I actually like reading fics that explore his trauma and show him dealing with it, as long as he had a response that seems in character, and he doesn't suddenly start falling apart constantly or crying all over everyone.

The thing is, a response to trauma isn't a mental illness on its own. If Harry had a panic response to some major event, it wouldn't necessarily mean he had a panic disorder. That being said, would you say that the large percentage of army veterans who have PTSD is down to a predisposition to mental health issues in all those people? Or does it seem more likely that Post-Traumatic Stress is a common mental and physiological response to trauma?

I'm no expert, but there's plenty of evidence of people in previous centuries having mental illnesses, they just didn't have names for them at the time. Sure, people seem to have been more durable (for lack of a better word) in those times, but the pervasiveness of mental illness today has a lot to do with the fact that mental illness is actually acknowledged. I'm not discounting the fact that we live far easier lives today, but I'm just trying to make a point that it's not black and white.

Twin speak: I liked it in the beginning, but it has gotten so old. Once or twice in the story is fine, but not every time they talk.

Same with the Gred and Forge, it was mentioned once or twice in the series, I don't need it mentioned a ton in stories.

Someone saying be serious to Sirius, and Sirius saying "But I am Sirius!" Again like the twin speak it was funny at first, but after a while it just got old.

I feel like if authors haven't bothered to get the tone right for a British setting, then they either don't know the source material very well, or they don't care very much for the source material.
