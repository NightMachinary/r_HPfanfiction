The Founders first major conflict unfortunately turned out to be their last.

They'd gathered the greatest minds and most skilled artisans of their fields of magic frim across the land in their quest to provide a place to safely and efficiently teach the magical youth of their nation.

However, they were at odds with who they would deign to teach within the walls of Hogwarts castle. The quartet entirely unable to come to a consensus.

Thus, Helga Hufflepuff stormed out with a furious defiant roar. Believing that all should have access to education and deciding if the others did not share this mentality then she would create HER school elsewhere.

And she took a swathe of the staff and resources along with her.

Decades later, when Hogwarts was better established a competing school popped up on the western most shores of Wales, a familiar woman its headmistress.

Having their own issues with the others methods AND seeing the success of their former associates endeavours, Rowena and Godric followed suit, taking what was theirs and leaving Hogwarts, Salazar and each other behind.

Fast forward to the twentieth century. The UK and Ireland are host to a quartet of equally prestigious and world reknowned magical schools.

▪︎ The Hufflepuff Academy in Wales, a welcoming school known for its support of its students and alumni in intergrating into society AND their professions.

▪︎ The Ravenclaw Institute of Magical Learning, an establishment in Ireland markedly similar to Muggle grammar schools. Known for its incredibly high grades and the production of world reknowned academics.

▪︎ The Gryffindor School of Excellence, though the magical world had no concept of such, it was stylised after a military academy. Strict schedules, gruelling practice and exercise with a 'follow orders or be punished' atmosphere that produced many a fine Auror and HitWizard.

And finally,

▪︎Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The brain child of all four Founders that found its ideals and practices set in stone by the Founder who inherited the castle. An establishment that encouraged both cunning and ambition in all walks of life, as well as it's complete lack of muggle-born students. Many a politician and businessman hail from Hogwarts.

Their reputations and ideals remain fairly consistent to their Founders ancient desires for their schools. And the four compete over absoloutely everything.

Especially prospective students...


** If it's a free-for-all for students, and no neutral arbiter deciding who goes where, there's going to be an awful lot of students made miserable by being putput in the "wrong" school. Also, canon Hogwarts at least has contact and friendship between people of different houses. Which isn't going to happen here, there's just poisonous rivalry. Seven years of this may produced some quiet messed-up individuals.

So as an idea for a magical educational system, I think it's mad. But as a starting point for interesting stories, I think it's *utterly awesome*.

*** My initial idea is that 'firsties' take the entire year to be Sorted. It is mandatory that they get some kind of tour of all four schools before having to decide at the end which one suits them best. The Sorting Hat's decision being more of a guideline on where it believes they should go.

E.g: the Weasley children were all recommended to go to the Gryffindor School but Percy was sent to the Ravenclaw Institute. And/or Harry IS sorted into Slytherin and advised to attend Hogwarts, but decides to go Gryffindor.*

But yes, it IS insane, all the House rivalries cranked up to eleven. Pure and glorious CHAOS!

*Can imagine this is a huge scandal, not only that the Boy Who Lived was a Slytherin at heart, but Hogwarts staff and students feeling snubbed when he decides not to go there. Making Harry somewhat unpopular on both sides.

Yes, there are going to be students who make a decision that maybe wasn't the best for them in retrospect. But there are also students who end up in certain Hogwarts Houses when another one could have shaped them differently.

Her husband, a Ravenclaw himself, shot her a smug look before descending on their daughter with just as much enthusiasm. Smothering her in proud kisses and laughter.

3 years later she dropped out and completed her education at the Hufflepuff Academy. Just like her mother had had to do. That excited grin snuffed out on both of her beloved's faces after three years of hellish deadlines, massive overwork and truly TRULY cruel and indifferent staff and children.

In an equally cruel way, 'Mummy' was satisfied. Because at least NOW her husband would understand why she didn't want anymore of her babies setting foot in that hellish school.

And can you imagine how they would have treated poor Ginny (in a world with heightened house rivalries) after a Chamber of Secrets like incident?

I can imagine a story where Harry feels alienated after a year of being treated as a messiah/savior and then one where he was bullied and belittled by people thinking him the Heir of Slytherin.

So he does the audacious, unthinkable act of transferring schools from Gryffindor School to one of the others, leading into a story where Harry gets to experience the best and worst of the different academies way of life and doing things.

** One thing that canon Hogwarts lacked was good competition. The nearest magic school is Beauxbatons, which is in a different country with a different main spoken language. Any British wizard pretty much *has* to go to Hogwarts. Thus, Hogwarts has no challenges to its curriculum.

But if there were four big schools, they have to fight over students and therefore have to constantly improve themselves, or try to innovate themselves. This happens for a thousand years. This means, that on average, the entire British Wizarding world is far more educated in different things. Everyone's a lot more specialised.

It's entirely possible that, over the years, Godric's school's purpose could have been perverted. As the HP world goes through wars(and remember, this school was created around 1000 years ago. Plenty of war to be found.) the regime was shifted from bravery to obedience. Quite similar to how war itself has changed through the years. Wars were thought of as grand adventures, once. It was only modern wars, predominantly the world wars, that the ‘war is hell' mentality came into being. So perhaps Godric's School wasn't a modern military school, at first. Possibly something more akin to a fantastical adventuring academy, where heroes are molded out of children.

Then all Children would attend their own school for the year. They compete with each other in all manner of sport and academics (Arithmancy Bowl, Quidditch obviously, Broom Racing, Gobstones, Dueling, Transfiguration Challenges etc).

Voldemort's obsession with Hogwarts could then be built around the fact its position in England both binds and places Hogwarts before and above even the splintered schools.

**** Hogwarts could host the 1st years only maybe and the department of education where all first years are assessed, given rankings in various classes/skill sets and then they are approached by the schools at the end of the year. Given tests etc. It also is the only place examinations may be taken, inter school sports games take place, and perhaps acts as a university for graduates?

Dumbledore would be head of department of education (aka first years + university) and check in regularly with each school later. He'd develop a relationship with Harry perhaps when teaching him transfiguration in first year.

Harry would be one of the very few who are offered a position at all four schools.

Schools may take as many or as few students as they wish. Slytherin takes fewest students followed by Ravenclaw. Majority go to Gryffindor and Hufflepuff.

Slytherin- mainly pure blood or the ultra talented/ambitious, small amount of half bloods Ravenclaw- top in various rankings or highly rated all rounders Gryffindor - anyone military minded, shows aggression, loves sports, or specialise in DDA Hufflepuff- takes the rest, actively recruits those who are influencers/social, good at sports, or show talent for Herbology and potions - they are connected to many mass production businesses

Inter house competitions are more expansive. Gobstones, debating, quidditch, and battle-school.

Harry goes to Gryffindor, but qualifies for a exchange program that allows top students to rotate certain schools (that they qualify for) once per year in order to promote unity (starting year 4 maybe?). Hermione qualifies Ravenclaw, Ron Hufflepuff, and Neville Slytherin. Different house do exchanges different terms

*** I had a somewhat similar idea a few months back. Post war, Hogwarts becomes the Hogwarts Trust, a collection of schools under the Hogwarts banner receiving training, aide and support from the main castle whilst operating in other parts of the country and the world.

I really like your idea, though mine stemmed from the fact that the Founders were never able to reconcile their differences of opinion and thus the British school system is as it is. A remnant of their past disagreement, if you will.

Perhaps this could be the endgame though? The story revolving, in some way, around the reintegration of the Founders vision into a single whole. Allowing the schools to share practices, staff and ideas and seeing they work better united than apart.

Add in the lack of old wards and respect for each school (what does a Slytherin care about the autonomous capabilities of Gryffindor?) I see all four quickly falling under the purview of the ministry with Hogwarts being used as a figure head name. I would also just make a Slytherin School rather than hiding them behind the Hogwarts name since it would just legitimize Slytherin rather than lowering him to the level of the other 3.

As for the endgame rejoining, it could be that Voldemort leaders his Death Eaters through a long March knocking over the school's taking Loyal students while trying to cripple the resistance. The Final result is all the remaining Students showing up at Hogwarts and defending it from Voldemort one final time showing that together is better than apart

***** I really do get your idea but I don't see the Ministry getting involved or even the public allowing the Ministry to get involved. The schools aren't state run establishments, as far as we know Hogwarts isn't a government funded school thus the Ministry doesn't really have the right to step in (hence why the whole Umbridge/Ministry interfering in Hogwarts thing was so massive).

Again, perhaps the Ministry could be getting more involved and trying to push the four schools together because of the negativity the school rivalries (on students and alumni) has on their society as a whole. They're seen as the bad guys for their interference with the schools and the system as a whole.

Additionally, why would Slytherin feel he is being lowered to the level of the four? He'd more likely feel victorious for actually managing to get Hogwarts all to himself. If he could see the modern era maybe he'd be upset but that's hundreds of years after he died.

****** 1 Hogwarts was able to stand strong because the people in charge all went to Hogwarts and respected the autonomous power of Hogwarts, a Hufflepuff Department head and a Ravenclaw Barrister don't care about Gryffindor Academy up in Ireland and it's autonomy. If anything bring it under heel is a good dig at the meat heads. Yes they lose the Autonomy of their school but they get fingers in 3 other "worst" schools

Essentially what kept Hogwarts out of Ministry power grabs was respect for the school and power of the defenses. These schools won't have this, without Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw and Slytherin and Gryffindor all blending their knowledge and influence.

2 the ministry wouldn't care about the hostility because they all grew up in the Hostility. But Britain can't look bad on a international scale, so while These schools all hate each other they need to provide a unified front so by essentially calling the schools and treating them as extensions of the Houses. Hogwarts isn't dead it's just grown beyond its walls

3 I would have Slytherin and Hufflepuff leave at around the same time, Slytherin because he didn't get his way (makes no sense that Ravenclaw and Gryffindor would give in to him) but Helga leaves as well because Godric and Rowena even debated letting Salazar get his way. Then you have the emotional head butting of Ravenclaw and Gryffindor about how to properly teach, through Military Precision or through Rote Memorization. The other founders leaving Hogwarts to Salazar is basically saying they where weaker than him but they kick him out and then break apart because of emotion and angry means no one wins which then makes the story "Let's all hate Slytherins" to "Our ancestors where fucking petty"

** I think it would be even better if Slytherin also created the "Slytherin School of Ambition" and Hogwarts was the school that provided well-rounded graduates. It could fun to have Hogwarts be the highest ranked, even as all four of the others constantly try to outdo Hogwarts, surpassing each other but not Hogwarts. Just my opinion though.
