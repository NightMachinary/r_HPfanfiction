Hi I'm looking for an awesome fanfic to read. I know what I'm looking for might not exist. I'm specifically looking for one that takes place in the harry potter universe but with completely new characters or places.

My favourite and closest I have found so far is the unfinished fic by Miranda Flairgold [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]] . Thanks


** If you check the side bar there's a series called Alexandra Quick that's ridiculously popular around these parts. I've never read it myself but I'm honestly surprised it hasn't been recommended in this thread yet.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

** You should check out The Fall of The Phoenix by IfIOnlyWereAWeasley linkffn(11304085) It takes place at Hogwarts but with the next gen kids (not the ones from CC) and a bunch of OCs. It goes into some "Egyptian magic" and "creatures" and recently it's looking like it's going to go into some "Greek magic" as well.

  After the war, all the Potters & the Weasleys wanted was to live in peace. With Lord Voldemort defeated & his Death Eaters locked away, peace seemed inevitable. Then the Minister began releasing Death Eaters, people started disappearing again, & it suddenly looked as though the heroes' children were destined to follow in their parents' footsteps.
