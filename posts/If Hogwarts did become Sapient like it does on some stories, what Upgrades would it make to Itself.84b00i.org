A way that Hogwarts might "wake up" is threw someone using the Room of Requirement to try to talk to Hogwarts, upon Entering the Room they Find Hogwarts in a Human form on a bed asleep and wake Hogwarts up for the first time (before the person does this Hogwarts on only sentient)

Like would Hogwarts read the whole Library and write a new one leaving out any redundant and out dated information(puts the outdated stuff in the History section)

What upgrades would a Sapient Hogwarts make to make herself a better school?

** ITT: No one discusses anything useful and OP gets blamed for an argument they didn't start and were correct about.

But, on topic, it feels a bit far fetched that it would create a human form. It's be neat to see a Hogwarts interpretation of the world around itself if it ever woke. I imagine it's first course of action, like most creatures, would be self-preservation.

It could decide for a time, using its sapient-level reasoning, to simply do nothing. No one expects a castle to be capable of thought, let alone reasoning. It could determine its safest course of action is to do nothing.

That'd be pretty boring, though.

** I think a sapient castle would do personal things for the students in need. Like helping them escape from bullies, or letting them stumble across a comforting room to cry in. I also think she would have an interesting relationship with Peeves, considering that the poltergeist could loosely be considered her child.

... would that qualify Hogwarts as a pedo? Jarvis would only be less than 20 (making him a minor, depending on country) depending on point of timelines, while Hogwarts is a couple hundred depending on how/when the sapience happens.

** Add a wing for adult visitors to come and do research or attend post-graduate lectures. The library would extend into this space, but all books loaned are simply Gemino-copies of the originals which dissipate soon after being taken off the grounds.

Those visitors staying on-campus to do research may be asked to perform guest-lectures in their best subjects, and the lectures are always transcribed for later review. Eventually, Hogwarts will become the world-wide leader in magical knowledge-sharing.

***** sapient, is the ability to think, and to reason. It may not seem like much a difference, but the ability to reason is tied more closely to sapience than to sentience. Most animals are sentient, (yes, you can correctly say your dog is sentient!) but only humans are sapient.

(Although in the magical world there is more than just humans)

Why? Why did it /have/ to reason about it to make a judgement? If you put your hand on a hot stove, do you have to wait, and reason, and think about whether you should take your hand away or not?

(The answer, btw, is no, because the stimulus doesn't make it all the way up to your brain, it gets to your spinal cord and is turned into a motor impulse that makes it back to your hand and you jerk away.)

** Sapient is an unnecessary word to use here. It just barely means what you commented down below. Sapience is the ability to reason, and sentience is perceiving. To reason is to be cognizant of your surroundings. You can't have sapience without sentience and so the word is completely redundant and a bad word choice. I agree with [[/u/AbuIncelAlAustrali][u/AbuIncelAlAustrali]] and don't get why they received to many downvotes.

*** You can have sentience without sapience though, and his question was specifically about what a thinking hogwarts would do. (Capitalizing the 'S' in sapient was totally useless, though. And the 'U' in upgrades.)

Also, I'm not sure why reasoning requires being cognizant of surroundings.
