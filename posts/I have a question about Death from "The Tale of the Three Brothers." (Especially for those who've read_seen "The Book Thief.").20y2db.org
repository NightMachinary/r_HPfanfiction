** Well, it sounds like an interesting scene, but I've never thought of Death as a real character, and that the Three Brothers tale was really just a story after all. But it's fanfiction, so I think you should go ahead and do it :)

  After all, the Deathly Hallows are real in the Harry Potter universe...so what about Death?

The existence of "Death" as a real person, a Grim Reaper if you will, is not canon.

We know the three hallows are real and we know they were first wielded by the Peverell brothers, anything else about their origin is shit Beedle made up hundred of years later to sell a children's book.

*** Thank you for your response, but please refrain from using crude and abrasive language with me when it is not necessary to get your point across. That's just juvenile.

To my knowledge, J.K. Rowling never said whether Death is real or not in the Harry Potter universe. Just because his existence isn't confirmed doesn't necessarily mean that he isn't real.

Lack of evidence is not proof of absence.

Cheers. xx
