I'm tired by how most HP fics completely butcher magic system, so I'm want to ask for some fics that handle it well. I don't have high hopes for getting them, but well it doesn't hurt to try.

What I *don't* want:

- magical cores
- mana based magic
- occlumency shields
- mindscapes
- spellmaking = arinthmancy
- trying to explain magic with physics

Fics with takes on magic I liked:

- Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived
- What I Leave Behind
- Forging the Sword
- Taure's fics


** Give The Weapon a try. It starts out as an angst fest and the ending is somewhat abrupt but the middle is good.

Also, if you're up for a LotR crossover, The Shadow of Angmar:

**** Kind of sidetracking here, but is the whole thing about not having magical creatures as animagus fanon or canon? I do recall JKR saying somewhere that often it's the same animal as your patronus, and my patronus is a magical creature, according to Pottermore.

** I'm not sure if it's what you're looking for (An HP/Avatar crossover), but Avatar by Von does touch on the impact magic has on the world as a whole, while completely avoiding all of those things you mention. She hasn't updated in a while, but I sent a private message to her and she responded, saying that life just got busy for a while and she's working on finishing up her stories.

Bonus points:\\
* No rehash of Harry's Hogwarts years OR the movie.\\
* No jumping between character POVs (not sure if this bothers you, but I'm growing to hate it.)\\
* Gen, with nary a hint of a pairing in sight. * No talk of the Dark side or Light side.\\
* Really very good depiction of the emotional side of things. Harry will get melancholy about his circumstances sometimes, but does not wallow in his angst for chapter after chapter.

** What's your problem with arithmancy = spellmaking?

The way people describe arithmancy in their arguments against it just make it sound like it's a magical version of statistics. I don't see why you couldn't use statistics while making a spell.

"What are the chances of this spell blowing me up because I fucked something up?"

I think the people who take offense to this just have read too many stories where people put no thought into it and have decided that the idea suddenly has no merit. The same goes for magical cores. It's a perfectly valid idea. It's just super misused by a lot of people.

*** There is difference between "Arithmancy equals spellmaking", and "Arithmancy is useful in spellmaking". I don't think that "fuzzy" nature of the HP spells make them well suited to be describable by mathematical means, and what little we were shown of spellmaking didn't involve arithmancy at all.

Of course, somebody may do this one well, and prove me wrong, but for now it's easy way to filter out weak fics.

Magical cores on the other side are inherently bad idea. Creating single magical "organ" is more primitive that what canon implies, and that's not a good thing. There is also literally no reason for creating such an organ. It's usually used for introducing mana-based magic system into HP, but this in itself is regression from canon. The only fic where I can respect use of magical cores is Matou Shinji series, because it's used there as a part of connecting Potterverse and Nasuverse.

** I actually like magic that has a realistic effect on the world via physics. You don't have too go to deeply into it (and thus steal all the fun from it), but a little bit here and there is enjoyable.

Ex: In the Dresden Files, Harry (Dresden) used a single "spell" to freeze one baddie and set another on fire because he stole all the heat from one and applied it to the other.

Does it completely work in real world physics? Probably not. I imagine you need a /lot/ of heat to set a monster on fire. Was it a cool idea and used in a fun way? Yes.

That's the important part, I feel. You need to make it fun and make sure that everything makes sense internally, as in inside the story. It's when everything starts to feel like nonsensical ass-pulls, or exists just to complicate matters in a way that isn't entertaining, that things become unbearable.
