So, magical-world specific question here. Imagine a typical Magical in Britain (that isn't Oblivious Harry). What would they know of the rest of the Magical World? Like, would they be able to rattle off the capital locations of every Magical Ministry on the planet? Would they know the cultural practices and beliefs of other regions of magical people?


** An adult magical would definitely know of the wider world, and there are probably a whole host of Child's Wizarding Atlas or other such books, if only because keeping children entertained during the days before they go to Hogwarts is a huge gap in the market. We know from canon, that Britain has a thriving import-export industry; Ali Bashir, petitioning to be allowed to export into Britain, and iirc correctly Percy's work on cauldron standardisation would have to apply to imported goods too. Though these are more technical.

The fact that young professionals such as Bill and Charlie, went to Egypt and Romania. Going on holiday to other countries seems to be a relatively common occurrence.

We also know that the book ‘An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe' also exists, so the information is relatively easily accessible. It's also likely that the Daily Prophet and WWN have foreign affairs correspondents and the Quidditch World Cup is a regular occurrence, so awareness of other places would bleed in that way.

An average magical might have a general idea of the wider magical world, but nothing overly specific. No random knowledge of Tribes of the Amazon with weird and wacky folk magic, beyond maybe having a vague recollection of having read about it once. Again it might be the same amount of knowledge someone who listens to the News regularly might have.

For specific esoterica, a more worldly person, like Dumbledore, Scamander or Ollivander might know some more.

*** The import-export thing is a very interesting point - Rowling's 'worldbuilding vibe' beyond just whatever sustains her current plot seemed to be 'like the real world, but MAGIC!'. Since Britain currently (and in the 80s/90s) was massively reduced in actual production and harvesting of materials (first and second sectors) and increased in the 'human end' of the industrial sectors (third through fifth sectors), that'd be an interesting dynamic for her to mimic. Maybe due to the last two wars, but maybe Magical Britain had a Margaret Thatcher all of their own?

The rest of your points are interesting as well, but I can't think of any specific responses to any of them. Seems like one thing is kind of agreed upon in the people who responded here, anyway - the information and opportunity for learning about other cultures exists/should exist and it's mostly up to the individual how much they engage with it.

Oh, actually - you do mention travelling seeming to be a common occurrence, so I'll ask you this as well. The little sub-thread from Nathen Drake 392 and lilaccomma brought up an interesting point. I'm not sure how magical competence would affect the international-travel abilities - most magicals can't cast a shield, does that have any bearing on whether they can transport or is that something all magicals can just do? And if the vast majority of magicals are too incompetent to travel, would that reduce the amount of intermingling possible? So, relating it back to your comment, is moving or travelling to other countries less common than it appears, but the characters we know just have more talent in that regard or access to travel tools than most would?

**** If you wanted a Thatcher parallel, you could make it Bagnold. That depends on how you interpret the Grindelwald and Death Eater parallels. If we say Grindelwald was the WWII parallel, then the Death Eaters are a mix of the Falklands and the Provo IRA, at least in terms of timeline. There is a whole direct parallel angle you could explore/make up given how shit Thatcher was. That'd make Fudge, the John Major parallel, weak and obsequious.

Like the real world but different is exactly the vibe that you want from the wizarding world, because the same issues that plague us will plague them, just in a different format.

Of course the whole point has more an emphasis import part of import-export.

It's established that Apparition is the cultural equivalent of driving, then it might be appropriate to say most people ‘can' apparate but choose not to because they find it difficult personally. As a slight aside, I am baffled by the concept that Apparition requires a wand. By the letter of canon, it doesn't , its a wandless ability, that require twirling on the spot and Destination, Determination, Deliberation. That's the limiting factor, Self Discipline, which seems appropriate given how scatter-brained the general populace is. Apparition is not an Academic skill, nor is it something like PE. It is difficult purely on grounds of self discipline. That being said, the reason, it might be difficult for international apparition, is that you have to visualise your destination, which makes it a ‘mid-distance' method of travel. Cost is probably a limiting factor to travel, also attitude. Portkeys are highly regulated, so it probably costs a lot, so the poor or ‘Middle England Wizards' like the classic ‘Middle England Tory' wouldn't have the opportunity to go abroad, or wouldn't see the value in it, respectively.

Our subset of characters is also applicable. Harry and Hermione have educated middle class background, Ron is like me, poor but well educated. These are people who are above average, and likely do not have the average experience. We don't really meet any character who i might say reflects a more ‘average' experience.

** Depends on how heavily warded (yes, I know “wards” aren't a thing in canon, but “protective enchantments” sounds dumb to me) and secretive they are. If they're open to travel, all it'd take is a pinch of floo powder, or if the floo network doesn't extend internationally, a portkey to travel.

The ability to visit /anywhere/ near-instantly, with minimal expense would allow for a lot of intermingling and broaden common knowledge. (“China's equivalent to the Ministry? Yeah I know it. In fact, I know a secretary there. He pops over for tea every other Tuesday”)

*** I've read so many fanfictions that I can't remember if international portkeys being very expensive is a real thing.

Also, I completely internalised all the lore from ‘The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles' because the author is incredible and came up with a thorough and complicated system of magic, writing paragraphs from within-fic textbooks in the fic. Anyway, in this fic each country was bounded and delineated by war wards and that was what separated countries from each other (because they presumably don't have the exact same boundaries as the Muggle countries). These wards were what allowed the Ministry to control immigration and movement across borders, which is why you can't just apparate across the Channel.

**** I believe it's canon that international aparation is very difficult and illegal, but I don't know about portkeys. Also, that fic seems interesting, I'll check it out.

*** Interesting idea - do you think there would be a few secretive societies of magicals out there, then?

Fair point, the ability to visit anywhere is something they have. But just because you can, doesn't mean you will. Do you think they would?

** Considering how clueless Fudge was on how to interact with the Bulgarian minister, but people like Dumbledore could speak a lot of languages... I'd say it depends on the person. Kind of like in real life... some people are more ignorant of others' cultures while others are not.

*** Fair point. :)

So, it's a matter of individual engagement for you, then? The material is available, it's just whether or not a person looks at it?

** I imagine it would vary much like it would in the human population.

they might be able to rattle of the capitals of the most important magical countries.

but then stumble with other countries

same with cultural and beliefs.

though if your nation is a strong ally with said nation you might know more about it

*** So, you think similar to DPs, then? The information is available, but it's up to the individual how much they learn and engage with it? With some 'obvious' things they know because their countries link more strongly and they sort of engage with it as part of their culture?
