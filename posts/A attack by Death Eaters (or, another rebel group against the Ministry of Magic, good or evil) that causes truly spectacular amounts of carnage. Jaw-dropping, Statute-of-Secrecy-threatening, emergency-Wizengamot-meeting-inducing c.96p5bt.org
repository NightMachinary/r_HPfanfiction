Like, slipping into the house of an identified muggleborn to Avada Kedavra them and their family before casting the Dark Mark? Lame.

Rigging the entire street with magical bombs, force-feeding the muggleborn+parents misbrewed blood-replenishing potions (or just using a dark spell) to raise their blood pressure to massive-exploding point, blowing the roof off their house with a simulated volcanic eruption, then detonating the bombs when Aurors respond, before opening up a magic suitcase and letting off several dragons (or similarly dangerous creatures) to mop up the survivors: Adequate amounts of carnage.

Does anyone know any stories where someone or other just goes for blatantly spectacular amounts of overkill? Preferably in ways that make it really hard to maintain the Statute of Secrecy?


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero) and its sequels. Highlights include (spoilers):

- Assassinating members of the ICW regularly
- Slaughtering over two hundred people in Diagon Alley, including the Minister and many of the Department Heads
- Breaking into Azkaban, killing over forty staff members and removing over a hundred prisoners.
- A mass dementor assault on London that de-souled a huge chunk of the population.
- Leveling the entirety of Beauxbatons and killing 99% of the people there (only like thirty survivors).
- Its sequels include unleashing an army of vampires on the muggles, blowing up Azkaban itself, a full on battle in France, the utter destruction of the Ministry building, a battle with a storm demon in the skies of London that froze the Thames, loosing a half-dozen basilisks in Scotland (not to mention lethifolds and nundus), and Harry literally melting a mountain.

Yeah. That happened.

***** Here's one of my favorite moments from the trilogy:

Harry laughed when he saw who was going to be speaking at his funeral. Lord Voldemort stood at the head of the coffin, resting his skeletal hand lightly on the brass handle.

"Harry and I were always close," Voldemort began, a tear falling from his flaming red eye. "Many enemies came and went over the years but Potter always managed to hold on that extra second, to escape me in some unexpected and spur of the moment type way."

Others were crying, some were smiling, and everyone was nodding.

"I killed my only son for siding with Potter and the Light," Voldemort continued. "I'd kill all of you here for more power, and I think Harry would understand that. He wasn't like the rest of us, was Harry. Some called him a madman, others called him a hero. But I like to think that there was a spark in Potter that could never die out, no matter how long and hard I tortured him or killed his surviving family members."

Gold right there.

  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.
