I just can't seem to find it. So I hope someone can. I remember quite a few things about it:

- hermione goes to snapes office after gradtuation. He fakes sleep, and she pets his eyebrows and says something to him, and she uses a spell to mimic his handwriting to grade the papers
- they meet again when harry, ron and hermione visit hogwarts again, hermione and sev meet and the lake and after it gets heated, he apparates her to her room. Afterwards he comes to her
- they meet at the weekends and he is pretty self destructive, they use a pensive so he can show her memories of his horrors, and also smut and stuff.
- she gets him to stay with her and her parents beach house, sell his house and buy a barn or something to make potion Business
- also ron has a fling, the mother dies and he is left with the baby, and draco becomes severus apprentice

Can someone help me?
