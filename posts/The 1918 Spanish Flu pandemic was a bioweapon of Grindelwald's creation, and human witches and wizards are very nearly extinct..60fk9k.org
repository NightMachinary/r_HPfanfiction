Just an idea I'm sitting on. The idea is that the Spanish Flu pandemic, occurring in between the First & Second World Wars, was in fact a creation by Grindelwald, a devastating bioweapon intended either to wipe out all opposition, or just wipe out everyone as revenge.

While it infected a lot of muggles, its true purpose was to home in on and destroy every human with magical potential, pureblood, half-blood, muggleborn, and even squibs and muggles with the ability to produce magical children. Because of the H1N1 bioweapon, human witches and wizards throughout the world are very nearly extinct.

With no human witches and wizards, it falls upon the various magical creatures to recreate magical society from the ground up; goblins took the wandlore they always wanted, house-elves found new ways to sate their desire to work, veela used their human-like appearance to smooth magical/muggle relations, and centaurs, merpeople, trolls and giants, and even dire wolves have all emerged out of the wilds to become part of the now wizardless society.

And then you have Harry Evans. Still born, to a Lily Evans who never had magic in this timeline. But when strange things start happening around him, when the magical people hear about the /human/ who is making things fly, they come to investigate. And young Harry Evans becomes known as the Boy-Who-Lived for an entirely different reason...

Does anyone find this a fascinating idea to expand upon?

*** Well, the primary purpose of this prompt is 'what if Harry were the /only/ magical human in a hidden magical world'; the Spanish Flu being a bioweapon released by Grindelwald to kill all human witches/wizards is essentially a justification for it.

** Rather interesting idea. But diseases jump species, especially around crossbreeds so giants and goblins would also likely be lower population. And mutations happen.

Potential change because harry evans without james potter is not the bwl really. James still exists, his family takes in a muggleborn when she's ill, pseudo wife husbandry by his parents but they do fall in love on own and they marry. Have a kid. Who is resistant to all strains of the disease. Now everyone wants his blood.

Yours would work great, possibly better than mine.

And dire wolves in magical settings are usually a larger, more feral breed of a wolf that is still extant.

****** From Pottermore:

#+begin_quote
  One curious feature of the condition is that if two werewolves meet and mate at the full moon (a highly unlikely contingency which is known to have occurred only twice) *the result of the mating will be wolf cubs which resemble true wolves in everything except their abnormally high intelligence. They are not more aggressive than normal wolves and do not single out humans for attack.* Such a litter was once set free, under conditions of extreme secrecy, in the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts, with the kind permission of Albus Dumbledore. The cubs grew into beautiful and unusually intelligent wolves and some of them live there still, which has given rise to the stories about â€˜werewolves' in the Forest -- stories none of the teachers, or the gamekeeper, has done much to dispel because keeping students out of the Forest is, in their view, highly desirable.
#+end_quote

These super-intelligent wolves came to mind when I was thinking about possible intelligent magical creatures coming out of the woodwork. It didn't seem right to call them werewolves (since then I'd have comments about why those with lycanthropy didn't get killed by the flu), so I went with dire wolves instead.

** I'd love to see this as a non-AU, where a wizard scientist working for Grindelwald in an obvious parallel of Nazi experimental research developed it as a magical disease that killed off most people with the "can have muggleborn descendants but isn't magical" gene.

**** True, but his campaign at least started by that point. Honestly, the bigger problem with this concept is that a 'Greater Good' Grindelwald probably wouldn't go as far as to unleash a magical bioweapon. This prompt's concept is a far cry from 'for want of a nail'.
