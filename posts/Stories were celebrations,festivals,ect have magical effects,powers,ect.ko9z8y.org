Normally stories have it as that day of the year is the thing that has power like say the summer&Yule solstice,Samhain,etc.

But are there any stories were the actual celebration,festivals,ect have power because people celebrate it? Like we're Christmas,New Years,Birthdays,ect.

Mabye even have the old celebrations and festivals losing power because less people are Celebrating them.

For example mabye New Years could help break curses because it about a new start to the year. Or Mabye the Weasley Twins pranks being enhanced of Aprils fools day,ect.
