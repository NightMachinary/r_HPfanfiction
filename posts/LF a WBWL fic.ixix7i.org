All I remember is that James and Lily abandoned him at the Dursley's and then go to pick him at his 11th Birthday, and Harry hates them(I think?)


** Is that not every wbwl fic with lily and James alive?

** Harry's Decision is the only believable Wbwl fic but it's not his parents but Hagrid and Harry refuses to go to Hogwarts.

Prince of Slytherin has James coming to get Harry.

  On his Eleventh birthday Harry Potter discovers that he is a wizard but that isn't the only secret Hagrid reveals. Harry's family is also alive. An attempt at the 'Wrong Boy Who lived, Harry's family is Alive'. Cliche Premise.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
