Finding out that Remus, Dumbledore, etc are dead. Meeting Harry and Ginny's kids, etc.


** I'm just imagining adult Harry's reaction to seeing his godfather who he believed to be dead for the last 20 years. Harry lived so long without him, and yet to Sirius it hasn't even been a day. Sirius has a lot of catching up to do on the last 20 years, with the war and - oh god, Remus... Okay this is making me too sad I need to stop.

** This would be interesting. Imagine he appears in front of Albus and scorpius (at hogwarts or something) and thinks Harry is hanging out with Malfoy.
