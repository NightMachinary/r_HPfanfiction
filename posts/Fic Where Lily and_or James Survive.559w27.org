I don't want any of that raised by the marauders, Prongslet garbage, or a super powerful wizard who's been training since he was three. I want a Harry that has been raised as a normal kid by loving parents.

** Both of these are fairly new and i can't guarantee how often they will get updated, if at all but they are at least worth a try.

Quality on a scale from 1 to 10 is a 'meh' but it's readable.

  Harry saves Lily's life when Voldemort comes for them, but this has impacting consequences. Wanting to distant himself, Harry locks himself away until he's finally forced out into the open by his name being called from the Goblet of Fire. This happens in 5th year in my story.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** Just recently found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7469856/1/Hallowed][Hallowed]] and am quite enjoying it. Ravenclaw Harry who's scarless and (as far as he knows) unaffected by the prophecy. Parents don't factor heavily into it, but seems to fit your criteria.

** Well there's always muggledad's The Last Casualties. He is still working on the next chapter despite the long break but at this point I suspect he is holding it back just to spite the people that keep pestering him about updates.
