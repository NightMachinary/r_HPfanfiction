Does anyone know if Battle of Lisa's fiction Vain Wisdom All and False Philosophy is abandoned of just updating once every few years? I found it on ashwinder. Its fantastic and bent my mind and kept me up until 3:00 in the morning.


** I remember that name and I'm sure I started reading it, but I can't remember what it's about at all. This is exactly why I refuse to read WIP stories. I did that twice and wanted to explode from rage and despair so instead, I just bookmark the unfinished ones and wait till they're done. I've been sitting on HPMOR for like 2 years and finally started reading when it finished this month. Hopefully it's worth the wait.

*** Exactly. Vain Wisdom and another WIP are my two favorite stories in this pairing. I try not to read WIPs because I'll spend my time angsting about how they'll end!

*** I do something similar but ugh. I foolishly didnt look to see if this one was completed. In some ways Im glad I read what I did as the plot was really interesting. Especially the story line of Sirius and Dumbledore/Harry's timeline. Its frustrating because I think I can guess the "mysterious" plot point but I will never be 100% sure.

** Yeah, it's probably abandoned. She last [[http://battle-of-lissa.livejournal.com/11798.html][posted]] about writing it about three years ago.

edit: I checked Ashwinder and a couple months ago she [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/reviews.php?sid=23526&a=1][responded]] to a review.

*** This is one of those times that abandoning a piece of work like this seems almost criminal. I hope shes ok and theres no aweful reason she didnt complete it. It is heavy and dark. Maybe it just got to be too much living with those characters and world? Or life just stepped in and took her attention away.
