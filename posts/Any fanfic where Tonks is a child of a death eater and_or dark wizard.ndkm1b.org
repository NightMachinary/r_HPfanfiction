I got this idea pop in my head after watching the Black sisters fan made film (which is AMAZING). Cygnus Black caring more about the Black name has made him forced his daughters to marry a pureblood wizard from a respectable family. We know that both Bella(Rodulphus) and Narcissa (Lucius) were engaged at that time wouldnt it be normal for the parents to focus on Andromeda? She might be forced to be engaged / married to a pureblood wizard at that time which led her to elope with Ted Tonks. In the fanfic, maybe Tonks is a child of Andromeda's former husband. The metamorphagus ability might be from him knowing that it can be inherited. Does any one know any fanfic similar to that?

It does not have to be a death eater maybe a pureblood from the 28.


** linkffn(12079410) has her as Bellatrix's daughter.

  What if Dora wasn't really Andromeda's daughter after all? What if someone had just dropped her off on the witch's doorstep? That someone is Bellatrix, and she has her reasons, as always.
