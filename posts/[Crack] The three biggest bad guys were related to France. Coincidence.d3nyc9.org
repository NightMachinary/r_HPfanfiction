Voldemort

Lestrange. (I know she's a Black by birth, but nobody calls her that.)

Malfoy

Coincidence, or a simple dig at France?


** JKR is half-French herself, so probably not a coincidence, but not an anti-French dig either, I guess.

** I think you're stretching it a bit - technically there are some Malfoy's running around in France, but it's not like it's anywhere near a common name - and Lestrange is much more 'British' than French IMO (and a google search in the same vein as Malfoy shows that).

In addition, even Malfoy gets renamed to Malefoy in the French version (in general places get localized as well, like Hogwarts -> Poudlard, and some names do - like Ludo Bagman -> Ludo Verpey, and other ones that 'frenchify' the names).

I'd say in Voldemort's case it's just a way to have an exotic sounding name that worked. It's a pretty funny one to realize it's the actual english name though when reading the french one ;)

Because... French Is such an exotic language in the UK? Going for something Arábica or Celtic maybe would have had a more exotic favor, I think

**** Personally I've never seen Lestrange for pubs or restaurants in France - and l'Estrange (another variation) isn't really found only in France from what I can tell. De Lestrange pulls a bit, but nothing much.

It might be of mixed old French and English, but I wouldn't call it particularly French personally. Maybe it's just not been in the areas where I lived, or found on the internet.

Malefoy IMO makes it read a bit more like an 'old' name - probably used to show he's from an old wizarding society?
