** Unoriginal.

A prompt or request involving guns and Voldemort/death eaters (or wizards in general on writingprompts) being surprised basically comes around weekly here and is pretty common on writingprompts as well.

And of course, I doubt the efficacy of guns in canon. The debate on them has been done over and over, because of the frequency of these prompts.
