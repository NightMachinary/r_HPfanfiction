** I read a fanfic once where the station guards knew more than they let on, and during the epilogue one of them had a muggle born kid, but no one accidentally leaned against the barrier and breached the Statute that way.

In fact, I'm pretty sure it's impossible to accidentally blunder ones' way through the barrier.

  Usually barriers are made of walls, walls made out of /bricks/ for that matter.

  But when Henry leaned against the barrier between Platforms 9 and 10 on September 1, around 10:55am he fell though. Yelping, he caught himself before crashing to the stone floor or the station, and looked up, and his eyes widened. For one thing, it was almost like he was transported to a different world, but also not. It still looked like Kings Cross. There was just.... a whole lot more going on. Hooting of owls, meowing of cats, croaking of toads. And there was /tons/ of children.

  A good number of people looked pretty rushed. There were mothers kissing their children, obviously goodbye. Henry read the plaque on the front of the Train. /Hogwarts Express/? What on earth was Hogwarts?

  "Oh dear. Seems like the platform let in another squib again," said a voice from behind him. Not unkind.

  Harry turned, to look at the man, a man with a funny scar over his left eyebrow. Almost like the shaping of a lightning bolt.

  "Get a good look, sir. You won't remember this in ten minutes."

  "Why would I not remember this?! It's... it's spectacular!"

  The man grinned, and chuckled. "Oh, we have our ways."
