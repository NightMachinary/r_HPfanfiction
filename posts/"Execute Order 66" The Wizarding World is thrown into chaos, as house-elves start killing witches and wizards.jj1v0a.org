The history of house-elves is shrouded in mystery, particularly their origin. Regardless, magical folk cared little and put them to work as servants and/or slaves. Sometimes, bonds of friendship were formed.

One day, though, their true purpose is revealed; whether it be from a spell or other instigating factor, the house-elves started killing their masters. The methods ranged from poisoning food and drink, to the explosive destruction of their homes.

It didn't matter the bond(s), for house-elves all over the world had one purpose now: eliminate witches and wizards.


** Like Dobby though, their plans to kill wizards fail because of how ridiculous they are.

Kreacher's plan to kill Harry via a fall down the stairs culminating with an anvil falling on his head ends with Harry deciding to remodel the staircase because of a loose floorboard and wondering why the Blacks had an anvil of all things.

The House Elves at Hogwarts smuggle in the giant squid into the great hall to kill all the wizards, giving it alcohol to make in more excitable. The giant squid just ends up playing with the students while the teachers look on.

Winky is ostracized by the rest of the house elves for just stabbing a wizard.

** What if, instead of this being the modern era, this is /why/ house-elves were originally enslaved? They nearly wiped out the ancient witches and wizards, and the only way to stop them was some ritual that bound them to follow every command of wizards and witches?

*** Good premise but that can easily end up in the same line of thought death eater apologists follow. 'Because of the witch hunts muggles are mistreated and muggles borns a risk to the magical world'

Punishing someone for the misdeeds of their ancestors is a crime against humanity and so is slavery.

Now if this were acknoledged by modern witches and wizards but iriversable it would make ourselves a tragic figure and provide the dangers of the dark arts. However, we don't see any of that in cannon could make an interesting political problem for a AU fic though.

It really depends on the story tone you are going for.

**** Perhaps the premise would feel more realistic if the change/ritual was not a widely accepted thing that had to be done, but the unilateral decision made by one person or a small group. What if the history and origins of the house elves is unknown because they were once something completely different?

****** I love this idea

I just read one where house elves are gremlins that get turned into house elves with a spell lmao and they're enslaved to pay back the damage they did. a big old stretch but kind of entertaining in its randomness

I have been trying to think of an origin story for them, but it's a tricky one it have it not be slavery apologetics or cheapen the horrors of what's gone on in the real world

**** i'm personally rather fond of the idea that Salazar wasn't actually a blood purist. that he had no problem with muggle-born, just muggles themselves. and that the disagreement between the founders was because Salazar saw the muggle-born maintaining ties with their muggle relatives as a threat to wizarding society, and the others disagreed.

most of the ones i've read with this premise usually throws in a son or grandson also named Salazar who WAS a blood purist, and history simply has them confused with one another.

***** Sure I too think that is a logical reason for blood purity ideology to start. However that happend in a time of what was essentially genocide and would be a valid question of time weather to allow muggle horns to Hogwarts during active witch hunts. However, this doesn't give an excuse on rasicim during non confrontational periods were. The whole point of the statute of secrecy was to peacefully coexist. For racism to continue for hundreds of years of peace is quite the extreme given the low interaction between cultures.

A Voldemort who was raised by his muggle father and his supporters are muggleborns and creatures that have been mistreated.

*** Hard to kill someone who live in your household and slit your throat while you are asleep, like how the first Elderwand owner Antioch Peverell got offed;

Or poison your food/drink, like how Hepzibah Smith got wasted;

House-Elves turning on their masters during their most vulnerable moments can be absolutely devastating.

Interestingly though, only those really rich Purebloods seem to have them, so if this actually happens, most Wizards should be fine and see many new opportunities in the Magical world opening up to them.

Finally, imagine how much inheritance some of their distant relatives are going to get!

** I always liked idea that Hause Elves are a low level demons like imps or more common fae like brownies that were enslaved to harness their magic. It may be result of a summoning ritual of some powerful mage or group of children disrupting accidentally fae ring one midsummer... with time it was forgotten and 'elves' became simply kept as servants.

What if the high tier demons/ fae king let wizards get away with it because they had a far reaching goal in mind...
