I've been reading some fics lately and some of them all touch briefly in the subject that people actually saw Harry Potter as a super hero or someone that God sent to free them from the evil. I've read plenty of stories where his fame is a curse, with people wanting to capitalize on it, nobody wants to know the real BWL and the good ol' corrupt ministry trying to destroy his image; this ideas already made some fantastic stories out there and some others... you know. Two fanfics that I don't recall the name have some points about the other side of this: One, Harry received a letter from an old lady thanking him, and giving some money, because she told how he could stop the evil that killed her family (or something like that). The other one was Kingsley saying how he thanks the 'boy who lived' everytime he lays next to his wife or when he hugs his parents. This made me think... is there any stories who have a major focus on this, and not just a paragraph or two, about Harry seeing the positive impact the legend have on people's lives?


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149113/1/Gratitude]]) -here's another story with the "legend" affecting people

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]]) - this story is immensely long but at some point Harry recognizes his impact.
