I am thinking of joining it (I just googled it so I hope it's the right one) and I am wondering if it's worth joining it.


** I mean, it's not like it's some irreversible life-altering decision. Join the server and if you don't like it, leave.

** I found the place to be a bit too... hug box-y. If you've got the same opinions on things as them, then you'll fit right in. If not? Well, I was banned from the server for holding opposing opinions to the staff. So, I'm sure you can imagine just how high my opinion of the server in general is.

** It's ultra left wing. It got too much even for me and I am generally a moderate.

If you disagree with them you will be mobbed and (possibly) evicted. There's even been a case of screenshots from another server altogether being used as justification to ban an "undesirable" just recently despite the guy not being guilty of anything on that server in particular.

I personally haven't been banned there because I was inactive most of the time, but I cannot stand to enter this place anymore. it's gotten suffocating.

** It's hit or miss. There's a lot a crossover from other Discords (Harmony, DLP, Fate, etc) so it might be difficult to avoid people you don't like (and vice versa) but you can always block them.
