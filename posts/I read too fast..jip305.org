I've been reading FanFiction for almost 10 years now. I began reading on my laptop, copying entire stories into word to read stories in the case that I had no WiFi (or on holiday). This was before I had a phone that could access the internet.

Now, I read too damn fast. You might ask... “but OP how is that a problem?” Well I'll tell you how! I'm beginning to run out of stories to read... it's getting harder and harder to find new ones I'm interested in... and it sucks. Ohh how I'm jealous of everyone who's just joined/joining now and all those amazing stories you are going to read... enjoy them. I know I did.

*** You are completely correct! I have indeed begun writing a story of my own. I'm not too far into it as of yet, I've written the first 3,000 words which so far has just been setting up the story. However, I have focused a lot of time setting up the plot and have almost 2,000 words of plot points and development down. I'm hoping to make it extremely AU and have been - I don't want to say struggling - but struggling, to completely fit the narrative that I am after. Once I have that figured out I'm hoping writing will become much more free flowing!

** Reread them. This is what I plan to do when I eventually run out. Or start writing.
