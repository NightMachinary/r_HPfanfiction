I feel like this is an unpopular opinion but mione and krum were extremely adorable I wish JK put them together instead of her and Ron, like at the end of GOF when he blows her a kiss and does a little wave goodbye.


** Yes! They are my favorite ship in the books! I loved how Viktor got Hermione to just relax and be a teenager for once. His adoration of her is so freaking adorable, and I loved how beautiful and appreciated he made her feel. It was also a nice touch how he maturely handled his jealousy and how he is similarly fair-minded and justice-oriented like Hermione. It's just such a good wholesome ship overall.

*** It was so sweet! He was the first person that made her feel wanted in a romantic way, and showed her she was beautiful, inside and out

**** She was officially 15 in September and had a couple extra months from the time-turner. When she came out of the lake she was 15 and a half. That said, Goblet of Fire, Chapter 7 (Bagman and Crouch), describes Krum as "only just eighteen" during the final of the Quidditch World Cup. So 3 years difference is accurate.

** I firmly believe that after their 7 years at hogwarts, hermione would want to do a mastery/higher education, probably abroad bc of everything that's happened in the UK....

My kingdom for a Hermione/Viktor fic in their twenties in like, Berlin or Paris or something.

*** We only know that Viktor is an excellent international seeker. He could very well share interests apart from quidditch. I honestly doubt Hermione would maintain some form of a relationship with him for over two years if he was nothing but a quidditch fanatic.
