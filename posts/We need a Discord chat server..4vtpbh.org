**** People are always on the IRC, there are 18 right now. Also IRC is superior to discord, which is why its still used. Discord has its usage, and is good at what it does, but it is not a replacement for IRC.

We had a discord server for awhile but no one used it. We tried to make a bot to link it to IRC to increase function but it was too hard to get Discord to play nice.

**** Yeah, that's been my opinion. I think we should just see if there's interest- I can manage an HP server, I already manage a few servers :D

**** The problem with this IRC server here is that I feel like the tastes on here are too varied. Like, I would not really have anything to talk about with someone who is into slash fics, or snape/hermione, or random bad fics people are trying to rediscover from 5+ years ago. Not to mention the redundant topics would drive me mad after a few days.

****** Thanks Ned.

I think the regulars rub along alright because although our tastes are different we respect each other's choices. If anything the variance helps keep conversation lively.
