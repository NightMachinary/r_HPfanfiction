Defense Against the Dark Arts class is a bit of a crapshoot. Quirrel, Lockhart, Lupin, Fake-Moody and Umbridge, and then Snape... that's what, 2.5/6? What I'd like to see is your ideas how the class should be conducted, how you would go about it if given the post (SI as a wizard with requisite backstory)?\\
What would you teach? How would you keep the discipline in a room filled with teens with wands and far too little common sense? The DADA done right - or at least in an entertaining manner.

There are a multitude of stories that feature alternative teachers - be it an auror on loan from DMLE, a time travelling Harry Potter or a particularly successful Tom Riddle.

Link a story, join discussion, write a snippet - the choice is yours! What will happen in *your* DADA classroom?


** First off I think your 2.5/6 is too high (i'm assuming your ratings are Lupin-1, fake moody-1, and Snape-0.5). Quirrell is either a zero or just barely above, Lockhart and especially Umbridge are not zeroes they are actually negative. As not only did the students learn nothing in class under Umbridge they were actually commanded to not use any defensive magic so they lost what skills they may have earned in previous years as they couldn't practice. And while Lockhart didn't restrict the students practice of magic he didn't provide them with actual defense books just his storybooks.

Fake-moody had to be a good defense teacher or his cover would have been blown. Now Snape may have known the subject matter he still is a lousy teacher so I wouldn't give him full marks. So I would rate the years as Lupin-1, fake-moody-1, Snape-0.75 for a rating of 2.75 but then you have to factor in Quirrell-0, Lockhart- -0.5, Umbridge- -1 which leaves you with a 1.25/6 rating.

Now the story Laughing all the way to London by JacobApples has a Time traveling Harry take over the Defense teacher position teaching in a fairly unique way in my opinion.

The crossover story Protecting Harry by Fairywm has Xander Harris in the HP world and has him take over the defense post.

** "Welcome to 6th year Defence Against the Dark Arts. While you have all evidently passes your OWLs to with high marks to get into this class, grade inflation due to the low quality of teaching over the years means that tells me little about what you actually know. The only ones of your previous teachers to leave notes were Professor Lupin and Professor Moody. The former were burned by Professor Umbridge for being written by a 'filthy half-breed', and the latter were apparantly cursed, and are being held as evidence by the Auror office. Discussions with the other staff members suggest that you have a total of 2 years of competent teaching and some of you did self-study for the practicle portion of the OWL last year. While this may have been enough to scrape you through the exams, I can't begin to teach you the NEWT syllabus until you have the foundations."

"Unfortunately we don't have much class time, as I am somehow expected to teach 12 classes at once. This will mean that I will be setting pre class research for you to do, which we will then discuss together. I will be picking on individuals for answers to make sure you are all keeping up. This will be most of your homework, as while you should be able to be trusted to set your own study habits, the lower years still need to have their essays read, and feeback given, so I don't have time to mark many of yours."

"The course structure is roughly split into two areas: magical creatures and defensive magic. Unlike the OWL syllabus, magical creatures are the small part. Much like before we will be working down the list of creatures focussing on identification and basic handling stratergies. If the creature requries a specific spell to be used on it, I will try and obtain a specimine to practice on, but otherwise this will be purely theoretical. For defensive magic I will first ask you to reasearch the spell before the lesson. We will then discuss what effects it has, including indirect and in conjunction with other spells and tactics, and when, if ever, it is permissable to be used. We will then move to the room nextdoor, which has safety charms placed on it. Depending on the spell we may focus on casting it on yourself, an inanimate target, or a living target, normally a pig or monkey. If you just need to know the countercurse, then I will cast it on a living target, and you will attempt to remove it. Even if they are nominally safe, we will not be casting NEWT level defensive spells on eachother. Not with one teacher and over a dozen students."

"Yes Miss Granger?"

"You may not practice these spells in your own time. I would suggest reading up on the incatiation and wand movements in your own time. The only teachers qualified to oversee that are myself, and Professors Flitwick and Snape. We all have seven years of classes to plan, for me from scratch, teach and mark class and homework for. In addition we have school patrols in the evenings, detentions to oversee, and in their case theoretically head of house duties. I suspect it will be a toss up if I reach the end of the year without my heart giving out from caffine overdose."

"You may begin the test now. You have until the beginning of next class to hand it in. While this isn't strictly exam conditions, I am only using this as a guide for what to teach you. If you pretend to know what you don't, I will simply not cover it in class, and you will struggle later on."

** *Example:*

Jackie Coteau was nervous. She'd been nervous ever since the older years started talking the previous night. As someone who'd just started her first year at Hogwarts, she had the strictest curfew and could not stay up long, but someone in her year -- Michael? He sounded like a Michael. She'd need to ask him -- asked about teachers... That's when the horror stories started.

As a Ravenclaw, she was mostly safe in Potions, being neutral in the Slytherin-Gryffindor war as she was -- and wasn't that a surprise! Half the school in open conflict with each other! She could also suffer through the Nap class with professor Binns, and while the necessity of self study for History was a bit disappointing, it was nothing she could not handle. Astronmy, Charms and Herbology had, in general receieved glowing reviews, being praised as interesting and the teachers as experienced. Cheatng was discouraged, duh, but with some effort they would be enjoyable.

And then the nightmare started. Defense Against the Dark Arts. Whether it was spoken is quiet whispers or shouted exuberantly, the effect was the same -- there was never the same teacher for two years, and the quality varied a lot too. Not a single one had managed to avoid a grim fate either. Cursed to death, locked up in a permanent residence ward in St. Mungo's spell damage wing, serving life sentence in Azkaban prison, obliviated of his whole life, eaten, rendered into potion ingredients, exorcised, burned alive, Kissed by a Dementor... Apparently Remus Lupin had set the record for the swiftest end... and the least brutal.

He was ‘just' revealed to be a werewolf a day before the opening feast, vacating the position and sending the Ministry into a tizzy. Headmaster Dumbledore had barely said four words at the ceremony and left in a hurry right after to continue his search for a replacement. There were bets going on how long that would take. The position was rumored to be cursed, and the visible lack of applicants certainly led credence to the rumors. Jackie wondered who'd be this year's teacher. Or what. A Dementor? A Boggart? A talking animal mascot with wish-granting powers?

It turned out to be a retired Auror, which was a disappointment in some ways, and a relief in others. Professor Donald Dross was old, was the first thing she noticed when the teacher entered the classroom. it had been left open for them to file in, but also lacking a teacher until they'd all gotten small talk and seating arrangements out of the way. It was to a silent classroom that Professor Don walked into.

“You're small!” cried out one of the newest Hufflepuffs. He'd be mocked for this outburst for years.

“Makes for a smaller target, don't you think?” replied the professor, unbothered by the disrespect. “Being hard to hit is a good thing, you'll surely agree?”

And indeed, where her peers had been expecting another Mad Eye Moody, a veteran of thousand battles with scars to match... Professor Dross didn't have any. He was small, wrinkled, grey -- he almost looked like a dwarf, except too well groomed to possibly be mistaken for one -- but he lacked a single injury. No missing limbs. No gouged out eyes. it was as if the only one to attempt harming him was Time... And Time had given it up as a bad job after first attempt.

“Now, I see you have your books out. Please put them away, we will not be needing them today.” Jackie realized he had been speaking the whole time and frantically stuffed her book into her bag, instead retrieving her parchment supply and writing utensils.

“The books you have were chosen because they are considered a good reference guide to what you will need to learn to do well on your exams. We will review them towards the end of the year, and you will occasionally be asked to read and summarize, verbally and during class, a chapter in place of essays your other professors are so fond of. I'm not -- your parchment belongs to you, and I recommend you either use it to note things you think you might forget otherwise, or save it.

“This is not an essay writing class, this is Defense Against the Dark Arts. My job is to ensure you can keep yourselves safe once you leave this school, and this will be my main focus during those lessons. My secondary focus will be to tell you what you wish to avoid, and what to do to keep the bureaucrats from bothering you over self-defense.” professor kept pacing in front of the blackboard, and Jackie could only see a glimpse of him now and then before he was obscured behind a student or a piece of furniture again.

She had to admit, she'd not like her chances fighting him. In open space and yet hidden from most of the class, most of the time, he'd be able to hex them all before they even knew what was going on.

“And since this class is all about you defending yourselves... Miss Coteau, what would you do when confronted with a hostile adult wizard?” Drat, she'd been zoning out again. What was the question? Attack, right?

“Hex them, sir?”

“Any hex in particular?” he asked, sounding amused.

“I don't know, sir” Jackie answered.

“And that is a problem, isn't it?” continued the professor. “You do not know, so while you're busy trying remember the spell to use, your opponent is already casting, and that, as you might see is rather problematic. Not to mention, anything they cast will probably be stronger and nastier.

“Let's have ourselves an experiment here, shall we?” the professor spoke as he transfigured a few tables into a dais with stairs leading up to it and climbed it, becoming fully visible for the first time.

”A Stunning Spell is the standard means Aurors use to capture their opponents. it is cast like this...” a demonstration followed, and quite a bit of silly wand-waving, but by the end everyone succeeded in delivering a feeble red beam upon a wall.

“Now, cast on me. One, two, three!” the wands flashed, the spells streaked through the air... And did absolutely nothing. He smiled.

“As you see, even if you get spell right, if you put no power in it, it will have no effect. Additionally, it has become rather common to charm clothing with at least mild protective properties, it prevents wear and tear of everyday use. Most of you did absolutely nothing wrong... But my protective clothing and greater magical power reduced the effect rather well, don't you think? “ he chuckled ”Most wizards will shield or dodge, though. “ he added.

Looking at the class he clapped his hands and as if summoned by the sound a cup of hot chocolate appeared in front of winded students. Professor waited for a few minutes, then resumed the discussion.

“Any other ideas?” that started the avalanche and resulted in the students missing half of lunch, but they were all in agreement; worth it.
