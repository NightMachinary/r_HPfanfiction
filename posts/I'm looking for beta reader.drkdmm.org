I would like to translate amazing fanfic that very popular in Russia to English language. I'm not native speaker, so I need beta reader to correct my work. Is there anyone who can help me?

I already chatted with the author and received approval.

*Fandom*: Harry Potter\\
*Size*: midi (30 000 words)\\
*Rating*: General\\
*Genre*: Action/Adventure/Crossover/Science Fiction\\
*Status*: Completed

*Summary*: If you're Harry Potter, you have to watch your mouth when you speak publicly. Otherwise the words that were said for effect can get you to the threshold of dangerous adventures and into the heart of someone else's terrible secrets. And your death for someone will become the only acceptable way to solve a problem.

*From me*: In that story Hermione invented the way how squibs and wizards can apparate like house elfes. When Harry was introducing this approach to the conference, he proposed to Apparate to the Moon. But they were wrong when they use photos with American astronauts on the moon. This story is about Moon Affair.
