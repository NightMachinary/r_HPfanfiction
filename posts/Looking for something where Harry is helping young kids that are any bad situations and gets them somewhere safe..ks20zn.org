The request was inspired by a Percy Jackson fanfic where Percy was helping demigods get either to camp or to The hunters. The queen's Champion by Anaklusmos14. Thanks for the help


** This one's a Percy Jackson crossover where Harry rescues young demigods. Harry has divine ancestry and saves other kids from being killed off by monsters before they make it to camp. Quite short at only 35k words, and abandoned several years ago, but I thought it was brilliant. Creature!Harry is awesome.

Story: Serpents and Celestial Bronze [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10641167]]

Not aware of any other stories that fit the bill, unfortunately, but I'll be keeping an eye on this thread as it's an excellent idea!

*** Thanks. I'll take a look. I'm not necessarily looking for a crossover either. Any pure HP fics would be great as well.

**** I read the linked fic rather recently (isn't it funny how recs come in waves?) - there is very little actual HP-Verse in the story. It's on the way back in, but doesn't quite get there before it's abandoned.
