** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The Many Deaths of Harry Potter]] might tickle you.

I'm not sure exactly what you mean though; do you mean during their school days, or afterwards? TmDoHP shows a less antagonistic side of the Dursleys, where they are justly terrified of magic because they don't want to be murdered and Petunia is stuck raising her sister's kid because of her sister's stupid decisions.

*** Thank you! I'll check it out. I meant that I want a fanfic where we see things from Petunia's point of view. I mean, her sister was loveable, intelligent, beautiful and a witch while Petunia was a muggle, ugly, unpleasant and not significantly smart. So I want a fic where Petunia is bitter about her parents doting on Lily. Lily basically won the genetic lottery. I'd expect her to feel like she's in her sister's shadow and jealous.

**** I also personally believe that Petunia thought accidental magic was intentional. It partially explains why they were so harsh on Harry and his accidents. She saw Lily do it deliberately, and thought Snape deliberately hurt her with the tree branch. What happened to Marge was probably the type of thing she and Vernon dreaded happening to them.

**** Petunia was indeed a muggle, ugly, unpleasant and not significantly smart. Do you know what else she was? Alive.

I'd say she came out ahead.

****** My point is: this is evidence of a cold, uncaring universe and that the scales don't balance. Good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people.

Lily was so "blessed" but she hardly got any time to enjoy all those things she had. Her and James' decision to take a stand and fight, directly led to their death and a decade of abuse for their son. All of Lily's gifts meant nothing in the end; the only thing that saved Harry was Lily's love.

Meanwhile, abusive, mean, spiteful, cowardly, envious, selfish Petunia got the dream: white picket fence in the suburbs, a middle class lifestyle, her family healthy and prosperous. And if her family had a secret, what of it, a lot of families have skeletons (or in this case, little boys) in their closets.

******* I thought that a constant theme of the series is that there are things far worse than death? Lily had a happy life, if a bit short - and Lily's 'gifts' were Potions. Petunia? Not so much. She had everything she wanted but she was not happy at all. She was always fake, bitter and mean.

******* One good thing that came out of CC is that it killed off Petunia with cancer before age 60.

For me, that's karma.
