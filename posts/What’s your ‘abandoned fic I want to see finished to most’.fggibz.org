*** Cywscross is my favorite author period. She has such an amazing style and imagination. All of her stories are just amazing. C'est La Vie I reread so so many times. It hurts even more because it was just about to really really start. It's so sad that many of her stories are discontinued. So much potential in them. But she's the only one I can forgive, because she keeps writing new stuff. Her muse if fickle thing, as she said. Also, when I don't know what to read, I know she probably bookmarked something good lately.

**** It's on AO3 Old Harry is transported to a new world with Neville as BWL and that works Harry a jealous jerk. Old Harry is given a new young body (4th year) and the option to be who and whatever he wants. He becomes a Hufflepuff and can't help but befriend the school outcasts (Luna, Neville, Hermione) and the blood adopted son of Remus and Sirius.

It's a fantastic story.

****** True, for a 20-something year old he's adapted to being younger very well. But in these stories I just always assume [[https://images.app.goo.gl/qYXvoS5s7cMHybeA6][MAGIC (ala the History Channel guy)]] makes the person accept and fit into the new time line.

As far as him not having to struggle, Harry might be the story's main character, but he is not yet the main character in the universe he's found himself in. It would be as if the Harry Potter stories were told from the perspective of Ron. We would see all the action but it wouldn't be centered on the character we're following.

******* Yeah, I tend to be fine with quickly accepting their new place/return to a younger body myself. But IDK - I think a Harry that's as powerful as this one is, and from the start, is not the /most/ interesting to read about.

To use your analogy, it'd be like if the Harry Potter stories were told from the perspective of Ron, but Ron was as powerful as Dumbledore and was guiding Harry through everything pretty heavy handedly. Whereas my preferred balance would be to have him closer in power to, say, Bellatrix - like if Dumbledore is a 10 and canon Harry is a 2-3, I'd rather bump him up a few steps but not all the way. Or, at least, to have that power up happen on screen with difficulty.

** For me it would have to be Prince of a dark kingdom. I know it's not to everyone's taste but the world building is really detailed and I do really wish I knew how it ended. Saying that you can guess where quite a few bits were heading and in some ways it may have almost been a let down vs the scale of the rest of the fic.

**** Its been awhile but Harry is not evil in the story. He's just darker than the other twin, Nathan. Part of the reason why I gave this fanfic a shot is because Harry and Nathan dont outright hate each. Harry isnt the spawn of the devil while the other twin isnt the light of all good. How they grown apart is realistic.

The characterization of the characters is great. The story is well written and the plot progression is smooth.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

**** Shelved Projects:

Harry Potter The Mind Arts Summary: What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.] You're probably here because of it. Which is a little disappointing, to be honest. The fact is I'm not sure if I will ever finish this story. Or when I'll even work on it again. This last update I tried my best, put plenty of time in, and it still didn't come out like I wanted. The pacing is terrible, Daphne's character arc sucks, and the foils I wanted to set up are poorly executed when they are done at all. It's a mixed up jumble of head-canons and fanons that I just tried to throw together like I was some kind of horrific machine learning program. It didn't work and as [[/u/thunder_dragon][u/thunder_dragon]] on Reddit first pointed out this story is dying, dying, dead. In the end, it was a lazy self insert with harem elements that just happened to do a slightly better job then the next best things for a bit. I was tempted to remove it outright, (still am) however, in the spirit of growth, I decided to leave it up and not delete it. So, it's there, it exists, don't judge me cruelly but FWD critiques. Anyone should feel free to adopt, continue, shred, and rewrite this if they feel like it. Any single idea or anything in general. Go nuts.

****** Yeah I've read and agree with everything they said. I really enjoyed core threads cause it was the first or one of the first fanfics I was read and it got me hooked. I didn't know such word building existed for Harry Potter, and loved the magic. But dear God the repetition of words and sexualization of 11-12 annoyed and bothered me. I just want to know what else happens and read about more awesome magic. Plus there's nothing I love more than OP Harry.

***** I bailed at Chapter 70 because of endless, boring details about building the city. But even before that, I had a lot of problem with the author's portrayal of sex-obsessed 11-year-olds (and younger!). Tracy became incredibly annoying, and it was clear that she was going to be a love interest.

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

There is a setup for a great plot but it ended there. We know the villain, the good guys and a broad backgroundstory for all involved.

We kinda know the layout of the chessboard, but the game have yet to be played.

** The Harveste Addams series by Kyaru. It was an Addams Family crossover where Harry was adopted into the Addams family. You've got Harry (or Harveste in this series) in Slytherin with Draco and Blaise, and the three of them are in a friend group with Hermione. There's some amazing discussions on what types of magic really mean, and why old Magic's aren't really discussed in Hogwarts. Plus, the series comes with standard Addams mayhem. What's not to love? Except, of course, that we're left on a cliffhanger at the beginning of sixth year.

** The God of the Lost by Gravidy. It stopped updating in 2002 and has since been deleted. I've only read it once, back when I still thought it might get another chapter. And I /still remember the unicorn scene./

The story is about Draco and Hermione being lost in a forest (maybe the Forbidden Forest? It's been years, I don't remember, lol) and having to survive together. Surviving, here, means going through all kinds of Neverending Story-esque trials...with an occasional horror twist.

The "unicorn scene" is where they come across the skinned, mutilated bodies of two unicorns (which they had seen before, alive, just a little while before). As they pass, the decapitated head of one of the unicorns turns to face them. In context, it was really, really creepy. I can't remember if any of it was ever explained, but from what I recall of the rest of it, I think the forest was very, very cursed.

It's probably not as mind-blowingly amazing as I remember, but I refuse to re-read it because it leaves off on a bad cliffhanger, and that was painful enough the first time. (Wow, I was 14 years old when I first read it. I've been pining over it for more than half my life. Putting it like that, it sounds kind of pathetic, huh? XD)

** Ugh it was a dramione that I can't remember the name of. Draco owned a nightclub (shocker, I know) that was BDSM themed (another shocker). He has had a crush on Hermione who he works with for a long time, but thought she wouldn't be into everything. Ginny drags her to the club one time and he later finds out who she is. The story was abandoned right after she finds out that it was Draco that she has been submitting to for months.

I really don't go for those kind of stories, but gets curious once in a while. I think this was the first of its kind I read, and it was the reason I rememberers. Not usually my cup of tea, but I remember it as being fairly well written.

I see absolutely no point in downvoting this, since it replies perfectly to the original question. I have had several frustration about fanfics just being cut off or abandoned. Which reminds me I also checked for updates several times for an abandoned fic with a slightly similar feel but different setup. Harry and one dominant girl. I think it was called “Boy and girls” or “girls and boy” or something along those lines. It was some time ago and I can't remember.

** linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School by Kwan Li) --- amazing story with a really unusual premise. It's sorta/kinda an Ender's Game crossover, but not really (and you needn't know anything about Ender's Game to enjoy it). Last updated almost 2 years ago and I suspect it's pretty much dead.

linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger) --- probably the finest Harry Potter / Lord of the Rings crossover of all time, and just plain awesome. Unfortunately, it hasn't updated in over a year, and given how much space will be required to finish it, that's sort of a bad sign.

linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure) --- an amazing fic. Harry gets Dumbledore's memories from up to the day Dumbledore defeated Grindlewald, not long after Dumbledore's death. I think this one is permanently abandoned.

linkffn(Culture Shock by Ruskbyte) --- another crossover, this one with Iain Banks' "The Culture" series. It is really great. Sadly, there's no question but that it's never going to update, it's been 12 years since it last got touched.

linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall) --- truly a spectacular story. Harry merges with the soul fragment in his head when he's attacked by the dementor at Privet Drive. It last updated almost two years ago, and is quite literally within one chapter of the climax. A horrible cliffhanger to end on. It's really well written though.

enembee is has several stories unfinished, which truly makes me sad. linkffn(By the Divining Light by enembee) and linkffn(Conlaodh's Song by enembee) form the first two parts of a trilogy that really, really deserved an ending, but there is none and probbly never will be. linkffn(The Sun Dog by enembee) is a great start of a story that has no end. (At least he recently posted the fabulous and complete linkffn(You Meet in Paris by enembee).)

  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable in the highly complicated and controversial subject of Spell Creation, a subject he soon becomes enamored with despite having to hide his interest from everyone. Besides, it's not like he's going Dark, after all.

** Easily Harry Potter and the Natural 20: linkffn(8096183)

It was abandoned in around 2015 I think but then in 2018 got a few new updates. I had started reading it around then so I was excited to see where the story would go from there, and then... nothing. Again. I've been considering writing a continuation of my own but I have no idea what the story should be, nor do I know what the author had planned, so it's unlikely.

** Okay, out of ones that haven't been mentioned so far:

Romance: /Harry and Luna Against the High Inquisitor/, linkffn(7725072). Hands-down the best Harry/Luna story out there.

Crossover: /Harry Potter and the Natural 20/, linkffn(8096183). The protagonist is a D&D player character, and it is hilarious.

"But you're almost finished!": /The Professors' Point of View,/ linkffn(7031677). The professors of Hogwarts discuss the events of the books in a shared journal. But it gets halfway through seventh year and then dies.

"Just tell me what happens next already!": /My Brother!,/ linkffn(7405386). Harry has a younger sister, and they're both super-geniuses. Not nearly as good in retrospect, but it's the most aggravating one to me. The author spends 150k words teasing the fact that arithmantically analyzing the Patronus charm has somehow revealed some unspeakably horrifying secret, strongly hints that they're going to reveal it, but then never does and keeps going for three more chapters and then stops. I just want to know what the secret was.

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

  "My name is Draco Lucius Malfoy. I was born on the fifth of June, 1980. My parents were Death Eaters and I am a war criminal." He didn't say anything else for a long time. By the tremors that wracked his body, she thought that perhaps he had succumbed to tears. But when he spoke, his voice was clear. "I should be dead," he said. DRAMIONE! Post-War Dystopian World.

** [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3meO7obwCb4X1NaSHNra3BjcUU/view?usp=drivesdk][A Winter's Fairytale]] (Link to ePUB file because the original has disappeared from the Internet)

It's an amazing SS/HG response to the Hollow Man challenge that also tackles a murder mystery (written well before HBP so most of it is AU). Keeps both characters hilariously in character, but is laugh-out-loud funny in many places due to their personalities butting heads. It got abandoned just before it started solving the mystery of Dumbledore's murder (not the one we know in HBP)

Edit: Yep, downvoted right on cue!
