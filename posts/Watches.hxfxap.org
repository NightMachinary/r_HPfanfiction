We know that Harry got a watch from the Weasleys on his seventeenth birthday, as it was tradition for wizards. I guess Ron must have gotten one too. However, I do wonder a few things.

- if Harry got a family watch... Did Bill, Charlie, Percy and the twins got one too? Not sure how many family watches they had. Guess a few of those were new.

- is it ever stated which kind of watch Ron got?

- Did Hermione get one? Not sure if this was a wizard only tradition or if it included witches too.


** I think all Weasley brothers got new bought watches, and only Harry got the slightly banged legacy watches because they didn't have money for the proper one (they already recently bought one for Ron). No idea about Ginny and Hermione.

*** I think the one Harry got is more special because it's an heirloom. Wasn't it from Molly's brother?

**** Wouldn't this contribute to Ron's Horcrux thoughts of his family preferring Harry than him?

***** I like the interpretation in this fic by FloreatCastellum.

To Harry, a used(and abused) watch with emotional significance is more valuable than a perfect, new one. To Ron, the value is having something that is entirely his own, and not a hand me down.

  Harry's seventeenth birthday is coming up, and Molly Weasley is certainly not going to let him come of age without a traditional gift of a watch.

**** It was, but I think it was a bit making a virtue of necessity: they didn't have enough money for the new one, so they gave him the family heirloom as the way out of the trouble.
