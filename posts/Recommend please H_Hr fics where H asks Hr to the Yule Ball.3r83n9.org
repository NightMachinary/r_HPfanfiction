Specifically, high-quality fics where Harry actually asks Hermione to the Yule Ball, and takes the story from there. Thanks!


** Not exactly what you're looking for but there's a GREAT fic called "Hermione Granger and the goblet of fire". Definitely an h/hr fic, definitely great, they definitely go to the ball together but i can't remember who asks who. It's on portkey, should be easy enough to find.

*** I remember reading that. I only got to about chapter 14, though, before I quit. And I can't remember why I quit, which is a bit frustrating.

**** I mean, I'm not going to say that it's life changing or anything, but it's one of my favorite fics (I'm a sucker for fixs where Hermione is the protagonist). Hope you find what you're looking for.

** Sure, I got quite a. . .

Oh, you want high quality fics. Sorry, that limits things a bit.

I suppose these two by chemprof are decent enough, although both are rather short.
