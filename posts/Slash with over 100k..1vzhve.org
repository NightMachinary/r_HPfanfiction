** From what you commented above I guess you've read most of the big ones on ff.net?

Here are the ones I've bookmarked that /aren't/ on ff.net. They are both HP/SS.

[[http://hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=19708][The Apple Tree]] by Philo. "Harry returns for his seventh year determined to change the status quo. A long (but completed!) tale of romance, betrayal, initiative and derring do!" This is really good, one of my favorites, but parts of it are really sad/angsty (I definitely cried).

[[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=15486][Light on the Dark Side of Me]] by CocoaSnape. "Harry discovers his sexuality and his attraction to Snape, who rejects his advances. But when Harry finds that Snape's life as a spy is much darker than he could have ever imagined, he fears that Snape is not the man he thought he was at all. HPSS." I don't actually remember reading this one, it must have been years ago, but when I bookmarked it I added the note: "Hottest thing ever. Also tragic and beautiful and hopeful." So I'm guessing I liked it. Maybe I should reread.

Edit: Ok I took a look at "Light on the Dark Side of Me" again and remember it. This fanfic is really good, but it is SUPER intense and there are some disturbing depictions of violence, including sexual assault, that definitely upset me.

**** Ok, here's what I could find. They are all Harry/Snape. I tend to gravitate more to Harry-centric than Snape-centric, so they may not be exactly what you're looking for, but Snape is still a huge focus in all of them. None of them are quite on the same level as "Light on the Dark Side of Me," but do what you will with them :)

[[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600095691][Controlled Emotions]] by LeviosaHex. "Snape has been asked to recommence Harry's Occlumency Lessons and a new approach is necessary."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7254046/1/Divine-Intervention][Divine Intervention]] by KJmom. "Snape gets a little guidance from an unlikely source."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6940707/1/Vocalizing][Vocalizing]] by KJmom. "Severus is uncertain of why Harry wants him. Harry shows him one of the many reasons. In the same universe of A Professor's Confessions and Harry's Eyes. Snarry, /slash/ you've been warned!"

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4463169/1/Pains-and-Contradictions][Pains and Contradictions]] by atypicalsnowman. "SS/HP. Slash. When Harry begins to break under the pressures of death and prophesy, help arrives from an unlikely quarter: Snape. Despite their own doubts, manipulations from all sides and hapless interventions combine to bring their two souls together."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1812613/1/The-Master-Plan][The Master Plan]] by StarryGazer. "SLASH. Complete. Harry is looking for the knowledge and training to survive the war. Only Severus Snape can give it. This is being edited for mistakes, and that is why the chapter titles and numbers don't match-I'll fix it someday."

** So here we go: "All pairings are welcome" /Ducks flood of Drarry smutfics./

Here are some of the longer slash fics I've read which /aren't/ Drarry or HP/LV. Just a wild spread of canon males who are /mostly/ the right age for Harry and have at least a Handful of easy-to-find stories if you like the pairing ;)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8095859/1/][Blood Matters]] is /very/ AU and has Harry and Draco as friends but no Drarry...

Bonus: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3024937/1/][Like this would EVER happen]] Viktor/Seamus

As per the request I left out a LOT of non-harry, crossover and too-short stories. If you use the regular searches on AO^{3} or ffnet you can find a treasure trove of (sometimes) well-written stuff if you leave the beaten +(and twelve-year-old-infested)+ path of Drarry ;)

**** Yay yay enabling! I haven't read a ton of HP/LV but that probably has to do with the quality of the work rather than an actual dislike of the pairing.

As I've been thinking about this here are a few more: [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=7385][Always Love, Draco]] Amazing. Perfect. Takes place about 5 years after Hogwarts. Harry is a Quidditch star and Draco is his Ex-Husband. Seriously great.

[[http://afallenangel.net/kimberjingle/itom.html][Tomorrow Will Come]] This probably is the weakest story-wise of the rec's I've made. It falls prey to several of the terrible things about fanfiction (Oh! Let's have them dress up and go out! OOC-ness) But aside from that its a good Dark/Powerful Harry type of story. Heavy drug use.

I'm seriously watching this for new recs now. I've fallen back down the rabbit hole...lol

** Here are my slash fic recs:

*LV/HP and/or TR/HP:* (the main slash pairing I read, often has dark!Harry and overpowered!Harry)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today][Death of Today]] by Epic Solemnity. This is always the first slash fic I will rec to people. It's an extensive AU where Harry is incredibly intelligent, dark, and not very much like canon Harry at all (some could feasibly argue its not truly a HP/LV pairing because of how un-Harry he is). That said, the world the author builds is very good, her characters are well-written, and the relationship is deliciously dark and twisted while still showing that the two genuinely care about each other. /Warning: dark themes, mentions of incest, violence, gore, torture, smut (that the author has on her LJ page, not on fnet). Complete. 500k/

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2032067/1/Abandon][Abandon]] by Batsutousai. This is a (so far) pretty good LVHP fic. I'm actually currently reading it, so I can't give you a full rundown of the fics strengths and weaknesses. Thus far, the author does a pretty good job of writing dialogue (and nearly the entire fic is dialogue) and portraying the budding relationship between Harry and Voldemort, in a surprisingly light and even humorous way. It's rated M, and I can't precisely tell you why, as I'm not done. But you should definitely check it out! /Complete. 265k/

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/451855/chapters/774989][Counting Bodies Like Sheep]] by rightonthelimit. Okay. This is only 70k words. I know it's not what you asked for, and you can totally disregard this rec. Just know that this is currently my favorite fic in this pairing and possibly ever. It's a non-magical AU set in a world that has been ravaged by a zombie apocalypse. It's so, so good. If you're okay with violence and zombies, of course. Harry and Tom Riddle are partners trying to survive in this world, and their relationship is both dynamic and endearing. /Warning: violence, gore, dark themes, zombies, smut. Complete. 70k/

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172646/1/Butterfly-Heart][Butterfly Heart]] by the Fictionist. This is a very well-written, non-magical story that was inspired (noticeably) by Silence of the Lambs. It's dark, and twisted, and the main slash relationship is not very healthy. That being said, I really liked it. By this point you've probably noticed that I like dark fics. This is another of them, and its possibly the best written one there is (and so close to 100k, can you forgive me?). /Warning: violence, psychological truama, very dark themes, smut. Complete. 93k/

*HP/DM:*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6435092/1/Turn][Turn]] by Sarah's girl. This is my favorite HP/DM fic ever, and get this? It's canon-compliant through the epilogue. This is a pretty mature (as in grown-up, not smutty) fic that features adult Harry and adult Draco and a bit of an alternate dimension travel-y thing. That's not particularly explanatory, but it works. It really works in this story. The fic is well written, is written maturely, and features some really delightful twists of canon. /Warning: smut, infidelity (but it's not trashy or weird). Complete. 300k/

*HP/Other:*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2093991/Epic-Solemnity][Deliver Us From Sorrow's Hold]] by Epic Solemnity. This is a crossover with Kuroshitsuji, a manga and anime set in the Victorian age about an English lordling who makes a deal with the devil. I know, it's a crossover, and you probably haven't read/watched the manga/anime. That said, I hadn't either when I read this fic, and I didn't need to. The author introduces you to the world and explains as she goes, and I was hooked without having any background knowledge. One of the best parts of this fics, for me, is that the author investigates extensively what being the "Master of Death" means for Harry. This is actually canon compliant through the epilogue, and features Harry being paired with one of the main characters from Kuroshitsuji, a demon in butler form. /Warning: dark themes, violence, gore, discussion of suicide, minor smut (so far). WIP. 96k/

And that's it, I may add more if/when I think of it. Have you read all of these?
