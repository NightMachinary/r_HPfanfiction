I know that Harry went by another name and it started (I think) with him and Voldemort talking in a battlefield on chairs and with tea. Harry already graduated somewhere else (I forgot where exactly somewhere like Japan, I'm not sure, but Tonks morphed into someone else and gained his trust even though after that he was suspicious of her though) before Dumbledore kidnapped him. He flirts a lot with Severus, he also plays pranks on Dumbledore and Sirius. I think him and Severus get together sometime during it. He's also a great dueler (I think) and is powerful.

Edit: I feel the need to clarify that it wasn't a battlefield and during that time (I think Dumbledore was talking about how Harry needs to fight Voldemort.
