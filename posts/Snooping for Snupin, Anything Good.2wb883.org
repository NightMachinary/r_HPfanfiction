Ever since I came across the pairing in part of a Drarry fanfic (should I spoil which one?) I was reading, I've kind of adored the idea. I would be super grateful for any Snupin fics you have be they slash or gen.

Or really anything good with Remus Lupin. He's one of my favourite characters.

Thank you. :)

EDIT: I've been told to share the fic name which is Secrets by Vorabiza. This is one of my favourite fanfics of all time by the by. I've re-read it into exhaustion. Just something about despite its flaws that draws me.


** I'm afraid the only fics I have to share are a couple of short one-shots ([[http://www.ssf-moonshadow.com/archive/archive/0/contextis.html][Context is Everything]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/745946][Diamonds in the Dirt]]) but I had to congratulate you on your wordplay in the title. I hate ship names, but that made me smile.

Also, yes, please say which H/D fic you were reading.

*** Thank you for what little you have. I'm sure I'll read them over and over. :)

And it was Secrets by Vorabiza, now this fic is sitting near the very tippy top of my favourites of all fanfiction list.

*** To be clear, he is one of my favourites not my number one favourite.

That being said, the reason why I love Lupin so is many. For starters: he is kind, he is patient, and he is the first actually knowledgeable and competent professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts. Probably the best professor of the lot actually since while Moody/Crouch Jr. knew his shit it wasn't exactly legal and Snape was a cold hearted bastard that year (in different circumstances, radically different circumstances, he might have been a great professor).

Anyway, I see him as a great father figure to Harry. Much better than Sirius would ever be, as Sirius is much too brash and more looking for a friend than a son, and more trustworthy than Dumbledore (from what we've read I do believe Lupin to be an honest person). Note: Arthur is a good father figure too, I am not disregarding him.

I am quite aware of his flaws: his desire to please people, his self-deprecating behaviour, his bystander tendencies, his blind loyalty, etc and I still love him. I understand the reasoning behind some of his flaws.

A lot of these flaws do stem from his werewolf affliction (which JK has likened to a disease/illness). How it makes him feels isolated, alienated, hated, like he doesn't deserve good things because he's a danger to others. And it has caused him to make poor decisions in his life but thankfully he has good friends (Harry!) to shout sense into him (Marauders exception but he was afraid of losing their friendship by standing up to them and thus didn't even though he knew it was wrong, it doesn't excuse the behaviour but I understand it).

I know Lupin had very little on-page/screen time but whenever he was there I always felt happy to see him. He is a good influence on Harry even when he's making bad decisions. And he genuinely seems like a good person. Some of my feelings for him are sympathy but it extends beyond that in my opinion. Remus Lupin is just so damn likeable.

*** As to why Severus and Remus as opposed to say, Sirius and Remus or Harry and Remus or even Tonks and Remus (I'm one of the few who didn't like this pairing, I apologize. It just never interested me and seemed quite out of the blue (not Ginny out of the blue but still).

The reason why I like this pairing is because if you were to give Severus a sprinkling of understanding/willingness to admit that Remus was not in on the attempted murder by Sirius, then I think they could have been good friends.

Remus and Severus strike me as quiet, introspective people. Both of them are also compassionate people and I think they're just different enough that they could develop a great understanding and connection between them.

I can see them drinking tea/coffee together in the mornings, I can see them reading together, I can see Severus brewing while Remus plans his curriculum or does whatever job work or hobby that he might like to do in his spare time. I can certainly see (sans werewolf grudge which truly stemmed from Sirius' assery and not out of any true hatred of werewolves IMO) Severus standing up and simply not tolerating any prejudice against Remus whatsoever. And I can also see Remus breaking Severus out of his shell a little bit when it comes to going out and hanging with friends (not Sirius though, Remus will visit him alone/with Marauders if they're still alive in this timeline).

I think they could make a great couple. Or even just great friends. I mean I read a ton of Drarry fics, so if I can believe that Draco and Harry can overcome their shit, especially when they both hate each other, then I can believe that Severus can overcome his grudge for Remus.

Plus I do think Remus respects Severus and understands he's not as antagonistic as he tries to be. He was deeply grateful for the wolfsbane potion and was probably incredibly angry with Sirius for that stunt as well.

So there's my reasoning. Not necessary maybe but I felt like it. Those two are important characters to me. Both are in my favourites list. And no I do not forgive all of Severus' actions but like with Remus, I understand them. Something about understanding the motives makes a person so much more interesting and likeable to me. Makes them so human.

**** A. I don't think Tonks and Remus is a good pairing either, in particular for the reasons you gave for why Remus and Severus could be friends. Tonks nearly defines Extroverted and Remus... isn't.

B. I agree Severus and Remus interacted with a reasonable if distant respect

C. I can see Harry being bi (but kept his interest solely focused on girls until he wasn't living with Ron and Seamus, the judgmental ones), Draco being gay and Remus being bi (particularly how David Thewlis characterized him in the films), but I always trip over Snape in these situations. He's /the most hetero character/ in the books, to the point where he devoted his whole life and purpose to the one girl who ever was kind to him.

Aside from that, Remus annoys me in how he didn't interact with Harry as much as his caring character would suggest. Once his secret was out he could have been just as relevant as Sirius, more so given that he could walk in public places, but he's busy being maudlin and angsty somewhere in the vast off-screen.

But that's why we have fanfiction- to explore the possibilities in the vast off-screen and the multiverse of what-ifs.

***** Indeed. I do love my fanfiction.

Although to your point A, it's not like extroverts and introverts can't fall in love and do well, it's probably just more of a challenge. And in my honest opinion, Remus is kind of an extroverted introvert in that I think he enjoys outings but prefers staying in. But anyway-

I'm wondering if Remus' appearances were really on JK and also on time allotment. There's only so much plot you can squeeze in a book, also Remus' visits would be purely fluff and not enough plot advancing which is enjoyable for some but not all. That being said, I would have loved to have seen more of him.

As to Severus' sexuality, just because he was in love with Lily doesn't mean was romantically/sexually inclined toward her. Harry loves Hermione but he didn't go for her. For all we know ol' Sev could be asexual. I get what you mean though, it's HEAVILY implied that it's a romantic love that Severus has for Lily.

But again, also as you say, fanfiction!!

** Have you tried searching over at [[http://www.ssf-moonshadow.com/][Moonshadow]]?

Also, I agree! Secrets was a great fic. Incidentally, it's my #8 favorite Drarry fic. I don't read Snupin but I seem to see them in a few fics with other pairings as a main focus. In addition to Secrets, I've seen them in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6029161/1/White-Lies][White Lies]] (Drarry) and [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=2025][Blood Magic]] (Severitus). There is also a beautifully written SS/HG/RL fic I can recommend called [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=23170][Snow Turns the World Deaf]].

**** LOL fair enough about Snape/Hermione.

It's funny. Everyone like something different. For example, I know [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4842696/1/Reparations][Reparations]] is a highly popular Drarry fic, but I didn't really care for it all that much. I guess it's because my personal preferences are Hogwarts Era fics and I also prefer fics where Draco/Harry get a glimpse into the future somehow (and my favorites reflect those preferences).

Now that said, my top 10 Drarry fics would probably be in order from #1 to #10:

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BW.html][Beautiful World]], [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/poison_pen/TF.html][Tempus Fugit]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7429542/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6435092/1/Turn][Turn]], [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3727][Draco's Boy]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/344335/chapters/558662][Starts with a Spin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1143478/1/Time-out-of-Place][Time Out of Place]], [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3386][Secrets]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4726251/1/Must-Love-Quidditch][Must Love Quidditch]], and [[http://bigbang.inkubation.net/bbb3/reparo.html][Reparo]].

***** Actually, in terms of Drarry fics, Reparations/Foundations is one of my top whatever-the-number-may-be. I'm quite fond of grown up Harry/Draco fics, probably because it makes me feel less of a creeper. Seriously, Beautiful World kept insisting they were 15. I felt creepy.

That being said, Beautiful World is wonderfully written. Very lovely and sad. Because it's sad I probably won't read it again but I keep it in mind as a good fic. Thhhoouuuugh I did find it hard to believe that Harry and Draco never once got caught by any of the no-name students/weren't gossiped about at all. I mean they were swimming in the lake in the middle of the day. But enough of that.

Favourite Drarry Fics In No Particular Order:

[[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=6256][Secrets by Vorabiza]] *This one is super fun. Amazingly well done and incredibly re-readable. My favourite.*

** I actually just downloaded a few (fiveish?) Snape/Lupin fics for the first time this week. I also really like Lupin, and I was looking for Lupin/anybody-but-Tonks-or-Sirius stories. I'll get back to you if they end up being any good.

I completely agree with you about Tonks/Lupin. That felt very out-of-the-blue to me in the originals, too. I feel like (had he lived), Sirius and Tonks would have hit it off really well, but she and Lupin just seem too different to have a successful long-term relationship.

**** Ok, The Other Side of the Mirror and its two sequels were rather good. Here's the summary:

In sixth year, Remus Lupin nearly killed Severus Snape in wolf form. Miraculously, Severus escaped unharmed. But what if he hadn't? Slash, RL/SS

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4954058/1/The-Other-Side-of-the-Mirror][Here's]] the first one on FF.net. The third is unfortunately not finished, but there are an extra seven chapters on another site (you can find the link in the author's profile).

The stories are more "let's see what horrible thing we can throw at Severus next" rather than "scenes of comfortable domesticity between Severus and Remus", though there are a few of those. The first book runs from the prank until Voldemort's first fall, the second runs from then until about six years later, and the third (so far--I don't know if it's abandoned or if she'll keep writing) runs from then until about halfway through Harry's first year at Hogwarts.
