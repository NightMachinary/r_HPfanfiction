Hey, I was wondering if anyone knew where I could find this oneshot. Harry and Pansy have to work together on a presentation and Harry is nervous about public speaking, so Pansy snogs him. It was something like "Getting an 'O'" or "Getting the 'O'". Despite the name, it was clean.


** Well, “O” is a grade in OWL testing, so it stands to reason it can be used without innuendo in a /Harry Potter/ story.
