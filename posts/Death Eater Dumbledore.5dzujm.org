I've read plenty of fics where Dumbledore is evil, senile, batshit crazy, irresponsible, or plain old retarded. But never one where he is a Death Eater.

Anyone have any DE Dumbledore fics?


** "Dumbledore trying to play both sides like Palpatine, only to lose control over his apprentice Tom Riddle" - I would totally read that story.

** There is a crackfic - or part of a collection - where Dumbledore picks a Dark Lord candidate each generation so he can fight them and be a hero. Once they are defeated for good, they can retirem to some Island, or with another identity. Harry is picked as the next candidate, and Voldemort fills him, explaining that no, thtey really do not have any chance, Dumbledore is just that powerful. As far as I recall, it's not for some comlicated plan or goal either, Dumbledore simply likes to play hero.

*** Ah yes I remember that one. Can't think of the title but Tom was married off to Bellatrix Lestrange as part of it and two of Harrys 4 Wives were Susan Bones and Romilda Vane

**** Literally "THE fucking END". Talk about anticlimatic as Albus denied his love interest proposition to join him in a domination of Muggle, denied the post of Minister of Magic, but suddenly have a turnabout in his personality to join Voldemort in his madman quest.\\
The two most powerful wizards of their era joining hand to fight against... well, nothing, as nothing can actually fight against them.

*** Agreed. We see so many of these fics where Dumbledore is a meddling senile foolâ„¢ but all of them still have Dumbledore trying to stop Voldemort.
