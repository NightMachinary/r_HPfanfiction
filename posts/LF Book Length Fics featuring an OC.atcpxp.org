Preferably during Harry's time at Hogwarts, I just want to explore the wizarding world through an OCs eyes with a completely new backstory


** Some of my favorite fics are part of an OC-centric series that follows four Slytherins who are one year older than Harry. They're all very fun to hang out with, imo. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2233473/1/Latet-Anguis-In-Herba][Latet Anguis In Herba]] is a collection of one-shots that introduces you to the characters, then after that comes the fantastic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3353818/1/Shade-to-Shade][Shade to Shade]]. I would call it an adventure story with a love triangle subplot. It's about school, war, strained friendships, death, and love. The stories also explore how Hogwarts culture is generally against Slytherin House, sometimes fairly, sometimes unfairly.

I'll also throw out my own WIP about my two OCs, Todd Ollivander and Maggie Gibson: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12723602/1/The-Wandsmiths][The Wandsmiths]]. However, this is set during the Marauder's Era. I've gotten compliments from readers who've said I've done a good job fleshing out Ollivander's and Diagon Alley. I note in Chapter One which chapters I think are my best.

Here are a couple other fantastic OC-centric fics, though they may not fit your request 100%:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] is a great (probably the best?) HP/D&D crossover, and people on this sub recommend it all the time. Milo attends Hogwarts at the same time Harry does.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15719628/chapters/36541374][People of the Goddess]] is about a witch who Snape meets during his year as headmaster. She's part of a cloistered wizarding family who is smuggling Muggle-borns to safe locations during the Second Wizarding War. Half the story is from Snape's POV; the other half is from hers.
- Another one of my favorite OCs is Theia Higglesworth, a trainee Auror who's paired with an adult Harry Potter. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors][The Aurors]] and its sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12778140/1/Hollow-Ash][Hollow Ash]], are great stories.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter][Victoria Potter]] experiences the wizarding world in such a different way than Harry does that I essentially consider her an OC, though I don't think Taure (or others) would agree with that at all, haha. She is, obviously, a Slytherin fem!Harry. But regardless of how your characterize Victoria, it's a great story with an impressively well fleshed-out wizarding world.

** linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky; Victoria Potter; You'll be the death of me; Black Bond; Potter and Black; Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power)

While Victoria Potter isn't exactly OC, she's completely OoC compared to canon Harry, while having similar background (not as harsh by any strech, the first chapter is quite clear on it) and it has the "Taure-effect" of having a fan-fucking-tastic world building.

Eclipse also has a great world building, but its PoV is shared between mostly (sometimes its Remus or Dora or even more rarely Hermione or Ron) Harry and Kally, who's an OC with full backstory that not even now, 900k words in, we know the full shabang, though its fairly obvious by now. She's also an original creature (its told, IIRC, in the first or second chapter, so sorry if this is a spoiler) with a pretty unique view of the magical world. Its also in my top 3 fav fic all time.

Of the rest, if you wanna a complete story, go with Elemental's power, it has world build unique to the fic, OC character as one of the MC and its setting from before Hogwarts till epilogue (not canon compliant at all)

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

** "alio forte" is on a03 by strangestories. Muggle Central character and you see things through her eyes.

There is going to be eventual Ss/OFC pairing but so far it's a fun slow burn with good character development. Plus a mystery. Let me know if you read it and what you think.
