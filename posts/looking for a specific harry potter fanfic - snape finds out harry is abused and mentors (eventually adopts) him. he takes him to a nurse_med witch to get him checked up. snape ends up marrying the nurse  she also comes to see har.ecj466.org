#+TITLE: looking for a specific harry potter fanfic - snape finds out harry is abused and mentors (eventually adopts) him. he takes him to a nurse/med witch to get him checked up. snape ends up marrying the nurse & she also comes to see harry as a son. i'm pretty sure there was also sword fighting in it too.
