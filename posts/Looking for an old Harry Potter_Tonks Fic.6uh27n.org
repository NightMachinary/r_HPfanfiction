I believe the Fic is a Time Travel or dimensional travel story.

Fem Harry

Meets Tonks at the Leaky Cauldron a number of times

Get's Job as a teacher through Tonks recommendation

there's a dinner with the with Tonks and Sirius B. with it ending as Fem Harry leaving and punching Sirius in the face

I also believe Sirius is also a teacher during the story.

Read it about a year ago and can't find it right now.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
