I totally meant to post this yesterday, but ended up forgetting (oops!). In honor of the incredible witch that is Hermione Granger, let's share our favorite quotes by her? Can be from a fic or the books or the movies.

Here's two of my personal favorites, which highlights (to me) how much she has grown over the series:

"I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed - or worse, expelled."

“I'm a mudblood! Mudblood, and proud of it! I've got no higher position under this new order than you have, Griphook! It was me they chose to torture, back at the Malfoys'!”


** "Honestly, am I the only person who's ever bothered to read Hogwarts, A History?”
