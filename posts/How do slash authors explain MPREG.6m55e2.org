** In HP fic, the top reasons are a potion, a spell, or a genetic throwback to some random type of creature or an old genetic variant. In FanFic in general, alpha/omega verse is the top place I see MPREG (and I have rarely seen this in the HPverse) or magical realism.

** "Magic, lul."

Which, frankly, is all the explanation you need in fanfiction.

** Not a slash author but this is really just about creativity.

1. Your own magic protects the child. If you get pregnant in a female form and revert back to male form your magic will make sure the minimum environment for the baby to exist is there. That doesn't mean external changes so C section time in 9 months or drink a potion to acquire the necessary parts needed to launch a baby from your hanger.

2. Emergency! Your wife can lose the baby or you can carry it for her but you've got to make a choice RIGHT NOW!

3. You sleep with Zeus there's a chance you get pregnant. Even if Zeus happens to woman at the time. You being male doesn't even matter.

** All of the above comment. And in one fic, the wizard had to transfigure his appendix into a womb. In a crossover, the wizard had to turn into a woman for the conception and duration of the pregnancy. In another, the men brewed a potion and contributed DNA to it, then gave it to a woman to drink, which impregnated her.

Also, because magic. In a world where you can turn into an animal or another person, it doesn't start to seem so far fetched.

**** The statistic you cite is based on a misrepresentation of a study by an anti-trans psychiatrist that got circulated around conservative media. Keep this kind of shit out of this subreddit.

***** Even if it was a statistic given by someone who doesn't like trans people, that doesn't falsify it in the least. Just a week ago a Trans you tuber killed himself.

**** I've never heard anyone say magic was supposed to take out mental illnesses. Look at Neville's parents. They were tortured into insanity with no hope for a cure. Similarly, Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange are crazy, despite having magic.

I also don't know what mental illness has to do with pregnancy in the context of fanfiction, unless you're saying the people who write and/or read about MPREG are mentally ill. Or do you mean the authors are writing characters who are secretly trans? That would be an entirely different story.

Finally, there is a lack studies on transsexualism. Where are you getting your statistics?

***** I meant inborn mental illness, being a sociopath is due to nurture, never seen a person with Down syndrome or the like in Hogwarts. I believe Rowling even has a page for it on Pottermore titled illness and disability.", answering your question.

Within this context, option one is blatantly obvious.

I believe Google is your best friend if you want to fact check me. I'm not in a position to provide a citation, but I should be able to get it out to you later today.

****** can you cite a study or give any other examples showing that mpreg in fanfiction is a mental illness? i see you have clearly followed this thought to its logical conclusion with such a statement as "option one is blatantly obvious".

I also checked up on the pottermore and the article does not once mention anything about mental disabilities. Rowling only ever talks about physical illnesses and disabilities. Not sure how that means autism and other mental illnesses can't exist in the wizarding world. You just have to read the books to see there are any number of characters suffering from its various forms. the Longbottom's, Sirius Black, .../Harry Potter/.

in regards to sociopathy: it is not a nature vs. nurture argument, but an influence of environments, genetics, and neurology. And even then the concept of just 'Nature vs. Nurture' isn't even a valid one depending on who is asked. you can easily google this stuff.

And finally... what does being a sociopath, or being transgender, or being mentally ill in any way have anything to do at all with the concept of mpreg in /fanfiction/?

Nice Strawman, but that's not what I said. I said option one, as in

Incredible stretches, there are no characters with *inborn* mental disabilities that we know of in the series. Stop trying to stretch the definition of a word in order to fit your narrative.

Please, research psychology before you offend people any further. The stuff you're saying it just generally wrong.

******* Because in order to want to be another gender (aka: being pregnant as a Male) you have to have been born with it (according to every Trans person ever).

******** i think you're confused about what mpreg in fanfiction is. it is not a transgender male getting pregnant or giving birth, it is a cis male with male sex organs who identifies as male getting pregnant or giving birth. In hp slash fics because of some form of magic or because of being a separate, third gender, like in a/b/o works.

I'm personally not a fan of pregnancy in /any/ form, you're allowed to dislike it. I'm just confused why you brought in all these irrelevant facts that have nothing to do with the concept, said people who write it are mentally ill, and reacted so strangely to someone stating how and why it works in harry potter fanfiction.
