Since fiendfyre is often self sustaining in canon, are there any fics where the main enemy is uncontrollably spreading fiendfyre? Like, an apocalypse/Grey goo scenario focused thing.

The counter to it is never really discussed, so it could be area based, in which case maybe the fic is about raising awareness and getting a giant army of wizards to cast the counter everywhere. Or maybe this fiendfyre is resistant somehow, or whatever. What do you think? Could this be a cool thriller-style fic? Or no?


** I was thinking about revisiting one of my old ideas where Voldemort makes a magical cauldron that stores fiendfyre and keeps it 'alive', supplying it with energy like a battery so it doesn't burn out.

Maybe said cauldron could also be enchanted to work as a 'brain' for the fiendfyre, so it can intelligently ambush targets, evade obstacles, et-cetera.

As a side note, [[/u/suername][u/suername]] posted their theory on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6t6fb2/lf_oneshot_where_fiendfyre_gets_completely_out_of/dliv8w8/][how fiendfyre works some months ago]]; basically, rather than being a semi-intelligent self-perpetuating fire, fiendfyre needs to devour magic (items, wizards, etc) to continuing burning, though it's hot enough to start regular fires. Sort of like a contagious magic-to-fire transfiguration.

...Huh, I wonder what other contagious magic-to-X transfiguration spells there might be? Turn afflicted wizards & witches into froggy squibs with magic-to-animal? Ultimate-nature's-wrath with magic-to-wood? I wonder how good you'd need to be at transfiguration to transfigure a spell in flight or target someone's magic in the first place? Or transfigure a ward, I saw that in Blindness once.

*** But then it can still perpetuate long enough to kill a lot of people if cast in, say, Diagon Alley, right? Also-- how does it not burn down Hogwarts if the castle is magical? Is the Room a pocket dimension or something?

** Considering how fast it spreads in DH, it would probably torch Britain within a day if it ever got out of control on the outside. You could make some parallels to "The Cloud" [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cloud_(film)]], but I don't think a semi-sentient natural disaster would make a good thriller plot.

I think a Fiendfyre obsessed maniac similar to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0Lxk8p43sA][Kilgore]] in Apocalypse Now would be a more interesting antagonist. Basically Bellatrix Lestrange but throwing Fiendfyre instead the torture curse around like it was going out of fashion. Since Fiendfyre spreads very quickly, the protagonists would have to choose between catching the maniac or stopping the flames, maybe even failing at both. There could be difficult choices, like do you help to evacuate the school or the hospital. He would not be as difficult to kill as Voldemort, but a lot less concerned about PR and recruitment, therefore doing a lot more collateral damage.

** In my headcanon, there /is/ no countercurse to Fiendfyre. That is what makes it so terrible. It will /keep burning/. The only way to stop it is to use a certain spell that will upgrade it from semi-sentient to fully sentient, and make it more physically stable. This is where Heliopaths come from.
