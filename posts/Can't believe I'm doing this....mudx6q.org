I would like to read some, uh, Indy!Harry fics, I haven't read many in the past because I didn't fancy having to read Lord Hadrian James Potter-Black-Gaunt-Ravenclaw-Slytherin-Hufflepuff-Gryffindor-Merlin-LeFay-Merlin, 7th Lord of the Fae courts, only magical in history to have 593 animagus forms, so powerful he can shat diamonds accidentally, etc, etc. But I'm bored and half asleep so I figured "why not?"


** Based on your description, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4873597]] His full name is an entire paragraph. It's a Crossover though.

**** Surprisingly the name is not that long and it's not continuously repeated. I would have expected a much longer name... at least proportional to the inheritance test results.

**** I giggled so hard when I read the first chapter. I also love Harry's reaction. He gets an inheritance from basically every important family in existence and then he “asked surprises.” I actually died a little when I read that first chapter so thanks lol.

  Revised! Harry has found out that the light has been keeping many of secrets from him that push him over the edge. He returns to Hogwarts after the death of his godfather seemingly unaware of the light's manipulations, but in the shadows the notorious assassin Sang Lys has arose. Dark!Evil!Harry. Major OOC! Light!Bashing

** Like, exactly how absurd of a fic do you want?

linkffa(1471) - [[http://hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1471][King of Kings]] is ridiculous. He's randomly kidnapped by a goblin who brings him to some palace somewhere and is told that he's the emperor of magical rome (among other things), and he's like 'okay, makes sense'. And then it starts to get crazy. (Honestly, most of the fics from hpfanfictionarchive are ridiculous, so, like, browse around the political or op tags, k?)

There's also that one that's been linked a lot recently with a 5k word inheritance test at gringotts, followed by Harry getting a harem (and the repeated typo of 'so smote it be' which made me laugh way too hard.) I think it was in the drinking game thread?

... I'm trying to think of a good one, and I just... can't...

So those two. There ya go.

** Not sure if it counts, but in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/896895][The Cupboard Series]], Harry ends up creating his own school after using magic to KO Dumbledore with the aid of a pillar at the end of Year 3. The Ministry is... not happy about this.
