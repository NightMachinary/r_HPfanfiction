So I remember coming across a fan fiction along time ago, (a one shot, I think...) where both Remus and Tonks had survived the final battle and were receiving orders of Merlin. However when the OotP wanted to celebrate after the ceremony, they almost get turned away at a restaurant because Remus is a werewolf but then at the end of the fic Remus does something heroic to change the restaurant owners perspective on werewolves... Can anyone help me find this fic? I've searched everywhere but can't seem to find it... Thanks in advance! ☺️

P.S. English is not my first language, I apologise for all the spelling/grammatical mistakes I made.


** It's definitely a fic by shimotsuki11. Only I can't remember the title. She has a ffn profile and the fic should be there. I think it's called changing minds.
