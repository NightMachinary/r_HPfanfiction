** I'm curious as to what happens to Tom Riddle in this world, where it's a Grindelwald run meritocracy. Is he Grindelwald's right hand, ready to take over when he dies? Is there an ensuing power struggle between the two, a-la the Sith Rule of Two? I wanna know.

If James and Lily, two of the brightest of their generation in canon, are both born into a wizard led meritocracy, where are they ranked in this hierarchy? Is a Harry raised by his brilliant and encouraging parents, if they are still around, putting forth all his effort into his abilities? The kid is a powerful wizard, he just seems to lack motivation.

Not to mention that I'm really not sure what a Grindelwald led world means for Muggleborns. Are they trained from earlier? Are they taken from their families? What does this mean for Hermione? Is her brain enough for her to become the next in line? Or will it go to someone who seems to have better knack with more powerful magic? (Harry)

I've always loved reading about meritocracies, but nearly every story about them is about the corruption or nepotism that ends up occurring. I could go on and on about this idea and where it takes my mind, but lack the ability to actually write a decent story about it. Damn.

*** An interesting take on the muggleborn issue is the idea that giving birth to a magical is a sure fire way to improve your standing. Muggleborn parents get a benefit in station for producing a magical, welcomes into high society.

*** Tom Riddle grows up differently perhaps in this timeline and leads the Order of the Pheonix against Grindeldwald while spending his day time as a defence against the dark arts teachers

in this timeline, there are two major changes, the three way dual was slightly more vicious which led to aberforth also being injured.

and the second change, is that merope used the love potion on Tom Riddle for a few months more and when she stopped Tom Riddle took his son with him when he fled.

Tom's father later died during the bombing of britan during ww2.

James amd lilly are both open members of the resistance due to James father being one of the founding Members.

Harry grows up in a secret resistance school with his best friend Ronald weasley.

Arthur weasley was scouted during his time at school by Riddle who realised he had hidden talents.

The offical motto of the grindalwald empire is the strong rise. But the empire is flawed and tends to belive in sink or swim.

While tom belives in fostering and nurturing people and the talents they might have due to his memories of his childhood before hogwarts, where even though his father was nervous about magic he helped him explore his abilities.

** [[/u/Just__A__Commenter]] makes a very good point: why Hermione? There are plenty of wizards, starting with Tom Riddle, who are equal or better candidates.

*Because everybody else who actually wants the bloody job and could even theoretically do it is even worse.*

You see, when wizards gathered under Grindelwald's flag, some did it because they felt like they shouldn't have to hide from their inferiors. Others wanted to practice Dark Arts freely (with other consenting adults only, and using safespells, of course). Others---particularly the Muggleborn---were drawn by his promises of equality and meritocracy. Yet others just wanted a fight. It is a testament to Grindelwald's organisational and political genius that he had managed to keep his coalition together long enough to actually take over the world.

Thus, as Grindelwald, having just cast down Dumbledore's last-ditch effort with contemptuous ease to become the undisputed ruler of the world, beheld his most loyal lieutenants... he realised that fully half of them were bloodthirsty palookas who would start a war for its own sake the moment he took his eyes off them. The other half were no less ruthless, but they had more than a dozen mutually opposing agendas for the new world. Also, he now had several billion Muggles who were undergoing social and religious upheavals brought about by revelation of magic.

And he had just put himself in charge of the whole mess.

The next decade alone aged him as much as the prior four, as he spent every waking hour playing whack-a-mole with the world's problems. Tom Riddle's rebellion in particular cost him a lot of grey hair---and then the rest of his hair, to a stray curse---before it was put down.

It didn't take him long to appreciate just how greatly the Statute of Secrecy simplified the wizard--Muggle relations. Why hadn't he and Dumbledore considered it when writing up their Greater Good? Wizards were /supposed/ to rule the Muggles as benevolent dictators; but it turned out that the ones interested in being dictators tended not to be benevolent at all.

His vision of meritocracy kept degenerating into backstabbing and gang warfare, always teetering on the edge of anarchy and war of all against all.

It took him over fifty years to reimpose some sort of semblance of sanity onto the world, and he knew better than anyone just how precarious it was and how much it depended on his leadership and his threat. At that point, he just wanted to retire. Not because he couldn't continue---because, as the greatest Dark Wizard in history, and the ruler of the world, he had no trouble obtaining immortality and eternal youth---but because he didn't want to. He was tired, bored, annoyed, frustrated. The Next Great Adventure, as Dumbledore had put it so many years ago, was more tempting than ever.

And so, he put out a call for candidates for the next benevolent dictator of the world. But, as he had discovered decades prior, benevolent dictators were hard to come by. Most who wanted the job didn't understand what it entailed; only a few of those who understood still wanted it. Fewer yet had the potential, even with his help, to gain the power to force their will on the world. And of those, only a small handful genuinely and earnestly believed in the Greater Good and would not abuse their power for petty self-interest.

Grindelwald's shortlist was short indeed. Appropriately enough, it was topped by a British Muggleborn witch just out of Hogwarts. This is her story.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...
