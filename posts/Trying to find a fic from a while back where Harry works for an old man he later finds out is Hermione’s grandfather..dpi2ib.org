**** Lequin had some interesting stuff, and may have the most palatable Ron bashing I've ever seen written.

Not that I like Ron bashing, but still. Lequin does tend to ignore that the hurt goes both ways though.

I think his Hermione, though smarter than in canon, fit Hermione better.

****** I think part of that is for the major stores of theirs, Hermione has a handicap compared to Harry.

Last Chance has a basically 17 year old Harry with a 15 year old Hermione, and no amounts of smarts on her part will compensate for the fact that Harry has fought in a war while she hasn't. A 17 year old war veteran (who has lived these events before) versus a 15 year old bookworm, makes it very clear who the sidekick would be in this situation.

Healing Hermione has her at a disadvantage because... well Hermione is hurt. She is the "damsel in distress" not because she can't hold her own, but because she got seriously cursed in a sneak attack.

******** You mean her focusing on the law? I don't understand why her pushing for reforms through legislation would be her considered a sidekick, considering they're all working towards the same common goal.

Note, I didn't like how Harry was made Chief Warlock, but considering he wrote it as a moderator position, I'll accept it.

********* No, I mean her being a student at Hogwarts and basically doing nothing while Harry sovles everything. Hermione is, in canon, the one who's interested in politcs and makes a career out of it. Here? It's all Harry, all the time, taking over Britain because he's just so awesome while the silly muggleborn is still at school. And the world and Wizengamot bends to make him win.

Where does she kick ass? Set Ron and/or the other Harry straight? Do something, achieve something without having to rely on Harry?

I don't recall her having any real agency.
