It be interesting to read a story where Harry genuinely doesn't like the game. He may still enjoy flying. Could be interesting when Ron, Oliver and McGonogall are utterly flummoxed by Harry's refusal to take part in the silly, nonsensical broom game.

So many fics (some excellent stories mind you!) go on and on about Quidditch. Guess a bit of reversal would be nice. Also with Harry's background as a social outcast would even make sense a bit.

Bonus point if Harry likes a different sport. Maybe broom racing, broom dancing or some other "magical" sport.

Please no mpreg/bashing/huge age difference fics.


** "Quidditch? Are you insane? There's no way I'm playing that!"

Ron looked flummoxed.

"Why not?" he asked. "It wouldn't hurt to try it, and you might even like it!"

"I might also like eating your face, but you wouldn't want me to try that, would you?" Harry retorted.

"That's different!" Ron protested, as he flew besides his best friend.

"No thank you," Harry said, as he stood up on his broom. "I'll stick to broom surfing; I've almost perfected the varial heelflip, and after that, I'm going to master the psycho white boy, and then the 180 darkslide."

"Yeah, that sounds just like you," Ron said under his breath.

"You say something?" Harry asked as he tottered dangerously on his broom.

"Nothing."

** In linkffn(Harry Potter ams the game) he enjoys flying but doesn't care about quidditch and is annoyed with everyone's obsession with it. He starts to create a PokÃ©mon style competitor to the game. But that's not a major plot point.

** Well - Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, from Methods of Rationality, dislikes Quidditch but enjoys flying. However, it's a relatively minor plot point in a very large story. And quite a lot of readers hate his guts.

He is, unquestionably, nothing like Harry from canon (and there is actually an in-story reason why he's so radically different, but you have to read most of the story to find it, and since it's over half a million words, the people who don't like him often don't feel like doing that). He's arrogant, too quick to dismiss people whom he deems less intelligent, and for all his talk about rational behavior, he does a lot of dumb stuff, which does come back to bite him in the rear. He is, however, loyal and generous to his friends, and genuinely cares about making the world a better place for everyone.

If you do want to try it, I recommend [[/u/daystareld][u/daystareld]]'s [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9676374/1/Daystar-s-Remix-of-HPMOR][expanded introduction]].

*** Personally I am not a fan of that story, but thanks for pointing out. I think in the end it was revealed he isn't even Harry Potter actually, but Tom Riddle the horcrux bit. So it doesn't even qualify :D

***** Remnant maybe, like an echo. But his entire being, psyche, intelligence, desires etc. are all Tom Riddle if I recall. Heck even Marauders map shows him as Tom Riddle. If I recall correctly.
