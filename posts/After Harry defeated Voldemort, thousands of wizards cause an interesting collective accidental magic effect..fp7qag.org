When thousands of wizards all hear of the news that the war is over, they're obviously relieved and happy and all those emotions cause a disturbance in the force of magic. The result is that they accidentally send knowledge of how the war ended back in time... to 1980 where Sybill Trelawney receives it.

This closed time loop makes all possible timelines that do not end with Harry and Voldemort in a duel and a resulting national emotional overload (be it positive or negative) logically impossible, which causes all kinds of crazy coincidences that save Harry's life to go from extremely unlikely to completely certain.

Sudden Phoenix appearing just in time? Couldn't not have happened. Future Harry appearing to chase away Dementors? Very improbable to spontaneously happen, but all other timelines result in kissed Harry unable to duel Voldemort and thus have probability = 0.

Or at least this is my headcanon explanation of where prophecies and plot armor come from.


** I love the initial part of this.

Instead of prophecies being dictated by divine/otherworldly forces it being an echo sent through time by enough people in the future who witnessed it. Leaving Seer's of the past to interpret the message as best they can and try to ensure people make it there (or don't).

** Mass accidental magic triggering an instance of retrocausality in the form of prophetic information and bizarre fate manipulation?...Works for me.

As a thought; Voldemort set up a contingency plan in the event of all of his horcruxes being destroyed and his own demise, which would preserve the remains of his soul and send it back in time informed of future events (so he could hide his horcruxes better).\\
But, with this bizarre accidental charm in play created by the whole of magical Britain, Voldemort finds that no matter how successful his plans and schemes are, something will consistently spectacularly derail them at the very last second.

*** Doesn't that trap Voldemort in an eternal Groundhog Day hell?

Although he *might* be able to escape it by trying to make something else happen that makes everyone deliriously happy in /a way that fits the prophecy./

**** would work as a fic where he either slowly gives up, or one where he has already looped multiple times and is very salty about the unreasonableness of the whole thing... whining about all the crazy shit that happened to foil his victory.

and it ends with him either setting up a doomsday 'fuck you' and then undoing his timetravel-safety and walking to his death... or he could clean up after himself to some degree for a happily ever after ending (with him still dying).

** This is mostly my head canon as well, but I believe determination causes closed loops, not emotion. It isn't emotional overload that causes Time Turners to work, it's the sheer determination to exploit causality to your own ends. Most people would probably be too afraid to risk causing an unstable paradox (cowards).

So because Harry is someone who was uniquely commited to stopping Voldemort with little concern for the consequences (consider Hermione's handwringing about rules or likelihood, or Ron leaving in year 7), he was the one prophicized. Which is one reason that I don't think Neville was ever really in the running for Boy Who Lived (the other reason being Voldemort's inability to value people who did not remind him of himself). And why I don't think a similar prophecy could have been made about Dumbledore; Dumbledore didn't shoot Voldemort when he waltzed into his office, while Harry would have.

How this squares at the end is a little more ambiguous. Harry doesn't hesitate to get himself killed at the end, but he doesn't ever try the Killing Curse, and tries to caution Voldemort to have some remorse. Perhaps the whole rising from the dead thing and dramatic speech was enough to shake Voldemort's confidence and so at the critical moment, Voldemort was sort of vacillating between killing Harry and fleeing.
