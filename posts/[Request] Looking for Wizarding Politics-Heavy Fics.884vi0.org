I just finished A Maurders Plan, & I am looking for other fics that have a heavy focus on the politics of the wizarding world - Wizengamot/The Ministry, Ancient & Noble Families, etc, etc.

Thanks in Advance!


** Linkffn(11574569)

Ok so I was sceptical about this as well because it features a harem and a pretty cringy one at that and it is pretty similar to robst whom I hate. But the writing really improves by a lot and if you can stomach the haram then this is the right fic for you. Very Op Harry but I feel like it's not overdone since his enemies are also powered up.

Linkffn(11191235)

One of my favourite fics. This is so well written, I wish the author would sell his books so that I could demand more updates etc. :) Honestly if you haven't read this then you definitely missed out.

The problem with most wizengamot fics is that they often use horrible horrible cliches that just make no sense if you think about it more than 5 minutes. The first pic I recommended makes the same mistakes sometimes.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

Maybe if nobody finds out his family name in the first place. Of course, things don't always go to plan... Disclaimer: J.K Rowling owns Harry Potter. Credit to Episoph for the summary.

Betagyre's stories are heavy on the politics and old families. These are all Tomione stories, which aren't everyone's cup of tea, but I personally enjoy them a lot.

Also, these two stories by the Imaginizer, /Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux/ linkffn(11762850) and /Harry Potter and the Chrysalis/ linkffn(12278649), both feature political activism by Harry. I think it's more of a psychological story overall, though.

  Hermione has always been a warrior for the Light. But when an attempt to salvage more than a Pyrrhic victory lands her in 1944, she quickly realizes that sometimes it is best to allow a lesser evil to flourish, because defeating it only creates the conditions for a greater one to rise. With conspiracies, schemes, and difficult choices in every corner, and a charismatic young Tom Riddle who is increasingly interested in her, she will eventually have to answer the question: How much darkness and grey in him can she accept?
