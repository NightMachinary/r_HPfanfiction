  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

** Here are some really good, under-read complete ones.

linkffn(Hermione Granger And The Quest For Merlin's Blessing) is a very weird one that I enjoyed quite a bit. Reminded me a little of the Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks.

linkffn(A Serpent's Sacrifice by Gabilian) and linkffn(The Bottom of the Lake by Gabilian) are two Book 7 replacements by the same author. They originally appeared on HPFF, so they're easy to overlook.

linkffn(With Malice Aforethought by SPSmith) is another old one I like---feels more canon than the average fanfic tonally. There's a Book 7 that will probably never be finished, but this Book 6 is complete.

[[https://fp.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Years_of_Rebellion/Through_The_Looking_Glass/][Years of Rebellion]] and [[https://fp.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Last_Horcrux_final/index/][Last Horcrux]] are two very old fanfics by Full Pensieve. Years of Rebellion in particular is a post-OOTP fic that was extremely influential in its time. I love his characters and the size of his world. YOR will probably never be finished, but it's absolutely worth reading.

  Explores the close, loving friendship between Hermione and Harry mainly from Hermione's viewpoint. Is it enough to form a devoted life-partnership even if they're not romantically in love? Might their love be just as true? And if so, what could bring them together? The story is fluffy, sometimes sensual, but never smutty or crude, and, of course, has the touch of magic.

** What kind of stories are you looking for? When they're adults? When they're still at Hogwarts? What about time-travel, AU, or re-do fics? Do you want it to be canon-compliant? One-shots or longer stories? If it's the latter, how long do you prefer? Any preferences about what kind of medium you'd want to read on (i.e. [[https://FanFiction.net][FanFiction.net]], Archive of our Own, etc.)? Would you be interested in any character bashing or not? Your request is a bit vague. If you narrow it down, perhaps others will provide you with what you're looking for.
