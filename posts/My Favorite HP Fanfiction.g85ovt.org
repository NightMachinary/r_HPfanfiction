This is what I will always think of when someone suggests a Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived story done right. This story wraps up some of the worst cliches of the Harry Potter fandom and makes them work like they always could have worked. WBWL, renaming, Dark!Harry, all executed brilliantly.

The three things that mean the most to me in a fanfiction are the characters, the world building, and the ending. A good plot helps, but it's also usually something I can forgive if I get the other three. In this case, I think it handles all four.

Characters

Harry Potter's arc of mental illness from beginning to end dragged me along with it, leaving me in the same chaotic emotional haze that the character experienced from start to finish. You start out feeling the neglect of a Harry who is quiet and non-demanding, who understands that his brother is in danger and just more important than him, and it is heart breaking. Then, as he ages and the tragedies of his life continue to pile up, you feel the same growing bitterness and resentment that he feels towards the family that abandoned him. You feel almost relieved when he is taken by Death Eaters, because they at least treat him as a person. You feel his spiraling mixture of paranoia, anxiety, depression, and anger throughout his years at Hogwarts, and in the end you feel his heart break and catharsis as the last of what he cares about is taken away, but he gets to stand victorious and face his immanent death at peace. The mixture of narrative from inside Harry's head and the outside world he exists in while following tight with Harry at almost all times combined with a strong portrayal of the sort of traumatized mental issues an abused child in a world of magic would face makes it easy to lose yourself in what Harry is feeling at any time.

Luna in this story is one of my favorite portrayals of Luna in all of fanfiction. Luna is not written as crazy, or a victim, or all knowing. She is observant and gifted at detecting magic, and she loves animals and nature and is willing to believe in things she can't see. She is clever and kind, and makes mistakes.

Voldemort here is shown to be every bit of the ruthless and clever man he was implied to be before his first death. He is effortlessly powerful, proud, manipulative, and calculating. He isn't out of control or wasteful as he is shown in the original series. He is a far more threatening presence, added on to by how much Harry fears him, and simultaneously seeks his approval as a father figure. He is shown to have an understanding of human feelings and emotions, although with disgust and disdain for the idea of feeling them himself, and only the facade of empathy. He is able to manipulate Harry's emotions to get the desired behavior from him. He uses affection as a carefully metered reward, and the withdrawal of affection as a reprimand towards a boy who has never known true parental love.

James and Lily Potter are not made out to be evil or even negligent, so much as put in an impossible situation and making mistakes and some poor choices. At the same time that you feel heartbroken for Harry being treated as an afterthought, you can also empathize with his parents, who know that Death Eaters still want to kill their son, who has been a little spoiled by his wealthy family and global fame, and Harry makes it so easy to focus on the big problems because he is so quiet and deferential to what he has been brought to believe are more important things than him. It feels like a feedback loop of neglect, where Harry withdraws further because he is never given attention, and is never given attention because of his withdrawn nature. In the end, you can feel and understand Harry's anger and resentment, and you can also understand his parents.

Skylar Potter, the WBWL. First, Skylar is the worst name ever. That is where my dislike ends. What I was most suprised by, in a WBWL story, is that Skylar was never the antagonist. He was never bad, evil, malicious, or even unkind. Despite being a bit self centered and bratty as a child, again wealthy and famous, he grew to be a genuinely good person, and it was an amazing thing to include. Harry meets Skylar at Hogwarts, a new name and a new face, and is constantly wary of Skylar and resentful of him for being the favorite. But as we get glimpses of Skylar, we start to see that he is kind, selfless, brave, and in general everything canon Harry would have been plus a little more emotional wellbeing, despite the guilt of multiple deaths that he blames himself for. I did not expect to like Skylar, but I did. He ended up being a good brother and a good character.

The Basilisk has made it difficult for me to work on my own story, because in mine, the Basilisk is a fundamentally good creature, but Adalonda constantly lurks at the back of my mind, coloring the personality of every iteration of the Basilisk I read and try to create. I never expected the Basilisk to have enough personality to carry an entire story on her own, but I believe she could in this. Typically the Basilisk is written as either mindless and animalistic, obedient and disinterested, or misunderstood slave. Rarely is it treated as a character with it's own agenda, more clever and dangerous than those who command it, and so pervasively menacing.

The list goes on and on.

World Building

Coming off of the Basilisk, the lore created around the Thestrals was a beautiful and compelling addition to the world, and one I am tempted to incorporate in my own work, although it just doesn't fit. Seeing the world primarily through Harry's eyes, who has a love of animals, and occasional input from Voldemort, who is brilliant and who has decades of experience, there end up being countless opportunities created and taken to explore the nature of magical creatures, from canon creatures given new life to entirely new creatures which drive the plot to its inevitable end.

The Ending

For me, the ideal ending is what Sam describes to Frodo in Mordor near the end of Return of the King. After the characters go through hell, suffer, lose everything, are beaten to the point of giving up, that final victory and to face the end at peace makes it all worth it. Harry suffers a lot throughout this story, but I think the ending was worth it. Harry is victorious, and gets to confront his parents and make peace with his brother before his end.

Plot

The story is focused on Harry, and while the rise and fall of Lord Voldemort is the driving force behind the story, the purpose and focus is always on Harry, how he suffers, what it makes him into, and how he finally resolves himself into his own person. The story never loses track of what story its telling.

All in all, this story is probably the biggest inspiration for me to write, but also one of the biggest obstacles, because I am not sure I can capture the same emotions as this story without feeling like a cheap knockoff. I know this story won't appeal to everyone, and there are some spelling, grammar, and formatting issues that made it through proofreading, but none of that detracted from my experience or my recommendation.

If I botched the bots, please help.


** You're definitely right. Antithesis took me on a whirlwind ride of emotions. On a side note, you'd definitely find The Other Boy Who Lived by KwanLi to your liking. linkffn(4985330)

** This fanfiction. This bloody fanfiction is the first one I had years in my eyes from. It is no the last no but it was the first. I know what you mean by the basilisk and harry. I feel you with all of it. And as much as I love this fanfiction I dont believe it's one you should re read. It is hallowed I would even say as it should be remembered after the first time you read it for the emotions it brought you and the twists it took you one.

May you spread your wings and fly forevermore Luna may you find all the creatures you always wished to find

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point.Skylar is the boy who lived, that's why he's important.

I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?

** Oh yeah. By far one of the best stories I have ever read- and your review of it was great! I can't remember how I found it, but I am so grateful that I did. I'm very surprised that it's not mentioned more on here, it's literally everything a fan fiction should be. And I totally agree with you about Skylar lol, that name annoyed me so much. I'm from England and I have never met anyone called Skylar, but eventually I ignored it. But yeah, just an amazing book, practically perfect in my eyes!

**** Ahaha that's a fine example as to why you don't like the name. Yeah, it's so weird, I really expected it to been mentioned more. I'm not usually one to cry at books or films, but I defo did, like three times in antithesis. I am so jealous of the author's ability to write a work of art like that
