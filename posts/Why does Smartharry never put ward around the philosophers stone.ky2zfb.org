In fanfics where they make Harry super powerful and smart he pretty much always comments on how Dumbledore could make the philosophers stone more protected or how he shouldn't mention it to the students, so my question is why doesn't Harry just put up notice me not wards?


** Because the writers just want an excuse to piss on Dumbledore, they're not nearly smart enough to write a really smart smart!Harry

*** Dumbledore is just a stand in for whatever teacher gave the author detention in those fics anyway

** White I agree with the other two doylistically, I'd also say that (in-world, anyway) him doing it himself would be pointless. Indy!Harry wants to teach Dumbledore that he's an idiot and could do better, so Harry setting up wards would be like your teacher just sighing and doing the maths problems for you instead of getting you to do it.

** If I were Dumbledore I would've put the stone in my underwear drawer but I'm not so yeah
