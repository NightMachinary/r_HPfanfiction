:END:
For a fic rattling around in my head... Summer of 5th year, Dobby works at Hogwarts. If Harry was at a park in Surrey(basically not on Hogwarts grounds), and calls Dobby, who doesn't work for him, would Dobby appear? Has a situation like this happened in the books? Where Dobby appeared when Harry called even though Harry's not his master/employer?


** I think it as he can call for Dobby or any Elf he knows the name of, but if the Elf is not bonded to him it is up to the Elf to decide whether or not to answer. Dobby being Dobby would pretty much always accept if Harry calls him.

*** That's very helpful. I know I shouldn't make a big deal out of such a trivial piece of the story in my head but I don't like breaking any established rules of the HP world. Thanks!

** If Harry can summon Kreacher at Hogwarts I see no reason why he wouldn't be able to summon Dobby when he is away from Hogwarts. I'm sure Dobby is listening fervently. üòä

*** Thank you for the reply. Question, wasn't Harry Kreacher's master anyway, since Sirius left everything to Harry after his death?

**** Harry was able to call Kreacher and Dobby in HBP when he was in the hospital wing. So he was able call Kreacher despite the distance and the fact that Kreacher was outside of Hogwarts while Harry was inside. Dobby also answered Harry's call despite the fact that Harry wasn't his master.

***** Thank you for the response. I think I was just hung up on the fact that in my scenario Harry isn't on Hogwarts grounds so I wasn't sure if Dobby would hear him.

*** That's different: since the summer after DoM, when he got the Black's inheritance, he IS the Master of bonded Kreacher.

*** That's good enough for me and if I write this fic, I think others will agree as well :) Thanks!

**** Yeah, Dobby was always fond of Harry so it would work (he woke Harry up ten minutes before the 2nd task started in book 4, after all). Harry (JK) should have taken more advantage of this.

** I'd assume it would be up to Dobby to respond or not, unless you assume that the ‚Äúbonding‚Äù of wizard and elf is what actually makes the call and response work.

*** But if elves could listen when someone calls them no matter where they are....

You could name elves important keywords, order them to write down when and where they are mentioned then you could effectively eavesdrop on the entire world!

**** Well unless the person saying the word has to actually be calling for the elf. For instance if an elf was named ‚ÄúPaper‚Äù and you wanted them to come to you you would have to already know the elf or know of the elf or say the name Paper with the intent of calling the elf.

** Yes. Technically, Harry is not Dobby's Master (‚ÄúDobby is free elf!‚Äù), but exactly because he has no master, he is kind of free agent, and he always kind of considers Harry to be his master anyway. And yes, it is canonical, in HBP Harry does call him to help him with his following Draco Malfoy.
