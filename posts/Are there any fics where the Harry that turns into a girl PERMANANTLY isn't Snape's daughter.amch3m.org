  Harry Potter is not like other boys. He's not even like other wizards. Everyone thinks they know the real Harry, but they're wrong. He has a secret even his friends Ron and Hermione don't know about, a secrets that he fears they would never understand or accept about him. But he may have found someone who understands and accepts him completely; someone who shares his secret. (AU)

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** In the fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4606270/1/Effects-and-Side-Effects][Effects and Side-effects]] which is set immediately after the Department of Mysteries battle, Voldie commands Draco to force-feed Harry a potion that will allow him to retrieve the piece of soul in Harry's scar along with most of Harry's magic in order to give himself a massive boost. However, Harry manages to reverse the magic-drain, but a side-effect of the potion leaves Harry female.

The fic is 400K+ words long and has a large amount of world-expansion, but is unfortunately on Hiatus/dead since it hasn't updated since 2015.

  Harry felt he had lost his chance at family after watching Sirius fly away only for his godfather to show up during the summer. Sirius teaches Harry what he needs to know, helping him become the true Lord Potter. Then the Tri-Wiz comes and the deepest, darkest secret of the Marauders is revealed - Harry was born the daughter of Lily and Sirius. Eventual Fem!HarryxTonks
