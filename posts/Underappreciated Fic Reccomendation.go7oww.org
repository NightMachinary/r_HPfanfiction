As I have had an /unexpected/ amount of free time these past three months, I have read rather a lot of fanfics- some bad, some utterly amazing.

I wanted to share this one with you all- somehow it only has 439 reviews, but is part 1/7 of an epic next-generation saga involving Albus Potter. I won't spoil it for you, but all 7 fics are now complete, and I feel this needs a little more love!

The spell backfired, the cave collapsed, Harry beat the basilisk, and now they've returned to the school with a stunned Lockhart no one is quite sure what to do with. Enter a newly unpetrified Hermione Granger. Not only did the ponce try to attack her Harry, he LIED in a BOOK...

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

** Linkffn(Coven by Naidhe): Hermione messes around with dark magic and befriends Pansy. Has a very nice scene where Pansy discovers that muggles have gotten quite advanced.

Linkffn(The Imposter Complex by Notus Oren): A different Diary Tom tries to fight against Voldemort. Written in first person like this one.

Linkffn(Exile by bennybear): Draco Malfoy's life after the War ended. He gets a job at a library and learns biology.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water by Starfox5): Possibly the most absurd ship in the entire fandom. Literally.

Linkffn(A Wizard's Guide to 'Banking' by Bakuraptor): Genetics + Polyjuice + inventive muggleborns = great story.

Linkffn(Voldemort's Bad Day by Diresquirrel): Aside from paved streets, photography, the wireless, and the Hogwarts Express, what have muggles ever given us?

Linkffn(In the Bleak Midwinter by TheLoud): Time-traveling Hermione and a very clever Tom Riddle Sr. having adventures in the roaring 20s.

** NoahPhantom's pretty well-known (and well-regarded), at least by next-gen standards.

Here are some even more obscure, but quality, next-gen fics.

linkffn(Lion, Eagle, Badger, Snake) - good, pasty, English school fare

linkffn(The Chronicle of Halo Wiggins) - also good, pasty, English school fare but it gets brilliant towards the end of the first book.

Today someone recommended linkffn(Fabula Post Bellum) and it's far better than I'd remembered. Also next-gen.

  Slytherin House isn't what it used to be. There are barely enough children to fill a classroom, let alone a House Table, and the Quidditch captain is a muggle-born fourth year. For a new generation starting at Hogwarts as the war drifts into memory, there's far more to learn about the four Houses than they could ever have imagined (prequel to Snake Bites).

But all is not what it seems for young Harry, who must learn the secrets behind his unusual abilities. At least everything will be fine when he gets to Hogwarts... won't it? NEXT-GEN

  CHAPTER 28 UP! Winter settles over Hogwarts, and the flurry of happenings that accompanied the autumn months has, for better or worse, gone nearly silent. But all is not well at the wizarding school - and the key to restoring the small society to its former health may, in fact, lie with those it has cast away...

** linkffn(God of Death: Black Beginning) is by far one of my favorites that I never see recommended. This fic alone is what made me fall in love with the character of Barty Crouch Jr, and it inspires a lot of what I write

A great PeggySue!Ron fic. It's the most unique Time Travel fic I've ever read thus far. It's still in year one but the word count is only 62k (and that's counting pre-Hogwarts chapters!) so I can tell this won't be long-winded.

  Ron died saving Fred at the Battle of Hogwarts. But a twist of fate grants Ron the chance to go back in time to save as much lives as he could. Nobody said it will be easy, but with the help of a new sense of purpose, by Merlin will Ronald Weasley try. *The Second Wizarding War & Year One*

** Slightly different than most of what's suggested here:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] ... all seven years (now eight stories, I believe) of the life of a Dudley's-magical-daughter. By far the best (and most different from normal, because she is just much more than just that) of the trope.

- Stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][mzzbee]] ... the most unique pairing of all normal ones (i.e., excluding The Giant Squib), and very different from most other fanfiction stories you know.
