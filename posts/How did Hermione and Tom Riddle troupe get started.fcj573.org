I've seen a lot of Hermione and Tom Riddle fanfiction and I just wasn't sure of why authors pair them together. It seems like the obvious pairing would be Ginny and Tom Riddle because of the diary connection? (I could also just be 100% biased though)


** A couple of reasons:

Hermione is the most popular female author-avatar character, somewhat equivalent to Harry in that regard.

This is partly because many female fans identify with her introverted bookworm persona, and partly because she's the most central female character in the books. Consequently, when people want to ship Tom Riddle with a female character without making it a blatant self-insert, Hermione is the go-to choice.

Secondly, many people prefer to ship Tom Riddle with someone who would be his intellectual equal, who could challenge his ideas and help him grow as a person.

Hermione is a logical choice in that regard because the books show that she is intelligent, driven, and occasionally ruthless. Ginny isn't as popular to ship because she's usually portrayed as less intellectual. Fanfic authors typically write her as a tomboy or a bit of a jock, and/or a little girl with a princess complex. Also, Hermione grew up amidst muggles before learning about magic, granting her a few more paralels to Tom, whereas Ginny grew up knowing that she was magical and a pureblood. Thus, Ginny doesn't have as much in common with Tom and shipping them is less intuitive.

Also, it doesn't help that Chamber of Secrets showed Tom mostly being disgusted/annoyed by his Diary interaction with Ginny. An author who wanted to ship them would have to invent a backstory in which Tom was lying about his true feelings in the Chamber, or show that Ginny later grew into someone Tom could admire, etc. It takes more character development/revisionism compared to the HG/TMR ship, which is one reason the ship is less popular.

*** Thanks for taking the time to answer! What you're saying makes a lot of sense, I hadn't thought of it from that view point before.

I do love hermione in the books and she is a dynamic character. I think I have a hard time with hermione-ships in fanfiction in general because the ones I have read portray hermione as this perfect woman who just does everything right and she almost becomes more of a one dimensional character because of that.

Maybe I need to try again and find a better story to read.

**** To be honest I've seen fics that fall on either side. Some HG/TMR fics portray her as preternaturally intelligent, always uber prepared, and thus able to easily get the upper hand in her battle of wits/hearts against Tom. Others make the mistake of dumbing her down to less than what she was in the books, making her fall prey to simple manipulation and often driven by hormones to do things that are obviously wrong.

It's rare to find fics that balance in between those two extremes, but I enjoy reading the stories that do.

I haven't read many Ginny/Tom fics, and the few I did try didn't strike my fancy. I would like to see what the better examples might be. Do you know of any you would recommend?

***** Do you have any fics you'd recommend?

I have read some good ones of Ginny/Tom. Usually the theme is Ginny develops an interest dark arts and blurs the lines of good/bad. I need to go back and see if I can find them

Unfortunately the only one I recall in any detail was not one I'd recomend. It involved some creepy noncon elements, abduction, pregnancy, and Tom routinely calling Ginny his princess.

******** Oh in that case, here are a few that I've enjoyed. In my opinion these all do a decent job portraying Hermione as intelligent but also balanced by believable flaws.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/][Birds of a Feather]] - Hermione is born in Tom Riddle's generation. They become friends before they get their Hogwarts letters. linkao3(15996890)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12157995/1/Tom-Just-Tom][Tom Just Tom]] - While struggling with PTSD after the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione buys a pet snake which turns out to be more than she bargained for. linkffn(12157995)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10643571/][Blood and Gold]] - Hermione travels back in time intending to prevent Tom Riddle's birth, but an accident strands her much later than she planned. linkao3(10643571)

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy in an orphanage who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms between them---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend".But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle.1930's-40's Childhood Friends AU.

  The true time-turner was slammed savagely into Hermione's throat. It shattered against her neck, bits of glass and gold piercing into her skin. The last thing she saw before blackness consumed her was a plume of metallic dust and vitreous fragments, tiny prisms dancing behind her eyelids. (In which Hermione accidentally ends up in 1950, pitted against an ascending Dark Lord in his prime, caught in the entanglement of pureblood politics, dark magic, and Tom Riddle's interest)
