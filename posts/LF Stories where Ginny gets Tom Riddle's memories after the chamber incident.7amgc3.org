There are many stories where Harry gains Tom Riddle's memories after the chamber incident. Are there any where Ginny gains them instead?


** That's actually a pretty interesting idea. Of course, she could only get fifteen-year-old Riddle memories, not Voldemort's full memories as Harry can thanks to the Scar-Horcrux, so that would be less of a way to OPness than for Harry... but I could definitely see such a premise work out really well in the right hands.

*** I imagine 15 year old Riddle could beat the avarage non-auror in a duel, he was already pretty strong by then

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345), she had a 16 years old Tom's complete memory.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), she seemed to have only partial powers such as Parselmouth and Legilimency.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!
