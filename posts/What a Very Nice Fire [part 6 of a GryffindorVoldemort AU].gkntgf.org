** I read it till *According to His Own Nature*,and I really really like it.

My only negative point I read, is the the way you kept the "Death Eater" name for Riddle's association, As a violent Gryffindor Revolutionary, Champion of the other magical Races, Muggleborn and Halfblood|breed, Being called Knight of Walpurgis (The original name) would sound and look much better.

Anyway! Kept it up, nice Rec.

*** The "Death Eater" name actually fits perfectly with Riddle's avowed goals and methods in his conversation with Dumbledore in part 2 of the series.

*** What [[/u/chiruochiba]] said, but also, I didn't think that "Knights" of /Anything/ worked well for a guy whose movement is about tearing down the aristocracy and so forth.

(It's a shame, too, because I'd have otherwise salvaged "Knight of Walpurgis" to be an "Order of Merlin" sort of deal later on)

**** True, but Death Earter doesn't really look good for the people wanting to rebuild a better and more fair order|society, sure the term appeals to Tom's philosophy but it also need to work with the population. To put it with irony "Death Eaters" doesn't feel Family friendly ^{^}

***** During most of the stories, the Death Eaters aren't (publicly) part of the main movement. They have a scary name in part /because/ it's scary, because Riddle is trying to present himself as The Reasonable One.

From /Having the Right Enemies/:

  "If you brought me here to talk about Death Eater demands, then we won't get anywhere. You're speaking with a moderate, Leach, the sort of friendly face that you'll need to keep the Death Eaters from nipping at your heels. I have nothing to do with that organization, as I have said on numerous occasions in the past."

** Your fic is incredible. The writing is exceptional and I love the originality of curses/spells and exploration of magical ideas. It feels like a logical extension of the HP world rather than just a redo of the rules.

I'm about halfway through and loving it.

That bowel scene was kinda fucked up but in a good way.
