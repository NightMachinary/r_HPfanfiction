** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867): Year 6 from Ginny's POV, very well written. This is the story that got me interested in HP fanfictions.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]], linkffn(11419408): IMO the best Year 7 Hogwarts story, fully canon-compliant.

** Linkffn(Not From Others)

DH from Ginny's pov, canon-compliant, amazingly well-written. Harry/Ginny isn't the forefront of the story, considering Harry's gone for most of it, but it's still a wonderful representation of their relationship.

If Ginny doesn't grow on you after reading this, you may just not be destined to like her.

[Edit] Just saw it's already been mentioned, but yeah. Read it.

** Since Ginny is my favorite character, I'm always interested in why some people don't like or care for her. So OP, why don't you like her?

It might help determine which type of fic you'd go for. But if you're main issue is we just don't know enough about her, then Not From Others, as others have mentioned, is the go to fic if you want to feel like you're still reading canon-Ginny.

*** I dunno. I guess I like her character. But I've never liked her for Harry. She just wasn't in the books enough, you know? When you stick with Harry for 7 straight books, then have him pair up with someone who really didn't get that much attention in the books, it's just meh. Maybe that made me dislike her even though her character itself is fine?

**** I think that makes complete sense.

Rowling intended for there to be a lot of subtle build up between the two so that when Ginny actually got significant page time, it would feel natural. But I think the clues were a bit too "blink and you miss it." so lots of people feel she came out of nowhere as this fully-formed, perfect for Harry character with no development to get to that point. I'd disagree but do understand that viewpoint.

It's actually easy to explain why she is actually perfect for Harry on paper, but I agree that when don't actually see them interact much as a couple, it makes it hard to form a solid opinion on them together. Now compare that to Harry and Hermione. We see them interact as friends countless times, but those interactions also show why they wouldn't work as a couple.

Yeah, I'm one of them. I know there was a ton of development for her, we just never really saw it. I think it would have been neat for Harry to maybe spend some time comforting Ginny (totally platonically as they were like 12/13 at the time) after the events in the Chamber. Maybe Ginny doing the same after the graveyard, you know since they've both had direct contact with Voldemort. I'm sure I'd love her if she showed up more in every book. I don't necessarily think canon Hermione and canon Harry would be a /great/ match if even a good one (Although I don't like Ron and Hermione more :P), but the experience and chemistry Harry & Hermione have is something that I'd want between Ginny and Harry.

Them comforting each other after the Chamber/graveyard, maybe Ginny taking up the role of Ron after Ron ditches Harry in the fourth book. Dunno where she'd fit in in the PoA (Harry playing quidditch with her maybe?), etc etc.

****** I remember reading a defence of Harry/Ginny in which was mentioned the fact that the books often use quite flattering language when describing Ginny for instance in CoS when Ginny blushes it's described as /her cheeks glowing like a sunset/.

Because the books are all from Harry's POV we're meant to just absorb these flattering descriptions as hints that Harry, at least subconsciously, finds Ginny attractive. I'm sorry but that's just a little too subtle for me.
