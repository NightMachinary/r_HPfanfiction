** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) An AU where Voldemort won the first war (He is more sane and reasonable than in canon so his wizarding society actually works out fairly well) Snape does not cause Lily's death and is thus more well adjusted as a result and does get together with someone else.

#+begin_quote
  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. Rating & Genres may change later.

** Check out linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville)! Great characterization for Snape and is one of the only fics I've read where 11 year old Harry behaves sufficiently childlike. The Snape pairing (not slash, but I won't spoil it for you) is really well done. And it has a completed sequel!

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** In the /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Re-]]/ trilogy (/Resonance, Revolution, Resolution/; (1,713,423 WL in total; abandoned), after the circumstances force (IIRC) Snape to become Harry's guardian, he gradually mellows out, somewhat.

Later he gets acquainted with a regular witch (OC), and eventually their relationship becomes strong enough to make the story suitable for your request. The trilogy isn't a fast-paced one, but usually when it's taking its time it's for the sake of realistic character development and not just for stretching out chapters and word count.

So whether or not you'll enjoy it depends on your reaction to the slow pacing, I guess.
