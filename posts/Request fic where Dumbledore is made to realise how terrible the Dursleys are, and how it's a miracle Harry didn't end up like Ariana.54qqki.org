Because mentioning Ariana would definitely give Dumbledore a large enough shock for him to see how bad the situation was.


** You know, I think my MC might actually go this route now in my story.

I was planning on having him draw parallels between Harry's upbringing and Voldemort's, but considering that said MC is a young Tom Riddle freshly free of the Diary after eating my SI's foreknowledge and is now gleefully trying to ruin Albus's everything... this seems like a much better way to twist the knife.

***** Question, is Dumbledore in this actually a meddler/manipulative or is Tom's point of view on him just super biased because of the part of him that's from the diary horcrux? So far it seems like you are setting up the latter, which would be an interesting change to the typical trope. But I am not far enough to tell.

****** Tom is super biased.

Dumbledore's actions will, I hope, seem reasonable.

Edit: That's not to say that Dumbledore isn't going to meddle or do manipulative things. He IS a politician after all. But he's not a mustache twirling twit. As Albus's understanding of who/what Tom is grows, you can expect to see Albus try and "guide" him towards fighting Voldemort. This seems reasonable to me because it's very quickly going to become apparent that when Tom lack anything else to do he'll throw a spanner at either Albus or canon just to watch the fireworks.

Edit2: If you've read my other story, Blood and Chaos, then Tom will have a working relationship with Albus similar to the one that Jack has with Buffy.

******* Yeah I have no problem with Dumbledore not being a perfect saint who is 100% moral in all of his actions to an unrealistic degree. As mentioned he is a politician and is fighting a war. It's when people make him cartoonishly evil that I dislike. I generally nope out of fics if he knew Sirius was innocent and let him rot anyway, or in general wanted harry to be mistreated by the dursleys, rather than thinking he needed the blood protection for his safety and not realizing how bad the environment there was.

Anyway your fic seems good so far. Haven't read the other one, might give it a shot, but while I've seen the show I haven't read any Buffy FF before.

***** Ignoring the delusions of Petunia Dursley, Harry Hunting is probably the closest analog to what we know Ariana's incident. Namely, a group of muggle children (IIRC in Ariana's case) beating up a wizarding child. Obviously Dudley and Co. either never carried it as far as the ones that broke Ariana did, or Harry was simply more resilient. Possibly both.

From the vantage point of intentionally horrifying Albus though, the similarities are definitely there if a character wanted to paint it that way.

******* There is a difference between wrestling and an attack. Harry is so scared of Harry Hunting that it prompts accidental apparation. I mean hell, it happens frequently enough that there is a NAME for the activity. That isn't 'normal' behavior for children.

As far as how the Dursley's treat Harry? He is an abused child. We know this is true. He's with-held food, he's with-held affection, he's confined to small spaces. He's treated like garbage and gas-lit by his family, and his image is desparaged enough that the locals all see him as a criminal hoodlum. Physical abuse isn't mentioned in the novels, but it wouldn't be absurd for it to happen in light of the other types of abused that are occuring.

This isn't true. Accidental magic doesn't just happen when you fear for your life.

I never said Harry wasn't abused, I said it is constantly exaggerated. The entire basis for the super!abusive!Dursleys comes from PS and CoS, which are the same books that bring us manipulative!Dumbledore. They're children's fairytail fantasy. The downtrodden orphan who is more than he appears he a staple of the genre.

However it doesn't make sense with Harry character. Harry is not an abused kid, I mean ignore what you know, or think you know about the Dursleys and examine the character.

********* Not all accidental magic is triggered by fear but we know this particular one was trigger by harry's desire to get away from dudleys gang.

I would argue that book 3 has similiar themes as well with the situation that occurred with Marge, but your point is valid in that the novels, as written, do not have abuse of Harry as a relevant theme. That said, the evidence is enough that it isn't really a stretch for a fanfiction author to explore those themes.

The novels are written for a young adult audience which means a number of things are going to be true: 1.All adults are either incompetent, incapable or evil, because if adults were competent and good, they would solve the problems and the hero wouldn't be the kid.\\
2. The main character is going to be relatable to the majority of people reading the book, because they will function as a stand in for the reader in many ways.

Harry in the books doesn't show near the level of reaction to his upbringing that we know is true, so using his behavior as evidence that the Dursley's didn't do something isn't really evidence. Harry makes friends fairly easily, he isn't afraid of touching, he doesn't cave to authority. While not all people that suffer emotional and psychological abuse react the same, they very rarely are going to be a normal kid. But he needs to be a normal kid to make thevstorybwork, and his family needs to be evil for the fairy tale to work.

Tl;dr:there is enough evidence for the story to work if someone wants it to.

The Dursley's are bad people and harry gets to go on magical adventures and escape them, then it turns out they are so bad and the magical adventures aren't so good. The specifics of what make the Dursley's bad aren't important and thus not explored.

Honestly I've wanted to read a fanfiction where someone retells the series through the eyes of adults and shows how Harry isn't lying so much as his perceptions are heavily biased.

************ A fic I'm writing sort of does that. Harry has an accident in the time room during OotP and get sent back to the '80s, but I'm using the canon time travel logic, a closed loop. It means Harry, and Dumbledore, already know what happens all the way up to '96 when he goes back. I've been having a lot of fun with the two of them trying to figure out when to interfere, and how they respond to things they can't change.

That sounds like a lot of fun, and isn't something I've seen before. I especially like the implied debate over what they can and can't change. I expect there will be plenty of moments like with the dementors/patronus in book 3 where what Harry thought was happening the first loop and what we see actually happens in the second loop are very different?

*********** I think the "problem" is that the series jumps from beings kids books to a more adult audience as you go. Trying to judge the events of the earlier books the way you would the later ones makes for a lot of "Wait... what?" moments.

It's not as clear cut and dry as a lot of folks make things out to be on either side of the argument, but I think it's fair to say that neither way of looking at things /contradicts/ canon.
