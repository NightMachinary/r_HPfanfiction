Hi guys. A while ago, I came over a HP fanfic in Year 1. The story shown an idea of HP and crew asked for help after the troll incident.

I'd like to find this story. Can you guys help me in this?

Thanks


** /The vague is strong in this one./

You're going to have to come up with more details if you want anyone to take the request seriously.

Who helped them? What made that story stick in your brain? How long was it? Were there only a few chapters or had it been going for a while?

** I remember a few details in this fanfic - The story is dropped - The entire school (roughly) support each other to make the attempt - A banner read "Help us" was used, support by firework (courtesy of the Weasley twin) - Headmaster Dumbledore was able to shut them down, but not before the message got to the Hogemead village - Aurors were called to the school, and as they say "shit hit the fan"
