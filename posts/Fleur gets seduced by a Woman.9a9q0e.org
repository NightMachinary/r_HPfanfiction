If possible, stay in Canon (i accept AU), so she is Married with Bill (or atleast loves him) and actually hetero. Whether the other Woman is also a Veela and uses her magic on Fleur or dosing her with Love Potion doesnt matter.


** Wait, I'm confused. If she's hetero she's not going to be seduced by any woman... because, she's hetero.

Are you looking for "raped by a woman"?

******* I mean, for sure there's a strong genetic component to sexual attraction, but there's certainly room for environment to influence this in the formative years. Also, women tend to be a bit bisexual in nature, and even though it's all Fanon, I have a hard time believing a race of explicitly sexual beings who have (evolved? Been created?) for seduction and sex would be repulsed by F/F.

And i NEVER wrote, that the other Woman has Sex with her, i just wrote "seduce". After your describing: if a Hetero Man enters a Gay Bar to have a Drink (because they are good there or the music) and a fellow gets attracted to him, the simple attempt to flirt with him is Rape.

****** A heterosexual woman can't be seduced by a woman, that means she's bisexual. Trying to seduce is not the same as seducing, and it's not the same as rape. You said using magic or potions to seduce, which pretty much everyone on this sub considers to be rape because it makes them do what the caster wants.

******** Again. pretty much everyone on this sub thinks that using love potions is very rapey, even in the books. It was used, and it was rapey. Nothing you've said in that comment is wrong, it's definitely frowned upon by the sub to use love potions to rape / molest / "seduce" people against their will, which means that fics that use that as its basic premise are also rapey.

********** What does a love potion do besides sexually harass people? It takes control over them and gives them uncontrollable infatuation for the brewer. You're taking the "any spell can be dark magic" route which everyone goes through before realizing that it's dumb. Incarcerous isn't rapey unless it's used to rape. Love potions /only/ do rapey things.

​

the same goes for the Imperio. THe Caster can order its Victim to show serious affection AND...of course, it takes over full control.

​

​

I didnt said anything of the above. I only stated that any Spell, that can Cause harm, CAN be used to "torture" the Victim and "persuade" it to love the Caster (mindbreak, manipulation, hypnotism). Dark Magic is, if the Caster has to make a sacrifice for it to be fullfilled. The "Common" Spells, tat i stated, arent clearly in that Class. But they can used for for i already mentioned.

************ Using those spells to do rapey things is rapey, but that doesn't make the spells rapey. The Imperious Curse is an unforgivable for good reason. Comparing love potions to the Imperious in order to show how love potions aren't so bad really does the opposite. Your definition of Dark Magic is noncanon and not really a popular fanon one either. In my fanon, Dark Magic is any magic that's primary purpose is to do bad things with. That way, Wingardium Leviosa isn't dark because you can hit someone with a club, but the eye exploding curse is because all it does is explode your eyes. I'd even say that things like Stupefy are a bit dark because they cause you to instantly go unconscious. if there wasn't a simple counter-curse, it would probably be on the same level as other dark magic.

BOTH Things let the User take "control" over its victim and if someone is crazy enough, s/he could use the Imperious as a better solution, because the Potion needs to be brewed and consumed regularly (Remember Dumbledore asked Harry what Merope could have used to Bind Riddle to her Love? Harry thought about the Potion AND the Imperious. Both have been possible). For each there is a Countermeasure. The Potion (as any other) needs a antidote/Cure and the Imperious need a strong mind and Willpower of the Victim. Barty Jr. managed to free himself because his hate of his Father strengthened its Will...and maybe because Sr got lesser acurate because he thought that his Son would stay ever as this loyal.

​

For the other unforgivables: you can trap your Victim in a Hidden Place and torture it with the Crucio or kill it with the KC, if it doesnt love you.

​

Ok, Dark Magic doesnt maybe need a Sacrifice anytime (define "Sacrifice" as Voldemort needed Blood of Harry, surely the Dark Lord was perfectly fine in offering it, unlike Harry. Oh and not to Forget his Fathers Bones, im sure Voldy didnt mind at all in giving those to strengthen himself, his cared nothing about his Father at all). But atleast Dark Magic isnt Cureable, shown by the other examples. Sectumsempra, the Twin lost its Ear, not reparable. Malfoy would have dies, if Snape hadnt managed to heal him.

​

The Process of Creating a Horcrus IS Dark Magic (as Hermione and Dumbledore confirm). Voldemort suffered alot, if he suffered at all, but if it was to become immortal, he was very willing to pay the price.

​

So, if Dark Magic doesnt mean to sacrifice anything of the performer, please correct me. Just his Reviving Ceremony wasnt of any real Loss, because Voldemort absolutely didnt care for other Peoples (his Father, Harry, Wormtail) sacrifices.
