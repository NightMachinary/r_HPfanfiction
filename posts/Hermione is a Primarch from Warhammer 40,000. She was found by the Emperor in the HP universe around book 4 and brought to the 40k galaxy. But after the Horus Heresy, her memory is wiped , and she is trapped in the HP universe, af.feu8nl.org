*** They are. Besides being larger, faster, stronger, and smarter than any normal human could hope to be, they are also supposed to be supremely charismatic. Something we know poor Hermione is not.

**** Also, her powers were on a kind of 'activation lock', since the Emperor wanted her to earn her powers, just as He Himself did.

**** Her powers were taken from her by Magnus the Red. Also, a female Primarch has been in demand lately.

** That would not be well received. Canonically all the Primarchs were men and the reason there were no female Space Marines I suspect, is due to the differing chromosomes between the Emperor and a female.

*** He's a bloody God-like genius. You think changing one cromosome because, He, for whatever reason, desires a daughter(Perhaps he had one once upon a time?) is at all difficult? Besides, it's fanfiction, man. It's meant to be cheesy/stupid.
