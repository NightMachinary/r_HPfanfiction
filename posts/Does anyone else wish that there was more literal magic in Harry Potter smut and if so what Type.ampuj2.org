I wouldn't mind some sort of sexually cursed Items they could be pretty fun. You have like five places were a Harry or Fem!harry could run into them by accident.

Borgen and Burkes Dureing second when Harry ends up there or six when hermione does in.

Grimmauld place in five year or Dureing the Hocrux hunt

The room of requirement in the Room of hidden things

And the Lestrange vault when getting the Hocrux

There is also like time in the train in six year but prefer the idea of the Cursed items being more of an accident.

What sort of magic or sexually Cursed Items would you find interesting?


** Honestly you would think that Magical hookers would have tons and tons of polyjuice potion ready. Polyjuice allows them to participate in the industry regardless of their own physical beauty and it allows the customer to tailor his own experience.

According to economics this allows a huge market because it completely eliminates a significant barrier of entry, being personal beauty. Now, the only factor left is having a supply of polyjuice. This creates a secondary market for hookers needing polyjuice from potions shops. This large demand incentivizes potion shops to accrue and mass-produce a large quantity of those products. This would in turn completely reduce the cost of poly-juice ingredients. Now, according to the determinants of supply this would increase the number of sellers greatly and temporarily decrease the price until the demand for sex in the Wizarding world increases to match market equilibrium.

Now you have a world where GOOD sex is affordable and everyone is doing it!

*** One problem is that there could very well be a limit on how available you can reasonably make polyjuice potion. Mass production may not be viable at all.

**** I am sure that there is a way to make Polyjuice Potion permanent, after all If it happened to Hermione by accident in second year, I am sure a potion master could make it permanent on purpose.

The only thing that crossed my mind would be that it could be abused by dark wizards, by doing something like make a Polyjuice Potion that can transform muggles and then Kidnapping them and Polyjuiceing them into harry's form and then playing there own much darker version of harry Hunting. were the Let the Polyjuiced muggle lose in Knockturn alley and then compete in hunting them down.

It was a fluke and turned her into something she didn't want to be, not to mention that we don't know whether or not there would be any health concerns if it was left as is. I'm not saying a permanent polyjuice isn't possible, but I really doubt it's anywhere near as easy as just hiring a potion master to work on it.

Then there's still the possibility that a perfected permanent polyjuice might be obscenely expensive.

Who's to say this sort of thing doesn't happen already? Not just with Harry, but with anyone. There could very well be a horrifically dark underworld to wizard society, and that scenario is just one of a great many possibilities. I mean, how hard would it be for some sick wizard to kidnap a third world tribal muggle child and keep them dosed with amortentia and (if they're rich enough) polyjuice?

Though I kind of doubt that Knockturn is lawless enough that a full on manhunt and torture session could go down without notice. Seems much more likely they'd use their own estate or just the wilderness somewhere.

******** this feels more like something for a Auror crime novel than something that could be considered erotic.

Like an older Harry, Fem!Harry or Tonks infiltrating and bring down the dark side of the Wizard sex industry.

*** I can't remember which fic it was, but in one of them a time-travel or SI confronts Snape with someone along the lines of "I know why you order so much boomslang skin" basically threatening to out him for his side-gig brewing polyjuice and stealing student hairs for wizard brothels.

** Nature of sex and sexuality really is under explored in fanfiction.

The various hi-jinks that can be accomplished with mutable forms (transfiguration), conjured toys, and various performance enhancers should affect societal views of such things in some interesting ways.

As for cursed objects, they'd probably be more creepy than sexy. Tracking/surveillance spells to track who the cursed individual is with and possibly harm them, or 'grooming' spells that cause feelings of disgust when feeling attraction to anyone other than the chosen target, when looking at the subjects chosen 'love' they may get hit with a cheering charm or something. There are also the classics such as spells that cause miscarriage, impotency or increased potency.

*** The thining that got me thinking about cursed objects was [[http://www2.adult-fanfiction.org/forum/topic/67668-femharry-and-the-magical-clit-box/?tab=comments#comment-422768][this]] challenge on the forums of adult fanfiction.

I see a sexually cursed object would be a good opener like. say A Fem!Harry gets cursed by a sexually cursed object and then ends up going to the weasly twins for Help and as payment for helping her and not telling anyone she agrees to test there new line of sexual products.

The cursed object could be as complex as the one in the challenge to as simple a set of enchanted nipple clamps that the user can't take off them selfs.

Edit: or [[http://www2.adult-fanfiction.org/forum/topic/66316-femdom-orgasm-denial-curse/][this challenge as well]]

*** Well yeah, cursed objects aren't going to be sexy, they're going to be some degree of horrible. Enchanted is what you call the good magical objects.

** Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes Patented Daydream Charm could probably have some interesting uses. dream magic in general would probably have some erotic uses.

You could do an erotic story were every chapter is Fem!harry or harry trying out a Different daydream scenario for the twins to sell at their shop.
