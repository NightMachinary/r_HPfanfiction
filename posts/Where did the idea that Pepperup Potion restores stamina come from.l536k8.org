It's a potion to cure the common cold, but I'm seeing more and more examples of it being used to restore stamina after an intense training session or battle.


** I guess because people can't keep the idea of two different potions in their heads. "Pepper-up" sounds like something that would pep you up, when in fact it's the Invigoration Draught (a fifth year potion) that gives you energy.

*** Pepper-up also sounds more HP magic-y than invigoration draught

**** Really? It always sounded like a soft drink to me. Like someone mixed 7up with Dr. Pepper.

** It's mentioned only twice in the books (I'd have sworn it came up more often).

From book 2:

#+begin_quote
  Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her Pepperup Potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward.
#+end_quote

From book 4:

#+begin_quote
  Madam Pomfrey had gone to rescue Ron from Percy's clutches; she led him over to Harry and the others, gave him a blanket and some Pepperup Potion, then went to fetch Fleur and her sister.
#+end_quote

So it looks like it's not just to cure colds, but to warm people up in general.

*** That makes much more sense, especially with the smoke from the ears effect. I have no idea where people got to magical energy potion from that though.

**** If I had to guess, I'd imagine a lot of stories requiring that effect were written before OOtP came out (which is where Invigoration Draught is mentioned) and authors simply gave Pepperup an extra effect.

*** Didn't Rowling at some point state that "mundane" diseases do not affect witches and wizards. Because I've seen people argue that wizards wouldn't care about nukes since that "trait" makes them immune to radiation poisoning.

** Huh. I've seen it most often as something to “pep you up” when you're tired, like magical coffee.
