I recall a fic in which Harry found a magical artefact in the Black household that allowed him to set up a somewhat similar sporting event. Participants were notified that they had been enrolled in the competition, and their objective was to kill a specific other participant. Failure meant death.

Anyone have a title that matches?


** ItÂ´s a one shot:
