Hey guys looking for fics where Harry has a near empty vault and he has to focus on making money. Things like harvesting potion ingredients, taking over abandoned classrooms where he raises animals and plants for harvest, selling the basilisk, taking some items from the Room of Lost Things for sale, etc.

Note: Already read No Knowledge, No Aim, No Money

There's one fic where Harry is poor/broke because his father spent all their money funding the Order and left nothing for him, meets Draco at Diagon Alley and ends up going to Slytherin, but that's as far as I got and I can't remember the name.

  Harry Potter knows that money can give you power and influence. He has learned that from a young age on, seeing how his relatives get away with many things.

** Magical Relations by EvansEntranced: Harry doesn't know about his vault. He begs Vernon to send him to Hogwarts, vowing to pay back every cent. He convinces Filch to hire him to clean with magic, but pretends they're detentions so his Slytherin housemates won't revile him for being poor. linkffn(3446796)
