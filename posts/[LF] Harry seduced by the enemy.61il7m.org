Okay we've all seen the stories where someone is forced to make Harry fall in love with them (because /reasons/). And they all invariably end up with "I never meant to, but I now love you in return and please forgive me and lets have rainbows and kittens together!" bla bla bla ending.

So I am looking now for a story where attraction/love is 100% one-sided. Where Harry is successfully made a fool of. And the antagonist walks away laughing with his schemes having worked out and Harry left behind to pick up the peaces.

Thanks!


** I had an idea like this, but I never wrote it. I was going to subvert the standard Daphne Greengrass tropes by actually making her a major bitch.

Was going to be a 6th year fic, Harry has a meet cute with Daph and they fall in love and married. Then she laughs and goes away. Her plan to inherit his wealth when he's kill by Voldemort.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** Surprised Duality hasn't been mentioned yet - linkffn(8262940)

Fantastic thriller with Harry and Daphne as the main characters, has the same type of vibe as Gone Girl if you've seen / read that. Easily in the top 3 of the fandom in terms of sheer writing quality as well.

Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG

Although /A Different Sort of Bond/ is a close second.
