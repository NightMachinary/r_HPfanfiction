Hello, I'm wondering if anybody would have any good angry Harry fics, and I would appreciate if they are over 100k+ words, thank you

*** Wow, I tried this for about ten chapters and It was a bit too Harry Crow for me. I see one explosion of anger at the beginning, and then nothing but everything going Harry's way after that? Does it get better?

*** Yeah, I came here to recommend this exact fic, it plays it completely straight and it somehow works without being either too angsty or too ridiculous.

** Hands down, the best is linkffn(Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian). Following that is a calm, controlled-anger version of Harry, and one of the best trilogies in the fandom: The Denarian Trilogy. linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) is the first book in it.

** I love angry!Harry stories, but most of the ones I know of are closer to one-shots, or perhaps two or three chapters. Even [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9750991/1/Angry-Harry-and-the-Seven][Angry Harry and the Seven]] (non-mobile link) posted earlier only has three or four really good "Harry losing his shit" moments, but they are fantastic scenes, especially when [[/spoiler][Harry, after being told that his attendance at the Halloween Feast is mandatory, shows up in the Great Hall to remind everyone that they're basically celebrating the murder of his parents. Loudly.]]

The others I know of:

linkffn(Rage by Wanda Ginny Greenleaf)

linkffn(One Wizard Too Many)

linkffn(The British Reformation)

  AU. Don't-give-an-eff!Fem!Harry. Starts during OOTP. Marie's been having a frustrating summer, a frustration that she tries to relieve in perhaps not the most sensible way. But she doesn't care. She's tired of caring. Screw being the hero for those fickle people, Marie was going to take care of number one.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.
