** So I've thought about it a bit more and realized a few things. I don't necessarily want Harry to even know what happened because I don't want him to abuse it. I want the other professors to notice some discrepancies with the house points and when they look into it in the logbook or whatever they have, they see things like “5 points to Hufflepuff for a wonderful shield charm” or “20 points to Ravenclaw for the first successful Patronus” or even “10 points from Gryffindor for cursing someone with their back turned”. The teachers are baffled and trying to figure out which professor it is.

** Hmm...I did see a one-shot, I don't remember if it was in a collection or not, that actually went with something like that.\\
As it went, at OWL exam time, the students were given truth-telling quills, and one of the questions they had to answer was which professor had taught them.\\
As it turned out, the vast majority of them wrote that Harry Potter had taught them DADA, not Dolores Umbridge. So, she got paid for the tiny handful of students she /did/ teach, which amounted to a handful of knuts, and Harry received a fair few galleons and an invitation to teach next year. Or something like that.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

** I really like the idea. However...

I don't see much that you can do with it - at least, not on its own.

What can a professor do?

Give and deduct points: interesting, but while Umbridge is there, that's pointless (huh... No pun intended)

Give detention: again, not while Umbridge is around

Being payed: possible, but only after the year is over and again, that doesn't have much bearing on the plot

Be up after curfew: that has possibilities, but as soon as Umbridge finds out, she will put a stop to it

Be allowed to continue teaching them, even though there is the decree of the ministry: Hahaha, no, that's never gonna fly.

Thinking about it, there actually were two things that I came up with, that Harry might be able to do: go to Hogsmead whenever he wants to and access the restricted section of the library. Both have a lot of potential and at least the library shouldn't be that easy to block by Umbridge

But other than that, you would probably need something like the trope where someone researches the Hogwards rules and finds out something that was previously unknown and that will help Harry (and maybe other teachers) take care of the situation

*** I'd take it from this angle: There can only be one teacher for each subject, so since Hogwarts recognizes Harry as the teacher of Defense Against the Dark Arts, anything he does overrides the actions of Umbridge, and since the Ministry decree that allowed her to teach there was only applicable if another viable teacher for a subject wasn't found, allowing the Ministry to assign one, then Dumbledore can by rights kick her out as she is no longer needed nor recognized as a teacher.

And whether you play this serious or not serious, the shenanigans of using Harry as a propup Defense teacher just because it means they can get rid of Umbridge as a testament to just how horrible a teacher she is will always be good for a few laughs.
