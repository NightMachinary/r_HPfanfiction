As above looking for a fic with alot of demonology. Can stem from heritage, literally making a deal with the devil or anything else you know of.

  NaNoWriMo 2019. After Harry Potter is thrown into hell, Britain falls to the dark. The lights only hope is to bring Harry back. But ten years have had their effect on him. Will he be the savior the light had hoped? Or have they merely traded one devil for another.

**** It's just... a very, very odd little ficlet about kittens that's stuck into the middle of a story about Harry being a demon lord. I was so very confused.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch.
