Looking for any fic where Harry dates a Slytherin girl.


** linkffn(What Lies Beneath) - Really good fic with Harry/Tracey, though romance is far from being the main focus.

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

I meant in general people are really not harsh with anything, unless the OP is aggressive, spiteful,... about it.

********* I see. When I said people are not harsh, I meant they don't really criticize fics as much as I thought they would. A lot of the recommended fics have a lot of issues that I would expect people to bring up in the threads.

***** The reviews on FFN have the same problem. A generic Harry/Harem story with Daphne as the lead (how surprising) where Harry gets 10000000000 Lordships and everyone wants to suck his dick because, well, he's Harry.

Reviews:

#+begin_quote
  Lol, love your original story. Very hot.
#+end_quote

or the always well received

#+begin_quote
  Great story but can you add (insert favorite character here) to the harem?

****** I'm very confused. Are you making a general statement about the quality of stories/reviews posted on fanfiction.net? Because The Pureblood Princess is not Harry/Harem, and Harry does not claim /any/ Lordships during the story.

**** I disagree. The author is an extremely talented writer and while I see how it wouldn't appeal to anyone since there's no real plot as the main focus is the relationship, to many it's a great story.

**** Yeah it's certainly a rambler but it was the only thing on my reading list that really fits your criteria. If you like just general Slytherin-focused content, Ginny as a Slytherin in The Changeling ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling]]) was recently finished and I thought it was really good. Her relationship and how she views Harry is different and I think it's a pretty good representation of how things may have went for a Weasley being put into Slytherin.
