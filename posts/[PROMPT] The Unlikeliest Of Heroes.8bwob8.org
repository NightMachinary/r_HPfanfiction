Write a short scene in which an Unlikely Hero defeats Voldemort. And I'm not talking about AU Harry or a side character - I'm talking about various loose ends left by Rowling as of the final battle (Pottermore nonwithstanding) or just various things that at least exist in the universe but nobody was expecting?

*REQUIREMENTS:*

- Short scene, so 200+ words.
- Voldemort is defeated by someone that isn't Harry. The unlikelier, the better.

*BONUS POINTS FOR:*

- the Hero not actually existing in canon, fanon, or Pottermore (that thing is like the free DLC)
- Having the terms of the prophecy apply in the most abstract way possible
- Giving the Hero a friendly Disney-movie style sidekick and/or animal companion
- The Hero being nonhuman


** Voldemort remembered to employ Occlumency against Harry.

As the trio were escaping on dragonback after robbing Gringotts in broad daylight, Harry never received the vision that Voldemort was going to check on his remaining horcruxes.

So, they lingered, taking a day to camp in the forest and catch their breath before they continued. No Potterwatch broadcast was scheduled that night; if there was, maybe they would have had warning.

--------------

There was a faint 'crack' as the trio Apparated into Hogsmeade, but before any of them could take a single step, a loud siren began to wail.

"Caterwauling Charm!" Ron shouted, wand out as he scanned the street for threats; hurriedly, Harry pulled out his invisibility cloak and threw it over the three of them, crouching down and pushing Ron & Hermione towards cover.

But nobody came. The streets stayed deserted, Hogsmeade completely still and silent except for the aforementioned charm.

Slowly, Harry came out from under the cloak, looking around with trepidation (and some irritation at the ongoing alarm), "I don't get it. Where is everyone?"

"/Harry, look!/ Look at Hogwarts!"

At Hermione's startled shout, Harry looked up...at the ruined walls of Hogwarts, his heart feeling like it plummeted to his feet, "What...what the heck?!"

"Come on, we need to do something!" Ron shouted as he shoved the invisibility cloak back at Harry and started running towards the castle.

--------------

The sunlit castle was thoroughly devastated; its outer walls crumbled, several towers collapsed, the grounds stained with plaster and stony dust.

Harry and Hermione slowly wandered through the courtyard, Ron watching their back carefully; the place was just as silent and empty as Hogsmeade.

"What..." Harry could barely speak. Seeing his home-away-from-home like this, it was...

"It's cold." Hermione noted.

"I know, Hermione...to do something like this..." Ron muttered.

Hermione shook her head, "No, I mean it's literally cold. There's cold air coming from...there!" she pointed at the doors to the Great Hall.

Hesitantly, Harry approached the slightly-ajar giant door, wand in hand in case the cold meant Dementors.

It wasn't Dementors.

"Guys..." Harry said in a strained voice, "I found what happened."

The Great Hall was frozen over, the air fogging with every breath Harry, Ron and Hermione took; patches of ice covered the walls, and icicles hung from the roof, which (for once) only resembled a large stone cavern.

That wasn't the important part, though; in the cold, lit by hundreds of candles...were bodies. Hundreds, if not over a thousand, corpses were lined up along the entire floor of the Great Hall, with barely any space to walk amongst them.

Most were witches and wizards, but some were other creatures; centaurs, house-elves, goblins, even a few giants...and there were also some (or rather, quite a lot of) bodies, more piled up in the corner than lined up, that bore the distinctive robes and masks of Death Eaters.

"Mum! No! /Mummy!/"

Harry twisted around and dashed back to Ron, who was starting to cry and clinging tightly to Hermione. In front of him was a corpse Harry would know anywhere, but dearly wished not to see; the distinctive slightly rounded body of Molly Weasley.

"Who goes there?!" a deep voice suddenly sounded from the door of the Great Hall.

Ron spun, tears glistening in his eyes, his face twisted with rage as he prepared to curse the intruder, but Hermione grabbed on to his shoulder, "Ron, wait!"

The one who had spoken stepped into view; it was a pale white centaur, bow and arrow in hand, pointed at the ground in front of the trio.

"You're not Firenze." Harry blurted out, the first thing that came to mind.

The centaur raised an eyebrow, "Indeed not. I am Phelan. Now, who are you three?"

"Um...I'm Hermione Granger," Hermione nervously answered, eyeing the dangerous looking bow in Phelan's hands, "And Ron Weasley, and Harry Potter."

"That's me. I'm Harry." Harry added.

Phelan snorted, then carefully stepped closer, his hooves clicking quietly on the Great Hall's stone floor, examining the trio closely, "You /are/ Harry Potter...but you are too late."

"Too late...?" Harry questioned, that sinking feeling in his heart beginning anew.

--------------

A short time later, the four of them had descended into the dungeon, passing a handful of other centaurs, goblins, and magical humans along the way, most of whom seemed too wrapped up in thought to pay attention to their passing.

"Filius Flitwick, we have visitors." Phelan announced as he pushed open the door to what used to be Slughorn's quarters.

"Visitors?" A squeaky voice responded, before the diminutive figure of Filius Flitwick came into view; his expression brightened as he saw, "Harry Potter! Ron Weasley! Hermione Granger! You're alive and well!"

"Forget about our wellbeing, professor, what happened /here/?!" Harry asked, a hint of frustration and panic in his voice.

Flitwick sighed and bounced back on a chair, "You-Know-Who attacked without warning last night, with a quite literal army. We...well, we weren't overwhelmed, but with no time to prepare, it was a long and costly battle."

"Mum...mum's dead." Ron whispered.

Flitwick nodded slowly, "Yes, as the battle went on, allies poured in from around Britain to reinforce us. That and with it being impossible to Apparate in Hogwarts, the Death Eaters could not employ their usual hit-and-run attacks. If there is one bit of good news to come out of this, the Death Eaters have been almost completely destroyed."

Harry took a sharp breath, "Sir, does that mean that Voldem-um-um-um, he's been destroyed?"

Phelan snorted, "Hah, he /wishes/."

Filius Flitwick slid off his chair and started to walk towards the door, "Yes, perhaps it is easier to show you."

--------------

A bit higher up, on the second floor, a door away from Moaning Myrtle's bathroom (and that was another thing, Harry noted to himself; he hadn't seen any ghosts yet), in a badly devastated room, was Lord Voldemort.

In Harry's opinion, he looked terrible; the dark lord's robes were shredded and in tatters, barely enough to preserve his modesty, he was lashed to the ground by thick glowing chains, and his pale scaly skin was scorched, gouged, and split open all over his body, to say nothing of the sickening way many of his limbs were crushed or bent the wrong way.

At the sight of him, Voldemort's eyes flickered with anger. "Aaaaarrrrrryyy...oooootteeeeeerr..." he growled, semi-incoherently.

"He won't die." Flitwick whispered, "We've tried everything short of Fiendfyre and the Killing Curse, neither of which I dare cast. Nobody wants to be near him in case he escapes, they're out searching the Ministry and the Death Eaters' homes and Azkaban and everywhere to find out what's keeping him alive. That's why there's so few people left here."

"Iiiiiiiii...ooooooo..."

Tearing her eyes away from the moaning dark lord, Hermione looked back at Flitwick, "How did you capture him, Professor?"

"It was in fact my doing, Miss Granger," Phelan answered quietly, "As the battle went on, I found it prudent to accept the aid of a house-elf...Kreacher, I believe his name was."

Noting Harry's sudden attention, the centaur continued, "He helped to protect me from oncoming hexes, as well as enchanting and multiplying the arrows still in my quiver. Though it is something I would never consent to again, I daresay that those of us centaurs who accepted house-elves as riders fared tenfold times better."

Ron stared at a large hole in Voldemort's chest, right where the dark lord's spine should have been, "You shot You-Know-Who with an arrow?"

Phelan nodded, "A very special arrow, Ron Weasley. I know not what grievance Kreacher had against this dark one to warrant such a curse on my arrow, but...I let it fly in the moment after the dark one struck down Minerva McGonagall-" (Harry choked) "-and had turned his attention to Flitwick here and a Kingsley Shacklebolt."

The centaur looked down at Voldemort, who was staring at the centaur with the same kind of fury he normally reserved for Harry, "As shrill and unpleasant his screams were to the ears, they did warm my heart a little. Of course, it should have been a killing blow, but as you can see..." he gestured at the crippled dark lord, "Fortunately Kingsley and Flitwick were able to disable him, and bind him here. Do you know why he will not die, Harry Potter?"

Harry startled, he /did/ know why Voldemort couldn't be killed, "Well...yes. Do you know anything about...Horcruxes?"

** Scrath, Fourty-Ninth Son of Aragog, had never been like all the other Acromantulas. While his brothers were obsessed with /hunting/, /eating/, and /fighting/, Scrath's days were full of /exploring/ and /learning/.

It was on one such day of exploration that Scrath happened upon a small, strange, /loud/ rodent.

"Why hello there, small, loud rodent thing. What are you?" asked the young spider.

"What kinda halfass piece of shit spider can't even recognize a fuckin' Jarvey when he sees one?" replied the profane ferret.

"I don't know those words. What is this 'half ass' you speak of?"

"Well get this, fuckwit: it's like a normal ass, but only /half of the fuckin' thing is there/."

Scrath laughed delightedly. "I have never even /heard/ of such a thing!"

*And so a grand, wondrous friendship grew between Scrath and the noble, profane rodent that called itself Jarvey. They explored the forest together for years, exclaiming (with excess of profanity) over each new discovery. And then, it all changed.*

Scrath picked up Jarvey with his front leg, as he skittered away from the dark-robed wand-wavers and their painful beams of light. "Jarvey, what is happening?"

'Well ya see, shithead, those wankers decided not to like ya, not that i can't see why, and they don't want your dumb ass in the Motherfuckin Forest anymore."

"Well that's awfully unfair, isn't it?"

"No shit, Sherlock. Go eat a dick."

"They can't do this."

"Watch em."

"/No./" Scrath stopped moving and planted his appendages into the ground.

"NO."

The forest went quiet, almost as if it were waiting for something.

"I SHALL NOT FLEE."

"What the shit are you doing, bitchface?"

"THIS FOREST IS MY BIRTHRIGHT. THEY HAVE NO /RIGHT/ TO DRIVE ME FROM MY HOME. I SHALL NOT FLEE."

"Well that sounds fuckin baller, standing around 'n shit, but I'm not feelin it right now-"

'/VROOOOOOOOOOOM/'

Beneath their feet, the underbrush swept away, revealing an ancient, vine-encrusted Ford Anglia. The old car roared to life, swept up in a new purpose. Spider and Ferret both stared for a moment, before Jarvey broke out in a grin.

"Now this is what I call hot shit."

*[ELSEWHERE IN THE FOREST]*

Harry calmly put his wand back into his pocket. "Do it, then. Kill me."

Voldemort fingered his wand and smirked. "Any last words, Potter?"

"My ancestors are smiling at me, Riddle. Can you say the same?"

Voldemort blinked, and aimed his wand. "/Avada Ke/-"

'*VROOOOOOOOOOOM*'

The vine-encrusted car leapt from the bushes and ran over the Dark Lord. A smaller-than-normal Acromantula seemed to be clutching the roof of the vehicle, while an odd ferret-looking thing was doing the driving.

"WE RIDE FOR OUR BROTHERS! WE RIDE FOR THE FOREST!"

"FUCK YEAH, DUMBASS! HOW DO YOU LIKE THE TASTE OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN FENDER IN THE MORNING, YA PIECE OF SHIT?"

The car swerved and ran over Bellatrix LeStrange, then Lucius Malfoy.

"Well," muttered Harry. "Looks like you've got this under control. I'll just... head back to Hogwarts, yeah?"

"YOU WILL /NEVER/ TAKE OUR HOME FROM US!"

"HAHA! THE ACCELERATION ON THIS SONUVABITCH IS FUCKIN AMAZING!"

"I'll take that as a yes."

** Standing here bearing witness to his masters resurrection, Lucius didn't trust that sniveling weakling to do what needed to be done. With a quietly uttered "Imperio" he bewitched Peter to perform the ritual as required.

Lucius watched from the shadows as the severed hand landed in the cauldron. It was done, Voldemort was Re...

It was about that time that Lucius noticed Voldemort's firey rebirth seemed a bit much on the firey side. 'Really that fire should have gone out by now. And it's getting bigger. Time to go!' he thought.

Before the portkey took him his last vision of the graveyard was of Harry Potter catching a mouthful of exploding Voldemort as his master popped like a flaming bubble and flung charred flesh into his gaping maw.

Back home, Lucius pondered. 'I suppose willingly given doesn't extend to best effort'.

** Spud was the offspring of a pair of owls that once lived at Hogwarts in the owlry. Spud remembered how Spud's mother used to bark about a smarmy human chick whom she had fun refusing to take mail for, though he found a different owl after the third time.

Spud, however, couldn't recall Spud's gender, because at some point, Spud had been transfigured into a rock. Spud spent years as a rock, getting moved around by one thing or another, until some human picked Spud up, carved two parallel lines one one side and set Spud down amongst a bunch of other rocks. Some screaming later, and the human waved his yes stick after saying something about vanishing the evidence. Next thing Spud knew, Spud was floating in a great big nothing.

Years passed of just floating there in the nothing, and Spud had nothing to do but think. Spud even too Spud's name drone a bigger rock-thing that did this weird cheep thing that Spud only felt when they bumped into each other. Then one day, Spud ran into a newer strange rock and was sent flying in a new direction.

Spud quickly became glad that Spud couldn't feel pain, because if Spud had still been an owl, Spud was sure Spud would be squeaking in pain from suddenly being /on fire/ as Spud fell.

Faster and faster Spud went as Spud zoomed towards what Spud recognized as the ground, more specifically, a big flat area with a hill nearby and a bunch of standing thin flat stones and there were humans there. Just before Spud hit the ground, Spud had one last thought about the one right under Spud.

/That's The Eggless Fowl Who Drew Lines On Me!/

BREAK

Harry blinked in surprise as one moment Voldenort was +thankfully+ putting on robes, and the next, something plowed a hole down through him, shattering the cauldron he was still standing in, sending a piece of shrapnel into Wormtail's throat.

Soon, Harry was the only one left alive in the graveyard, still tied to a tombstone....

"Hello, is there anyone to help me?"

"Master Harry Potter calls for Dobby!?"

BREAK

Years later, after finding out about the prophecy from Dumbledore, who insisted Voldemort would come back again, Harry laughed and told him the "power he knows not" was "terminal velocity". Dumbledore would spend the rest of his life trying to find a spell or ritual or anything magical by that name, while Harry went on with his life, Voldemort free, thanks to an owl turned rock turned shooting star named Spud.

**** Spudnik pun, yes: I decided that it would be a rock falling from orbit before I decided how to put it there and have it fit the prophecy, and since it was in space, referencing the first man made orbital sounded good. And since prophecies are open to interpretation, I think taking it as "marked as an equal +sign+ that happens to be his" was a fun twist; glad you liked it! I also am pretty sure that reentry is faster than terminal velocity but Harry was being misleading as petty revenge on Dumbledore.

** *A shorter, happier story:*

"/Quirrel.../" a voice muffled by the turban Quirrel was wearing on his head said, "/Go to the seventh floor, I wish to examine something./"

Quirrel looked blank for a moment, then shrugged and obeyed, putting aside the Martin Miggs comic he was browsing and beginning the slow process of walking all the way up to the seventh floor of Hogwarts Castle.

After Quirrel wandered off, the paintings behind him started to whisper.

"Did you hear that, Mauve? Talking to himself, he was!"

"Aye, Amber, but the strangest thing was that himself was talking back! Without moving 'is lips."

"It sounded like it was coming from under his turban, all muffled and all."

"Well, what do we do? Do we run and tell someone that Professor Quirrel's hiding a squirrel under there?"

"Nah, Mauve, I'll get this, don't you worry."

A minute later, the amber-colored Amber squeezed herself into the tapestry of Barnaby training the trolls.

Right as Quirrel came pacing by for who knows what reason, she whispered, "Oy, professor! Your turban's coming undone!"

Raising his eyebrow and turning to see Amber, Quirrel nodded at her, "Ah, thank you," he muttered before beginning the process of unwinding and rewinding his turban.

Ravenclaw's Diadem successfully checked-upon to see that it was still there and untouched (and possibly hidden a bit better), Quirrel was making his way back to his office when it happened.

As he was passing a suit of armor standing outside the trophy room, the armor flicked its helmet like it was glancing towards Quirrel, then took one step and unceremoniously kicked the turban-wearing professor in the balls.

~CLANG!!~

As Quirrel collapsed on the floor and whimpered, the knight reached down and tugged away his turban, right as Professor Dumbledore came jogging up, having followed a runner through the paintings all the way up to the 6th floor.

The headmaster stopped, seeing the face on the back of Quirrel's head, which grumbled, "Bugger."

** Carole Dennis of Kalamazoo, Michigan had no idea that her actions on Jun 20, 1989 would change the world. For her, it was just day where she was being forced to interrupt her British vacation with her husband Charlie to visit Charlie's second cousin, Muriel, in - of all places - Little Whinging, Surrey.

Unfortunately, Muriel had several ancient Pomeranian dogs which set off Carole's allergies and their yapping pierced through her brain. Charlie, seeing that she was at the end of her rope, did what every good spouse did and sacrificed himself to save her -- in this case, volunteering to see Muriel's extensive collection of Royalty-themed tea cozies leaving Carole free to “take a walk around your charming neighborhood”.

Which why she happened to be walking past No 4 Privet Drive at 2:35 pm just as Harry Potter, was struck by a bolt of lightning out of a clear blue sky as he was pulling weeds.

Luckily for Harry, Carole Dennis was a Nurse at an Emergency Care Center and was used to acting fast in medical situations. She quickly examined the small boy and started CPR.

In the 2 minutes while Harry was dead, in an unnamed cave in the middle of the Bulgarian forest, Lord Voldemort felt a sudden surge of energy as if a portion of his splintered soul had returned. Because Tom was well studied in magic, he instantly knew that his mortal enemy, Harry Potter, was dead and jubilantly ran out of the cave to celebrate.

Unluckily for Lord Voldemort, aka Tom Riddle, his cave was perched on the side of a hill and he did not survive the 300 foot fall. Unlike Harry, there was no Carole Dennis around to quickly give medical aid. Just a few random forest creatures and not even the insects or scavengers would go near the corpse, leaving it to elements to wipe it from the earth.

Across England, several valuable and storied antiques began to smoke but instead of burning, they disappeared as if being slowly pulled into another dimension.

Harry Potter survived his sudden death experience although his mundane doctors could not explain how the lightning shaped scar on his forehead had been removed by a lightning strike.
