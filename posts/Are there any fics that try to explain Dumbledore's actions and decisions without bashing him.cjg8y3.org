For example what if several death eaters got sent to prison without trials so it wasn't just Sirius, and what if Dumbledore tried to get him a trial but was blocked by people like Malfoy? What if the ministry agreed that Harry's closest blood relatives were the best place for him? Instead of raising Harry to die what if Dumbledore shared his thoughts and theories on horcruxes with Harry, and told him there's a chance he wouldn't die but the horcrux would.

I'm just getting a little tired of the bashing authors seem to love to do. Everyone seems to like to write manipulative Dumbledore or evil Dumbledore, but there never seems to be Dumbledore who's trying his best but not succeeding.

Sidenote: Did canon Dumbledore know Harry would survive, and keep that theory from everyone including Snape who thought he was setting Harry up to die?


** Not any specific fics, but if I were to do that, I would try this:

“I wasn't the Chief Warlock at that time. My relationship with the Ministry was already strained due to me running the Order of Phoenix. I couldn't have forced a trial even if I had wanted to. On the other hand, Sirius Black's betrayal was too painful for me to confront him directly. I took his confession for fact and didn't pursue this matter because of my personal cowardice.”

“I had known that Dursleys weren't treating you right. I thought several times about removing you from that place. But after what had happened to the Longbottoms, when they were betrayed by leaks inside the Ministry, I just couldn't risk moving you out of the protection of the Blood Ward. You see, Lucius Malfoy has made many inquiries about your address over the years. Walden MacNair has tried a few times. Corban Yaxley did several times too. Their attempts were all thwarted for whatever reasons. Only last year, when Minister Fudge turned against you directly, did your home location become finally compromised. Even then, the Dementors could have never entered the premise itself. You were surprised outside your home.

I have several instruments monitoring your conditions on this shelf. I was indeed prompted several times to take actions, but your condition somehow improved afterwards.”

“Yes, the Stone was both a trap and a test. If you had not intervened, Voldemort would have either made off with the Stone or gotten caught by the Mirror.”

“I tried to ask Miss Warren several times, but she absolutely refused to speak to me. Without knowing the cause of her death, I couldn't investigate further and clear Hagrid. I didn't know that Basilisks could cause petrification if its gaze was redirected, so I ruled out a Basilisk very early on, although I should have known that the king of snakes must be a Basilisk.”

------------------

“But I have no excuses for my atrocious actions during your year 6. I should have explained everything to you in a single day. I could have much better prepared you for this dangerous mission. It was completely wrong for me to risk the lives of so many students, just for the faint hope of turning a would be murderer and terrorist. Perhaps the only explanation is that I underestimated to what great length a desperate teenager was willing to go.”

** Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.

Seriously.

From Dumbledore's memories; Moody on Karkaroff:

#+begin_quote
  "Crouch is going to let him out," Moody breathed quietly to Dumbledore. "He's done a deal with him. Took me six months to track him down, and Crouch is going to let him go if he's got enough new names. Let's hear his information, I say, and throw him straight back to the dementors. "
#+end_quote

Crouch sentenced his son and the Lestranges to Azkaban. Crouch questioned Karkaroff and Ludo Bagman. Crouch threw Sirius in Azkaban without a trial. Ergo, Crouch let Lucius and Co. go free.

#+begin_quote
  Did canon Dumbledore know Harry would survive, and keep that theory from everyone including Snape who thought he was setting Harry up to die?
#+end_quote

Pretty much. Also GoF:

#+begin_quote
  "He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's," Harry told Dumbledore. "He said the protection my - my mother left in me - he'd have it too. And he was right - he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face. "

  For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's eyes.
#+end_quote

Then Dumbledore in DH:

#+begin_quote
  “Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”

Absolutely. If Harry hadn't thought he was going to die, he wouldn't have protected everyone in Hogwarts during the second half of the battle. Because he did, no one was killed by Voldemort and his death eaters because Harry basically made a magical bargain with Voldemort to die for them, just like his mother did for him.

Dumbledore probably didn't know that's what would happen, but he knew the way Voldemort thought, and he maybe knew the way prophecies work or some other theories that made it likely.

** No recs to offer, just a reply to your Sidenote:

Dumbledore didn't know that Harry would survive. He guessed, and he bet on that guess for no other reason than his 'guesses are quite good'. He suspected about the Horcrux in Harry after the diary incident and believed that since Voldemort had used Harry's blood in his resurrection ritual that it was very possible for Voldemort to act as Harry's faux Horcrux (thereby ensuring Harry's survival). And I'm only going by the books on this b/c I've never actually watched any of the movies beyond the 2nd one.

BTW, since I don't have my books on hand, I've been referencing these sites to be sure I'm remembering things correctly:

** I read an excellent fic that once explained the blood protection in more detail and justified why he was sent to the Dursleys.

So Voldemort had shown, at least to Dumbledore, that he had some way to live up to his nickname and escape death. Dumbledore was an old man, and it wasn't a guarantee that he'd live to see the return of Voldemort. So he turned to the blood protection. He reasoned that 10 or so years of mistreatment was nothing compared to a lifetime of potent protection against Voldemort. Harry's kids would have presumably inherited this protection as well, and so there was a possibility of creating a dynasty of wizards and witches whose blood was Voldemort's bane.

Of course in canon, Voldemort successfully returned while Harry was still in school instead of biding his time for decades, and he subverted the blood protection by using Harry's blood to create his new body. But this explanation still helped convince me that it was reasonable for Dumbledore to make the decisions he did. Harry arrived at Hogwarts alive, if mistreated and skinny.

** It's not directly about Dumbledore, but does canon ever say Sirius never had a trial ? I mean, it's not like he could not be sent to jail with one : ●We dont know who set the Fidelius on thé Potter's Home, but it could potentially be Lily. Bill cast one on his home for example. So Dumbledore may not know the identity of the secret keeper ●Absolutely everyone though Sirius would be the Secret Keeper for the Potter. It's because it was such an obvious choice that they chose Peter. So when the Potter are betrayed, it's normal for everyone to think he did it. ●When Sirius is finally found (like 5 days later ), the rare witnesses only heard someone else accuse him of betraying the Potter before before an explosion killed 12 people (13 if you count the new guy ). ●As Rowling say (though not in canon ), the Veritaserum is not infaillible (or it would make a very boring plot device ). As Voldemort 's suspected right hand man, Sirius was though to be talented enough to fool the potion. The fact that he had 5 day before his arrest to modify his memories, put himself under the Imperius or any other defense make the potion even less usefull.

All these elements make Sirius extremely suspectfull, and we see in canon that Death Eater could not be present at their trials (Bellatrix and co were only brought to hear their sentence for example). Maybe Sirius got the same treatment, or was though to be too dangerous to have have it, but that doesn't mean he never got a trial. I'm sick to read this cliche in all the manipulative Dumbledore.

As for Dumbledore himself, even if I think he was clean in Sirius sentence, and even if Lupin was not forthcoming with informations, I wonder why he never though to check if Sirius used secret passages to sneak in the school, especially when it seems he created one of these passages.

#+end_quote

It's canon. Sirius himself tells the Trio that Barty Crouch Sr, who was in charge of trying and sentencing all Death Eaters and suspected Death Eaters, was the one who decided to send Sirius to jail without a trial. He even goes into pretty big detail of what exactly happened and why Crouch was allowed to act like this:

#+begin_quote
  “D'you know Crouch, then?” said Harry.

  Sirius's face darkened. He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when Harry first met him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a murderer. “Oh I know Crouch all right,” he said quietly. “He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban - without a trial.”

  [...]

  “Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn't you know?”

  Harry, Ron, and Hermione shook their heads.

  “He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic,” said Sirius. “He's a great wizard, Barty Crouch, powerfully magical - and power-hungry. Oh never a Voldemort supporter,” he said, reading the look on Harrys face. “No, Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against the Dark Side. But then a lot of people who were against the Dark Side... well, you wouldn't understand... you're too young...”

  [...]

  “Imagine that Voldemort's powerful now. You don't know who his supporters are, you don't know who's working for him and who isn't; you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves. You're scared for yourself, and your family, and your friends. Every week, news comes of more deaths, more disappearances, more torturing... the Ministry of Magic's in disarray, they don't know what to do, they're trying to keep everything hidden from the Muggles, but meanwhile, Muggles are dying too. Terror everywhere... panic... confusion... that's how it used to be.

  “Well, times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others. Crouch's principles might've been good in the beginning - I wouldn't know. He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemort's supporters. The Aurors were given new powers - powers to kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn't the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side. He had his supporters, mind you - plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic. When Voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job. But then something rather unfortunate happened...” Sirius smiled grimly. “Crouch's own son was caught with a group of Death Eaters who'd managed to talk their way out of Azkaban. Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power.”

  “Crouch's son was caught?” gasped Hermione.

  “Yep,” said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak, flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half. “Nasty little shock for old Barty, I'd imagine. Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family, shouldn't he? Ought to have left the office early once in a while... gotten to know his own son.” He began to wolf down large pieces of bread.

  [...]

  “Did Crouch try and get his son off?” Hermione whispered.

  Sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark. “Crouch let his son off? I thought you had the measure of him, Hermione! Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go; he had dedicated his whole life to becoming Minister of Magic. You saw him dismiss a devoted house-elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again - doesn't that tell you what he's like? Crouch's fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial, and by all accounts, it wasn't much more than an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the boy... then he sent him straight to Azkaban.”
#+end_quote

Yeah... the blame for Sirius not getting a trial is pretty much solely on Barty Crouch Sr.... and on the general attitude of the wizarding world at the time. Dumbledore doesn't seem to have had anything to do with it... and Sirius HAD inadevertently managed to set up the situation so that the case against him appeared completely water-tight.

*** That sort of thing happens in real life... it's in fact depressingly common. I've read about babies left on doorsteps, and of people who have left them there, and it's a very sad situation... But the thing is, there IS a sort of logic behind it, even if it's a logic born out of desperation.

Most often, it seems, you have a young mother who knows she can't take care of her baby. She doesn't have the money, maybe not a job, maybe she's sick. She doesn't have any friends or family members who could take care of the child. The only chance the baby has to survive is if she gives it up. But she's desperately afraid that if she goes to the authorities and tries to put the baby up for adoption, she'll be shamed and rejected and told to just do her duty as a mother and keep the child. And she's not sure she'll be strong enough to insist.

So she does the only thing she can think of: Abandon the baby on the doorstep in the middle of the night, when nobody can see her. And then leave. Because surely NOBODY who finds a helpless baby on a doorstep, all alone and with no mother to take care of it, could POSSIBLY be so heartless as to refuse taking it in?

Dumbledore of course isn't a young mother, but I can see there being a similar reasoning: He knows that Harry's best chance for survival is with the Dursleys, but he's afraid that if he shows up in person with him Petunia will just slam the door on him and refuse to have anything to do with her nephew. And then the blood protections will fail and Harry has lost his best chance for survival. But if Petunia finds Harry on her doorstep, with a letter that the boy has nowhere else to go, surely that'll evoke her pity and she'll take him.

*** I mean... using that kind of logic in a magical childrens book is kind of silly. It's like judging a cartoon's physics-it just doesn't work. You need to carefully pick and choose what scenes to judge a character on; because consistency is /not/ something you'll find here.

Had Rowling made something for a more mature audience, I doubt the protagonist would've been dropped on a doorstep. That's horrible; but children certainly won't catch that pesky little detail. And so she did it the magical way, akin to a bird dropping off a baby. Because procreation doesn't exist.

From Book 6 and beyond I can't really defend anything though; every one was more a plot device than a person at that point. And the audience was more mature then.
