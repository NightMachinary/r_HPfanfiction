I'm looking for a fic I read about a year ago. It was a relatively short story, time-travel, and snarry. The main thing I remember about it was that when Harry time travels back, he saves Severus from a group of death eaters / bullies in the street. Both Harry and Severus are post-Hogwarts age, and Harry works in a library. He has bleached (?) / lighter colored hair as part of his disguise. Pretty sure I read this on ff.net if that helps.


** I think this might be [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3836032?view_adult=true][Rapture]] because it has the Snarry time travel and the bullies part. I don't think Harry changes his appearance though or is a librarian so I'm not positive. But this is a great fic regardless! Linkao3(3836032)

*** It's definitely not Rapture.

I read the fic in question only a few months ago but for the life of me, I cannot remember the title or author. This is bugging me so much I'm going to search my internet history in hopes it's still there. I post the fic if I find anything.
