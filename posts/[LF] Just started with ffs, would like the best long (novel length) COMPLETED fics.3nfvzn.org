I've started with HP fics only 3 weeks ago, and I've looked over the general recommendations thread, and others too, but can't figure out which to read, and I'd appreciate some suggestions. Till now, I've read

- Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality
- Growing Up Black
- Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past
- Harry Crow


** linkffn(Stages of Hope)

linkffn(Delenda Est)

This is pretty much it for complete stories on my favorites. Everything else is incomplete. I have some more recommendations if you want incomplete series.

Since this is the thread in which someone is asking for “the best” something, Robst's stories simply do not qualify, one way or another. And not necessarily because they are bad, it just ... sort of feels like something is missing in his stories, like they could have been better than Robst ends up making them.

****** I don't disagree, but in the context of this comment thread, OP's response wasn't asserting that the fic in question was the best, just that they enjoyed them. Best being subjective, it's a completely valid question to ask OP what they thought of the ones they read so that good quality fics that have similar topics, ideas, or writing style (or better) can be recommended.

It just irks me that someone coming into the ff community got somewhere around 4 or 5 down votes when I commented just for liking something.

I feel I might not even know the ones so good/popular, that they might miss mentions for being that popular, or whatever, that's what I was asking. On ff.net, on arranging by number of favourites, and high word count, I found Harry Crow within the first 5 and assumed it's good.

******* I guess it's just that kind of place. Happened to me too. And I think that, as harsh as it sounds, down-voting an answer that gives a fic, in a thread about “the best” ones, that you don't think counts as anything like that, is a valid way of disagreeing with it.

The only thing you can do if it happens to you is shrug and not care, pretty much. Any other way of approaching it means you will only stress yourself over something that doesn't really matter all that much.

**** Well, unfortunately as one of my main gripes with Harry Crow was the writing style, I doubt I can help you much. I would suggest reading more of Robst's stories. One great way to find more is to see if the author has written any other fics. Also, to get an idea of if a fic is abandoned, try checking: the status (Incomplete/complete), the last update (recent or not?) and also the last chapter's ANs, plus the author page. The last two are good to check even if the fic is labelled as complete, since many authors split a fic into 7 seperate fics, and the last one might be abandoned. A few will even mark their fic as complete when they abandon it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness][Dumbledore's Army & the Year of Darkness]] is worth your time, it slots neatly into canon and offers a solid flipside to DH, with a slightly darker tone.

Anything by JBern, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][Lie I've Lived]] is brilliant, with Harry believably and interestingly powered up, while [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]] is crude, flawed, and written in second person (some hate it) but just so much /fun/ that it gets away with it.

** I'm quite new to it. I started with cannon, post war. I might eventually branch out a bit, later on.

'Harry Potter and the Summer after the War' and 'Harry Potter and the Winters after the War' are worth reading if you're new. I'm also reading '19 Years' as it progresses.

So far I've found that all stories have their faults, but it's worth pushing through shortcomings if a story is interesting and compelling. It's also worth abandoning if something is seriously annoying you at the start. There are so many tales out there, you can pretty much find everything you might want it seems.

*** Summer After the War and Winters After the War are two of my all-time favorites. While you're on HPFF, check out Run!, Before They Fall, Until We Close Our Eyes for Good and Conspiracy of Blood.
