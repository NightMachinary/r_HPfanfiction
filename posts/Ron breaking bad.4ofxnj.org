A good idea for a villainous Ron would be if he decided to use illegal means to escape poverty, like participating in the black market of Hogwarts, selling drugs and illegal potions.

Basically Breaking Bad style but Ron-centric. Now that I think about it, there was a fic named Buttefly Effect where something like this happens but it's not the focus of the story.


** Neville, with his affinity to plants, was the more obvious candidate for breaking bad.

*** Imagine the Hufflepuffs setting up an illegal marijuana market. Nobody would see that coming.

**** Are you kidding? They are called Hufflepuffs! While all the other houses are like, "we want the brave/smartest/cunning," Hufflepuffs are like "ya dog, come chill, puff this huffle!" I bet you their dorm area is just a forest of weed! Complimentary bongs and everything!

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/16/The-random-craziness-file]["The Damned"]], a snip from Darklooshkin, Ron, Hermione and Harry are selling illegal potions, stealing and fencing, and worse, all to defeat Voldemort. Not quite what you were looking for, but it has a similar idea with regards to Ron - he steals everything he can.
