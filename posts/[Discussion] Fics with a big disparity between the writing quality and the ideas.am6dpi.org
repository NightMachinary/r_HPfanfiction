** For your first question, I can't think of anything specifically because there are too many to name. One of my pet peeves is nobody has figured out how to use commas to break up natural speech patterns. "It's a very dangerous mirror Harry" WHAT'S A "MIRROR HARRY"??

For your second question, I would have to say the "boy with a scar" AU series by dirgewithoutmusic. Poetically written, succinct, grammatically correct interesting story seeds that turn into dull canon rehashes every time.

Duh! That the one from the Mirror Universe. You know, the one with the goatee.

*** Was just about to recommend those fics as falling into category two, but then I scrolled down and saw your post. The Neville BWL is a stretch from the start, copying Lily's sacrifice "just because", even though it would never have happened without Snape's intervention. The canon rehash makes all the fics blend together and even the better ones (Harry and Dudley raised by divorced Petunia) become less memorable in retrospect when you can barely any remember details because they're all exactly by-the-book. I remember one, or several, where Sirius died in the Veil and it made me mad, because there wasn't any set-up with Dumbledore's year-long ghosting or the magic communication mirror.

linkffn(8615605) is another example of excellent writing that is let down by a rehash. Over 200k words of by-the-book setup, and doesn't start to diverge until the Yule Ball of year 4.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. Future Snape/Harriet. Sequel "No Journey's End" (Ootp - DH) is now posting.

I guess I'm asking about the ones at the very top of that heap of bad writing. Ones that have, truly remarkably clever/interesting ideas. Not just your run of the mill "oh that's a clever what-if, too bad it's written as shite" but a story that has /multiple/ instances where you go "Oh. Oh wow. Now /that's/ clever. Too bad it's written as shite."

** Harry Crow had an interesting premise (Harry raised by goblins) but implemented it rather poorly. Not in terms of terrible grammar and spelling (despite his other writing faults Robst is usually pretty good about those), but in terms of there being no plot tension at all. Antagonists are cartoonishly evil with no redeeming features. Protagonists never face any serious difficulties and are shown to embody all that is wonderful and good and pure, etc.

*** I tell this to everyone who complains about how /Harry Crow/ snatched a good idea and made a terrible novel out of it, but: have you read /Harry Amidst the Vaults of Stone/? It has the disadvantage of being abandoned, of course, but it also has the advantage of actually being a good story. It also may or may not be where robst got the idea from, as it predates /Harry Crow/.

** For the first, linkffn(Horry Patter and the Philogoger's Stone) has amazing ideas about a magical society and an AU take on magic that is brilliant, but puts people off because of its weird names.

For the second, though I really like it and it does a lot well, linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) had a few too many tropes that make it, while still an amazing fic and worth reading, still particularly lacking in areas.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
