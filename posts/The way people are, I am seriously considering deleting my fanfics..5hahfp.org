You can't control how people respond to your work; if the critical reviews bother you that much, enable comment moderation and remove them.

That being said, if you want to write, then /fucking write/. If the opinions of random strangers on the internet are enough to make you want to not write, /stop writing/. Either way, bitching and moaning doesn't solve shit.

And honestly, [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] is right. Going out to shock and disturb people leads to shocking and disturbing people, who then are either:

A. Too disturbed to continue reading

B. Into it.

C. Too disturbed to continue reading, and then leave reviews addressing this fact.

D. Too disturbed to continue reading, and then leave angry reviews addressing this fact.

#+end_quote

This is your problem, right here. You're not exploring fucking anything, you're wallowing in your theme, which just so happens to be fucking /rape/, one of the most sensitive subjects you can write about. So putting out a fic about rape that sounds like you were writing the whole scene one-handed is both the height of tastelessness and completely un-exploratory, unless by exploration, you actually do mean masturbation.

"[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_of_the_Month_(The_Sopranos)][Employee of the Month]]", an episode of The Sopranos, actually /explores/ the theme of rape and its consequences, and it is both shocking and disturbing without being maudlin and tactless, like your fics. There is nothing, absolutely /nothing/, profound about Hermione being raped by Neville and Harry with all "three holes" being plugged up with their dicks. And there's nothing profound about that story idea you floated a few days ago about Daphne being gangraped and impregnated by one of her rapists. You're just turning rape into a profoundly crude and plainly offensive, voyeuristic fetish.

You want to explore the topic of rape, actually fucking explore it. Don't write some second-rate rape erotica and get brassed when people say it's shit.

#+end_quote

The thing is I'm not writing some second-rate rape erotica or wallowing in that theme. I do try to explore it by putting the characters in real life situations.

Case in point, one story I've wrote explores how someone can suffer from a medical condition, yet another person presumes that said person is attacking her. When I wrote it, I researched it before hand, and while I was writing, ensuing that I didn't get some cheap heat out of the readers.

Incorrect.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Things happen in the real world and that's what I try to portray in those stories. For example the Daphne storyline, it has been known in some wars that occupying armies have done it to not just prisoners of war, which Wizarding Britain was in in the final book, with the occupying army (Death Eaters) running Hogwarts, but to women in the areas they are occupying.

It's not a bed of roses out there in the real world, and unlike most authors, I try my best to write stories in which things happen.

"Things happen in the real world" is a real shallow theme, my dude. War happens in the real world. Famine happens in the real world. Rape happens in the real world. But saying those things happen in the real world is an entirely different thing from exploring what they are and why they happen. You're not reflecting on why these things happen in the real world, or how people are capable of these things in the real world. You're not exploring how rape affects people, and if you are, you're not doing it well enough. You really only ever explore the act, or describe it in excruciating detail with no real closure. That's not exploring something. It's like making a documentary that's ten minutes on how forced prostitution happens, and it sucks, then following it up with 80 minutes of prostitutes having sex with their johns.

#+begin_quote

On the contrary, pretty much every author tries to write stories in which things happen. Writing a story where nothing happened would be some seriously skilled, postmodern shit.

I hate shitty reviewers just as much as the next bloke. It's annoying and discouraging when you get a shitty comment on your fic, believe me, I know. But when you put your fics up online, you choose to open yourself up to that kind of criticism. And sometimes, the guy who trashes your fic may be a douchebag, but he also may be /right/. Instead of threatening to delete all your fics and your account or whatever, really look over why this guy hated your fic and why other people have criticised you. Every writer can improve, and every writer is doing something wrong; you're no different.

Edit: my spelling sux.

All the intent in the world does not make up for the actual end product. People are obviously seeing something in your stories that you are are too close to see.

** I don't have a fanfiction.net account, so...

bit of constructive criticism.

First three lines are very... I'm not sure how to say it. They boils down to "Harry, [long unnecessary description] feels this. He feels this because he has a reason to feel this The reason is [...]"

It's forcing your reader to stop, over and over for what could have been 1-2 lines worth of idea. It's jarring and breaks immersion.

And right after that, your next few sentences tend to run on, way too many explanations that feels out of place. For example, if you introduce yourself to someone, you'd start "Hi, I'm, [name], [thing about you]", not "Hi, I'm [name 1, nickname 1, nickname 2, nickname 3], [list of all your hobbies] , [list of all your hopes and dreams], [explanation of what you're feeling at the current moment and why][ tangent to personal backstory]"

I doubt you've ever heard anyone talk like that in real life, right?

I don't have a interest in it but the reason I have wrote about it in a couple of my Fics is for one simple reason, it happens in real life, so why not in fiction?

Just like a couple of my stories are about people having affairs. Again, people have affairs in real life, so why not write about it in fiction?

The same with people dying. People die in real life, so why should I write about it?

I try to write about topics in my fics that affect people in real life. Some of my stories I feel sick when writing, especially when people are attacked/abused but I know that if I didn't write them, then I would be saying that in a way, I don't believe that they can happen.

Of course you may see differently, but that is, as they say, up to you.

I don't write fanfiction for anyone but myself and (for several reasons) have zero interests in reading reviews. I use Gethermit.com. You can write and publish to their library anonymously, under a pen name or your own name. You can choose to publish to the "public library" or not. Reviews are not supported (though people can "like" your work).

It works for me, perhaps this, or something similar would work for you?

** If you can't deal with one comment, then you shouldn't be writing. This is the bane of many writers. Some people will be offended with what you write. You need to learn how to deal with it, instead of having a temper tantrum about how somebody basically took a shit on your fic in the public mall during Black Friday.

I suppose I should start with the story itself. What you were trying to do is one of my favorite tropes. The first few chapters, the ones before Harry made Hermione his concubine (sorry for spoiling guys), were good, and I was looking forward to reading more. But then your story ventured into messed up and cliched territory. Then your bashing and the cliched tropes spiraled out of control, to the point where I couldn't read it. I stopped reading it faster than I grew bored with Princess of the Blacks. What you ended up trying to do was failing at writing rape erotica with a smidgen of plot. You tried, and you failed. It blew up in your face. I have read many cliched and disgusting fics, like many here undoubtedly have also. Some of them are even well liked. Perhaps you should see what they did that made their stories liked, instead of reviled, as many people in this thread seem to be of the opinion?

Perhaps you should tone down the rape/concubine/slave stuff and focus more on plot? Perhaps then it would appeal to a larger selection of readers who might actually leave constructive reviews instead of saying your story is a shame to the word "story".

I can't comment on your story since I'm not interested in Hermione bashing, especially not coming from an author who chooses a "Pureblood Supremacist" tag for himself, so I'd not read it even if it won the Nobel Prize for literature.

** Here's my take on the situation. I skimmed through the linked story, decided it's not my cup of tea and left. That was it. No compulsion to waste your and mine time with degrading remarks if I thought that you story just didn't work for me, because of a difference in opinion/taste.

I'm not that full of myself like your quoted reviewer to want my indignation/aggravation with any story be heard, as if the opinion of a random stranger on the internet is worth shit if they're spewing unnecessary vitriol. Being cruel on the Internet and making authors feel too bad to write anymore and then their readers suffer just doesn't seem productive to me.

Like I said, if I don't find a story interesting it usually isn't worth wasting my breath to reply to. It's as simple as closing the tag on the browser.

If I liked part of story, then I admit I can get passionate in the review, but I'd at least point out what part of it makes me cringe/twitch and why. And that's only when I think the author would take it under consideration.
