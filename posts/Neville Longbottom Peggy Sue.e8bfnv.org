I've seen Harry, Hermione, Draco, Ginny and groups of Peggy Sues, but no Neville.

Are there any fics where Neville goes back in time to his younger self? (Preferably on his own.)


** This might not be exactly what you're looking for, but try Far too Many Time Travelers, by Lord Jeram. It has a Neville like this, but not only Neville.
