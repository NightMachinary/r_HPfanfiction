You know the fics, where Dumbledore has planned Harry's entire life from life to finish before he was even born...

I was just thinking, is there any where, upon learning everything, instead of making all of these plans to undermine Dumbles and monologue to him about how he has seen through his deceit when he ultimately gets the upper hand, Harry decides to just off him without saying anything?

Like, say, they're having a conversation about the war or whatever, and seemingly out of nowhere for Dumbledore, Harry whips out his wand and immediately fires the deadliest spell he can think of without taking the time to gloat about how he's discovered Dumbledore's nefarious plans?

Or Harry sneak up to him with the cloak and shank him with a dagger/knife covered in basilisk venom, just like that?


** Admittedly, there's a bunch of instances in fanfictions I can point to where I'd say: "Yeah, just for that I'd stab him in the neck right now."

But it's like that repo-man reality show where it's so clear all you have to do to defeat the repo-men is to not open your door when they knock because they aren't really cops and can't come in unless you let them. I always wanted to see an episode where a guy was smart enough to just keep the door closed. Then one episode, they did air an instance where the guy just wouldn't let the repo-men inside and wouldn't even argue with them from behind the door, it was just two losers talking to themselves outside a door and honestly it was pretty boring. So I learned my lesson, I didn't actually want to watch smart criminals, I wanted to watch dumb criminals.

The same thing would happen in a story where you insta-kill your enemies. Sure, it'd be smart to immediately murder any opposition, but once your enemies are dead, why even keep reading?

** I have several fics where Harry slaughters Dumbledore with no monologuing to be found. Although Dumbledore isn't quite the scheming villain other people portray him as in them, Harry's simply not very forgiving.

** I've been reading this one recently. Fits what you are looking for. Harry simply kills Dumbledore at the end of HBP and joins Voldemort.
