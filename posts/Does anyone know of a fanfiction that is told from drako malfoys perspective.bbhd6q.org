One that follows cannon but is told from the way he sees it?


** I'm going to apologise in advance for not being able to contribute any stories, I just really need to ask you to never spell Draco like that ever again. Also canon.

*** I would like to formally apologize to you and the 12 people that uploaded your comment.

If it helps we can go 10 to English is my second language. Or that I'm 11 years old.

Neither of those statements are true, but if you think of it that way then it's an honest spelling mistake.

** Alright, so I suspect something like a 1/3rd of HP fanfics are from Draco's perspective; my advice would be to just go on archiveofourown.org and sort the HP fanfics by Hits and go from there.

That being said, here are some of my faves, hope one or two strikes your interest (they're all Drarry)!- linkao3(5494034) linkao3(2854709) linkao3(2693312) linkao3(2039154) linkao3(5817637)

  Narcissa Malfoy and Amarantha Greengrass just want what's best for their children. But since it's 1899, their children are 32 and 27 respectively, and sundry magical and Muggle crises are erupting across Europe, the chances of their plans progressing smoothly are close to zero.

  It's one thing to be good at not making a besotted fool of yourself over a man when he's busy being the most famous wizard in the world and you're tucked away quietly in Wiltshire. It's quite another when you have to see him every morning.

#+begin_quote
  Thirteen years after Draco accepts Potter's help escaping the horror of his sixth year, he returns to England where he makes the unfortunate discovery that Potter is still as obnoxious as ever. And worse, more than a decade overseas hasn't been enough to dim Draco's obsession with him.

  Repeatedly rejected by the Auror training programme, Draco Malfoy attempts an unorthodox method of gaining admission. Written for 2010 hd_fan_fair (travel), following scarlet_malfoy's prompt. Note: contains genderswap and dubious consent, both of which were requested in the prompt.

*** I just noticed the 'canon-compliant' request- most of these take a more-or-less approach to canon (as they're Drarry), if you can give any other requests to narrow down the list, I can go through my bookmarks again. Sorry!
