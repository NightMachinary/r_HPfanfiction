I just read Path of Decision by Lulu24 linkffn(4438449) . Harry there had moments of not being quite there. He doesn't always really realize what he is doing. He has trouble doing easy things, but can still kick ass. I was wondering if there are any others like it? I don't want one where he just decides that fuck the light side, I now love voldemort! I also would prefer no bashing, but some is fine. I would prefer no relationships but I am fine with anything (Even slash)


** "Stages of Hope" has a Harry that is incredibly powerful, but also barely functional outside of battle.

*** Is he actually particularly powerful in that? IIRC he's matched pretty well by his friends, and he relies heavily on performance enhancers.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  Harry has been a little off since the graveyard. He sees more than a closed door in his nightly visions, and he's losing his grasp on reality. The memory charm around the student population isn't helping. Who has Voldemort allied with? Riddle, always suspicious, seems to be a symptom of something larger.

  When Harry was hit by the killing curse, a horcrux was created. In this story, Harry is affected by the piece of Voldemort's soul inside his head in a more noticable way than in the books. Muggles, not knowing any better, decide he must be mentally ill. What effects might the treatment on a psychiatric ward have for the boy-who-lived and the wizarding world?
