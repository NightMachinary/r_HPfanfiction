Like

HP / any Death Eater (besides Draco and Snape)

Or anything else.

Preferably not 100% smut.

Ooh! Thanks for the fics! This request was prompted by me reading linkffn(Ephemeral Time by Mystical Magician) which is Harry/Dumbledore.


** Again and Again by Athey is utterly fantastic. Really, it's got such a bizarre pairing (Harry/Voldemort), but it actually works really well and makes perfect sense. And Athey is good at using canon details to stregthen her fics. It's definitely plot focused, not smut focused (although Athey has written [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/513388/chapters/905559][PWP Outtakes]] for it that are entirely smut, if you'd like to read more about their bedroom adventures).

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/439865/chapters/749908]])

If you want more Harry/Voldemort, I've got plenty more favorited, but none of it's as awesome. Most of it's still pretty fun though.

Also, TIL that I read a lot of non-HP centric rare pairings.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. Story is high on Political intrigue. Dumbledore!bashing slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

*** I love Again and Again, I think it is great, but is Harry/Voldemort considered rare? Even snake!Voldemort (which is not what he is in Again and Again) gets quiet a bit of Harry love.

**** It's not as rare as some pairings (I read an Albus Dumbledore/Draco Malfoy fic recently that was surprisingly sweet. That's a pairing that very barely exists), but it's rarer than Harry/Draco and Harry/Snape. I figured it was a reasonable suggestion given that OP only requested no Draco and no Snape.

Also, a lot of the rarer pairings, like Harry/Rabastan or Harry/Marcus Flint, have stories that are fun, but I'm not sure if I'd rec them to someone who wasn't asking for that exact type of fic, because Harry is pretty much always massively OOC in them.

***** Ah, ok. The OP doesn't specify what kind of story they are talking about, so when I saw rare pair, I thought actual rare pairs.

On AO3, a very quick search finds of about 20,000 slash Harry fics, close to 60% are Harry/Draco, 30% are Harry/Severus, 8% are Harry/LV(or TRJ), and just over 5% are Harry/Ron. Everything else I would count as a rare pair in some ways(those numbers don't add up as many include more then one pairing, and I'm rounding up).

  Teaching is no easy profession. Albus Dumbledore just wants to support his students. Even the bad ones. Even Draco Malfoy. In a world where the dark lord was defeated, Harry's generation grow up without the looming threat of war. Which means they have to be regular teenagers and make their own trouble. Fortunately, Draco is very good at that! Perhaps he just needs someone to be a good influence on him...?

      This is just a little AU scenario I dreamed up\.  Yes, it's Dumbledore/Draco\.  Yes, it has explicit content\.  Yes, I have a kink for older men\.\.\.\. \#sorrynotsorry\!

  A sequel to Teaching & Learning. Harry Potter knew that Malfoy had been Dumbledore's lover while they were at school. He had never quite approved of the fact but he had learned to accept it. Only years later does Harry finally realise the true intensity of their relationship and he finally begins to accept that there might be more to Draco Malfoy than he realised.

It's actually well-written and the porn bits are enjoyable (I'm a sucker for age kinks) but for some reason I keep getting mental images of RichardHarris!Dumbledore saying "Do you want me to fill that sweet ass of yours" and I just break down into helpless laughter.

** What kind of story are you looking for exactly? Harry/Any Dark but Severus or Draco is pretty broad. You want a little smut but not only? So Hurt/Comfort? Mystery? Creature Fics?

As for a rare pairs, there isn't a lot of Fenrir/Harry that isn't also involving someone else (normally LV), and almost all have strong dubious consent issues. Lucius/Harry is pretty common, and so is Lucius/Severus/Harry, but by simply moving a Malfoy up: Abraxas/Harry is rare (but still out there!). There is a few Rabastan/Harry out there which are ok, but they tend to have Abused!Harry for some reason. There are a few Orion Black/Harry's and like Abraxas, time travel galore!, as well as a lot of let's fix the future/redeem everyone. Not sure if it they are really 'dark', but there is a lot of Theodore Nott/Harry and Blaise Z/Harry out there too, as if there Viktor Krum/Harry. In fact the only pair I can think of that I have never seen is Peter/Harry.

**** I read Fire Keeper a what seems like a long time ago linkffn(8791602) and thought it was ok. It does have Mpreg, and quiet a few what amounts to OCs. The Red Strokes is not just smut linkffn(5380993), but it is rather short (and not exactly a happy ending either). Seven Cardinal Whats is a Theo/Harry from Ron's POV which is pretty good (or at least not bad) linkffn(9225124). There is a number of Theo/Harry's which are also harems or dragon!Harry, probably inspired by the massively popular The Rise of the Drackens linkffn(8022667), which doesn't have Theo, but There Be Dragons, Harry is quiet well known (I haven't read it myself, I'm not a fan of dragon!Harry) linkao3(There Be Dragons, Harry by Scioneeris), as well as Dragon's Heritage linkao3(Dragons Heritage by Doragonkage).
