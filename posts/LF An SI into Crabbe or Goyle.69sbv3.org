I want. Even a smart/manipulative Crabbe or Goyle would tide me over.


** I know LF = looking for. What on earth is an SI?

** Shout out to linkffn(Vincent Crabbe Saves Westeros), sadly it was abandoned much to early, but it's still a rather great comedy and I'd still recommend it for it's crass humor and like a review of it I still remember said: "I never knew I needed this, but now that I have it I cannot not have it."

(No spoilers for GoT, it happens before the series timeline.) Edit: And I doubt you'd get a more manipulative Crabbe without going totally OC on him. And while it's not a SI, it is a first person view of Crabbe and has alot of the SI vibes.

** I definitely remember a fic where someone was reincarnated as either Crabbe's or Goyle's sister and it was on AO3, not exactly what you're looking for but I can't find it anywhere.

  The words be careful what you wish for had never rung truer. "Wait... what did she just call my father? Oh, oh god no, anyone but them! Please god no! I'd rather scourgify my own blood then have them for a family! I would take the Malfoys- no, even Voldemort over them! Anyone but...!" SI-OC. Pairings undecided. Not an SI you've read before, according to reviewers.

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.
