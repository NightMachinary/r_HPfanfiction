** In /A Black Comedy/, where Harry and Sirius keep trying to avoid telling Dumbledore and the Potters the truth, including staging a fake scuffle to try and make it to the Hospital Wing door, and volunteering to /Obliviate/ everyone every other sentence.

The whole scene is - to me - one of if not the funniest moment in the whole fic, and one of my favourites ever.

Special mention goes towards /any/ of Harry's opinions on Sirius Black in /Seventh Horcrux/, where he believes the "most valued Death Eater" nonsense alongside the real Voldemort - like when Voldemort is defeated, Sirius starts cursing the fleeing Death Eaters, and Harry reflects on how Sirius truly has no loyalty. Absolute gold.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
