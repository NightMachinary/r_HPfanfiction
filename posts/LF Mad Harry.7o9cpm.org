Looking for stories with crazy Harry. He can be dark or light doesn't matter. Of course story has to be humorous.


** linkffn(Oh God Not Again) has a Harry that is either insane, a troll, or both.

linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff) has a Harry who might not be nuts per se, but has such a distinctly odd view of the world (namely, he seems to be allergic to work) that most people think he is.

linkffn(Play up, play up, and break the game!) Harry sees into the REAL BEYOND and goes stark raving mad. All so that he could be a better quidditch player.

  Oliver has one last shot at winning the Quidditch Cup before he leaves Hogwarts, and he's willing to do anything to make sure he does. No, really, anything. Absolutely anything. Oh dear...

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  When Harry was hit by the killing curse, a horcrux was created. In this story, Harry is affected by the piece of Voldemort's soul inside his head in a more noticable way than in the books. Muggles, not knowing any better, decide he must be mentally ill. What effects might the treatment on a psychiatric ward have for the boy-who-lived and the wizarding world?
