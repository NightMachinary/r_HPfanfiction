So, there's a threeway fight between the Dumble Bros and Gellert where Ariana gets killed. I'm looking for fics where something in that event changes and influences the plot or setting from then on. Like, if a different person died, or if Albus and Gellert didn't break up, or whatever else someone's thought of.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

  When Harry saves Hermione's life they end up in a different world and in the middle of another magical war - but at least they have each other.

*** Ah, CatsAreCool. A fun writer, and the story looks good! And hey, even the smallest change works - the duel just has to be different to meet the request. Thanks for the rec. :)

*** Oooh, yeah. I got recc'ed this one a little while ago - it was actually the fic that motivated this post! - and it does look interesting! Read a couple chapters and it has a promising start. Thanks for the rec! A double endorsement is definitely a plus. :)

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.
