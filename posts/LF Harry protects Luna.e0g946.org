I reread the merging and i really enjoyed the scene where harry destroys the Ravenclaw table and openly threatens them when he finds out what happened to Luna

are there any more fics like that? It doesnt have to be Harry/Luna but i would like it if she was a more prominent character


** Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path has a good scene where Harry gets help to threaten Ravenclaw. linkffn(11898648)

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

Harry is in Ravenclaw. When he discovers the bullying, he tells a prefect and takes Luna under his wing.

*** You're probably right that its only a few girl in her year up to a couple years above her. But when a girl literally has to walk though the school barefoot because she has no shoes, I can guarantee that the rest of the house knew about it. And maybe the first and second years could be excused from not doing anything out of fear but the rest, especially the prefects do nothing and that's inexcusable.

In fairness, that's only in the movies.

In the books, Harry does note that the notices Luna sets up include a list of her clothing, but given that the narration never notes that's she's barefoot while regularly noting her eccentricities, I doubt her shoes were stolen.

Gloves, hat, scarf--things that are easy to miss, and therefore easy to claim an alibi if accused--seem more likely.

***** That would only be a possibility if the perpetrators in the house never said a word. We can't know anything for certain since canon is an on rails shooter with the camera pointed square at Harry but in my experience if a bully has reach the point that they're stealing your stuff they are doing all sorts of other verbal and emotional attacks and that can't be hidden behind Luna's 'wackiness'.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
