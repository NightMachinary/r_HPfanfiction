:END:
Years ago I read a fic that I'm looking for now and I cannot find it. I remember that Harry goes to Voldemort and winds up becoming a girl to get around the prophecy and I'm pretty sure Snape adopts him and he winds up with Draco.


** Possibly linkao3(Shedding Lionskin by BeaconHill).

  Harry Potter has honestly enjoyed his four years as a Gryffindor. He loves the friends, the camaraderie, the cozy feeling of Gryffindor Tower -- oh, and getting to be the Boy-who-Lived, wizarding superstar, isn't bad either. The House of Lions helped him to become the friendly, warm, fun-loving kid he is today -- and hide the Terror of Little Whinging Primary, the cold, angry boy who hurt Muggles with magic, so perfectly that his friends and teachers don't even know he's still there. But the tournament last year had been way too dangerous, and after watching Lord Voldemort murder Cedric Diggory, he's absolutely petrified. He wants out. He wants to stop being Harry Potter.When Dumbledore realizes that the wards around Four Privet Drive have fallen, putting Harry in grave danger, he gets his chance: Dumbledore offers to have him hidden behind a new name and new face, placed with the family of an Order member so he can return to Hogwarts incognito. Harry accepts, but he can't truly expect the persona that unfolds: the Terror reborn as the cunning, Dark, and ever so Slytherin girl, Miss Iolanthe Snape. And she can't even imagine wanting to stay this way.

** Not exactly, but there is “Snape's Daughter by Tribi“ linkffn(7618752). It tends very quickly towards Drarry (which is not my cup of tea), and her name is terrible. But if you like it.

  Bill was scanning her too, no doubt checking for curses, "it's as if," he suddenly mused aloud and startled Snape, "as if all of the James was drained from her..." -Harry becomes a girl and Christmas comes early for Draco. fem/Harry AU Book 6
