I'm looking for a specific fanfiction I've read a while ago but can't remember the name and if it was a oneshot or not.

I only remember that there was a ceremony (triwizard tournament maybe ) and Karkaroff thought that Harry (or was it neville ... he had many veelas around him) tried to kill him (I think it was because deatheaters died by accidents and stuff) and he thought him getting offered sushi was a murder attempt.

To stay safe before the ceremony he had himself locked in in a Hogwarts vault.

â€‹

If anyone could help me or recommend other fantastic humor / crack fics I havent read yet it would be amazing :)


** ha! I know this one!
