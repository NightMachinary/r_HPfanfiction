Warning for rather long post ahead, apologies here: Just something I thought about throughout the years.

I want the Weasley's to be in the story, they were an important part of Harry's life, so to write them in such negative ways, is something that I will (never) understand.

I never really cared much for Harry/Hermione, though I think a large part was because of the people that loved Hermione's character, and hated Ron, which was unfortunately a lot.

It didn't help that a lot of people were introduced to the Harry Potter series, through the movies, and not the books. They only saw Ron's jealousy, and his comic relief side.

Ron's a good person, he's made mistakes, but everyone has made mistakes.

You don't need to villainize the characters to make it so that Harry and Hermione are good together. It's not a us vs them scenario.

I can see how Harry and Hermione would make a good couple, or have things in common.

- Harry and Hermione are both only children.

- Harry and Hermione are treated different for things they can't control. Hermione because she's Muggleborn, and Harry because his Boy Who Lived Status

- They have a understanding of the Muggle World and can talk about it, without being confused.

- Other then when she was petrified by the Basilisk, Hermione was with Harry throughout his adventures.

There are things there for a potential good story, but so many of them have Weasley bashings, I'm sorry, I just don't see the Weasley's hating on Harry or Hermione if they ended up together. They might become disappointed, but after a while their happiness would overflow instead.

Molly loved Harry, she loved helping and taking care of him, she wouldn't just abandon Harry, if he got together with someone else.

Ginny wasn't an obsessive fanatic, she was a fan of Harry in the beginning for sure, but she wasn't a crazy stalker, she didn't try to put love potion in his drink to control him.

I could definitely see Ron being upset or jealous (depending on when the two get together in the story), but after a time I can see Ron getting over it, I don't see him abandoning them, just because they're together.

The story can be: Oneshots/Drabbles/Multichapters. It can be on ANY site, anyone can be the main character, can be old or new.

As for other pairings outside of Harry/Hermione, am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual, et cetra.

Bonus points for showing Ron and/or Ginny in other relationships and being happy, despite Ron not being with Hermione, and Ginny not being with Harry.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.


** TBH I hate character bashing in all its forms. People are complicated in real life and literature is supposed to reflect that. Nothing turns me away from a fic faster than an author proclaiming â€˜X Bashing' like it's something to be proud of.

That said, I just recently read an HHr fic that might fit what you're looking for, though it's pretty short.

** I've written an oneshot which has Harry/Hermione and background Lavender/Ron, with Lavender serving as a catalyst which got them "together". It throws some shade at Molly, but not beyond any regular teenage feelings towards adults who might get in their way when it comes to romance. Ron shares the sentiment.

** I don't know that Ron is a *good* person, but he is definitely an average one, just like Ginny. I wrote this comment on a similar thread - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gtf2ti/how_do_you_build_a_realistic_harmony_aka_hhr/fsfby3g?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x]] - where I pointed out that a lot of the hate for r/G is based around the fact that they act like normal, immature, cowardly children. In other words, they respond to the events of the series the way most of us would in their shoes. Does that make them bad? Of course not. But it certainly makes them *look bad* compared to Harry/Hermione/Neville who are legit heroes.

That's the main reason I can't handle [[/r/HR][r/HR]] and H/G pairings. They usually end up trying to make Ron or Ginny smart/capable/heroic, which is totally OOC for them.

Agree with your points RE: Molly.

*** Ron let his emotions get the better of him, more then others, but that doesn't make him a bad person.

He also wasn't stupid, he was above average in that department. He and Harry weren't Hermione, but then again no one - not even the other Muggleborns were either.

There are different kinds of smart, some are book smart, some are experimental smart, some are people smart, et cetra - there are different kinds of smart.

Ron pretty much got similar or the same grades as Harry, he was able to cast a Patronus, which is a difficult thing to cast.

His emotions often got the better of him for sure, but I'd say that's pretty normal, he was one of the youngest of his siblings, he got hand me downs - which there's nothing wrong with them of course, but when jerks like Malfoy putting him down, it's easy to let his emotions get the best of him. He left Harry and Hermione behind, but the locket was affecting them all, and was feeding into his negative emotions, if Dumbledore had felt the urge to put on the ring, despite knowing there could be consequences, Ron can be cut some slack for leaving.

**** Okay...? I don't necessarily disagree with most of what you say (maybe the ability/smarts of Ron I'd grade a little lower than you - he wasn't stupid, but never stood out as smart to me), but overall I'd respond 'so what?'

Like I said, I don't hate Ron. I just see him as very normal, the way I and billions of other people are. I don't think it is inherently insulting to say that he is average.

We judge Ron based on the context we see him in. In all 7 books, he is surrounded by noble and heroic characters, so the fact that - /as I said -/ he acts like a normal boy just illustrates all the more that Harry and Hermione are exceptional. Maybe the locket was responsible for him abandoning H/HR; that just shows that H/HR are objectively better than Ron since they were able to resist its effects. Plus, what's his excuse for walking out on Harry during GoT?

I can't say for sure, but I would have thought that was part of Ron's appeal to people that like him. He's like Joe Everyman, alongside the super-genius and the prophesied messiah. He doesn't have to smart/capable for you to like him, but it's hard to deny he's the weak link (lazy, jealous, unmotivated) of the group. Adds a lot of personality and comic relief.

***** Harry's only exceptional thing is that he excels at are, his ability to cast a patronus at a young age, DADA, and fly. Hermione is incredibly ridiculously smart, and can't be measured against "normal" people.

Re Read the book that shows Ron and Harry's O.W.L's, he and Harry got the same grades (except for DADA, if I'm not mistaken), he didn't try hard in his written work, but not everyone is for that, anyway.

****** So Harry is exceptional at the only wizarding sport we know of that most magical people are obsessed with, and exceptional at the combat-related area of magic (during a war).

You don't see how that might make him a little more useful/capable/popular than Ron? I legitimately don't understand what there is to argue about. You said you felt Ron was relatable - so do I! I just don't have an interesting life and am not extremely talented or special. I'm just normal. Like Ron. But I live in the real world, where normal is fine. Ron exists in a fictional universe where teenagers decide the fate of the world.

Ironically, in decrying the bashing of Ron/Weasleys, /you/ are bashing Harry by saying he's nothing special. You don't need to boost up Ron to justify liking him. I LOVE Lockhart, and he is a total fraud/useless. But I don't try to make myself feel better about that by trashing Dumbledore, I just accept Lockhart's failings and enjoy the character all the same.

******* I'm not boosting Ron up, I'm just pointing out his good side, since a lot of people like to bash him.

I live in a realistic viewpoint as well. Give this a thought: If Harry was not someone who had survived the Killing Curse, if Voldemort was not after Harry, he'd be known as an orphan, but he'd be a pretty above average person, or average in most classes that weren't DADA, that others would not even look at twice.

Similar with Ron, he would be considered an average, or above Average in certain classes.

If there wasn't a war going on, Harry, and Ron would both be considered relatively normal in terms of personality traits and looks, and other things.

I love Hermione, I love her, but I also hate how Rowling made her over zealous in her studies, making other students look bad in comparison.

*** Also I read your post, seems like you hate Ron and Ginny - (Sigh), Or at least don't seem to understand their characters.

Ginny was a Harry Potter Fanatic at first, for sure, but she wasn't a stalker, she didn't put love potion in his drink to make him love her. She didn't cry in public over him or act all clingy towards him.

She had boyfriends, trying to get over someone is a healthy thing to do, I don't think that she was using any of them.

She didn't "date a bunch of guys" She dated two. Two guys in her Hogwarts years before Harry, is pretty normal.

It's realistic for boys and girls to date several different people, throughout years of slowly becoming an adult. It's also realistic to date several different people in adulthood. There's a difference between being in a relationship and being slutty, or easy, and imo Ginny wasn't slutty or easy. She was a normal teenager.

Dean and Ginny dated in the 5th book, and continued until his sixth year, which a year to two years is a relatively normal and healthy relationship standing point, imo.

Michael and Ginny dated after Dean, which seemed to be almost a full year, before Ginny broke it off.

Two boys before Harry, that's normal.

**** I don't hate Ginny or Ron, but I do hate their canon pairings. JKR really shoehorned them into relationships with H and HR, and it soured the end of the story for me. She is a very poor YA author for a lot of different reasons, but romance was certainly near the top of those. It would have been great if she could have handed the series off after GOF to someone else.

She had 6 books to develop Ginny as a character and barely made any effort beyond a "monster in the chest". Especially at that age, instantaneous attraction to someone you grew up with is silly. Somehow both Harry and Ginny made it through puberty without him noticing he was attracted to her? /jerk-off motion of disbelief/

As for Ron and Hermione, I mean, hell, even JKR admitted that divorce was the best case scenario for that marriage. He simply isn't capable of making her happy, and she would drive him insane.

I never called Ginny a slut, or even implied it. But how likely would you be to immediately jump onto your roommate's ex-bf/gf (depending on your orientation) a few weeks/months after they split? It's kind of gross. I know I wouldn't want to step on that landmine, especially given that Harry's in a school full of available witches.

Imagine if Lily had dated Sirius for a year and a month or two after they split, her and James got together. That wouldn't change the way you looked at those characters?

But whatever. You dig canon pairings - good for you. They bother me enough that I don't read any fics with Ron or Ginny as main characters. Good thing there are 900k HP fanfics on FFNet for us to choose from!

They weren't close like Harry and Ron, who would have each other's back in a pointless fight. Though, they were close enough to fight together to stop Voldemort, but almost everyone was close enough to do that. Not that the situation wouldn't have been awkward with Harry and Dean being roommates.

There is a Harry/Hermione and Draco/Hermione love triangle but the endgame is Harmony. And Draco ends up with Ginny. Ron plays a supporting role and he's in general a good friend.

To expand, this one just started recently, but has been actively updating.

Ron is even making a proper go of things with Lavender, who when you think about it is not a bad match for him if he can get over his original motivation.

  A Harmony fic featuring a marriage law. One morning at breakfast the lives of a large chunk of Hogwarts students are changed forever. How will they cope? Will there be a happily ever after or will relationships fall apart? not canon, AU, no horcruxes, not so nice to Ron but seeking redemption for him. I apologize for a poor summary. Prologue offers more details about the story.
