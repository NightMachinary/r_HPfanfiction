Hey guys, I'm looking for fics that explore either Draco's character, the Malfoy family dynamics, or possibly both. I'd be interested in seeing any interpretation of the characters, as long as it's well thought out. At this point, I'm pretty desperate for good fic, so if you know one that fits only vaguely, please do go ahead and tell me about them :)

The two exceptions are sex god draco and dramione, which are things I just can't seem to get on board with. Thank you all in advance for any suggestions!


** It was just posted on here yesterday, so you may have seen it but linkffn(6432055) is excellent

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** Hmmm. Looking through my favorites list:

linkffn(Chase this light by Lady Altair) is pretty good, albeit short and abandoned.

linkffn(Winter's Debt by La Guera) is a good oneshot, although not really canon compliant characterizations as it was written pre OoTP.

linkffn(The albatross did follow) is a pretty fun Ginny/Draco fic. Time travel with multiple loops.

I have no idea how this ended up in my favorites, but here you go: linkffn(Angel and Devil by Gamma Orionis)

linkffn(After the End) has the best characterization of Draco ever, and has a lot of exploration of Draco's relationship with his father.

I second Exile by bennybear, already mentioned in the thread. If you want Draco centric, it doesn't get much better than that.

Also, I haven't started reading this yet, so no guarantees on quality, but this one looks promising at first glance and is on my reading list: linkffn(The Malfoy Case by natida)

** I love [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=179718][peppersweet]]'s Draco first and foremost, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308510][Christmas in Prison]] being a particular favorite of mine. Her Scorpius stories also touch upon Malfoy family dynamics. She gets the bleak Draco just as I like it, with none of the sex god nonsense.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=332461][the earth and the sky]] is a Draco/Astoria oneshot about their relationship.

I have a short character fic as well - incomplete but standaloneish - [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=322009][Dreamscape]].

** Draco is my favorite also, so I know of so many, lol!! But here are my top 3 picks. The first 2 fics I recommend are by the same author, but that's only because Dan seriously has THE BEST Cannon Draco EVER!! And then my 3rd pick is just a really great Malfoy family story, about the father-son relationship between Lucius & Draco. It will certainly give you all the Malfoy feels. I hope you like them all!! ;)
