Sirius was dead. She was the cause. That laughing bitch took his Godfather. Harry's mind snaps for a split second, but just long enough "REDUCTO" and Bellatrix's head exploded, brains and blood flying everywhere. Little did Harry know, several house elves working for the ministry were pleased at the cleanup they'd get to do.

What happens next. Or well, a story that follows that idea. Harry kills Bellatrix at the Ministry with a perfectly legal spell rather than a halfassed Crucio, he just explodes her brains or beheads her whilst she's mocking him and has her guard down.


** Try No Hurry At All by RobSt where harry uses a part of the fountain in the atrium to kill Bellatrix.

  Remus was so shocked at seeing Sirius fall through the veil that Harry had raced past him before the boy's intentions even registered with the werewolf. Screaming "Sirius!" Harry followed his godfather into the veil before anyone could stop him. H/Hr

** Harry may feel some guilt over killing her, though he'll probably suppress or rationalize it.

Dumbledore will be disappointed in him.

Harry will probably fight more ruthlessly during the war, and people will take him much more seriously as a threat.

He may be sent to Azkaban- if he kills Bellatrix before Voldemort shows, the Ministry doesn't see proof of Voldemort's return, and he's a trespasser in the Ministry even if they're unlikely to prosecute him for killing a wanted Death Eater in a duel.
