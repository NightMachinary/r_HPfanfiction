Hi y'all, I'm looking for fics where Harry and the gang attend Hogwarts but it's fundamentally different from its canon counterpart.

For example: Like it's actually the best education you can get in Europe with actual competent teachers who are respected in their fields. Students who research and do projects about magic.

Or Hogwarts is a specialized magic school, like Battle Magic.

Something like that. It doesn't have to be light, any kind of magic discipline is interesting to me. I would prefer no slash or student/teacher ships. Thanks for any suggestions!

#+end_quote

In linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School), Hogwarts' curriculum was changed after the first war against Riddle so that it was excessively militarized. There were specific group Battle and Strategy classes and dueling and combat were regular parts of school life. The school was so combat-focused that Harry, when seeing a novel use of transfiguration occurring, noted that most Hogwarts students wouldn't think of using transfiguration in that manner as that was outside of the combat-focused scope of Hogwarts' classes.

Edit: I like how within 10 minutes, /everybody/ suggested Hogwarts Battle School.

*** You can just imagine an ending, let's say that they all go into the room of requirement and have a bunch of simulations of battles against the acromantulas around the world, and in each simulation they get closer and closer to the main acromantula nest where they are from originally, which they eventually blow up completely with some super magic deatomizer weapon. Then it turns out the simulations were real and all the acromantulas in the world are all dead. But then it turns out that the acromantulas only attacked wizards in the first place because of a misunderstanding and weren't planning on doing that anymore. Harry then travels to another planet, starts a religion, and the story picks up several thousand years later. Oh but there's a side story about Hermione's adventures still on earth, trying to find a cure for some generic disease she had that will kill her in her 20s or 30s, and Harry's cousin Dudley becomes the ruler of the entire world.

***** How is HPMOR an Ender's Game rip-off? Yeah okay the combat/battle progression was the same, but I felt even that was written as a parody and acknowledgement of Ender's Game just as much as a showcase for Harry's abilities. As for the rest of the work, it didn't seem to follow stuff from Ender's Game at all. But it's been awhile since I read either work, so if I'm mistaken, please tell me in what other ways HPMOR ripped off Ender's Game.

You're right about that graveyard scene though. Of course, if the author is to be believed, some random reader thought that up as a way to get Harry out of there alive.

I have a similar Hogwarts in my story "Patron". F.e., Hagrid is a teacher, and known as one of the best authorities on magical creatures in Europe. The students (and everyone) also use far more magic than in canon.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Oh, I forgot to put these down. They both have very different versions of Hogwarts.

linkffn(Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles) it's exactly what it sounds like. Notable not just for the theme, but being the only fic I can think of with more reviews than words.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Illusions of Reality) it's a Harry Potter-Matrix crossover. In this version, Hogwarts accepts people not at 11, but whenever they first experience accidental magic. The Trio attends and are considered unusual because they were all accepted at the same age. Malfoy is the same age as the trio but is a 5th year because he had accidental magic much earlier than the trio.

** linkffn(Firebird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy)

Total AU, harems are expected, the wizarding world's a matriarchy, Harry's a seer, the Houses are associated with Greek elements, Sirius is an incel, Lily was a seer, Voldemort sleeps with all the Death Eater's wives, etc. etc. etc..

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

**** I tried reading it once. I stopped when I started finding the murderous actions of Voldemort to perfectly reasonable solutions to the setting. I figured enough was enough at that point.

***** I had a similar reaction... I read through the first story of the trilogy in morbid fascination... by the time of the second story I was wishing death on all the characters.

It did help me when I started my own "matriarchal harem-based AU" to know what NOT to write. ;)

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.
