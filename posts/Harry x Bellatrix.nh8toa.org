:END:
In which Bellatrix has a daughter that goes to Hogwarts but she doesn't have the best of relations with her, due to her daughter blaming her for her father's death? (I believe). I'm not sure if Harry travels to an alternate universe or time travels (though I'm fairly certain it's the former) but he ends up being a Hogwarts teacher and tries to help the girl.

Thank you for your help :)


** I think this might be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13250447/1/Something-to-Live-For][Something to Live For]] by Grey Silver Hawk.

I don't think Harry becomes a teacher, though. It does feature Dorea, daughter of Bellatrix (and grand-daughter of Tom Riddle aka Lord Slytherin) whom Harry saves early on. Bellatrix and Dorea have a tense relationship as you describe.

If it's not what you're looking for, it might be worth a look in. It does some pretty refreshingly original things with its AU setting. Pacing is pretty glacial, which is only made more marked by the fact that all 100k words were posted in two months back in 2019, with not a peep since, suggesting that what we have is all we're gonna get.

  Harry sacrificed everything to kill the Dark Lord. He sacrificed more to kill the next one. And the next. And the next. By the end, he had nothing left to give, and nothing left to win. Burdened by failure, he's thrown into a new world with familiar faces and unfamiliar personalities, and must fight to survive. AU, Dimension Travel, Graphic Violence.

** Before I commit to this is it semi-complete or will it just leave me hanging forever?

*** It's not semi-complete unfortunately, but it is a good read (at least in my opinion).
