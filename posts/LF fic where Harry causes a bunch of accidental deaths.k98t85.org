:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm not sure I even sure I like it, but I think it's time travel, most likely a master of death fic.

Notable parts maybe:

- Ron dies on Hogwarts Express after tripping over chocolate frog and through window
- I think Hermione gets killed by the Troll

Edit: it's "accidental" deaths, like he either does some wandless magic to help things along or has like a death note or whispers to death or something to cause them.

** Not what you're asking for, but Harry triggers a sort of Final Destination series of events.

Harry is forced to marry Ginny, so Harry seals the contract with the family magic.

** The only one I know is where he runs away from the Dursley's after the dementors and somehow kills a bunch of aurors by luring them to fly next to a plane.

  Harry learns something about pure-bloods, and his father, which rocks his world. And not in a good way. And oh, the repercussions!

*** Most of those deaths aren't accidental, the man who controlled international portkeys was deliberately sending them to their deaths and the only people who die are Death Eaters and people similar to them. Also, its crack

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
