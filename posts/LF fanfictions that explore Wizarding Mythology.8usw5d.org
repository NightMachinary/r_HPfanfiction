  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

*** Is it really mythology though? Mythology is usually designated to things that people believe are real, but are not necessarily known. Here is an example:

- To muggles, ghosts are myths.
- To wizards, ghosts are physical beings of sort that are well known if not common (how common remains to be seen), and nobody doubts their existence.

In PoaDK though, all these things are tangible beings. Even the pagan gods appear to have physical form that can interact. Thats not myth so much as religion: you worship these entities and I worship those entities.

Don't get me wrong, I love this fic (so sad that its probably KIA). But I think mythology would be more like "the legend of the Deathly Hallows" or "the Lady of the Lake teaching Merlin" or something similar to wizards.
