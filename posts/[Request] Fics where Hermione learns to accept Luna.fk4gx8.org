Seeing the recent discussion thread got me itching for stories where Hermione learns to get along with Luna.

I'd prefer not to read romance and I would also prefer fics that lean closer to canon, as Hermione was actively antagonistic towards Luna early on.


** It's post-series femslash Romance in desperate need of a good Britpick, but it's the only one I currently remember that even vaguely fits the 'Hermione learns to get along with Luna'. It is canon compliant and has one of the best ends to a Romione Relationship I've seen in a while. No bashing, for one. :D

I'll reply to this message with more suggestions if I can find/remember them though. I think there's a couple more - though they're Harry-Luna fics mostly.

** Linkffn(Flutter) got linked recently and I really appreciated it. It features Ginny, Luna, and Hermione becoming friends during PoA. It's slightly AU, but still pretty close to canon. Very interesting, not like much else I've read recently.

  The traces of Dark magic aren't swept away with a summer and a trip abroad. It leaves marks on its victims, deep gouges in their soul, and just being in its presence can irrevocably change a person. You can never really overcome Dark magic, only survive it and hope for the best. This is Ginny Weasley, doing her best.

**** These may make it sound better or worse to you, but I also thought it was one of the best explorations of ritual magic I've read and also a rare fic where the story doesn't revolve around a male character without hating male characters.
