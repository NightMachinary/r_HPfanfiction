#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

- Nonmagical AU. Harry, Hermione, and Ron go to school. Harry plays sports, Hermione studies, and Ron socializes. Canon pairings. (/Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived/)

Then Indy!Harry trains with fem!Hogwarts to become a dueling expert. Icy Daphne Greengrass is the focus of his affections but Tracey Davis is interested too, moreso after Harry single handedly stops Luna's bullying with an explosive announcement in the great hall. Some Dimension Travel, bit of Harry/Bellatrix, possibly Harry/Pansy. He watches Tonks (who he's shagged) die. Merlin's portrait's alive and Harry's collected all the founders' portraits which he keeps in the trunk where he lives with his surrogate mother Narcissa Black (previously Malfoy) who worries about him when he goes out on his missions with the Aurors.

Also Harry makes his mom cry like three times, because he's a dick.

Also, Harry constantly berates and insults the person most devoted to him in either universe, kidnapped a girl because he was bored, and Harry and Sirius' best friends are an incestuous couple. Also the entire plot ends with them helping Voldemort getting laid. And let's just ignore that Remus was set up to be raped by his friends, and his daughter encouraged it.
