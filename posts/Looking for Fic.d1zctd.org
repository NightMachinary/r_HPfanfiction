Hi I'm looking for a fanfic I've read a while ago and can't remember the name of it but it goes that Neville is the boy who lived and Harry is traversing thru Hogwarts himself and that's about all I remember but I do no one part in the story is that Harry finds out Neville's invisibility cloak is actually his and it was givin to him by Sirius so any help who be great thanks!


** Took me a moment to recall the story. Thankfully there's been few Neville is the BWL with Sirius giving him the cloak that I've read... bonus was that it was a Harry/Tonks story so I was even more inclined to read it.

Should be [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13082443/1/][The life he leads]].

** Start with Innocent by MauraderLover7 on Fanfiction. She has rewritten the books in an incredible way with Sirius raising Harry
