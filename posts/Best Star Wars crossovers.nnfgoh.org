Hey everyone.

So I know this might be a bit of an odd request, but I've been on a Star Wars kick lately. Sadly, I've read or caught up on the major Star Wars fics I'm into, but I know I remember hearing about a few Star Wars/HP crossovers on this subreddit so I thought I'd ask for recs.

I'm fine with any pairings and don't mind rather it's something like the characters getting teleported to the Star Wars universe with cannon memories intact or if its just an AU where the HP characters happen to be born in the Star Wars universe.

Thanks!

** Mind sharing which ones you've already read?

The one that spring to my mind immediately is Vimesenthusiast's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11577249/1/Magic-of-the-Force][/Magic of the Force/]].

*** I haven't read any of the HP crossovers yet. As for Star Wars I really enjoyed Son of Suns, New Sith Order, and Utter Descent: A Siri Tachi Tale, Differently Rational.

** My favorite is Harry Potter: Lost Very Far Away. It's complete and good length.

** linkao3(25133773) Clones and Wizards is also good, here Harry is transported to Star Wars years during the Philosophers Stone incident, so he doesn't know much magic or magic lore, he has to learn himself, also the characters involved are not usual suspects, entirely new characters, a lot of exploration about the situation of Clone Wars.

  Combining the Mirror of Erised, the Philosopher's Stone, and the Killing Curse had some unexpected effects. Clone trooper CT-4387 is left for dead after an attempted ambush on Christophsis and 11-year-old Harry Potter makes himself a family.
