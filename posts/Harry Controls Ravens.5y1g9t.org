Harry Controls Ravens

for those of you who play league i basically want to know if their is a fic that has Harry with Swains powers


** In linkffn(The art of self-fashioning), Harry is a transfiguration prodigy and he conjures animals, including ravens, quite often. His creations are particularly useful in battles, but they also spy for him, do some reconnaissance, etc. If you're familiar with the web serial "Worm", it's sort of like Taylor using her bugs to track people. It's an excellent story, very well written although Harry is quite overpowered.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

*** I tried to read this but it is infuriating. Everyone in this fic is carrying the Idiot Ball and the author seems to have some spanking fetish, or is just completely ignorant of how to handle child abuse. You do no spank a previously physically abused child.

  Warnings Inside. Dumbledore ought to have known better than to leave an orphaned Harry Potter in the hands of the Dursleys. A twist of fate has the boy-who-lived living with criminals. Sly, cunning, street-smart, sorted into Slytherin where his housemates have been raised to hate him, will Harry survive? Or maybe it's the House of Snakes that doesn't stand a chance.

** Nothing I can think of fits that exactly but Noodlehammer's love of magic linkffn(11669575) features Harry having a link with crows/ravens.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** In The Raven's Anger by ooso1991 (linkffn(5731338)) Harry is extremely OOC but does have control over the ravens of New York. It's worth a read, but it barely qualifies as a Harry Potter story - his name is changed, he uses different magics and most of the characters are essentially OCs.

  He was abandoned by the Dursleys in New York City. Found by an Italian mobster surrounded by ravens, he grew to be the most powerful Don that New York ever witnessed. Absolutely ruthless and feared by all, what happens now when he is found by Dumbledore?
