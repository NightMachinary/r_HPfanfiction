Every fic I've read that has a character go insane has it happen either instantly or out of our view. I'm looking for fics that follow /any/ character's slow descent into madness.

I could get into a whole big philosophical debate right now, because I don't think those two are as different as you pretend they are, but it's probably just going to waste our time.

Suffice it to say "I can see why he's doing that, crazy bastard" is a form of empathy and empathy requires the ability to put yourself "in the shoes" of someone else. I would never murder anyone, but yeah I can get into a tragic story of someone doing it under extreme circumstances (and probably pity the protagonist in the end, feel sad for them). But relating to a protagonist that is a psychopath? I don't even know how that would work... Maybe it's more the "Revenge Porn" angle that attracts people to stories like this.

  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is Worthy of Magic and who isn't.

When one careless deed brings his world crashing down around him, with far-reaching consequences, Regulus Black has to step in and help his brother piece together the fragments of his life -- if he can stop himself from being sucked into the terrifying vortex alongside Sirius.
