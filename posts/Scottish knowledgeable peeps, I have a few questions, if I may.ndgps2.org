1) why ain't Black lake called a loch? Is it because Rowling is English or some other reason? Are only some lakes called ‘loch'?

2) if Hagrid lived in the Scottish highlands since he was like thirteen or whatever would he really still have that accent?

thanks for your answers, because I know not very much about these things


** Despite it being set in Scotland there is almost no Scottish culture and only three Scottish people that I can name. McGonagall, Moody and Wood. There is one Irish guy and no Welsh people that I can remember. The book is about magic English people that just so happens to be set outside of England.

Shut up, I'm not bitter about it.

*** [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Morag_MacDougal][Morag MacDougall]], but yes, I got your point. I love this ministory from “Harry Potter and the Malleus Mallardeficarum” by Abracabadger linkao3(20403121):

  Late December at Hogwarts meant delicate traceries of ice crystals that slowly grew together and spread across the window panes in the night, it meant mornings where the grass crunched and cracked beneath your feet on the way to Herbology, and when an anaemic sun finally burned away the dense Scottish mist it revealed a world rimed in hoar-frost.

  It meant feet that froze on the ancient stone floors of the castle even inside two pairs of woollen socks, and breath that fogged and steamed the moment you stepped outside. Only the very daring relied on a single jumper and a warming charm, because the wind sliced through you like there was nothing between you and the North Pole except the occasional Yeti. Well, only the very daring and Morag MacDougall, the chirpy Shetland Islander who bounced around in a skirt and shirtsleeves all year long. Even Professor McGonagall, that hardiest of teachers and well-accustomed to the inclement Scottish weather, was overheard one morning, as she watched Morag skipping out to Hagrid's hut for Care of Magical Creatures, muttering that the girl was clearly insane.

****** So Seamus Finnegan is an incredibly Irish name. Seamus is the kind of name that Americans call Irishmen in cartoons. Finnegan is also one of those very Irish sounding surnames. Morag MacDougall is such a Scottish name, her name might as well be Scottie MacScotsperson. It's all very stereotypical.

What would be the Czech equivalent of a very stereotypical first name and surname combination?

******* Right, Jan Novák (John Newman) or perhaps he should be Václav (Wenceslas). Although, I have always suspected that McGonagall is even more US-version-of-Scottish, but yes, I get your point.

/{after the discussion on this with my wife}/ Definitively Václav Novák (á is slightly longer a), because everybody has Jan/John/Johan/Jean as the most common name, so it is not enough Czech specific. And Good King Wenceslas was actually the Czech prince and the saint-patron of the nation.

  As the mayhem resulting from the lifting of apparition restrictions at Hogwarts settles down, Harry Potter is trying to survive the last few days of term without going mad. His best friends are behaving strangely, Malfoy is being a git, and, most importantly, he has to learn to dance before the Yule Ball. He's not the only one with problems, however, and somewhere amidst all this he needs to help Neville Longbottom in his search for a way to restore Luna Lovegood to normality after her avian apparition aberration.If there's one person he can rely on to keep him sane amidst all this, it's Ginny Weasley, his best friend's little sister... and now, his date for the Ball. Oh yes, her twin brothers are very interested in that development.Harry may be in even more trouble than usual, here.A sequel (and very definitely the finale) to Wondrous Apparition Provided By Magician. You probably need to read that for this to even begin to make sense.No ducks were harmed in the writing of this fic, although one was severely inconvenienced and extremely confused.

*** Is this when I ruin your day by telling you that Wood and Moody's nationalities are film canon only and that Moody's actor is Irish? I do concede that Alastor is a spelling that hints he might have been Scottish in the books.

You should just re-imagine some of these kids as Scottish. After all, unless the character was French, Bulgarian or Hagrid, JKR did not exactly make race, region or nationality very obvious. (I'm thinking about how she had to tell the filmmakers to cast a black kid as Dean, because by her own admission it's not even made implicit in the early books, and that one oblique reference to Angelina's braids in OotP - aka the one indication she might have been black. Five books after she was introduced).

** Hi, Scotsperson here. Speaker of both Scots and Gàidhlig.

The answer to your questions are as follows, and somewhat longwinded.

1) The Black Lake may be called the Black Lake because of Linguistic shift. For example, the Lake of Menteith, was originally called Loch Inchmahome from Gàidhlig, ‘Loch Innis Mo Cholmaig'. Lake of Menteith is a 19th Century name, likely from Victorian ‘explorer' and Tartanry. Hogwarts is a profoundly middle class boarding school, and the Language of the Middle Class is English. Over the last 2 and a half centuries, both Gàidhlig and Scots were beaten out of people at school and suppressed. My own Great Grandparents had the Gàidhlig beaten out of them. It might originally have a Gàidhlig or even Pictish origin that isn't used.

It may also depend on where Hogwarts actually is, despite it's isolation, The Gàidhlig Strongholds are in the West and Hogwarts is likely more east than that. See Highland Architecture as part of that, Most West Highland Castles are more like Towerhouses, and get larger the more East and flatter you go. The films say it's near Dufftown, which is in Moray further east than the majority of Gàidhlig communities.

Hogwarts is isolated from any of that due again to the profoundly middle class nature of the wizarding world. Non English speakers tend not to be middle class

The Black Lake may also be artificial, the example above ‘The Lake of Menteith' is the only natural lake in Scotland but plenty of artificial bodies of water are named Lake rather than Loch these days.

2) Hagrid doesn't speak Gàidhlig or in Highland English because there is no community to assimilate with and to learn from. It's all isolated from the rest of the world, and if we look at the origin of Hogsmeade. It is literally an exercise in Anglo-Saxon colonialism in the middle of the Gàidhealtachd. Even 1000 years ago, Pictish was still around but dying and replaced as the prestige language by Gàidhlig. Hogsmeade was founded by Hengist of Woodcroft, a Saxon wizard.

Sorry went on a bit of a ramble.

*** Thank you so much for the ramble, I feel like with this kind of thing rambles are excellent because they tend to have a nuance to them. I really appreciate you taking the time to answer!

The point about colonialism is really the one that I thought would be the answer, as the magical world seems to be very very anglicised for sure. There have definitely been references in a lot of fics of the druids being killed off and stuff, and it seems like it's super likely

I'm sickened but not surprised to hear about your family being treated that way, it's horrific. I'm so sorry

**** Well, Colonialism isn't inherently the answer. Scotland has a complex relationship with colonialism, and experienced essentially both sides of it with Na Fuadaichean (The Highland and Lowland Clearances) and our wealthier landowners taking active roles in British imperialism. Sometimes men took the king's shilling because it was the only option, others went for glory or adventure. Royal politics has more to do with what language is in vogue. The 1609 Statutes of Iona, forcing Gàidhlig chiefs to send their heirs south.

‘The education of the children of any "gentleman or yeoman" in possession of more than sixty cattle in Lowland schools where they “may be found able sufficiently to speik, reid and wryte Englische"'

Contributed to Gàidhlig decline.

The past is the past, getting the belt for not speaking English was commonplace.

The Destruction of the Druids is not a result of Anglification, it happened ~500 years before the Angles and Saxons came to these shores, at which time, The Gaelic nations where already being christianised as a result of the Hiberno-Pictish mission. The Druids were suppressed by the Romans in ~AD 58 because they believed not only was it a symbol of Celtic resistance but they also believed they were performing human sacrifice, which considering the Romans sometimes did that themselves, they rather disingenuously abhorred.

*** Terrific post.

About your great grandparents: I'm sorry for that. Examples of linguistic tyranny and forced assimilation are of course too common.

Cajun French in Louisiana is the example I know best: it's reviving, slowly, but the loss of generations of Cajun dialect language and literature to forced American English is just sad and shameful.

** 1. The only non-manmade body of water in Scotland typically called a lake is the Lake of Menteith, though even that is often referred to as Loch Inchmahome. So either Rowling is implying the Black Lake is a manmade reservoir of some kind, or simply didn't consider it.
2. Accents among wizards is something that you might reasonably expect to be a little funky to be honest. Consider that they have a much greater geographical mobility than muggles, Hagrid does much of his shopping in London for example, and you might imagine that the 'common' accent of witches and wizards might amalgamate into something less regional. Certainly there's not much evidence that Hagrid interacted with locals on the regular. A lot of the people who live in Hogsmeade are likely from elsewhere in the UK, and the locals probably don't interact much with any nearby Scottish settlements.\\
   Besides, I've known some people who lost their accent within a few months, and others who kept theirs for decades. I know of a woman who moved from Glasgow to South Africa, and when I spoke to her a year later she'd adopted quite a string South African accent. On the other hand, I also met another chap from Glasgow while in New Zealand who'd been there for 40 years, and he still had his Scottish accent.

Like many have said, Scotland was really just a conveniently wildernessy part of the UK for Rowling to set her stories in. There's almost no connection between the country and the books in terms of their actual content.

** The key thing to consider about Hogwarts here is that it's not really a Scottish school - rather, it's a British and Irish school, that just happens to be located in Scotland. And because of the demographics of the British Isles, that means Hogwarts is predominantly inhabited and staffed by English people.

I'd also imagine the main cultures of the British Isles would be a lot more homogenised in the wizarding world, because there's no regional borders really - anyone can be anyone in the blink of an eye.

** Lots of people who emigrate keep their accents all their lives. A Scottish man living in London wouldn't raise any eyebrows if he kept his accent. I live in Australia, and it's completely common for people to have strong accents from whatever country they spent their childhood in. My own grandmother is British, and emigrated when she was in her late teens, and you can not only still tell that she comes from England, but you can tell where in England she comes from.

*** Yeah, I'm in Australia too so I defs know that happens a lot here, it's so funny becaUe my mom is from New Jersey so we think she has a massive accent, but her family always go on about her super strong Australian accent.

I guess also because Hogwarts has people from all over, there would be less saturation of a certain way of talking to chip away at the regional accent.

It just seems like in HP everyone magical is English, even though Wales and Scotland feature heavily, and I wonder whether in reality that would effect the way people talked or whether they might be isolated enough to have their own dialects and accents

** To be fair, ‘The Black Lake' is never called so, nor called ‘The Dark Lake'. In the books it's described more like “the lake was dark”. In reality it's more like JK just using lake without thinking because she's English, and not naming it. In my head canon though, Harry is English and in his head calls it a lake, because why wouldn't he?

I will apologize in advance for my American nature but for me all British accents sound the same except maybe for cockney because I saw Oliver Twist. Also I know scots use a lot the word 'lad'. I can identify French accent by the way they say their r's and Eastern Europeans because they pronounce w as v.

He tells me that in the French editions of the books, Fluer's speech is done in a 'high class' French dialect, while the English characters speak in a lower class French dialect.
