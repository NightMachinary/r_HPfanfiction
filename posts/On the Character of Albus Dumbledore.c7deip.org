So I recently filled out the HP Fanfiction Subreddit Survey, and two of the questions and subsequent user answers got me thinking. Specifically [[https://i.imgur.com/ba2K6Hb.png][the questions about the results of Albus Dumbledore's actions]]. In my case, I voted that Dumbledore did indeed leave both the Wizarding World and Harry better off with his decisions, but this was certainly a divisive question. I was initially going to make a post detailing why I decided he made Harry better off, but then I decided fuck it, Dumbledore is one of the most misunderstood Characters in the HPFanfiction fandom in my opinion, I'm just going to write a big blurb detailing my understanding of him instead.

​

So, without further ado, let's begin. Quick disclaimer though, this is being written with literally no research and only my memories of reading the series some years ago along with reading many FF retreads of said series in the recent past, so I may get canon mixed with fanon at some points. Here's to hoping it's nothing major.

​

Let's start with that fateful Halloween night where Dumbledore found two of his friends dead, their child surviving with a curse scar the feels an awful lot like the remains of a failed AK, and the ashes of the Dark Lord that caused it. A big and common complaint people have with the series is why did Dumbledore leave Harry with the Dursleys instead of putting him with another Wizarding family or under Fidelius or similar. Well, the books do a decent job explaining why not, but I'll add some more of my perspective as well. This boy was just orphaned because the Fidelius charm failed due to a naughty secret keeper, so obviously Albus did not exactly trust that at the moment. But what about other magical protections? Well, this baby just survived the unsurvivable. Harry took a good dose of Killer Green right to the noggin and came out with only a nifty scar to show for it. And if Dumbledore is correct, the protection is still active and can be expanded upon to last longer, so why wouldn't he use this when it is likely the most powerful protection he knows of. So of course he takes Harry to the Dursleys. As for how he takes (abandons) him there, well, I'll get to that later.

​

In the next few years, Dumbledore likely spends his time helping rebuild Wizarding Britain, while looking for clues about Voldemort's immortality on the side. Then, PS and CoS happen, and trust me, I'll get to those in a bit as well. But suffice to say, Dumbledore came to really care for Harry in these two books and tries his best to keep him innocent, as seen at the end of PS.

​

We then reach the end of Harry's second year where Harry hands Dumbledore the remains of a "memory" of Voldemort. Of course, Albus quickly realizes what it is, and he also knows that there is no way Tom would trust any of his followers with the only key to his immortality, so there are likely more out there. And hasn't Harry shown some weird symtpoms lately? His scar hurts when near Voldemort and he is a parselmouth when none of his family showed the trait. Dumbledore begins fearing the worst.

​

It is at this point that any "Greater Good" Dumbledore would kill Harry immediately with little to no remorse, but canon Dumbledore does not. In fact, he likely spends his time digging around for memories of young Tom to confirm his suspicions while looking for a way to kill the Horcrux in Harry without harming him in the process. He has time after all, Voldemort has yet to return to a body. All the while, he is preparing himself to do the unthinkable and kill a child he has come to love should Voldemort actually return.

​

But then, Voldemort does something Dumbledore never expected; he used Harry's blood to resurrect himself thus binding him irrevocably to the very protection that kept Harry alive all those years ago. A smidgen of an idea worms it's way into Dumbledore's head, and it just won't leave. Maybe, just maybe, if Harry dies at the end of Voldemort's wand, and not just dies, but sacrifices himself knowingly for the sake of others, like his mother did for him, the protection would prevent Harry's untimely death again. But this scenario is so out there, and so unlikely, it doesn't seem worth betting on. But with Dumbledore not finding any other ways to rid Harry of his Horcrux, he eventually affirms that he will do his best to lead to this case, as it is the best hope for Harry's survival.

​

Until then, he will fight the war for Harry, continuing his search for the other Horcruxes while trying to keep Harry out of everything so that he can at least maybe have some happy memories. After all, it isn't likely that Harry will survive this war. Dumbledore doesn't change his mind until Harry and friends invade the DoM and ultimately get Sirius killed, which forces him to acknowledge Harry as a person with agency instead of a child. Dumbledore then affirms to do better, as seen in his discussion with Harry at the end of OotP.

​

At this point, Dumbledore knows that Harry will get involved no matter what, so he just goes along with it. He also, at some point in the past year or two, realizes that Harry is the person that will be able to understand who Tom Riddle is the best, and will be most likely to find the remaining Horcruxes, so he begins giving Harry some actual history lessons for once. He meanwhile prepares Severus with the bombshell that will push Harry over the sacrificial ledge and hopes it's enough for Harry to survive.

​

And what do you know, the war ends, Voldemort dies, and Harry gets back up! Dumbledore's plan worked! For years, he feared that Harry would die an early death for the sake of defeating a snake man, but his one hope came to pass, and Harry is finally free of the burden of Voldemort and able to live his life in relative peace. That's exactly what Dumbledore hoped for.

​

In summary, Dumbledore was a man trying to save the wizarding world without sacrificing a child he had come to love, and put all of his eggs in the one basket with even a tiny chance of that working. That's it right? Oh yeah, I said I would come back to PS and CoS earlier, didn't I?

​

Well since I just spent these extremely long paragraphs dissecting what I got from the character of Dumbledore in the HP Series, I'm going to start this section of with the following claim; *In the Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, Albus Dumbledore acts so out of character that I consider him a plot device instead of an actual character.* Phew, bold claim right? Well, let's dive into why I think that.

​

First, and most obvious, literally dropping Harry off at his aunt and uncle's house with only a letter explaining the situation is so horribly inhumane, I don't think I have to explain why. It also horrendously contradicts with the loving man we learn about in the later books. Further, the whole plot of PS just doesn't make any sense. I could definitely see Greater Good Dumbledore hiding the Philospher's Stone in the school he is in charge of behind defenses a group of first years could get past, and many fanfics explore this thought thoroughly. But as I've spent way too many paragraphs explaining, I did not get a greater good vibe from Dumbledore from the rest of the series, so why would he be different here? The Dumbledore of PoA and on would never risk children so brazenly, whether to test Harry, lure Voldemort out, or even to help an old friend.

​

Secondly, if Albus Dumbledore was actually headmaster during CoS, the chamber would have been found the morning after Mrs. Norris got petrified at the latest. From there, Ginny Weasley would have been caught trying to enter the chamber and the diary found soon after. Why so soon? Well, Dumbledore was around the previous time the chamber was opened, damn sure knew who opened it, and knew that there was a perfectly good ghost of the victim residing in Hogwarts. One quick set of questions later, and when Myrtle describes dying after seeing a pair of big scary yellow eyes coming from the direction of that sink and hearing some hissing noises just before that, I'm sure my man can put the rest together.

​

And even if that didn't happen, there is no way the Dumbledore that gets into pissing matches with the ministry in books 3 through 6 on the regular would just sit back and let them sack him with no fight at all when the fucking chamber of secrets is open.

​

This meat sack with no agency is not a character, he is a plot point. And why is he a plot point? Because if Albus Dumbledore was actually a character, the first 2 books would be called "Harry Potter and the Relatively Normal First Year at Magic School" And "Harry Potter and that time Dumbledore solved the case of the Petrified Cat"

​

In short, JK Rowling was not good enough at writing a good mystery story without compromising the characters not directly involved in the plot at this point in time. She wanted Harry to grow up abused and unknowingly special, have Wacky Wise Old Wizard Man leave him on the doorstep. Harry needs a good quest with reasonable challenges, have the McGuffin at the end of an obstacle course for first years instead of actually locked away. Harry needs to learn about Evil Wizard's Childhood, have Harry solve case without regards for how adults should be able to solve it too.

​

Truthfully, I am able to look past these flaws in Dumbledore in PS and CoS because I can rationalize that they are there for the plot and so OOC it doesn't even feel like Dumbledore in the first place. However, I can understand why people can't and don't look past these flaws also.

​

Holy shit, that was 1712 words.

​

*TL;DR*

*Dumbledore put all his eggs in the basket with the best hope of Harry surviving. Dumbledore in PS and CoS is so OOC that I don't count him as actually Dumbledore.*

​

Well, now that's finally over. Did I change your views on Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, do you disagree with my essay on a fictional wizard, or did you even read this damned thing? I did flair this as a discussion, so go ahead and discuss!

There's something you haven't taken into account in your explanation, and it's this passage from GoF that had 12 year old me extremely suspicious of Dumbledore:

#+begin_quote
  For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's eyes. But next second Harry was sure he had imagined it, for when Dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk, he looked as old and weary as Harry had ever seen him.
#+end_quote

A more plausible explanation is that Dumbledore was basically double dog daring Voldemort to use Harry's blood. Why else would he allow the Triwizard Tournament to go ahead? If the Goblet is weak enough to be confunded by Crouch Jr, it can surely be undone by a wizard of Dumbledore's puissance.

How on earth did Dumbledore immediately know Voldemort's plan had been subverted? Either he can think faster than the speed of plot (which is likely but still never confirmed) or he was hoping/planning for something similar all along. A smidgen didn't just "worm it's way into his head", this smidgen was ready at the starting line waiting for the gun.

This is basically the whole point of fanon bashing of Dumbledore, that especially in earlier books he acts in ways that no truly competent super smart wizard would. The Doylist answer, which is the correct answer IMHO, is that Rowling switches genres from children's adventure novel to teenage coming of age novel somewhere in the middle of the series. Thus Dumbledore of The Philosopher's Stone is not the Dumbledore of The Half Blood Prince. The Watsonian answer however, the one that fandom seems to have run with, is that Dumbledore is either incompetent or malicious towards Harry.

And how would Dumbledore know what Voldemort was planning in the first place? This requires even greater leaps of logic, than to intuit that taking up Harry's blood within could help Harry. The fact that Dumbledore appears just as weary after that seems to indicate that this is at best a hopeful possibility.

Harry would not have survived long with Dumbledore being malicious towards him. As for Dumbledore being incompetent, that would explain him allowing Harry to be captured by Voldemort but not understanding the entire intricacy of the plot and guessing how it could be subverted.

** Regardless how much I have criticized Dumbledore's failing as a military and political leader, going as far as calling him a “criminally negligent shithead” for his pathetic actions in Year 6, he was at least determined to fight Voldemort's sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums until the very end. He had also worked out the key to Voldemort's immortality and gave to his life in the line of duty.

On the other hand, the government of Magical Britain submitted to Voldemort without any resistance. We can observe that a large part of its bureaucracy was very willing to collaborate with Voldemort and implement his sadistic genocidal policies enthusiastically.

Therefore, I do consider Dumbledore's actions beneficial for the Wizarding Britain simply because the alternative is a lot worse.

Otherwise he was gathering often useless information (without acting on it as to not endanger Snape!) and recruiting useless people into his order (seriously, the only people in that Order worth anything are the Aurors (Shacklebolt, Tonks and Moody) and Sirius and Snape! The others? They are like carrying dead weight, especially Molly the housewife (who should have never killed Bellatrix, as it is unrealistic as hell!))

Dumbledore was not willing to muzzle Snape (who made Hogwarts even more intoa deatheater-recruitment-center than it already was!), outlaw pureblood bullshit, stop bullying etc. etc.

Dumbledore was the absent chess master for most of the books! Hell, he admitted to avoiding Harry in 'Order of the Phoenix' (and to knowing about Harry's abuse at the hands of the Dursleys..."...ten dark and difficult years...")

*** But what about beneficial for Harry? I didn't really explain it properly, but one of the points I was trying to make was that even if Harry suffered due to Dumbledore's decisions in the series, they were always for his good (at least book 3 and after) and all for the goal of a happy ending. And I felt that with that happy ending, he left Harry better off then without all of the "Scheming".

But since the story is from Harry's POV, no one really knows what goes on in Dumbledore's head, one of the great things about fanfiction.

Even with training, it would probably have taken decades for Harry to be ready to face Voldemort, and that's without taking into account the Death Eaters, or the fact that he could have lost.

I believe Dumbledore truly wanted for Harry to have a childhood, and a shitty one at the Dursley was probably preferable to the fate of a child soldier.

Book Dumbledore suffers from plot point syndrome in 1-3 (100% agree and thanks for using awesome words to say it). But plot point syndrome (to me st least) is present in movie Dumbledore throughout.\\
I feel that the movie Dumbledore was just colder and less caring than I imagined book Dumbledore.

** Personally, I think part of the issue with Dumbledore is that he was 1) head of the school, 2) head of the Wizengamot, and 3) head of the International Confederation of Wizards. For someone who claimed to not trust himself with power, he evidently doesn't trust other people with power either. To me, he seems to have a patronizing attitude toward the wider Wizarding world. Which, to be fair, is kind of because the wider Wizarding world seems full of illogical sheep all armed with a personal tool for lunacy and mayhem.

Ignoring that personal aside, he still has three very powerful, probably very busy positions. That's a lot for one guy, even one as awesome as Dumbledore. He's going to miss things and let others slip between the cracks. He can't do everything but he tries to anyway and therefore some of what he does falls short.

** I think something people discount a lot about Dumbledore, is the motherfucker is old 118 years old at the time of his death, Dumbledore was still sharp but I feel the years would have started to weigh on him, the first wizarding war would have sucked most of all, He most likely went to school with a potter and then taught a few potters before becoming headmaster -using potter as an example as it relates to harry-

I imagine dumbledore might have become fond of certain familes, we know the potters have never been ones for blood purity so dumbledore might have found them to be good allies over the years.

and Dumbledore watches James enters Hogwarts as a young arrogant kid, and he watches him befriend a werewolf and a black he watches the young James potter grow up and mature. then straight out of Hogwarts James potter Joins Dumbledore order of the phoenix and then James potter gets cut down before the prime of his life

and now Dumbledore is watching harry grow up, and Dumbledore has a fondness for harry since his birth, and he watches him grow up

and hopes that he will not have to watch harry join his parents in an early grave.

Being a teacher who sees a generation of students be scared by war most be a horrific experience now imagine that same teacher watched those students parents grow up and now is currently looking after that generation students kids knowing another war is coming.

Dumbledore is a deeply tragic charcter, he is an old man filled with regrets and mistakes hell his last living action is begging a former student of his to kill him so that a current student of his who has been press ganged into it does not have too.

*** I agree with the point you made about Dumbledore's age. He was over 100 and well past his prime. You mentioned the first wizarding war but also add the war against Grindenwald. He already fought in two wars with heavy losses before Voldemort's resurrection. Honestly, I think one of the most difficult things is that everyone became deferential to him. He got used to working on his own because everyone expected him to have the answers. Even if someone didn't agree with an idea he had, they went along with it anyway. I can't say if he truly expected Harry to die in the end but if he was weighing Harry's life and the existence of the British Wizarding World, I can't truly fault him for choosing the latter. Do I hate everything that happened in Harry's life and could have happened? Of course but war isn't always about doing what's morally right regardless of the side.

Having him grow up with horrible people who despise him makes no sense and is counterintuitive to his stated goals. There had to be another option and seeing that he appointed himself as the master of this plan he should have come up with something. Based on how he was treated growing up Harry should have become the next Voldemort but didn't in spite of Dumbledore's decision.
2. Involve other people and have them actually help with the plan. Imagine a world where Dumbledore explained all of his thoughts and theories with those he trusted and had them help with the plan and in looking for horcruxes. Based on his age, position and experience he has access to the greatest wizarding minds in the world...he uses none of them to help.
3. Stop sitting on your ass at Hogwarts and do something. The argument could be made that he stayed at Hogwarts to protect Harry and stop a new generation of death eaters at the school. If that is the case he failed spectacularly as Harry was constantly in danger and Draco and co. were allowed to do what they wanted with impunity. Dumbledore took very few actions at Hogwarts and was seemingly unaware of everything happening under his nose.
4. Explain everything to Harry and make him a true partner much earlier. Explain why Snape acts the way he does and why he trusts him. Explain the Deathly Hallows...don't make him sort it out based on a children's story and vague clues. Give him the resurrection stone and trust him to use it at the right time instead of putting it in a fucking golden snitch with a riddle. To this day I still cannot wrap my head around why Harry could only learn he was a horcrux at the end.

I touched on this in the story I wrote but it sums up Dumbledore to me: He gives a great speech at the end of GOF stressing the importance of doing what is right over what is easy. In regards to Harry, Dumbledore seems to always make the easy choice, not the right one.

***** 1. The blood protection from Lily was stronger than any other protection.

2. Who could he trust? The magical government of Britain literally collapsed when their PM got imperiused.

3. He found out voldy had horcruxes, he found their probable locations.

4. For him, Harry was an innocent child whom he didn't want to put a burden on. Will you go to an 11 year old orphan and tell him he has to die?

  Deathly hallows
#+end_quote

Harry wasn't supposed to find or use the deathly hallows. He was just supposed to understand Dumbledore's suicide plan. He gave Harry the resurrection stone as a proof that hallows exist but made it not easily accessible so that Harry doesn't face the same fate as the 2nd brother.

#+begin_quote
  Snape
#+end_quote

Snape would not have liked Harry knowing that the reason Snape was helping him was because Snape liked his mum.

#+begin_quote
  Harry learning he was horcrux at the end
#+end_quote

Would he have the will to destroy the horcruxes if he realised he was going to die? Would he have killed himself that very instant to kill voldy? Too many uncertainties arose from telling Harry that.

- I'm not arguing the blood wards didn't provide some protection. I'm arguing that there were other options that would not have forced Harry to suffer his entire childhood. Throwing your hands up and saying 'blood wards' and fucking off for 10 years while the Dursleys treated Harry like shit isn't the act of a hero.

#+end_quote

- So the argument is it is okay to keep Harry, the savior of the wizarding world who was knowingly placed in an abusive environment to be raised, in the dark because it wouldn't be right to hurt Snape's feelings? Just as a reminder, Snape is in part responsible for Lily and James being murdered. But his feelings and state of mind are more important than Harry's. Not assuring Harry of Snape's loyalties only risked Dumbledore's plan more.

  He found out voldy had horcruxes, he found their probable locations.

-And yet he was only able to find and destroy one...and because he chose to go by himself he ended up with a fatally cursed hand. Imagine if he had enlisted other allies to brainstorm and scout locations and to help Harry after he died.

-How about at 12 when that same boy was able to find and destroy one of the horcruxes and save a dying student thanks only to himself and his friends? At this point he has been attacked twice by Voldemort. Does he deserve to know anything yet?

-How about at 14 after he watched Cedric die and was tortured after helping resurrect Voldemort? Don't you think at this point Harry deserved to know the truth? Nah...best to send him back to the people who despise him and tell his support group...the people who love Harry... not to contact him.

-How about at 15 when he literally says "I am going to tell you everything."

-How about at 16 when he knows he is dying and is running out of time. I'm pretty sure Harry is feeling pretty burdened already at this point.

-Throughout the books Harry had proven time and time again that is exactly what he would do. If Dumbledore truly believed in Harry than he should have trusted him with the truth.

****** I disagree. There was a password on it. If Dumbledore wanted Harry to avoid the second brother's fate, he would have hidden the stone, not give it wrapped to Harry.

Dumbledore used it to ensure Harry dies. Right after he uses it, it willingly goes to his death, just like the second brother. Dumbledore might not have been evil, but it's my headcanon he's stuck in limbo for his actions towards Harry.

Damned, raise him outside of England! Give him a fake name, don't even tell his foster parents the real name (hide the damn scar if you can)

**** Did he? It is never shown that Dumbledore even tried removing the 'crux! Hell, he could have asked Grindelwald or other dark wizards, but we never hear about that, so IMHO he didn't want to try at all!

He could have locked Voldemort up in solitary, so he goes totally insane (so that he stops being an effective, if cruel, leader!)

** I agree with you. The only thing I believe Dumbledore really fucked up on big was leaving Harry with the Dursleys. He /did/ state in book 5 that he knew Harry's living conditions weren't "ideal", and the fact he knew about the abuse Harry had suffered is a big negative for him. How ironic the supposed reason for Harry to live in the muggle world was to have a normal childhood. Other than that, I'm sure Dumbledore did want Harry to live and tried to find ways for him to survive, but just couldn't before he died.

** My problem with Dumbledore is:

a) That he does things he shouldn't (I bet there's laws against leaving teenagers on doorsteps, hell he probably had to put a lot of muggles under the imperius (or other spells!) to create a paper-trail for Harry (he was born to wizard-parents and I doubt Lily and James registered his birth with muggle authorities!)...he also allowed bullying at his school and raised Harry as a sacrifice instead of doing the right thing and either not doing that at all or killing Harry himself (and dealing the horcrux!))

b) His secrecy (he could have easily had questioned the order members under veritaserum and legilimency to weed out traitors and after that he could have them help Harry hunt for the horcruxes!)

c) He trusts the wrong people and puts too much pressure on them! He trusted Snape for example...and he pressured the man into doing things he hates (teaching, spying, helping Harry) and he also put too much pressure on Harry (seriously, use your god forsaken order or at least send an auror or two with the kids (Tonks and Moody for example!))

Not to mention that Dumbledore seems a bad teacher...good ones prepare their students if they have to face impossible tasks! What did Dumbledore do? Take a year to show Harry memories...seriously, I'd have told him that in one evening and then I would teach Harry magic that would awe even Voldemort, on the off chance that he can get a lucky hit (or a surprise hit)

For me Dumbledore is a spineless coward!

Spineless, why? Because he never tried to deal with the issues that caused Voldemort's rise in the first place (pureblood supremacists openly call people mudbloods in his school, the deatheaters got away (if the ministry will not act, then act yourself and kill them - seriously, you already have a vigilanty organisation!) etc.) and he also didn't have the balls to kill Harry himself, instead he became an accessory to child-abuse and child-endangerment!

Coward, why? Well, he avoided confronting Voldemort when he could probably have easily bated Voldemort (take that damn prophecy orb and pull a Sorcerer's Stone 2.0 but with yourself as the guard!)

ps: What innocence? The Dursleys beat that out of him years before Hogwarts! Harry is a jaded individual IMHO, not much of an "intact childhood" left!

** I think that the reason behind Dumbledore's ooc-ness is that the first 3 books seen like they are written for kids (at the end of the book all is well) but from the 4th book onwards it becomes directed at adults too (actions have consequences). But I completely agree with your points. JKR didn't think far into the future while writing.
