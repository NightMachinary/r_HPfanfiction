As it is widely known and acknowledged on this sub, Daphne Greengrass is hardly ever mentioned in Canon. In fact, I'd wager that the reason most people even come to know of her outside this unique community of ours is because of her sister who is maried to Draco Malfoy and is only named as a Greengrass in The-Play-That-Must-Not-Be-Named. Anyway, as has been covered already, Daphne Greengrass is basically a blank slate, an OC that has avoided the dreaded tag of 'OC' and is readily accepted in most stories where an OC would be shunned.

But that in itself shouldn't be the only reason for her success. After all, there are pleanty of characters that Rowling didn't flesh out, some of them even female and Harry's age! So why does Daphne Greengrass get so much coverage while Hannah Abbott and Susan Bones and countless other would be bachelorettes get sidelined?

My theory:

Positive Reinforcement

Daphne Greengrass is almost unanimously in Slytherin, I've not seen a story where that wasn't the case. With so many bad apples already in the house, nealy every author who uses Daphne in their story chooses to make her 'different' from the rest. Authors who don't like Slytherin or want to use them as the big bad hardly ever take the time to explicitly drag Daphne Greengrass through the mud with them, so in a way, her name remains 'untarnished', even if its implied everyone in Slytherin is bad. After all, if Rowling doesn't take the time to mention her, why would an author who is using an entire house as an overly exaggerated bad/evil entity mention her? Basically, what I'm trying to get at is that Daphne Greengrass is hardly ever played in negative light, at least by the end of a story. Sure, she can be bitchy or mean, but by the end, she is the snarky good Slytherin.

Now, with that in mind, when a reader opens their first Daphnee Greengrass story and read about this different Slytherin who isn't all that bad once you get to know her, they begin forming their own head canons. They begin to have their own thoughts about who Daphne Greengrass really is. But, as is a common theme with any kind of FanFiction, a reader is left wanting more after a story, good or otherwise. They want the Daphne Greengrass that is now their head canon in a different setting, or maybe tweaked just a bit form the last story they read, or what have you. But, as we all know, we can never seem to find that one perfect story. So...

They make it. Not everyone, mind you, but enough people want that vision badly enough to strike out on their own and create what they've envisioned, adding to the ever growing pool.

So, the reason we see so much of her these days is because there is already so much of her. A redundant statement, I know, but its the only one that makes sense to me.

Am I crazy, or am I right? Is there something I'm totally missing that better explains this fascination this community has with a barely mentioned character?


** If it's a Haphne fic, it helps they have the paradigm (usually) of being an adorable opposite pairing, while also having the fact their relationship would probably be frowned upon makes it interesting to see their struggle. The idea that their relationship would make waves isn't that much of a stretch, given how much Slytherin and Gryffindor hate each other in the books.

******* It's complete fanon, but it's passed along as a book thing because on a superficial level, it /sounds/ like something the Dursleys would do.

But if you think about it, it doesn't make sense. Intellectualism was never a trait the Dursleys valued. They're a family who have a subscription to the /Daily Mail/. Dudley didn't need to have good grades, because he was going to Smeltings as a legacy student. And their praise for him wasn't because of his academic achievements, but because he became school boxing champion.

The closest thing in canon is a single line where Harry is ordered not to ask questions.

#+begin_quote
  "Don't ask questions---that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys."

Otherwise there's nothing in the books to indicate that Harry ever had to handicap his grades for Dudders.

** As an avid Haphne shipper, part of the appeal is certainly the “making Slytherin not all evil” angle. I also imagine there's a bit of the Everygirl approach to Daphne's character too, where writers can really make her character to be anything because she's an entirely blank slate. Characters like Harry and Ron and Hermione, their personalities are well-established and are expected. With Daphne, no one knows what to expect, and it challenges the writer to actually create a three-dimensional character on their own without relying on Rowling's portrayal of them.

In addition, in many cases Daphne's addition as a main character allows the writer to explore various underrepresented aspects of the Wizarding World, such as Harry's more Slytherin nature, Wizarding politics, and the like. More intrigue is added as a result which allows characters to be challenged and grow in new ways.

**** Why couldn't it be both? It all comes down to why the person reads the pic and why the person writes it. For many writers, Daphne's character gives readers validation in that Slytherin house is not just a collection of Wizarding Hitler Youths. Most of the Haphne pics out there depict her and her family as neutral leaning towards the light, and obviously Harry's influence pushes them to stand firmly against Voldemort. Beyond that, there is a certain allure that Slytherin House has because of JK's portrayal of it, because the human brain is a weird place that tends to romanticize and be attracted to the dark and mysterious. So yes, I definitely think it could be both.

#+end_quote

On top of the lack of history with Harry that the rest of the named Slytherin cast carries (Zabini is a raging elitist, Parkinson is a snitch, Crabbe and Goyle are dumb thugs, Bulstrode is unnattractive, Draco is racist), Daphne doesn't only have her blank slate nature as an advantage, she doesn't have a list of crimes to repent for.

This means that Daphne can be the safe, non-problematic way to hook Harry up with refined, cultured Pureblood Etiquette, and turn him from an everyman kid into the powerful, respected Lord Potter. She's basically the straight version of Draco in Drarry fics, without the author having to find ways to Leather Pants her, or make Harry gay.

I think one of the big appeals of fanfiction is giving a protagonist an attractive, high-status, and above all, /loyal/ partner, and Daphne is a character who can easily be fit into the mold. She can be made into the perfect partner for a happy, satisfying, and cathartic fic, without having to file off the personality flaws like for characters such as Draco and Hermione. And isn't catharsis and satisfaction why we first turned to fanfic in the first place?

**** "OC" carries too much of a stigma from the early years of HP fanfic, where shitty, inexperienced young writers first dipped their toes into storytelling. For every interesting, well-rounded OC like Milo from /Natural 20/, you get 5-10 Ebony Dark'ness Ravenways from /My Immortal/.

It's like how songfics are universally derided, because their reputation has been ruined by too many kiddie authors with a hard-on for Evanescence.

To get readers to give them a chance, most authors refrain from using OC's whenever possible. It also gets them more visibility, as readers searching for pairing tags look for specific named characters, not OC's.

** Comparing Daphne to Susan, I feel like Susan is used as an excuse to get Harry to associate himself with her Aunt Amelia and thus her position in the Ministry. Daphne, on the other hand, is often seen as something of a forbidden fruit, as one of your replies suggests. Susan is far more a means to an end. Daphne is more an end to a means, I suppose. People want to pair Harry with someone who's basically the opposite. Daphne's a pureblood Slytherin compared to Harry, who is of course a halfblood Gryffindor. I've seen surprisingly little in the way of interactions between Harry and Draco as brothers-in-law.

Even though Susan is mentioned in most (all?) of the books, we don't know much more about her compared to Daphne. We know their houses, blood status, and a somewhat important relative. Susan is in Dumbledore's Army is the only other tidbit that jumps out at me. A lot of these stories use Daphne, Susan, et al. as quasi-OCs, because as you recognize, OCs are not super popular.

** Her being the straight alternative to Drarry, the prospect of her being a ‘good' Slytherin, ‘The Chosen One' acting rebellious, the Romero and Juliet aspect, there's a lot of reasons for her popularity and all of them are correct. I especially like the proposal that Haphne fics naturally breed more Haphne fics, I hadn't thought about it like that before and it's absolutely true. I got started writing for the ship myself from not being able to find my idealised version of them in others peoples work, so I wrote my own. It's commonplace that people will take the elements that they most enjoyed about Daphne from other stories and place them in their own, like a FanFiction for a FanFiction, which is how the ‘Ice Queen' demeanour trope has ended up getting attached to her so much.

They have so many things going for them that would make their relationship interesting, as another commenter puts it, the drama literally writes itself. Everyone loves a scandalous, defrosting Ice Queen story.

** She's a blank slate, which allows her to be anything - within reason.

But more than that, she's a blank slate with an established fanon personality - this allows people to use her without feeling like they are, putting in the work for, or being judged for making an OC.

In particular, her established fanon personality - cold but secretly loving, sarcastic and witty, clever and pragmatic, and a non-Pureblood supremacist Slytherin from a "grey" or neutral family - is a character archetype entirely missing from JK's work, and canon feels poorer for it. It's also especially useful when writing certain popular types of fic.

Slytherin Harry of all forms, especially WBWL or other non-Dark Slytherin Harry fics, Indie!Harry, Grey!Harry and Dark!Harry, for a start.

Generally speaking, she offers a chance for exposition on Dark Magic, Wizarding Politics, Pureblood Culture, Death Eater History and the like - all things that JK totally ignored - as well as a ready made friend/love interest/rival for a Harry in Slytherin. She also provides an interesting counterpart for him because of her cold and cunning personality as compared to Harry's canon persona as King Boy-Scout.

Finally, I think there's an element of meme/trope to it - because she's been used so much, she's taken on a life of her own and propagates through fics just because we're all so used to her being present.

**** Yeah, canon Harry broke every rule in the book at the drop of a hat, the moment it inconvenienced him, no matter what petty or stupid reason he had to try and justify it. Like being invisible and sneaking into Hogsmeade after his form wasn't signed while a murderer was after him...

Snape was right about Harry on one thing: he was as arrogant as his father, thinking no rule ever applied to him unless he wanted it to. It just so happens that this penchant for flaunting any rule in the world also allowed him to do some good in the world too, and beat Voldemort.

Remember that time he tried to torture Bellatrix or the time he Imperius'd people or the time he left Umbridge to be assaulted and possibly killed by centaurs or the time he decided to kill a man in cold blood at the age of 13 or that time he hurt Ron for coming to check on him or that time he deliberately traumatized Slughorn with the details of Lily's death to coerce him into giving him his memories or the time he blows off Cho because he can't be fussed with her grieving or the time he supported Hermione's curse on Edgecombe to Cho's face or the entire first half of OotP when he screams at basically anyone who talks to him or the time he stops talking to Hermione because she thought his Firebolt might have been sent by Sirius Black when it was, in fact, sent by Sirius Black or the time or the time he tortures the Carrows out of revenge for spitting on McGonnagal or the time he owned a slave?

​

But your post is intentionally misgiving to paint the reality in a certain way, a fallacy. Harry used Impero one time in a very specific situation to save the day as always.

Cho's incident = Are you kidding? Lacking empathy or not being tactful isn't morally questionable.

Edgecomb = she betrayed a whole group of teenagers to a...child abuser that they tried to defy. She gets lucky with her punishment. The people that she betrayed were fed Veritaserum. But again not morally questionable...

Being angsty (after you have seen the death of a friend and been tortured the summer prior) or having a tantrum isn't morally questionable. We call that hitting puberty in real life or coping with traumatic events... Just sayin'

He didn't traumatize Slughorn at all. Stop making bullshit. Slughorn feels guilty because he knows that he gave to Riddle knowledge that helped him to become Lord Voldemort.

Owned a slave? Please, are we talking about house elves? It's a fallacy to say Harry is a slave master pure and simple...

** It's pretty simple TBH. There's an appeal to having a sympathetic character from Slytherin - and Daphne, being a blank slate, lets us work away rather easily there. That can be helpful for things like romance, working into the pureblood structure of the world, etc.

There are plenty of other characters who are blank slates - but the ones you list aren't in Slytherin, which has (for romance) a star crossed lovers appeal, and for other ones it has a 'redemption' goal.

From Slytherin itself, it really only has Daphne and Tracey Davis as mostly blank slates and female characters. Daphne has the much more interesting name (which, early on in FF, would lend itself better to a pureblood character even before we knew a bit more about her family) and from there it's easy to flesh her out/why she doesn't seem to agree with or work with the other, 'bad' slytherins.

Afterwards, there's the concept of it entering the fandom and reinforcing fics. Why don't we see more Tracey Davis as 'good' slytherin love interest fics? Because Daphne is the default for that now, and using her lets us draw from that sense of wider fandom 'understanding' of the situation
