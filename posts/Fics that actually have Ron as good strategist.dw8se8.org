** It's been /years/, but a while back author theelderwand at HPFF wrote a couple of post-DH novels, /Children's Crusade/ and /Stop All the Clocks/, where he wrote Ron as a hero alongside Harry. They're still up on the site.

Caveat: there were a lot of things I did not care for in the fics, I think eldy took a lot of liberties with the trio's characterizations, and I found the Ron/Hermione interactions really OOC, which is a bummer because I am like the first mate of that ship and I love it when I find them written as a functional couple and Ron not turned into some kind of neglectful POS. Anyway, eldy makes it kind of a “ ‘Mione” sorta relationship on steroids if that makes any sense.

But, the thing I did like about what eldy did is that he recognized Ron as a great strategist, and the fics are action/adventure so it's in there plenty. Just keep in mind I haven't read the fics in like 8 years, but they did leave an impression on me for how respectfully he treated Ron. Also, IIRC, it gets a little AU.

I get your frustration. Ron's not a dumbass, he has a brain but as a teenager he is lazy and doesn't apply himself. You know, /like a teenager/.

** Linkffn(The Granger Principle)

Ron and Harry are capable strategists and fighters. A little cautious, but hey, trained by Moody. Although they're not quite as good at 4d chess as Dumbledore.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

** I'm a little hesitant to recommend it, but Ron is both highly loyal and highly capable in linkffn(Blood of the Phoenix). That said, it's kinda tropey and kinda squicky, so it's definitely not for everyone.
