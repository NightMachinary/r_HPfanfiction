[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/9/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/17/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force][The Havoc side of the Force]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11417036/1/][Equilibrium]]. I love these but they are unfinished and probably abandoned. I want more. My main problem is that I'm not interested in Harry being born in the SW universe, or SW characters in the HP Universe. Harry appearing in the SW universe (and staying there) is just perfect.

(I have read Revenge of the Wizard but for some reason I never finished it)


** Havoc side is definitely still updating fairly regularly. And it has its companion fic linkffn(The Unsuspecting Side of the Force by Tsu Doh Nimh) which also updates decently often

  It wasn't the bright and shiny Jewel of the Galaxy you've all seen on the HoloNet. Harry's story started in the Underworld, a kilometer below the upper levels of Coruscant, where you never walk the streets alone, especially if you don't have a blaster hanging by your side. He left for a little while, but now it's called him back, whether he realizes it or not.

** these stories are all the ones currently being read by me or have been favorited and aren't already listed.

Of the ones listed, the ones I don't recommend are Eye of the Storm and The Lord of the Light. Eye because if I remember right, it's not very well written and Lord of the Light just because it's not nearly as good as the second story in the trilogy but it's at least better than the first story. And I think maybe Dying Embers I wouldn't recommend either? I can't remember at the moment what it's about/like.

linkffn(The katarn side by darth marrs; shiver me timbers by wolfd890; jedi that would not die by theguardianoflight; harry tano by thebeardedone; broken chains by darth marrs; eye of the storm by dz2; The lord of the Light by Darth Marrs; dying embers by kalistar)
