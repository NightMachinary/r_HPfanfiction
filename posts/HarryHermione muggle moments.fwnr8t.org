Hi yall

Here's my request: do you know fics (or chapters) where Harry and Hermione bond over muggle stuff? I love to read H&H friendship snippets but the ones involving muggle references are the best!

Thanks in advance Hope you all are safe and sane

*** I think the OP is about platonic fics rather than harmony romance.

** There's this little outtake from FloreatCastellum's The Aurors.

ETA: I think Northumbrian's "Zoinks!" fits this too.

** In linkffn(Harry is a Dragon, and that's okay by Saphroneth), Harry is a /massive/ bookwyrm. So Harry, Hermione, and even Dean get to bond over book references, and then they bring Neville and Ron into the mix and it's a great time.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Not Harry, but linkao3(12927441) could be of interest as well.

  Justin loves being a wizard. He does. But some of the things they insist on are stupid. One day, when he can't take it anymore, someone in the library understands.
