Just read a fic where Harry got thrown back in time and fell in love with Eileen Prince and fathered Snape. Of course Harry cast a glamour on him and was thrown back to the present... Now having to deal with being the father of a man old enough to be his own father. This is such a strange story and honestly i had my reservations about it but it was done pretty well I thought. Does anyone else have stories similar? It was a response to a prompt to maybe there's one out there.

**** I'm sorry. I really don't recall. But it's a pretty rare story and I know it was on ffn. I would filter the Harry Potter section of characters: Merlop Gaunt, Harry Potter (and maybe Tom). I forgot if it was written before ffn let u tag more than 2 characters.

linkffn(6715591) has Harry as Tom's /adoptive/ father - could this be what you're looking for? Also has (story spoilers, don't click til you've read!) Tom/Minerva McGonagall in a relationship, which is one of my favorite AU rarepairs.

**** Oh god. Ok so I was curious and I took my own advice.

These are the two contenders. The fic I read was good but idk if either of these are it. They're just the closest approximations I could find based on what I remember and the story summary.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7505410/1/If-I-Could-Have-Been-There]]

Link just in case I didn't use the bot right.

Pretty sure no one else has mention this. But while reading No Difference I also found a fic named /If I Could Have Been There/ by tess4aria on ff.net. It's a continuation / alternate path of /No Difference/, where Harry chooses to stay in the past with Eileen and Snape.

It's got pretty good writing, with very nice domestic moments. I'd give it a try if you want to see interactions between Harry and child Snape. Along with Eileen, who felt so quickly brushed aside in /No Difference/ imo.
