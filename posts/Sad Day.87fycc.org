It was a somber day at the Burrow, no one was looking forward to this.

Harry was helping with the arrangements for later that day, sooner than he had anticipated, it was time to go.

The Ministry had provided cars for the day again, it was the least they could do but as it was one less thing they had to worry about nobody complained.

The journey took very little time but it felt like an eternity. There were lots of guests, family, friends old and new, even the Malfoy's had turned up...none were expecting this.

After the eulogy many of the guests approched the Weasley's to give their condolences, some simply left quietly.

Harry approched the coffin and noticed a few of the guests had left gifts on the coffin, this made him smile.

Harry was paying his respects when Ginny approched him and said, "Come on, it's time to go". "Okay", said Harry, "Just one more thing".

He reached into his jacket pocket and withdrew his own gift, a rubber duck, which he left next to a plug and a battery, then followed Ginny back to their children and headed home.

*** I don't doubt you, this was my first head canon ever so it probably is nowhere near the best.

**** I'm only taunting you about it because I wrote something along these lines in the latest chapter I posted.

***** Oh, I'd love to read yours.

I actually first shared this in FB a few months ago.

****** The gathering grew in size, spreading out to fill the garden, the orchard, the pond and down the lane towards Ottery St. Catchpole. Many people who had arrived just past the sunrise were still there by midday, as if they wouldn't leave until told to do so. Harry was sitting with Ron when he asked him about it.

"It was like this when we lost Uncle Bilius. They come until they feel everyone expected has arrived, then they shuffle off. I s'pose it's meant to show how much someone will be missed."

"And you're suppposed to just... mingle all day?"

"Some people like to make a speech, but no one has to." Ron nodded towards a makeshift podium where a wizened old warlock was babbling about bendy billiard cues.

Harry stood up. He had no reason to do it. No one had asked him. Being the center of attention certainly wasn't his favorite thing, but in this case, for this man, he'd discovered a need to speak.

He strode over to the podium. A minute later, the man noticed Harry waiting and hurriedly ended his reminiscence with, "Ah, Arthur, I'll miss you."

The warlock nodded to Harry while tapping his own throat with his wand, and then walked off. Harry took his position.

"Sonorous." He felt a swelling in his throat. It didn't obstruct anything but was an odd sensation nonetheless. "Uhh... hi. You may not know me but I'm Harry Potter."

Harry looked up at the crowd and suddenly was caught by waves of pressure that seemed to be coming from them. Every person there was looking at him, and there were a few hundred at least. Emotions were rolling at him in discordant tones and rhythms and it made him dizzy for a moment, until he could center his mind. Once he'd caught his breath, he re-invoked the Harry he wanted to be at that moment, then spoke.

"I haven't known Arthur Weasley for as long as most of you. In fact, he could only convince me to call him Arthur a few months ago. But I'm absolutely blown away - I mean, overwhelmed.

"There are so many people here today. I mean, I knew that Arthur was a nice guy. Very pleasant. Able to put even a really nervous kid like me at ease by asking an odd question about the meaning and function of a rubber duck." Harry chortled, but then took a drink of water to cover for it. "That was Arthur to me- the man who couldn't quite understand muggles, even though they fascinated him. It's no surprise that he would make it his job to protect them from jinxes and the like.

"A nice man, was Arthur. Mind you, the rest of the family is a bit batty... ," he paused to allow some titters to subside, "but Arthur never minded that. I think he liked that about them.

"Yet that doesn't explain all of you being here."

Harry paused again to change the tone of his delivery to something more forceful.

"Nice men die all the time. They die at home or in hospital or when falling victim to something, whether accidental or, uh, malicious. Nice men like that are missed. Their family grieves for them, and friends offer a pat on the back and shot of whisky and the usual, 'Ahh, whatsisname- he was a nice fellow. Cheers.'"

Harry noticed something in the corner of his eye; the previous speaker was grumping a bit. Harry gave him a nod to apologise for using him as an example.

"That doesn't explain all of you coming here. I think the difference is that Arthur Weasley was a good man. Good. Loving, kind, patient with his family and with strangers. Good with a quick joke. Willing to offer advice, but wouldn't be offended if you chose to ignore it. Arthur spoke as quietly as needed but firmly when necessary. He represented his ideals in his every action.

"That's why you're all here. He was a Good man. And I think you're also here for the same reason I am; there's a hole where Arthur was. I... I'm going to miss him. You will, too. Because he won't be there to add his honest opinion any more. His jokes will need to be told by someone else. Someone else will need to disarm the traps and protect the unwary and say nice things to strangers... and calm down frightened young boys with a silly question.

"That's what I wanted to point out. Missing him isn't enough. We need to carry on with his work. If you came here to find a way to deal with the loss of Arthur Weasley, here it is; be him, every once in a while. Add the intentions of a Good man to your life, for Arthur. I don't know how many of you will do it, but let me say that if just a tenth of you strove to add a good Arthur-like deed every once in a while... well, we might be able to keep up with all the good that Arthur Weasley could have done, that he can't do now that he's gone.

"As for me, I've already vowed to do my 'Arthur'-best to improve the lives of those around me, starting with his family. Starting with this speech."

Harry was tempted to stop there. He probably should have, but...

"There's one thing, though. One un-Arthurish thing that I feel I have to do."

He felt the tone of the audience change in response- a hint of curiosity. He could feel their attention building towards him. He let it collect for a few seconds.

"I'm going to track down the creature that did this to Arthur and burn it until it screams," Harry declared, "And I'll keep burning him until he can't scream any more."

The rage was kept in control. He let the heat simmer away from his face and consciously relaxed his shoulders.

"Thank you," he said, invoked a silent Quietus, and then left the podium for the next speaker to have their say.

Of course, he had no idea who came after him as he was enveloped in Weasleys soon after.

******* Awesome read, I don't think Harry would be the type to burn his target until they scream, a bit dark I think, but still a good read :)
