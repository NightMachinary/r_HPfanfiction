I just started thinking about the Fidelius Charm and couldn't turn off my brain. It's literally the most OP spell in the entire universe, from how it's described. Allow me to explain... The Fidelius Charm makes a given informaiton into a secret that people /literally cannot comprehend/ unless the spell is broken by the Secret Keeper revealing it (Rowling states Voldemort could have gone up to their house and looked through the window and his brain just wouldn't have processed that the two people he was seeing were James and Lily Potter). It can clearly remove people's access to knowledge they once had, too, because it was by no means unknown that James and Lily lived in Godric's Hollow before they went into hiding.

*/Do I even need to explain how overpowered this is./*

There are dozens of time a Fidelius Charm could have saved the day in the books: first off, the big one. You don't need all the Obliviators and Co. to uphold the Statute of Secrecy if there's no further restrictions of the spell. Just put a Fidelius on "magic exists", with the various Ministers for Magic serving as Secret Keepers, then immediately let the wizards back in on the secret. At this point wizards could waltz down the streets of New-York casting left and right and no one would bat an eyelid. This scenario is mind-bogglingly bizarre but nothing in the books seems to contradict its possibility aside from the fact that it's not actually how things are done.

...But okay, I hear you, let's assume there are such limitations on the spell that the secret has to be known to a somewhat limited amount of people to begin with for the Charm to work. It's an assumption made by several fanfic writers that the spell becomes exponentionally harder to cast the more people knew the secret in the first place. Fine. I can work with that. /It's still a one-way ticket to Core Threads-level OPness./ For instance...

...how about, as soon as Harry comes back from Little Hangleton Graveyard and tells him about Voldemort's resurrection, having Dumbledore place a Fidelius on the secret: "Voldemort is not actually dead and is seeking followers"? Bam. Voldemort in all his corporal snakey magnificence could walk right up to Lucius Malfoy and yell "I'M BACK FOR MERLIN'S SAKE!", and Lucius would just wonder who this strange, ugly man screaming at him could possibly be. 'Would put a bit of a hinder on Riddle's plans, is all I'm saying.

It can work the other way around, too, for that matter. It boggles the mind that Voldemort didn't think to put a Fidelius Charm on "I have created six Horcruxes and destroying them is necessary to killing me", or on "The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a Basilisk and a Parselmouth is required to find the entrance". Heck, those two would have worked even if the Charm didn't make pre-cognizant people forget the secret, since no one knew these things in the first place.

My point is this is a plot hole the size of the Pacific Ocean and surely someone has thought/can think of a way to close it because SERIOUSLY.


** Maybe I'm too simple-minded, but the most obvious explanation would be that the Fidelius can only be placed on locations, and not, say, concepts or people.

*** Yes, in canon we've only ever seen it work on locations.

An alternative (but related) proposal [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3lf86j/closing_plot_holes_the_fidelius_charm/][I've put forward]] is that it can only work on secrets you /own/. You can't hide knowledge which is in the public sphere, only your own secrets. There is some basis for this in canon: Flitwick describes the secret as being moved from your soul to another person's soul. So it has to be in your soul in the first place in order to use the fidelius. That implies some kind of ownership of the secret.

That in turn forces one to allow magic to recognise property rights of some kind or another, but that's not a big problem. Magic already recognises all kinds of social constructs.

*** I don't think it's ever stated that the fidelius works /only/ on tangibles items, but we have proof that magic does work on concepts or people, like the Voldemort Taboo.

EDIT: Now that I remember, wasn't it said in the 3rd book that it wasn't the /House/ of the Potters that was hidden, but the fact that they were living there?

"An immensely complex spell involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find --- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, *not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!"*

That line tells me that it's not the house what was hidden, but the people in it.

*** That /would/ make sense, but it's just plain not how it works in the books. The house in Godric's Hollow wasn't "concealed" --- it was right there in plain sight; it works rather like what fanon imagines the Notice-Me-Not Charm to work. Re Rowling's statement that Voldemort could have stared long and hard through the window of the Potters' house and just not processed the information that they were /right there/. The /OotP/ movie muddled it all up by making it seem as though Grimmauld Place was physically concealed, but that's not how it actually works, just another example of that movie's chronic inability to get the magic right (like how Apparation was now more like flying while partially turning to smoke, and Death Eaters' smoke being black as opposed to the Order's white).

** Ok, so let's start off with the big assumption: Is it canon that the Fidelius can hide anything other than a set location? All canon examples given seem to suggest that, no, the Fidelius cannot be used for conceptual ideas. It can only be used to hide a location. In this way it's basically an extremely powerful Unplottable charm.

But let's assume that the Fidelius CAN hide concepts. First thing's first, the difficulty. One would assume that the more people who knew a secret, the harder it would be to cast, as you stated. But you also need to account for the effects of the spell itself, and how hard it has to try to keep the Secret kept. You can't assume that the spell CAN NOT be broken. It's a spell, and like all spells it can be blocked or countered. In this vein are the effects of the spell itself; It's incredibly easy for a brain to just skip over the fact that there is no #12 Grimmauld Place, especially when looking at the houses as you pass by. It's a very easy thing to miss. But when it is made very, VERY obvious that there is no #12, then the Secret is put under stress. The cognitive dissonance that the brain would go through in trying to comprehend the Secret would be a great amount, especially if the Secret was being shoved in your face. To do this to a single person would probably cause insanity, assuming the Fidelius was strong enough to hold.

#+begin_quote
  At this point wizards could waltz down the streets of New-York casting left and right and no one would bat an eyelid.
#+end_quote

THIS, however, would put massive, MASSIVE strain on the spell, assuming that the requirements of a spell encompassing the entire world were actually feasible, which it probably isn't. People WILL understand that something is happening. MANY people will understand that. If enough people were to understand that there is SOMETHING happening, even if they don't know exactly what, then the spell would break. Or, tons of people would go insane. Either way there are problems.

There's also the thought that the Fidelius is an extremely high level charm and cannot be used at the slightest whim. Maybe it needs a very concrete foundation on which to build the secret, and a simple thought isn't enough to anchor the spell. Maybe the magic of the horcruxes would interfere with the magic of the Fidelius. Maybe any secret concerning a specific individual - say, Voldemort - needs that individual's exacting permission.

The Fidelius isn't OP, you're just not allowing for any weaknesses.

*** As far as your #12 example, I don't think that's really a breakable secret. If I walked down my own street and didn't find a #12, I'd probably think someone fucked up the numbers and not think about it again. The alternative explanation is so simple to accept rather than "there's a house there that no-one can see".

Otherwise I agree with your idea that if knowledge of the secret is shoved in someone's face, it would either break the secret or they'd become aware that something was very wrong when they weren't able to focus on a specific thought, which would lead to them coming up with a round about explanation of the secret.

*** I wonder...

I've always kind of assumed that, unless you were the secret keeper, you couldn't do anything which would endanger the secret (IE: Tell someone the location of the House of the Potters).

Wouldn't that, in turn, prevent people from casting magic in front of those who weren't already aware of it?

What does this mean for muggleborns? Would parents be unable to comprehend the magic being performed, or would the child not be able to cast magic at all?

It stands to reason that you couldn't just SHOUT the address of a location and break the secret without being the secret keeper.

If it's really just a "strain" and trying to hide an obvious secret could cause those being imposed upon mental damage, could you kill Voldemort by shouting "THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX IS LOCATED AT 12 GRIMMAULD PLACE!", while not being the secret keeper, in his face?

This is an area where the movies unfortunately confused a lot of people. In the books, the Fidelius does not take a location "out of space". It merely takes it out of perception. So Voldemort can be touching Godric's Hollow or Grimmauld Place but not perceive them.

*** carrying on from your point, and I'm not sure this is a headcanon or something I construed from canon, but the secret keeper cannot be the same as the person who cast the charm. The charm is given more power by putting trust into a third party, but obviously that can backfire (see: canon events). It also seems to be a very difficult and near unknown spell - both times in canon we see it used Dumbledore has been the one to cast it (and we all know how Dumbledore is).

My thought process was that while Dumbledore could be the one to cast the charm for the Potter's he wouldn't necessarily know who the secret keeper was, allowing James and Lily to change from Sirius to Peter as their secret keeper without anyone else knowing. Now that I think about it it's more likely Lily or James cast the charm and chose who the secret keeper was. However we don't actually know for certain how the charm works. It might possibly require three people to uphold (like with an unbreakable vow); more risk for betrayal pays back as a more powerful fidelius. But again that is all conjecture.

**** But Dumbledore was the secret keeper the second time. The secret for 12 Grimmauld Place was given to Harry via a note written in Dumbledore's handwriting. That means either 1. someone else cast the fidelius on Grimmauld Place, or 2. the person who cast the fidelius can also act as secret keeper. Also, I'm fairly certain its mentioned in canon that Dumbledore offered to act as secret keeper for the Potters, but they declined.

I don't think the implied limit is on the fidelius caster, but rather on the person whose secret is being kept. The house in Godric's Hollow belonged to the Potters, so they couldn't keep their own secret. Likewise, Grimmauld Place belonged to Sirius, so he couldn't keep the secret.

Edit: Plus its a whole plot point in the last book that Dumbledore's death caused them all to become secret keepers. Dumbledore was definitely Grimmauld Place's secret keeper, and presumable also cast the charm.

And about the other requirements for the charm. What happens when the secret keeper is obliviated? Is that even possible? Can a secret keeper be forbidden from being able to tell the secret?

Perhaps most importantly, is a Horcrux a possible secret keeper for Voldemort? It is clear that at least the Diary Horcrux and Voldemort himself were very distinct, the madness afflicting the actual Voldemort not quite there in the Horcrux. It makes me wonder what mechanisms the Fidelius charm has for determining a third party, since if it looks at souls, and the sliver of Voldemort's soul in Harry were to fuse, would it be possible that Harry could not be Voldemort's secret keeper?

** I wonder if the Fidelius weakens the more people know the secret. So if you have a population of thousands or millions all knowing the same secret, it just may not work. Theres also the fact that those who know the secret become the Secret-Keepers if the previous Secret-Keeper dies. What stops all of them from disseminating the secret of magic?

I also don't think it's any more OP than properly cast invisibility charms for hiding a person. It just covers more aspects (sight, sound, smell, etc) of a person than the individual charms. Plus it only works if you don't leave the charm. If Voldy had put a tracking charm on James when he went out for groceries, for instance, he might have found him that way. We already know that bringing someone past the boundaries if the charm lets them know the secret, after all.

I think it's stated in the books that Voldy can't use the Fidelius because he wouldn't trust anyone enough for that.

This brings me to why I don't think the Fidelius could protect a lie. The Fidelius is based on total and complete trust, and a lie is by definition a breach of trust. It just wouldn't work.

Er, I'm pretty sure you can essentially be your own Secret Keeper.

Sirius is letting Albus use the place for the order but he himself is living there, and Bill is Arhur and Molly's son so of course he is free to spend time there even if the house definitely isn't his in any way.

**** Right, but you still need someone else to cast the charm. You cannot cast the charm and divest the secret on yourself, so Voldy would again need to trust someone else. We can assume he would never trust anyone to cast the charm correctly. We can also assume that if Voldy did divest the secret in someone else, he would kill them shortly after to leave himself the sole Secret-Keeper. This would fail for 2 reasons, I think. First, Voldy's intention to kill his Secret-Keeper would be a lack of trust and interfere with the casting. Second, even if cast correctly, I would think the person hiding the secret killing their Secret-Keeper would again show a complete lack of trust and would break the charm.

And if it is indeed possible for the Secret-Keeper to also be the caster, then it's just another instance of Rowling not thinking out her own story and world. Which there's way too many instances of to begin with.

****** Again, the Vow seems to me to show a lack of trust. The whole point it the charm is that you show trust in another person rather than coercing the Secret to be kept. If the person you entrust a secret to is someone who does bot have the ability to betray it, thats not a lot of trust, is it? I mean, I can tell my cats any manner of thing and they'll never tell a soul because they cannot. I don't trust them not to talk; I know they're unable. However, if I tell my best friend a secret, I trust him not to tell anyone else.

As for Voldy casting only on the location, when I say he doesn't trust his Death Eater, I mean he literally does not have enough trust in them to cast the charm to hide anything, no matter the secret. As in, I fully believe the spell would not cast correctly or at all.

******* The way Unbreakable Vows work in canon, though, they don't render you /unable/ to break them in the way the Fidelius /prevents/ you from telling unless you're the Secret Keeper; it just kills you once you've broken the vow. Technically, it'd still be within the free will of a Vow-bound Secret Keeper to betray the Secret --- it just would have dire consequences. My idle reasoning here is that functionally, the Vow-enabled death would not be all that different from any other consequence that might naturally befall a betraying Secret Keeper --- Peter had to have known Sirius would try to kill him if he betrayed the Potters, for instance.

******** But the Unbreakable Vow, the one time we've seen it used in canon, was used because there was no trust. If it's use is a sign of deep distrust, that is diametrically opposed to the trust I think would be required for the Fidelius. In that case, either the Charm should fail on casting or making the Vow should cause the Charm to fail.

The difference between the Vow and what happened with Peter is simple: the Potters had absolute trust in both Peter and Sirius. It wasn't until after they were betrayed that anyone suspected there was a mole in the Marauders. Peter chose to betray the trust put in him, but no one threatened him if he betrayed that trust. Sirius chose to go after him partly as vengeance and partly to assuage his own guilt. And even if Sirius had threatened Peter, he wasn't the caster. His trust or lack thereof is immaterial for the working of the Fidelius.

In addition, Sirius says he persuaded the Potters to use Peter at the last minute. If he'd cast the spell, using Peter as Secret-Keeper, I think his guilt and need for vengeance would've been much greater. Plus he likely would've mentioned it.

We know it's not Dumbledore. For all his faults I don't think he would've let Sirius go to prison with everyone thinking he betrayed the Potters (whether or not Sirius would've gone down for the murder of a dozen muggles is another matter entirely), and he definitely would not have allowed Peter to be granted the Order of Merlin. Likewise, we know it could not have been Lupin because Prisoner of Azkaban says that Lupin suspected Sirius. He wouldve known it wasn't Sirius if he'd cast the Charm, and that's assuming the Charm didn't fail due to him suspecting Sirius beforehand. The only ones left are Peter, Sirius, and the Potters. We can eliminate Peter under the assumption that the Secret-Keeper and the caster must be different people, and Sirius is unlikely for the reasons listed above. Logically, the Potters are the only ones who could be the casters.

Well, the secret /was/ some variation of "The Potters are hiding in Godric's Hollow", so one could argue the Fidelius would have broken because part of its target secret was now missing --- there /were/ no longer any Potters to be hiding in Godric's Hollow.

  An immensely complex spell involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find --- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!

Flitwick says nothing of the secret having to be a location. He clearly says "secret" and "information".

** Easy. Simply assume that magic isn't simply spell = effect, and that esoteric magics exist, and that the Fidelius is a part of it.

Trying to "balance" the Fidelius like you would a spell in a videogame isn't going to work, and it will also harm the atmosphere of your story.

Let's assume you can only use it on locations, not concepts, as this is how its used in Canon. Let's also assume that the Secret Keeper can't live in the location, since that makes sense with Canon.

How do you definie "live"? This is where the esoterism comes in. Magic isn't a coding language, so there is no real answer. Magic just knows, it either works or it doesn't, and you can't fool it. Even if the secret keeper is kept in a dungeon and obliviated into a blubbering mess that doesn't even recognize the concept of "living somewhere", "Magic" would still recognize this as an attempt to "cheat" the concept, and thus not work.

You don't need to explain that, since the only people that can use the Fidelius, great wizards with significant and deep understanding of magic, already knows you can't trick magic.

And there's your last piece of "nerfing" this overpowered spell: in Canon we only saw Dumbledore use it, I'm pretty sure. Fanfiction writers make it seem like common knowledge, but we only know because our main characters are so involved with Dumbledore. It could be reasonable to assume that very few know about esoteric magics like this, and even fewer can cast it. If only Dumbledore and Voldemort are at this time capable of casting it in Britain, and Voldemort would never trust a Secret Keeper, which is necessary, your "overpowered" solution is already solved.

Why didn't Dumbledore cast it for more Order members? That's really up to what your individual story needs, but we can safely assume it's hard to cast, and/or requires significant upkeep. The best way to "balance" the stronger HP magics is just to assume that you cant just wave your wand and say "Fidelius Maxima" to hide a house. If it requires significant setup, and perhaps some sort of upkeep from the caster, your problem is solved.

- The process to cast the spell, be it meditation or a ritual or a significant chant, whatever fits your story, is cumbersome.

- The process may require expensive or rare components.

- The knowledge to cast the magic is hidden and known only by a few.

- The magic is very hard to cast, and only masterful wizards can succeed.

- Failure to cast the magic properly has significant downsides.

- The caster, and those living in the hidden location, must deeply trust the Secret Keeper.

- The Secret Keeper can not reside in the hidden location for any significant amount of time, nor consider it their home.

- The magic requires constant upkeep, either of resources or components or as a drain on the caster. If your story has magical cores (please no), a constant drain on that would make sure the spell is only used when absolutely necessary. If you want to stay more true to HP, the magic could constantly buzz in the back of the casters mind, forcing them to always keep the secret somewhat in mind, and thus preventing them from using it too many times.

Pick whichever you like of these, and you have your solution for your story. If you use all of them, the only Canon character that would even be able to set up a Fidelius would be Dumbledore, and he would be limited to a small amount of hidden locations.

** I think there one key thing here. The main thing is that whatever you are trying to conceal had to be a SECRET. I think this is a more platonic concept of secret rather than any specific requirements on what a 'secret' is.

What I mean is this: you can't conceal a concept like 'magic is real' because it's not really a secret per say. Sure most muggles don't know, but it's well known about a fairly large community that it can't really be considered a secret. However it doesn't have to be a secret that no one or really few people know either. Look at Grimmauld place. It was the ancestral home of the Blacks. How many people do you think knew that? Bellatrix and Narcissa and Andromeda certainly... Probably Lucius and Rodolphus as well. And what about all the other purebloods who came to visit? No what was secret was the order having their HQ there. But this leads me into my second point...

It likely does have to be a location... This is based on when the trio brought yaxley to HQ after the ministry heist... They only showed him the location by bringing him there by apparition. There was never any thing about them telling him it was HQ. So the secret had to be tied to the location

I dunno maybe this is just one of those things that Rowling wasn't consistent on

The fact that the secret is expressed as hiding a fact does not prevent it from hiding the location.

The confusion that there is some kind of difference in function between the Grimmauld Place Charm and the Godric Hollow Charm is created by the movies, not the books. In the movies the Fidelius Charm moves a location out of space. In the books it moves it out of perception.

So in the books you can touch a location hidden by the fidelius but not perceive that you are doing so. Voldemort could be touching Godric's Hollow, or Grimmauld Place, but not realise they were there.

** i think it already exists after all, people go out of their way to make up explanations for HP Magic. I think ithat it just doesnt work once people have 1st hand witnessed magic and that's what the obliviators are for. plus imagine this: wizarding children would then be born with magic but unable to comprehend that it exists because they werent given the Secret. they cant be told the secret until they'vre developed some, but by that point, their magic could be damaged, so no one risks the fidelius As a side note, anything that happened outside the 7 books, doesnt count as HP canon. FBaWtFT is AU to HP

Ummm, no. Officially, canon is whatever the creator says is canon. Rowling did say Pottermore, /Fantastic Beasts/ and /Cursed Child/ are canon. It's your right to invoke the "death of the author" principle and say /you/ won't consider them canon, but the true, official canon does include them.

** Found this an interesting read.

Also I had a thought...why didn't anyone use the unbreakable vow as well as the fidelius charm? You know like "I know the secret but if I tell anyone I will die" sort of encourages you to keep your mouth shut

*** Personal theory: the most powerful magics seem to require emotion to drive them. The fidelius could require absolute trust or the casting would fail. Any attempts to verify or force that trust in the secret keeper would cause the spell to fail. This would also explain why Voldemort never used it -- he doesn't trust anyone to the degree needed to cast the spell.

**** Yeah, the name fidelius itself means faith. Forcing someone in any way to keep the secret would never work.

Perhaps, but what about making himself the Secret Keeper? He's so phenomenally megalomaniac I'm pretty sure he "trusts himself" plenty enough.

***** There is no precedent for anyone hiding anything with the spell without having someone else to give the secret to. So that's the answer, using yourself as a secret keeper is not canon and at most hypothetical, and doesn't make much sense, and it's one of the worst possible things to do if your problem is that the charm seems overpowered to you.
