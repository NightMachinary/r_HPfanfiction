I mean, it fits well as Diggory sr always wanted to show off his son and volemort is egotistical, so having his rival be selected for the Triwizard tournament would justify him being a threat.

** That could explain a great deal about his attitude afterwards. It's not only the death of his only son, but also the guilt of knowing what truly happened up to that point.

** This is actually kinda the case in A Cadmean Victory. Voldemort had his dude put Cedric in under his own school and swap the actual hogwarts champion with Harry's name

** Doesn't make much sense for the age restriction policy, however. Moody would've had to confound the goblet and then anyone who put their name in but "didn't" succeed could've been selected. I like the theory, but there's just too many holes to justify it being less complex than just entering Harry as the 4th under a new school

*** The age rule wasn't on the Goblet itself, just an added protection around it. That's why Dumbledore asks Harry if an older student had put his name in for him. The Goblet doesn't take into account ages, just how worthy you are supposedly. It's also, not sure where, mentioned that it was the death/injury toll that got it cancelled which I would imagine was due to inexperienced kids entering and being selected.

**** If it was just the age line preventing people from entering, then Fred and George should've been likely possibilities for the goblet. The Ministry would've added a charm to the goblet - especially considering the building distrust between them and Dumbledore at this point in the series.

I say Fred and George because, thinking about it realistically, they are certainly worthy of a test of knowledge, bravery, etc. They're basically certified geniuses considering their pranks and products - take the love potion for example, which is essentially proven very difficult to brew since its a year 6+ difficulty potion.

****** Oh, I thought they did. I must be confusing myself with the movie version. That did always rub me the wrong way though - the twins would have been 17 by the time of the first task, so they should've been allowed to apply.

******* I'm pretty sure in the book Fred goes over the line and George joins him before both are chucked out. Dumbledore comes in and compliments their beards. In the movie I think we do see them get their names in before being chucked out but it's been a while since I watch GoF and I only have access to the audiobook at the moment.
