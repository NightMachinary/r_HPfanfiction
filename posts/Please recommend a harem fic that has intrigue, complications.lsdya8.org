After watching an interesting yet complicated Korean Drama, I realized that the Harry Potter harem fanfiction I've read were quite simple. Harry's girls usually end up being OK with their arrangement and are friendly with each other. Their kids end up being friends. Everyone belongs to one big happy family. Hence, I am asking if there are any fics where this isn't the case.

I'm looking for fics where the concubines / mistresses are fighting over who would be the "queen" / official wife or bear the first son or daughter. Where alliances are formed between some of the girls vs the others when they realize that this kind of arrangement is more beneficial rather than fighting over who becomes the queen. Where each girl has their own political or family agenda that they want to protect.

I just want to know if this stuff exists in the HP fanfic universe. If not, there are Korean and Chinese dramas I can watch, anyway.


** What was the harem k-drama?

*** It's not really a "harem" in the anime sense of the word. It was about a king who had to marry a queen he didn't love, and make his real love the concubine. What made it complicated was the presence of other "queens" in the palace --- the grandmother queen and the mother queen --- when they weren't even the King's grandma and mother. It took me a while to figure out why they were there. There's a part where the grandmother queen reminds the King's queen that she has to start the process for the selection of 3 other concubines.

Title is "Mr. Queen." It's a comedy, which makes it a lot simpler than the other dramatic K-dramas with more convoluted relationships.

** I don't see why people like that stuff, anyways. However, I'll tell you that you likely won't find any good ones over 60k words.
