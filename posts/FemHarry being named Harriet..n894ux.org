I always thought the name Harriet was weird for a female Harry. I always picture FemHarry as Hailey. TIL that Harriet references Harriet Tubman the American abolitionist.


** I always was quite particular to the name Holly.

** I like flower names for her, but generally prefer her to have a flower or botanical name that starts with H, such as Holly, Heather, Hazel etc, but I think I prefer Harriet to Hailey (am I wrong to think Hailey isn't particualrly British?)

And what, you thought Harriet Tubman's name sprung out of nowhere, fully formed with no history? Harriet was used the English form of Henriette (same deal as Harry being the English form of Henry, although Harry is far older) as early as the 1700s.

** I always thought it fit better with femHarry keeping the naming-theme of the Evans-family, by naming her after a flower. Lily - Petunia - Rose(?) Potter or Bella(Short for Belladonna) Potter

Also personal opinion: I think it is just a tad bit lazy to go "I am making Harry a female... name? female-version of Harry as well!"

**** Or ANY OTHER NAME (even Nymphadora is better ;)). Apparently, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brogan][that name]] is Irish in origin, but Wikipedia shows people who have it only as a surname (which is not that bad). Certainly, not something I would pick when I could actually choose and select my name.

Why? It literally makes no sense and just makes you sound ridiculous

** I'm not a fan of Fem!Harry being named Harriet, either. I like something that's along the lines of the Potter names that we know like Harry, James, and Henry, which I classify as classic royal names. So, I'd choose something like Mary, Elizabeth, Victoria, or Margaret with either Lily or another flower name as a middle name as a nod to the Evans girls for Fem!Harry.

Yeah, nothing is more cringy and lazy than when fem Harry is just called and referenced as Harry by everyone. What the fuck is the point of changing his gender then if you can't even come up with a different name?

** While fem-Harry could be interesting in a "DC Elseworlds" kind of way, most authors use it either as a "bate and switch" for their OC or even SI, do it so they can pair Harry with Malfoy "without it being slash", have it as Snape's "second chance" as either a future love interest or as a daughter figure, or other things just as odd/nebulous.

The names are usually the same, but that's not a bad thing outside of common ones like Harriet: I could see Lily sticking with the flower theme in her family, so fem-Harry being "Rose" or "Daisy"? Yeah, I could see that.

But on the whole, it's why I avoid them like the plague, as 99% of the time it's author agenda driven for something like "not-slash", an SI/OC, or a fetish/pairing.
