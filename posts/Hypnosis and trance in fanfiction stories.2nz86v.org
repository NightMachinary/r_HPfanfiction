Do you know any good fics that have portions of writing dedicated to hypnosis or trance-like states?

I ask due to the presence of hypnosis as part of my own fic (should advertise it on here in a few months, ask me about it here or pm me to find out more).


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem with Purity]] has a bit of this, as an aid to help people attain Animagus forms. It's a 62-chapter epic of over 600,000 words, so you may want to pick and choose chapters by title if you only want to read the parts about hypnosis/trances.
