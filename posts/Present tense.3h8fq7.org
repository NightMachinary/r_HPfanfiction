I can't stand it reading stories written in present tense. Is it just me?


** It does take a bit of getting used to, but it's not the end of the world for me. What absolutely kills a fic for me, though, is if the tense inexplicably /changes/.

Consistent present tense is fine. Consistent past tense is fine. Heck, changing tense for a good reason can be fine. Changing tense mid-paragraph for no good reason? In the bin.

** It all comes back to this: can the author pull it off or not? If, instead of reading the story, you are making note of the tenses or the author's quirks, it means the writer has failed to reel you in.

If a story is really good and the writing style is appropriate, I think you would barely notice it.

** No, as with stories written in first person this is usually a sign of a young and inexperience author. So not only does it feel wrong or awful but the quality of the story tends to be pretty low too...

note: of course there are exceptions, but this seems to be pretty accurate.

*** Speaking as someone who has written both: it's /much/ more difficult to write a first person, present tense fic than it is a third person, past tense fic.

*** I've noticed this too about inexperienced authors. I wonder why they seem to gravitate to present tense/first person...

I also don't like these kinds of stylistic choices. I've read some first person stuff I enjoy but never any present tense.

**** Most Young Adults novels are in the first person so for them it's a logical choice. For the present tense I think that's because they are too young to be really familiar with literature (they usually don't read that much books) and go for the easiest tense: the present, without realizing that it's actually really rarely used. Logic being "I think in the present so I write in the present".

***** It really lends itself to stream of consciousness type prose which is what a lot of new writers work with. If you've planned it out and have a structure you're following then you're naturally inclined to write in the past tense because you know what comes after it.

*** I really like reading first person stories, especially with fanfiction since it's pretty much a guarantee you won't have an omniscient point of view nor will there be any head hopping. Both of those things really turn me of from reading stories.

** It depends on the story, I guess. The present tense grates in /Dagger and Rose/, and it didn't really work for me in Hunger Games either, but I absolutely loved it in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/4/The-Changeling][The Changeling]].

** Sometimes it suits the story. One of my novels is first person present, but I don't think it'd work if it didn't have a distinct narrative voice. Now I don't notice tense anymore as long as it's done correctly. It's definitely harder to find good grammar resources for writing in present tense though, and its scarcity in fiction doesn't make it easier to know if you're doing it right.

** It's a preference thing. "Haters gonna hate." "Don't like, don't read," and all that jazz.

Unlike most everyone else in the thread, I enjoy reading and writing in present tense. I have sold many short stories (including all my "pro" sales) written in present tense, so the shit is at least marketable. In recent years, half the Man Booker prize finalists have been written in present tense, so the shit appears to be literary as well, if done right. That said, it's not for everyone. Some master prose stylists (e.g. [[http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/01/specials/gass-present.html?_r=1][William Gass]]) despise it.

Personally, I find the overuse of cumulative sentences (hello, William Gass) to be the sure sign of MFA over-workshopping and a far more tiresome literary device. At least fanfiction, in its cavalcade of amateurism, has avoided that (for now).

I feel like I see it quite a bit. I guess it depends on your definition of overuse. My perception may be skewed by the fact that they're used quite a bit in the fic I beta. I sometimes tone it down when I'm editing.

** It's harder to pull off than the more commonly used tenses, but when well-executed it pulls you into the character like none other. I mean, if the tense alone is enough to completely turn you off a story then you are missing out on some great stuff.

** Jbern is the only one I've seen that used it well enough that I could forget about while reading (I always came back to noticing it, but it wasn't completely awful), and it was more of a..putting you in the story directly than reading from inside the characters head... idk

I don't think I've ever read first person that I enjoyed 100% without mental complaining. But if the story is good enough I can ignore it (see hunger games...or cringingly admitted Twilight)
