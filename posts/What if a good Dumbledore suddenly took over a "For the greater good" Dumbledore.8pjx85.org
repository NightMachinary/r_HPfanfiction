Imagine it. Just for a second.


** There's actually a story with that exact premise. I think it's called linkffn(Dumbledore and the Next Great Adventure) ...?

#+begin_quote
  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
