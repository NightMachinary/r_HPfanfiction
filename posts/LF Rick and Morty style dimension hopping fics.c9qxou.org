I really liked how Rick and Morty is able to showcase all these different possibilities for what their world could be. Is there anything like this in the hp fanfiction world? The closest thing I've found was Dimension Hopping for Beginners by nonjon. The story could be funny or serious, just interested in characters getting to see AUs that are a bit more divergent than the average AU.

Bonus points if the dimension hopping characters are doing something a bit more dynamic that just stopping Voldemort. Say like they need to collect 2 dozen resurrection stones because they want to use the souls to power their hyperdrive so that they can reach their universe's Andromeda system because while they do have inter-dimensional travel on their world, they don't have interstellar travel. Or maybe they are looking for army recruits for their world's Dumbledore because he's locked into an eternal battle with a third universe's Gilderoy Lockhart. Double bonus points if there are multiple dimension hoppers who all originate from separate dimensions.

​

Thanks in advance!


** So obviously linkffn(Dimension Hopping for Beginners) is the best one. Also check out linkffn(Harry Potter Lone Traveller)

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

  After spending half his life trying to rid the world of Voldemort, Harry Potter finally succeeds. However, the price has been high. Too high. Unfortunately, when Harry risks his life to go back and ‘do things right', something goes wrong...
