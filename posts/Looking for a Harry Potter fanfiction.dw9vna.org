I'm looking for a fanfiction I read once, but I can't remember much about it. I do remember Harry Potter being called a "little lord" by some shopkeepers when shopping for uniforms because he is going to Hogwarts and not a local school because in this fic there are local schools that most attend and Hogwarts is where the elite go.

*** I don't think so. The only fic I know called The Black Prince is a crossover, and that's not it.
