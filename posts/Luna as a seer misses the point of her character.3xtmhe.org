  Do you think Seer Luna is an acceptable change from canon?
#+end_quote

Fanfics that features Luna in a predominate role almost always fall victim to one big problem: they telegraph their moves /way/ too far ahead of time and suck all of the remaining conflict from the story.

So what's a better way to use her inherent oddness?

IIRC there was an interview with JKR around the time of OOtP (where Luna makes her first appearance). The interviewer asked her about some of the themes she wanted to emphasise in the novel. Rowling was keen to point out that Harry had an awful lot of growing up to do still and she illustrated this with an interesting example: the two train rides to and from Hogwarts. In the chapter covering the journey /to/ the castle, Harry empathises with Neville who didn't want to be anywhere near 'Loony Lovegood.' He's intensely embarassed when Cho Chang comes by his compartment and believes that she quickly runs off because of the odd company he keeps. Less than ten pages from the end of that book, Harry and Luna commiserate on the loss of loved ones. On the train ride back /from/ Hogwarts, Harry realises he doesn't care what Cho thinks of him or his friends, thus displaying the personal growth Rowling was trying to highlight.

I tend to enjoy stories that do the same thing with Luna that Rowling did: treat her oddness as a milemarker that allows Harry to demonstrate personal growth. Whenever fanfics have him instantly accept her odd ways, I find myself wondering if I'm reading about Harry Potter or Harry-Sue. But this is just a personal preference and I'd love to hear what other people have to say about her.

*** I totally agree with you that the personal growth of Harry comes through via his interaction with others. I also think Luna is used as a way to show both that Harry shouldn't rely on his friends for his happiness (as happiness can be found elsewhere, just as Luna does in the herd despite being bullied) but also that he can find happiness by /being/ with his friends (as his friends are there for him).

** I've always been a bit conflicted on Luna's character, unsure of whether she truly believes what she says and is trying to make a point of never dismissing things without proof or whether she was just raised into it by her father and doesn't really know any better.

There is one thing I'm sure of though, and that is that underneath her quirky exterior there is a lot of rationale at work. But I do agree with you that making Luna right, either through Seer powers or by just showing the existence of the Snorkack and the like, seems to miss the point of her character and just turns her into this all-knowing person with in-depth knowledge of several things the rest of the world is not privy to.

My favorite characterization of Luna was that it was her father that lost it when her mother died, and she developed this persona as a way of being able to relate to the only parent she had left.

**** I was thinking about Luna's character in particular for the story I'm planning to write (she and Harry are pretty much the only HP characters that are given any major amount of screentime).

I came up with a similar description to that, it being that her parents originally came up with his various fantasy creatures and quirky personas just to entertain Luna and tell her bedtime stories, but when Luna's mother died, Xenophilius adopted that personality 24/7 and Luna, who had to have been about 8 or 9, just figured that it was all real and started acting the same way, possibly to remind her of better times.

I get the sense as I think about her that perhaps Luna knows deep down that it's all a fantasy, but she rationalizes it by equating it to something like a muggle-born's life before finding out they could do magic; who's to say that it /isn't/ real?

*** It's true there appears to be an element of belief in her character, like she is well aware what she is saying doesn't make a lot of sense, but she wants it to be said anyway. I think it is telling she marries an actual magical zoologist, that she knows the difference between reality and what she wants to be. It is clear she isn't interested in confirming social expectations, but your right that is personal opinion on whether this is due to some mental trauma from either her father or from seeing her mother die or if she just has the personal strength of character to be happy being alone.

thats exactly what Seer Luna is supposed to do. Its a character alteration that exchanges the cheer of her character with a vibe of tragedy.

Fics don't fail because of one character. Fics can fail for many reasons and most often fail because a lot of small mistakes stack up.

If I describe a fic as "mediocre" its most often because of a story trope or just awful excitement curves. I'm very lenient when it comes to characters, since I'm not attached to any canon-characteristic. If I want canon, I read the originals.

Certainly there are a lot of fanfics out there with poor characterization and certainly there are a lot of badly written seer!Lunas. However, I don't think it's fair to say that it's necessarily missing the point to have a fanfic!Luna who plays a significantly different role than canon!Luna plays in Rowling's books. A fanfic author can understand what Rowling was doing with the character but write a fanfic where they intentionally do something else with the character. They aren't missing the point of the character, they're just using her differently.

** Luna is hands down my favorite character. I feel (perhaps differently from most people) that her purpose is not just in being quirky and offbeat, but being a source of comfort and acceptance and having an instinctive understanding of people. Her conversation with Harry about Sirius' death comes to mind - she knows exactly how to comfort Harry.

In light of that, if her being a seer doesn't tarnish these aspects of her, I'm perfectly okay. I also don't think that making her tragic and mentally unstable is necessarily out of character - the key part is that her weirdness should not be the only thing that defines her. She's so much more than that. So as long as the story acknowledges that I'm happy.

An issue I've always had with canon!Luna is that her story is never really told, and she's characterized more in terms of her relationships with other people (the comforter, the vehicle by which Harry's open-mindedness is made known, the giver of insight) than on her own. So honestly I'd love to see a story that centers on her.

** I have never seen Luna written as a seer in a manner that doesn't trample over the most interesting elements of her character. I can see why authors are attracted to the characterization, though---her character is complex and contradictory, and not the easiest to understand. I have general qualms about the way even more thoughtful authors write Luna; I think that authors that write Luna as being totally right about Nargles all along, or even as simply "quirkly," are still missing the forest for the trees.

For what it's worth, here is how I approach Luna's "quirkiness" (independent of other, equally important traits) in my own writing:

Luna genuinely believes in the things she says (or many of them)---and, at the same time, doesn't. She has developed a bizarre epistemology that allows her to simultaneously access different, seemingly contradictory, kinds of truth. Are Nargles, to her, literally real? Yes, of course! But also not at all. Does it even matter to her which truth is (to the standards by which others judge them) more "real"? Not really.

On some level, she conceives some of postulatory and factual statements as having little fundamental or utilitarian distinction. (She may choose to outwardly, if not always inwardly, draw no distinction between "Maybe there are these little creatures called Nargles that hide in mistletoe and cause mischief; wouldn't that be something!" and "Nargles hide in mistletoe and cause mischief"). Similarly, things can be true independent of their strict factuality, and true despite being admittedly and observably otherwise false. (How so? Well, it's true /in a different way/!) She is very tightlipped about these nuances (and probably couldn't explain them very well even if she wanted to), and her friends and acquaintances are not apt to pick up on them. She is, however, reasonably self-aware about the oddity of her own beliefs and how other people perceive her/them, and is capable (if not necessarily willing) of using these perceptions to her own ends.

Separate from her epistemology is an extreme and innate sense of whimsy, which both serves as a source of personal amusement and as a magnifier of the apparent weirdness of her claims. Every once in awhile, she's just saying things to mess with people or to make a joke at her own expense---but it's intended, mostly, as a private joke, because who can tell the difference?

As Luna enters her twenties and forms her own communities away from arbitrary school groupings, she sheds some her most outward excesses---she and the manner in which she evaluates truth are no less odd, and she's no less willing to argue strange positions, but the level of rhetoric dies down. In her Hogwarts years, Nargles et al. act at least in part as a defense mechanism to avoid engaging in painful topics with friends. (Luna, where are your shoes? Oh, the Nargles must have took them again. Luna, why are people being mean to you? Oh, it must be the Wrackspurts fuzzing up their brains.) She's comfortable standing up for her family and for her friends, but she isn't comfortable standing up for herself. Luna sincerely wants to think the best of people, and therefore refuses to allow others' antagonism towards her to become a source of conflict. Now, freed from Hogwarts and adolescence, deflecting becomes less of a constant imperative. She becomes less interested in weird animals and strange conspiracies and more invested in broader questions, in manners and matters of thinking and living.

*** I completely agree that part of the appeal of Luna is that she is complex, and in a lot of ways mysterious. We, as the reader of Harry's limited POV, can not possible know if she truly believe what she is saying, and we certainly don't know if this is some sort of defense against the situations we see her in, or if she is indeed always like this. Ginny refers to her as strange before they attend Hogwarts, which implies this is not a simple reaction to her being bullied and not fitting in. My question then is, if she was a seer, is it possible to retain that complexity? I don't believe it is.

As has been discussed, it's just not a very satisfying characterization.

Being a little bit weird is okay (believing in bigfoot) being a lot weird makes you a bit of an outcast (being a cryptobiologist or the ancient aliens guy).

Personally I would indeed like to celebrate Luna not killing herself over the bullying for her weirdness. I love Luna, but I also love having her take on the world be oddly perceptive (though I agree straight up SEEing is different than merely interpreting reality differently)

There are many many things that JKR doesn't seem to realize she had written, but with Luna's backstory it is fairly obvious she's a bit broken; either mentally, genetically, or both. Her family is not rich enough to call her eccentric.

People love her character anyway, which is awesome, but that doesn't change the fact that cannon Luna is unstable in many ways. People who love her want to make her worth something more than some savvant words of wisdom from time to time and fading into the background again.

By the end she has strong friendships, is respected, and gains a family. But if you take that little broken girl at the start and say, 'well she is weird, but she is also /right/ , and therefore everyone else is /wrong/', it strips her of that growth, because she isn't broken in a way that can get better anymore.
