** Harry sat there, aware that every head in the Great Hall had turned to in their direction. He was stunned. Had he heard correctly? He turned to his friend to look for any indication that he knew what was going on, but Ron's eyes had just expanded and his jaw had dropped down.

"Bloody hell..." he muttered almost in a whisper.

There was no applause. A buzzing, as though of angry bees, was starting to fill the Hall; some students were standing up to get a better look at Ron, who was still to get up from his seat.

Up at the top table, Professor McGonagall had got to her feet and swept past Ludo Bagman and Professor Karkaroff to whisper urgently to Professor Dumbledore, who bent his ear toward her, frowning slightly. Percy was there as well, looking as if he had been struck by a lightning.

Harry turned to Ron as he noticed everyone at the long Gryffindor table watching the redhead, open-mouthed.

"Did you-" Harry started but was unable to finish his question. It felt ludicrous, yet what other explanation could be to it. Hermione had turned to Ron, as if waiting for his answer, but she was unusually speechless.

"What?" Ron asked

"Did you put your name in?" Harry repeated, this time managing to voice the word, but trying to keep a straight face.

It took Ron a few seconds to process the question. "What? 'Course not. I-- How--? What?"

At the top table, Professor Dumbledore had straightened up, nodding to Professor McGonagall. “Ronald Weasley!” he called again. “Ronald! Up here, if you please!”

"They're expecting you to move your arse up there," Seamus said on Ron's other side when the boy didn't move.

"Go," Harry agreed. "We'll talk later."

Ron turned to Hermione in panic, who was pale as a ghost. However, the girl composed herself and nodded, as she pointed at the front with the look.

Almost as if dragging his feet, Ron walked to Professor Dumbledore. Stunned and, at the same time, frightened by the attention around him. It was a painfully long walk, Harry figured as he saw his best friend stumbled forward. He looked just as surprised by the revelation as Harry, yet he couldn't be sure of what went on just yet.

“Well . . . through the door, Ronald,” said Dumbledore. He wasn't smiling.

Soon after Ron did as he was told, the professors excused themselves to join him and the door closed behind them. Then, the whispers exploded.

"... who the hell was that...?"

"... Weasley? I think he's Potter's friend..."

"...how did he do it?"

The questions seemed familiar to Harry, however, it was odd to be on the other end of them. They were pesky enough and before long they reached Harry as well.

"Did you know?" Dean asked him, leaning forward.

"No, I- I don't know what happened," Harry mumbled.

"He didn't seem to know himself," Neville said.

Seamus huffed, "Bugger that! It was acting. How else could this have happened otherwise? Maybe his brothers helped him."

Could it be? But, if that had been the case, why didn't he told Harry? Weren't they supposed to be friends? He wasn't going to snitch on him. Doubtfully, Harry turned to the other side of the table, looking for answers. When he caught the twins' eyes though, their only answer was a lost shrug.

"What was that?" Ginny's voice came. Harry hadn't seen her approach, but she was next to Hermione now, pushing Parvati to the other side. Parvati, who wanted to get answers as well, didn't appreciate that.

"I- I don't know. I didn't hear him say anything about it. It must be a mistake... I-" Hermione stumbled with the words, then found Harry's eyes, "Do you know?"

Harry shook his head.

"A fat mistake at that. Weasley, is no champion material..." a fifth year boy said. Harry recognized him as a bloke whose lastname was McLaggen.

"I didn't say that," Hermione hurried.

"Well, he is miles away from Diggory, isn't he? He must have cheated somehow. The boy is nothing special," a girl said this time.

Hermione frowned looking furious, but was slower to answer than Ginny, "Hey! Take that back!"

The first instinct Harry had was to defend his friend, but he didn't know how. If he only knew if Ron had put his name in or not, then he could figure out a way to do it. If he did put it on, why hadn't he told him though? Hopefully, Harry would get some answers later on.

THe other tables were just as stunned and flooding with questions, and all of them seemed to be turning their way, Harry noticed. Some of them seemed like wanting to walk over, but they kept to their places, fully aware there were still some teachers left at the end table. Those same teachers that stopped the verbal conflict Ginny was having with McLaggen to escalate.

"Knock it off, you don't know Ron," Harry hurried, standing next to Ginny. He was surprised by the girl of course, he couldn't remember seeing her so menacing before and Harry was suddenly thankful that her temper wasn't directed at him. At that moment though, the most important thing was to defend Ron.

"As if there was much to figure out there... a bland bloke that one..."

"Why you vile..." Hermione started, but there was a loud cough on the end of the table that stopped her. Professor Flitwick, SProut and Vector had stood up, trying to put some order.

Eventually, the professors asked the prefects to take everyone to their common rooms.

Hermione looked away from McLaggen with a frown as the rest of the students quieted down and stood up. Ginny returned to her classmates, not without blushing at Harry when she noticed him.

Across the hall, Malfoy and his goons were walking out of the hall. They were sniggering, which made Harry's blood boil just by imagining what were they going about.

"He didn't do it," Hermione told Harry the way to the common room, leaning over and almost on a whisper.

"We'll talk to him after, see if he-" Harry started before being cut off.

"He didn't do it. There must be some other explanation," Hermione insisted, this time more energetically. The girl didn't say anything more. Harry could almost see the gears in her head turning around, looking for logical reasoning.

In all honesty, Harry wasn't sure. It would raise more questions, but a part of him wished that Ron hadn't put his name in. Just to avoid feeling left out. He really hoped to get some answers soon. That was the state of his mind when they reached the Fat Lady portrait.

** Surely he had misheard. Surely.

"Ronald Weasley! Up here!" Dumbledore called out again, his voice stony.

No, no he hadn't.

Ron got up on shaky legs, aware that every head in the great hall was looking in his direction. There was no applause, just silence. Ron felt guilty for thinking so badly of Harry when his name had been called out.

Now he had been called out.

"Bloody hell," he muttered.

Hermione placed a hand on his shoulder and squeezed, he turned to see her shoot an uncertain smile at him.

"Go on Ron," Ginny said, a few places away, trying to reassure him.

Ron nodded, more to assure himself, and started walking up to the head table. A steady buzz started to pick up in the Great Hall, and Ron felt himself hearing quite a few snide comments and picked out one voice in particular.

Draco Malfoy.

Ron clenched his fists as he reached the head table. What a prick.

"Ronald, through the door," Dumbledore said, his usual cheer and the twinkle in his eyes missing.

"Professor you have to believe me! I didn't put my name in!" Ron said vehemently, his previous desire to be in the tournament vanishing. He could hear Professor McGonagall take a sharp breath.

Dumbledore placed a hand on his shoulder, "I believe you, my boy." He said after a pause. Ron looked up gratefully.

Dumbledore gently steered him through the door and closed it behind them, the murmur of the Great Hall falling silent.

"Ron?!" Harry started, from the corner of the room, shooting up from his seat. Near him were the other champions, Barty Crouch, Ludo Bagman, and Professor Moody. Ron gulped.

"Hi mate," he offered, with a weak smile. Bloody hell.

  The great hall went silent as the Goblet's flames unexpectedly turned blue again. A scrap of paper flew out and Dumbledore reached for it almost automatically. He cleared his throat. “Ronald Weasley.”

   

  Ron looked up in shock. "Yes, Headmaster?"

   

  A quiet wave of excited murmurs spread throughout the Great Hall. It was finally Ron's time to shine, to show his family that he could achieve just as much as his brothers. For once, something important was happening to /him/, not Harry. And it was just his luck that Harry was in the loo, so he wasn't around to see Ron's big moment.

   

  "Do you know where Harry went?" Dumbledore continued. "The Goblet has chosen him as the fourth Triwizard Champion."

** Ron's eyes bugged out of his skull, and he looked around wildly - but just before his brothers could grab him and drag him from the hall, the Goblet burned brightly once more.

"Hermione Granger."

The girl in question dropped her goblet, but before she could say anything, the goblet burned once more. and again. and again.

Faster and faster, scraps of names flew from the goblet - the flame licking higher into the hall, eventually growing into a spire that made the enchantment on the ceiling spark in anger when they touched.

Name after name came spewing forth in a tide of paper and names, prompting everyone to flee as the goblet was buried beneath a growing hill of names, fire bursting forth like a paper volcano.

When the current students' names were exhausted, the Goblet seemed to draw upon older and older ones - the parchment scraps grew more yellow, brittle and dusty, and soon enough, they were forming clumps that floated across the hall like demented clouds, raining paper down on anyone who dared come forth from the conjured shelters.

Eventually, the Goblet seemed to stutter, and spark, before cracking in half and exploding upwards, tearing a hole into the ceiling and allowing real snow to join the banks of paper that littered the great hall.

  As you can tell I think of Ron as a fat lazy character who would be a beggar on the streets if he didn't have such amazing brothers
#+end_quote

Ron is not fat. Ron is not lazy.

Ron got seven O.W.L.s, failing only History of Magic and Divination.

Ron can cast a Patronus

Ron is the equal of his brothers

#+begin_quote
  wasn't friends with Ron or Hermione
#+end_quote

Ron was friends with himself?

#+begin_quote
  For goodness sake Ron almost killed Harry if he wasn't so lazy by dragging Harry down.
#+end_quote

What the heck are you talking about?

Ron stood on a broken leg and looked a presumed mass murderer in the eye and declared his intent to die for his friend.

We should all strive to be as good a friend as Ron.

#+begin_quote
  I can't help but notice you only reply to the fewest of the things i stated above. That makes me feel like you accept everything else even if you dislike it including what I showed on exactly how Ron got 7 OWLS.
#+end_quote

Not necessarily. He may have had a more expedient response to what he actually replied to.

Do not take passivity for agreement.

#+begin_quote
  Also even if Neville was the one who let in the alleged mass murderer in 5th year the headmaster and head of houses knew Sirius was innocent.
#+end_quote

First of all, it was third year. Second of all, not a single one of the professors believed that Sirius Black was innocent--remember, he was imprisoned for killing twelve people with a single curse, not for selling out the Potters.

#+begin_quote
  Even then Dean has a spotless record compared to Ron
#+end_quote

In terms of discipline? There's no actual evidence that Dean didn't get his fair share of trouble. And even if he did manage to never get a detention, that's not exactly an endorsement of his character from a story-telling standpoint.

#+begin_quote
  Ron broke countless school rules and has nothing special like the boy who lived title and skill to prove to be prefect.
#+end_quote

Hermione broke many more rules than Lavender or Parvati and yet she was named a prefect.

Ron also has a Special Award for Services to the School to his name--which is more than you can say for Neville or Dean.

#+begin_quote
  He also has a bad temper and can be petty as you can see Ron ended up being as prefect.
#+end_quote

If you're talking about his threatening Seamus with detention, keep in mind, the boy had outright stated he believed that Harry was lying about what happened to Cedric and had insinuated Ron was stupid for believing it.

That could have easily gotten him written up in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  In the Cursed Child Ron was not exactly a househusband but we are told he was originally an auror but decided to quit.
#+end_quote

That play was a travesty for Ron's character, but if you want to play that card, then I'll respond in kind.

Ron chose to leave a very high-stress job where he was in a constant state of danger in fighting Dark Wizards. He'd had his fill of fighting.

#+begin_quote
  Then he goes to work at his brother's shot where he is not a partner he is below George and Harry.
#+end_quote

Why should Ron be an equal partner with the founder and financier of the shop?

#+begin_quote
  Had any of the Weasley brothers tagged along with Harry, Ron, or Hermione in Deathly Hallows they could've destroyed horcruxes too
#+end_quote

Perhaps, but Ron confronted the horcrux that had affected him most personally. He slew his greatest demon in destroying it--and that was /after/ jumping into a freezing cold pond, in the dead of winter, /fully-clothed/ to save Harry's life.

#+begin_quote
  And the comment about the author feeling like it is because she stated in an interview that Harry and Hermione fit better but she paired Hermione with Ron because of some reason.
#+end_quote

Rowling wrote the series from scratch. What she says goes. Get over it.

#+begin_quote
  (Albus was capable of casting basic charms successfully such as the Unlocking Charm, Engorgement Charm, Cushioning Charm and the Fire-Making Spell. He was also shown to have a natural affinity at casting his father's signature spell, the Disarming Charm.[10])
#+end_quote

None of those are particularly difficult magic. The Disarming Charm is something /second-years/ are taught.

#+begin_quote
  That is from harry potter fandom which states facts, it shows instinctual talent in is father's signature spell. Also we know magical abilities and affinities are heriditary as Metamorphicgi run in the Black family, Parseltongue in Slytherin, and Flying in the Potters.
#+end_quote

You're comparing elementary and intermediate /coursework/ to profoundly rare and difficult magics, with the exception of flying.

#+begin_quote
  Personally I feel Ron Weasley is a brave character who is lacking in ambitions and has grown up from the annoying and terrible child and teen character he was into a good person. However, Ron never had the ambitions to be the breadwinner in the family, he would always stay content with what he had and not more.
#+end_quote

You pitched a fit about how Ron was an awful character for two days, and you expect us to believe that you like him--when /Cursed Child/ is nearly universally agreed to be an awful display of his character.

And there is no shame in not having ambition--why should Ron have to be the breadwinner? And why on /earth/ is it wrong that Ron be /content/ with what he had?

***** u/CryptidGrimnoir:
#+begin_quote
  Hmm, lets see.
#+end_quote

Yes...let's.

#+begin_quote
  The fat part was a mistake on my part.
#+end_quote

Considering Ron is described as tall and skinny--or long and lanky--in literally every book, this is a mistake that would have been very easy not to make.

#+begin_quote
  He is lazy as he would have failed his OWLS if Hermione didn't help him at all.
#+end_quote

Ron was joking when he said that without Hermione's help with her notes, he'd fail his O.W.L.s

#+begin_quote
  Before you say Harry was in the same situation he was because of Ron. When you enter a whole new world you want to learn as much about it as you can. Harry was going to to do that when he met Ron. Suddenly he becomes more lazy and barely wants to learn anything.
#+end_quote

Harry does not become more lazy--the books say that he and Ron do study together. They just have bad time management skills--but a good chunk of this is Quidditch practice.

But what Harry craves more than anything else is companionship. He wants friends. He wants a family.

#+begin_quote
  As for Ron being the equal of his brothers lets compare them shall we.
#+end_quote

Yes, let's.

#+begin_quote
  Fred and George - Created a huge franchise of prank supplies that made them riches.
#+end_quote

They worked /together/ and they found a market that was /desperate/ for a laugh.

And they had Harry's /Triwizard/ winnings which gave them a leg up they desperately needed.

#+begin_quote
  Percy - Achieved high sucess in the Ministry, Prefect, Head boy
#+end_quote

Percy was a professional butt-kisser that wormed his way into politics by playing the game.

Ron refused outright to stoop to Percy's level when he was made Prefect.

#+begin_quote
  Househusband,
#+end_quote

/Retired Auror./ And even if he was a househusband, there's nothing wrong with that.

#+begin_quote
  got Prefect because Dumbledore had pity on him. Before you say Ron 'earned' his badge lets look at this. Dean, and Neville easily surpassed Ron in helpfulness. Harry would've gotten the badge had he been in a better place.
#+end_quote

nd Ron wasn't just given Prefect out of pity. Dumbledore thought Harry had too much on his plate.

What the hell did Dean do--at /all/--for the first four books? You can count his scenes where we get actual glimpses of his character on both hands, and likely have a couple fingers left over.

I adore Neville but he was not a leader--not yet anyway. He would have been eaten alive as a Prefect.

#+begin_quote
  In Prisoner of Azkaban he yelled at Hermione about losing a pet he NEVER CARED ABOUT.
#+end_quote

There's a saying: The things we complain about the most are the things we care about the most.

Ron loved Scabbers and he thought that Hermione had let her pet roam around willy-nilly--and this was after Crookshanks had attacked Scabbers several times.

#+begin_quote
  In Goblet he betrays harry even though he knows Harry would bever do such a thing.
#+end_quote

Harry gives as good as he gets in this fight--and physically hits Ron during this.

Secondly, Ron's resentment comes from the impression that Harry is leaving him behind--up to this point, they've largely been equals, or at least have tried to be so.

#+begin_quote
  In Deathly Hallows he abandoned Hermione and Harry because he was HUNGRY. Before you say it was the horcrux's fault Harry wore it more than Ron did and was perfectly fine, and so was Hermione.
#+end_quote

Oy. They had /very/ meager rations and Ron had /never/ known hunger before--ever.

And it was too the Horcrux--the moment he disapparates and is free of its influence, Ron immediately feels remorse and wants to find his friends again.

#+begin_quote
  Now lets counter more of your points.
#+end_quote

You can try.

#+begin_quote
  He passed most of them because of Hermione's help.
#+end_quote

They did their studying /together./ They passed, /together./

And seven O.W.L.s is /nothing/ to sneeze at, considering the oh-so-brilliant Fred and George only got three each.

#+begin_quote
  Patronus was because of DA like i dont know 20 OTHER KIDS. Those kids only accomplished it because Harry taught them. But, harry was an amazing teacher and the rest of the kids had something to use.
#+end_quote

No, we only saw a half dozen Patronuses other than Harry's: Hermione, Cho, Luna, Seamus, Ernie /and/ Ron.

Not 20. Six.

And not one of Ron's siblings--not even Ginny--is shown casting a Patronus in the books.

#+begin_quote
  Before you say Harry would always be that way he had 2 parents. 1 was skilled insanely at Charms and Potions, and one in Transfiguration. Defense is a natural talent he got and passed to his kids. Proof Ron slowed Harry down and could've potentially killed him by making him more incompetent.
#+end_quote

There is /no/ evidence whatsoever that this sort of magic is genetic. Slughorn suggested it, but that's all it was, a suggestion.

If this is what you consider "proof," then I suggest you get a new dictionary.

#+begin_quote
  Lastly my last words for this incredibly long comment is...
#+end_quote

Noise.

#+begin_quote
  Ron is so forgetful of a character in the movies he only serves mainly as comic relief with most of his major lines given to Hermione or Harry.
#+end_quote

​You openly acknowledge the movies sabotaged Ron's character and you have the audacity to think that /strengthens/ your argument?

#+begin_quote
  FOR GOODNESS SAKE RON ONLY GOT THE GIRL BECAUSE JK ROWLING FELT LIKE IT. SHE ADMITTED HERSELF HERMIONE FITS A LOT BETTER WITH HARRY THAN RON.
#+end_quote

She's the writer. You're not. What she says goes.
