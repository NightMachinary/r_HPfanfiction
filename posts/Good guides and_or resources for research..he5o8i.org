I recently got quite into Harry Potter fanfic, and was thinking of trying to write my own as a little pet project. I am a huge dweeb for details though, and when the FFs that I have read have inaccurate canon it bothers me. What are good places I can go to find canon knowledge on as many of the subjects taught at Hogwarts, lore for origins of magic branches, or history of the world outside of Britain?

Any and all help is appreciated greatly, thank you in advance guys:)


** Pottermore is technically the 'official' source, and you can find information there on the HP universe, but ever since they integrated it in the general Wizarding World site it's been frankly ridiculous to navigate. If you want meticulous information on as many topics as possible in the Wizarding World, I would recommend the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/][Harry Potter Lexicon]]. It's created and run by fans who have done some incredible work going through canon and organizing it in an easy-to-access way.

Any of the other HP Wikias out there are also probably simpler to go through than Pottermore, though their information may not be as accurate as the Lexicon.
