** “Oh, Merlin. It's Hermione Granger. You are having an affair with Hermione Granger.”

Draco had escaped his mother's questions during breakfast simply because his father had been there. For the first time in years, Draco welcomed Lucius's presence. Usually, his dad was still keeled over his desk at that hour, allowing his wife and son time for a cozy tete-a-tete. Narcissa, however, couldn't question Draco about women with her husband there. Long ago, he'd convinced himself that Pansy had joined the family. He tended to converse with an empty chair, asking how the pregnancy was coming along: a disconcerting spectacle, one step away from the grand guignol. All Lucius needed was an icepick to make the scene complete.

Draco crammed down his breakfast and escaped to his room---not forgetting to grab a heel of bread and a leftover orange for Hermy---before his dad finished his spiked coffee and retreated for further fortification. Upon returning to his room, Draco had been horrified at how Hermy had torn into the food. Rather than face her, he busied himself with shrinking the robe to smaller proportions. It wouldn't do for his elf to go about tripping on her hems.

He should have expected this confrontation. Of course a House Elf wandering around the Manor in Draco's robe was bound to attract attention. Now, he was face to face with his mother, who'd dragged the unfortunate creature all the way to Draco's sanctuary at the far corner of the estate.
