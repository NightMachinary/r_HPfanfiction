** Everytime the author updates I have to reread the entire fic. I have no recollection of what happens in this fic but I remember liking it so here we go

*** Yeah I have no fucking clue what happened in that fic anymore and not in the mood to read it all over again, so the notification is probably gonna clog up my email app for a bit.

** One of the fics that I'll just keep to the side until its completed.

I can't be bothered to reread an entire fic with every new chapter.

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** Hooray! I love this fic.

I read the new chapter without having looked at the story in a while and had no real trouble remembering what I needed to. Odd, perhaps, but also the story left a great impression on me.
