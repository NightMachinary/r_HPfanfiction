** I feel in HP there are just so freaking many characters in canon that one doesn't always need an OC where they're put.

That said, OCs can serve great function in stories and if done well (not a Mary-Sue or a self-insert, etc) then I have no problem with them. Sometimes they can be awesome additions to a story.

** If done right, they can add a lot of flavor and originality to a story. They're very rarely done right.

** When they're well written, I really enjoy them. Alexandra Quick is a great example.

They're a hard sell though as major characters. It also depends on the timeframe. If you're writing a story with HP as the main character, you'll have a harder job than if you're writing a different era, where they're more necessary.

*** I feel like most OC characters are just thrown into the action out of nowhere and have either harry or another major character fall in love with them and they are also a god when it comes to magic. I've read a few decent one's down the years, right now I'm reading one about a American wizard who was at the world cup. It involves him, his adopted sister and from what I can gather a slight romance interest between the main character and Fleur Delacour. It's called The Story of Tim Parker Adams. It hasn't been updated in almost a year though so I doubt the author plans to come back to it.

** I prefer OCs over canon characters acting OOC, but HP hardly needs them for a Hogwarts story.\\
Virtually all students outside of Gryffindor are complete unknowns of whom we only know the name (e.g. Daphne Greengrass) so it's easy to just use one of them and give them whatever characteristics you like.

If you're writing a new teacher, or story not set in Hogwarts... go wild.

*** I don't know about other people, but for me, some fanon characterisations have become so 'head-canon' that it makes me angry when authors change them completely. For example, Daphne has been used a lot in fanfic, so making her an incompetent bully or a brunette just really aggrivates me. (And God forbid they make Pansy a blonde on top of that I will stop reading that story D=<) So, I don't think they're a completely blank slate for anyone to do whatever they want with. I mean, of course the author can do whatever they want with them, but some people may find an OOC Daphne, or Susan or Blaise, for example, as bothersome as an OOC Draco or Luna or something.

**** Huh. I don't agree with that at all. Personally, I find it refreshing when I see a good, creative new direction for a typically played-out fanon concept. I'm far more likely to X out of a story that uses the phrase "Ice Queen" to describe Daphne than I am if she happens to have brown hair.

***** I guess I get emotionally attached to characters and reading about them in different ways just feels /wrong/. I'm physically incapable of reading fics where Blaise is a girl, no matter how good the fic is, though Italian I can still manage. Though, to be honest, I have yet to see Daphne described as an "ice queen", although I've heard people complaining about the stereotype.

**** I know what you mean.

Fanon and movie canon are very fixed for some people...

Daphne is the blonde "Ice Princess" with Tracey her best friend (yet Astoria in the filmed Crapilogue is a brunette).

Susan Bones is a red-head with massive tracts of land who lives with her aunt Amelia.

Beauxbatons is a girls only school; Durmstrang is boys only.

***** Well, Narcissa has bicolored hair in the movies too, and all of the older generation look to be in their 40s, 50s, or even 60s (God Lucius and Snape looked ancient) when they should be in their mid to late 30s. I thought Susan Bones being a redhead and living with auntie Amelia was canon? And her father having been a member of the order before being killed? I thought that's what Moody said when he was talking about the old order, I hope I'm not hallucinating... Although for the life of me I have yet to see Daphne being called "ice" anything.

****** Susan Bones being a ginger is because of (most of) the actresses playing her, her haircolour is never mentioned in the books.

Established canon for her is that she is not an orphan, although part of that is from secondary canon (Pottermore). Her uncle Edgar and all his children were murdered by Voldemort and he was in the first Order, but it's not stated in the books her parents were killed, too. Pottermore has established that she is a half-blood and both her parents were still alive when Amelia was murdered.

I like the notion she lived with Madam Bones better though, I mostly ignore Pottermore.

******* Oh, I think I was under the misconception that Edgar was her father .-. Thank you for clearing that up! But yeah, ignoring all the new stuff is more convenient for me. I had a whole backstory thought up and researched for the Malfoys involving the Duke of Burgundy, the Carolingians, and the French Revolution, and then Pottermore went and blew it all to pieces -___-

** In HP fanfiction, a prominent OC protagonist needs to do something new, present the magical world to the reader in a new and interesting way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] introduces Milo, a D&D 3.5e Wizard, to wizarding Britain. Milo's magical abilities invite comparison and impact the plot. If instead a canon character had merely played D&D before arriving at Hogwarts, no one would actually be gaining experience points. The comparison would be less meaningful^{1.} The wizarding world and Milo are in a mutually baffling relationship: Rowling's magic system continues to surprise Milo as he learns about it, and his own abilities surprise and intrigue others.

If an OC brings anything to the table, /something/ needs to make the story more challenging. Milo is often the voice of the genre-savvy, so the story 'difficulty' has been raised accordingly. Milo's general approach to problems is fairly entertaining in itself. This is all cleverly woven into his character arc and gradually-revealed backstory. Milo is an excellent example of an OC.

There's a bit more leeway to make an OC /ant/agonist, and a bit more reason to. In canon, the obvious villains are Voldemort and his Death Eaters. They're rarely seen at Hogwarts. This leaves characters such as Draco and Snape, but they've been characterized plenty and don't play well with others. An OC has the potential benefit of having unknown allegiances and motivations, and even a chance at being redeemed^{2.}

I type all this with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655][Hogwarts Battle School]] in mind, specifically the more recent chapters. Foreign students are visiting for the tournament. No spoilers, so I'll stop there.

1: Even though both magic systems are equally fictional to /us/.

2: Convincingly, I mean. Wasn't it Rowling who admitted in an interview that Snape didn't deserve it? I don't quite remember.

(I acknowledge there are stories that turn Dumbledore & the Order against Harry, and sometimes popular sentiment has been against Harry, but the former still isn't a very flexible enemy and the latter isn't a character.)

** Ordinarily, I hate reading about OC main characters, and even OC secondary characters often irritate me. However, I adored [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2481096/1/][One Day at a Time]] (currently being rewritten as [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7319692/1/][Pensieve Souls]]) when I first read it, and I'm enjoying the rewrite too (making a Tarazet plushie is still at the top of my to-do list as soon as I magically come across stuffing I don't have to order online or dissect anything for) even though I hate OCs and dislike Snape. Also, when I read the amazing epic fantastic mindblowingly awesome [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]], I not only didn't hate Calypso, but actually appreciated and enjoyed her presence. Kira, on the other hand...... x_x thank god she was so minor.

So I guess the point is that although a lot of people might balk from OCs in principle, good storytelling and likeable characters will prevail even against prejudice.

** I have 0 interest in reading about a main OC, and will usually skip fics that have OCs that are too fleshed out for my liking. There are so many canon characters in HP that there's really no reason to have an OC as a main character. I'm okay with them being minor characters as long as they stay minor characters and have little "screen time."

** While i don't have anything against them, if the fanfiction is written simply based around a new OC that suddenly appears,relative of X character, or even an normal student of the school, if he is the center of the story, i don't read, it is simply too much mary sue potential.

** I think the general trend is that you're better off with a few done well than a lot done poorly. I don't particularly mind introducing characters just to put a name to a face, like naming Hermione's parents but when they are right in the thick of things it can easily become unreadable.
