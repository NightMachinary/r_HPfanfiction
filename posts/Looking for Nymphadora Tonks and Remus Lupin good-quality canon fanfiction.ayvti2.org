I'm a huge fan of Nymphadora Tonks and Remus Lupin in book canon. I've read just about every canon fanfiction about Nymphadora Tonks and Remus Lupin, in particular my favourate authors are Mrstater, Lady Bracknell, Gilpin, Godrical, Sweetdeamon, Jess Pallas, just to name a few :) I am desperate to find more canon fanfiction similar to the work of the above authors, so if anyone knows of anything please let me know, I will be forever grateful! x


** Please forgive the lame self-recommendation, but I can't help it (those are my favourite Tonks/Lupin authors too so perhaps we are on the same wave length, taste-wise!). My story, Flying Colours, is a canon Remus & Tonks fic over the OOTP timeline [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13001458/1/Flying-Colours]] (also on Archive of our Own).

** I'm not a fan of Tonks, but stories by shimotsuki11 are very well-written. They are very close to what JK published about Remus and Tonks on Pottermore, so it's as canon compliant as it's possible to be.

  Nymphadora Tonks answered the call to join The Order of the Phoenix, not knowing what exactly was to come. Fighting for a world she holds dear, she is facing dangerous missions, balancing Order duty with her job, an unlikely friendship, and a chance for love. OOtP era RLNT love story.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  Tonks knows all about werewolves, thanks to her Auror training, so now she can humansplain lycanthropy to this intriguing man she just met named Remus Lupin. That'll impress him, right?
