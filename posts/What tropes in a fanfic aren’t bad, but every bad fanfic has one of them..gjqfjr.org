I'm interested in finding out about this. For example, there are a lot of bad fanfics where harry has a twin who was thought to be the BWL. A lot of them are bad but not all. Tropes like that.


** Diagon Alley shopping trips. They're necessary, they happen in canon, it's an easy point of divergence and your protagonist can get a lot of really helpful stuff.

But when you spend an entire chapter or even multiple chapters meticulously detailing everything your protagonist bought in every shop, including shopkeepers who are easily intimidated by your protagonist or who are willing to break laws to sell them super special items and then none of those items matter a whit later on it just becomes a masturbatory exercise in materialism.

Vague shopping trips are great because you can legitimately pull pretty much anything your protagonist needs later on out of your hat and claim that they got it during the shopping trip that you didn't put on the page.

*** In Canon, Diagon Alley chapter are great because of everything that happens outside of the Shopping Trip. Every time Harry goes to Diagon Alley, Rowling use this scene to either introduce a character or to foreshadow the plot (sometimes both). Just like in CoS when Harry meet both Lucius Malfoy and Lockart, and past this chapter the narration sometimes make off hand comment about Ginny and her diary (foreshadowing the end of the plot).

When Rowling doesn't have any information to give, Harry just doesn't go to Diagon Alley and Molly does the shopping trip off screen (like in GoF and maybe OotP?).

So yeah Vague Shopping are the best because nobody need to read 5k words about how Harry bought gold rimmed glasses (when he doesn't buy the very expensive potion that cure nearsightedness that both James Potter and Albus Dumbledore chose to not buy for reasons), Acromantula' silk robes and a "Duelist Wand Holder".

** A central OC.

I have a fic with a central OC, I'm not bashing the concept itself, but so many inexperienced writers start with building the background of their self-insert/cliched OC, sending them to Hogwarts, but then they haven't bothered to think of a plot beyond that or why it needs to be an OC to do it.

*** Even non-central OCs can be obnoxious when they are just sort of there to be there and talk about themselves.

OCs can be very well done, though. Yours and Northumbian's are proof of that.

It's a shame when the existence of an OC drives people away from otherwise great fics. I recently came across [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14939201/chapters/34612796][this fic]] that seems to suffer from that problem.

**** I've seen OCs done extremely well. But you need a light touch. For it to work, the OC needs to simply /exist/ in that world, without a ton of back story front loaded early on. You drop little gems here and there about that OC. The reader can figure out that if an OC always takes the floo or flies that they had some kind of Issue with apparating. You don't need to go into this long, overworked retelling of that one time they apparated and ended up in wizard hitler's lair by accident or something.

In fact, heavy duty internal monologue/exposition. I can pick up hints, I promise you. The whole reason for fanfic versus original fic is because we all know the source material, so you can shorthand most things, and the reader will get it. Hell, even with original fic, you do much better when you show, not tell.

***** For FloreatCastellum

linkao3(1344421)

Follows Harry's Auror trainee

linkao3(Wood for the Trees)

Romance fic about Harry's son James and an OC falling in love while working together as Aurors.

For Northumbrian:

linkffn(6331126)

Muggle OC friend of Harry and Ginny whose son goes to primary school with James.

linkfnn(8465313)

The sequel, James and Me, is a story about the romance between the daughter of the Muggle OC and a grown up James.

I would also recommend Friends and Foes and the MIT series by him which follow a couple OCs (a vampire and a Muggle policewoman) as well as Harry and some of the former DA. Unfortunately Friends and Foes and some of the MIT fics are incomplete.

Northumbrian's Harry and Ginny are a bit flat but his OCs and his interpretations of minor canon characters are great. FloreatCastellum's characters are all amazing with great dialogue. Her universe is basically my headcanon. Both authors write canon compliant.

Edit: Sigh...the bot seems to not like it when you use the ID number for Ao3.

*** Agreed. I sometimes feel like a bit of a hypocrite because I will write so much stuff with OCs but then skip 90% of the fics that I see with an OC only becuse they containe an OC.

** I'd say most tropes aren't intrinsically bad. Just the implementation is often shoddy, and the fact that they are so over used makes people very critical of them.

There is a reason they become tropes, in the first place, and that's because a lot of people find the ideas appealing.

** There's no bad tropes, only bad executions of tropes.

Like, for example, the super apartment trunk that has five bedrooms, three bathrooms, multiple libraries, a fireplace with a Floo connection, etc. I don't mind it, but there should be a good reason for it. Will Harry be running away from Hogwarts or Privet Drive? Is he organizing an undercover operation? Is his plan to drop the trunk in the middle of the desert somewhere and hide until the conflict is over? Is he running some sort of business that needs absolute secrecy and nowhere else will do? Is Harry going to be using it on a consistent basis?

Don't get the super cool Moody-esque trunk and only use it a few times (if even that!) before forgetting about it completely.

*** It goes double for those really wealthy Harry stories. Find a reason for him to need that much money, or for that matter /for the author to mention it/. You want to say that he's a multi billionaire? Cool. Why would he need to know that he has all that cash?

You want to overpower your Mary Sue Harry? Pointless. You want to say that he uses that wealth to buy out the debt of poor muggleborn children, and ensure that they get good apprenticeship, or positions in the Ministry? Cool. You're making him nobility? Fine. What for? To have the title for the sake of having the title is stupid. To have the title so that he uses his parliamentary seat to drag the wizarding world kicking and screaming into the modern era? Cool. I'm here for it.

Same goes for super trunk. Is the dude paranoid from the jump off, and he gets more so after seeing the moody trunk, and now he realises what a valuable tool it would be, so he commissions one? Cool. Tell me /why/, and it can't be “because he's rich, and it's cool.” I've seen even really wealthy people stick to the version of stuff that's good enough to work well, and be of quality. Nobody isn't a niche collector is going to drop millions (for example) on 10 fancy cars. They'll get a nice one that works, and keep it moving.

Actually, I could see this being a funny in universe reason: Harry, impulsive teenager, sees something cool and just buys one.
