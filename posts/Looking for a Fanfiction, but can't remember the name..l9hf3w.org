:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfiction that I read a few years ago and I can't remember the name.

A list of events that happen in the book:

- Tom Riddle is sane again
- Harry stays at Riddle Manor with Tom Riddle in Little Hangleton
- Harry is on a soccer (football) team in Little Hangleton
- Dean (I think) plays against Harry during a soccer (football) game and realizes it's him.
- Death Eaters try to turn against Tom


** It might be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1644645/1/Harry-s-Savior][Harry's Savior]], by shadowsylvia. Harry is cared for by Tom and a mind healer named Matthew in Little Hangleton, and he plays football for the town team. I believe this Tom has separated from the "main Voldemort" somehow. linkffn(1644645).

**** Glad I could help. The detail of Harry playing football in Little Hangleton was a good one. It triggered the dusty gears in my memory and worked as a keyword for me to search in my old reader notes.

***** That was literally one of the main things that I remembered from this fic because I found it so unique to this fic compared to all the others I have ever read.

  Harry is offered a way out of the Dursleys and a specialized education to be an Auror. The only catch...Voldemort.
