I'm looking for some of the best fanfics that involve Harry (or anyone really) hunting Voldemort's horcruxes. Are there any you know of that present a cool spin to the normal 'horcrux-hunt' type fics?


** Horcrux hunts that are different:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]]: First, a hunt like the canon is completely useless here. Second, the canon Trio would most likely be killed by their traps. Third, this hunt itself is a diversion for Voldemort

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/][Petrification Proliferation]]: Dumbledore takes the Basilisk more seriously, and the canon plot is mostly solved, including most Horcruxes

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]]: They found an easy way to destroy Horcrux powered individuals in Egypt, but couldn't find any of Voldemort's Horcruxes after learning that knowledge. Harry not being a Horcrux here actually works against them

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]]: 'Harry' leads them on a Horcrux hunt too, but with a very different goal in mind

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/][The Accidental Bond]]: A competent Ministry found most Horcruxes. The war against Voldemort is very much in the background

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11933512/1/][The House of Potter Rebuilt]]: This fic has some very unique plot twists

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/][When in Doubt, Obliviate]]: [[/spoiler][Memory charm specialists Lockhart and Harry obliviate Voldemort back to his infancy, so no need to hunt Horcruxes anymore]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]]: Time traveling Harry doesn't know where Voldemort's Horcruxes are in 1970, so he has to try something different here

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]]: [[/spoiler][Voldemort got a body back much earlier, but is magically so weak that he has to rejoin all of them. Finding them all in his weakened state proves to be quite a challenge]]

** If you're okay with self-inserts:

I just read a muggle self-insert where they take diary Tom back to try and absorb them all through remorse. They even hunt down herpo the foul's horcrux in an attempt to learn more about them.

Linkao3(seven devils)

Also, self promotion: Ted Tonks has a self-insert little sister who is on a horcrux hunt during the marauder era. She just stole the locket from a Malfoy Christmas party in the latest chapter! She's down to just the cup now.

  The six devils of hell encompass all of the seven deadly sins. Each devil possess every sin in their being. But, six is such a terrible number. They are in search of a seventh. Tormenting human Jeongguk and making him fall sounds tempting.

  A college student is reborn as Ted Tonks's little sister. She is determined to learn all that she can in order to vanquish Voldemort before Halloween of 1981. At any cost, by any means. That intense ambition and utter ruthlessness has the Hat sort her, a known muggleborn, into Slytherin. _____________________I got tired of reading OCs and SIs and AUs that did nothing to change to the plot so here we are.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.
