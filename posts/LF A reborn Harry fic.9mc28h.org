So recently I've been trying to find this one particular fanfic. I know it's a reborn fanfic, but Harry has less of the whole, "Lets save the world!" and more of an "I'm done with all this crap" attitude. I remember that it starts out with him leaving Privet Drive and basically disappearing into the Muggle world. Dumbledore gives him his letter and finds out that he's living alone, and I'm pretty sure that he disappears at some point whenever Dumbledore tries to have somebody watch him. About the only other thing I can really recall is that he was sorted into Slytherin. Any help would be much appreciated, thanks!

Edit: Never mind, I found it. It's all good

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
