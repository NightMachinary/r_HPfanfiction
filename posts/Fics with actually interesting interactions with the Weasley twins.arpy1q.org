I think actually fun Weasley twins is one of those things, like actually intelligent Dumbledore, that are signs of a good fic. As an example, from what I've read lately, in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense), whenever the Weasley twins come by, I'm always looking forward to the interaction because something actually interesting does happen. So, fics like that?

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** I'm working on this one about their early Hogwarts pranks. I understand why Rowling didn't make them main characters, since it's hard to maintain this level of wit for a whole story. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14846531/chapters/34366397]])

  Fred and George Weasley are used to pulling pranks with a hairpin and pocketknife, but in their first year at Hogwarts, they find some extra help locked in a drawer in Filch's office. These characters are the property of J.K. Rowling.First Place Winner in the Honorary Marauder category in the Shrieking Shack Society's 2018 Marauder Medals. Thanks to everyone who voted!

*** I agree, in a way. Most stories where they feel truly special are when they are distractions woven through the plot rather than the focus of attention. I'll be sure to check out your fic, the premise sounds interesting.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
