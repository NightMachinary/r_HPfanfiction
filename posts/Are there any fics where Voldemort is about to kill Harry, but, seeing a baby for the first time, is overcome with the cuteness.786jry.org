Not one where he takes him and raises him as his own, but more that the power he knew not was the power of a cute, innocent baby. And from there, he suffers regret for killing Lily and James, and then thinks back to all the other babies parents he must've killed, and ends up overpowered by regret of all those poor little orphaned children, and heals his soul.

I imagine Sirius and Hagrid turn up to find him sobbing by the crib while Harry plays with all the things Voldemort conjured for him.


** This reminds me of a more serious theory that making a Horcrux requires committing an act even /you/ find depraved, which is harder and harder because the more your soul is damaged, the less inhibitions you have. So Riddle started with the murder of his parents that was sorta-kinda justified, and moved "up" from there. In Godric's Hollow he didn't take any protections for his soul because he still had a bit more humanity than he /thought/ he did --- the fact of killing an innocent baby over his mother's pleas was still a bit too much for him and that was why it accidentally fractured his soul once again.

*** That actually makes more than a little sense - and it's a very cool explanation for what actually happened that night.

The process of making a Horcrux is supposed to damage/destabilize your soul enough that it can be separated.

Simple murder isn't nearly enough to disturb some people.

*** I've read a while ago that the "horrible" act is Cannibalism. The writers argument was that When the killing curse rebounded his soul was so mutated that it ate his body and those the horcrux was unknowingly made and that's why there was no body founded. It's a pretty good theory, the writer did explain it in detail that it's actually believable

**** I know that theory, but eh, I dunno... it feels like a body-related ritual seems to be sort of missing the point for what is quintessentially soul magic. Also, surely it'd have come up in the investigation if Hepzibah Smith and Co. had been mutilated and half-eaten --- whereas the authorities deemed it likely enough in Smith's case that she had been /poisoned/. So good try but no cigar.

****** I find it to be stupid as cannibalism is hardly an atrocious thing. In fact, I find it to be a good solution. No need to make all those dead bodies rot into the ground when they can be eaten.
