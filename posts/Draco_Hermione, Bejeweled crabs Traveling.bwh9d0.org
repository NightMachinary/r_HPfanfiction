:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic I read a long time ago, it was a very slow burn Draco/Hermione fic. They were traveling, he was her assigned auror (? maybe), he had a suitcase with a potions kit and was very into potions, but it wasn't his job. There wasn't much romance and the fic was more story-driven than most other "romance" fics. There were dangerous Bejeweled, endangered crabs involved? It was a fairly lengthy fic. Anyone know which one I'm thinking of? I'll add more if I remember more, I'm currently just stuck att the crabs and potions part ðŸ˜…
