The stories written by Windschild8178 are great. Especially the one known as Stay Standing, where Ron's self-esteem is so low that he predetermines every one's opinion of his potential death. So would anyone know similar fanfics out there? It can be from any website.

EDIT: I meant Stay Standing, not Within, my bad.


** I don't know about the fic you are mentioning but this is my fave ron centric fic ever.

Groundhog Day Â» Ron keeps reliving the same day over and over. His world is inhabited by the same people every day, but they don't know that the day repeating itself. He is the only one who can remember what happened yesterday and that gives him an advantage!R/H & Humor
