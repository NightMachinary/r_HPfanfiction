This fic is an AU where Harry is taken away to be raised by Dumbledore in secret after a short time with the Dursleys. Dumbledore leaves his public positions from the time he takes Harry away to the time Harry starts at Hogwarts. Dumbledore doesn't give him magical commando training, but he does have a large influence as Harry's sole parent and companion, and Harry in this fic seems to be much more well-read and adjusted to the Wizarding World. He wasn't allowed a wand before Hogwarts shopping, but he was allowed to read any books Dumbledore had, brew simple potions under supervision and to explore the magical forest around their home.

What I'd like more of is fics with any of the following:

- Harry gaining a guardian who truly cares for him and provides for him a happy childhood. If he is better prepared for Hogwarts and Voldemort by the end of this period without being too implausible, bonus points.
- Prose that deals with the sorrow and fear that comes with loving a child or parental figure so much.
- No bashing, but also no "Death Eaters were right all along" bullshit.

  Canon Divergence AU Dumbledore raises Harry from the age of four after the Dursleys are found to be unfit guardians. They live in relative isolation, away from the pressures and dangers of the wizarding world, until Harry turns eleven. Then they return to Hogwarts together in the role of headmaster and student.Nothing has changed except for Harry and Dumbledore and what they mean to each other. And that changes everything.

*** It is a great story! I'm beginning to dislike stories that make Harry's childhood even worse. It's already pretty bad, just losing your parents in infancy and having an insane villain raring to murder you is already pretty terrible. So fics that give him happiness in childhood are precious.

**** There's more than enough to work with if you want to highlight Harry's unfortunate childhood. Making it worse is a bit like flanderizing Marge Dursleys.
