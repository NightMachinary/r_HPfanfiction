#+TITLE: I've just re-read part of Limpieza de Sangre and wanted to discuss something here. Do you think if Moody and the rest of the Order found out Harry was hanging out with Emily they would react as they have in the fic? Would there maybe be more scorn, more hostility? Or is the depiction there true?

** Emily is a master manipulator. I got the impression that she had turned more than one order member. The order loves Harry and doesn't want to lose him. I haven't finished it but that was how I took it. Remember, from their point of view he is a child.

Also Moody did get bent out of shape lol.
