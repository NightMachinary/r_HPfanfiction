Except HPMOR, of course. I'd like to see a situation where hermione is dead and linger as a ghost. Preferably in early years (death by basilisk). Maybe just platonic friendship or maybe more?

edit: well... I don't think this one need new thread since the premise is similar. So, any snape and lily story post lily death in similar premise? As in her ghost remain in the world?


** In contrast, here's one with Harry/Hermione except that /Harry/ is dead; linkffn(the Little Veela That Could by Darth Drafter)

**** About as bad as you can get while still being literate. Dumbledore's obsession with bringing about his canon plot borders on brain damage. Accept that and it can be kinda fun.
