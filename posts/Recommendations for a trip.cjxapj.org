** My all-time favorite fic(s) is Resonance and its two sequels , Revolution and Resolution. It's sadly abandoned somewhere around 90% through the third fic, but even without a proper resolution, it's still the fic I go back to time and time again. It's... a bit of a premise, but the author shows her work and pulls it off magnificently. It's also what brought me to HP/NT as my preferred ship.

*** Honestly, I'm open to try most things aside from slash-HP & HP/LL, and I've tried reading a mixed bag, but I only got into reading ffs recently, so I fear I'm somewhat out of my depth. Anything outside of those two things, I'm willing to try if the writing is good enough.

Both light & dark, DE-centric, HP-centric, godlike, sick - anything that is written well is essentially interesting given how little experience I have.

Edit: The only other preference would be a longer(multiple stories maybe?) story, given that I have a lot of time to occupy between FFs and Netflix ðŸ˜…

**** Very long Harry/Hermione fics I really liked centric on both characters: linkffn(Patron by Starfox5; Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Patron has a really interesting situation with much more pureblood traditions and muggleborns having less rights, which makes the situation between the two awkward.

Lady Thief has a series of other romances during the Hogwarts years with Harry and Hermione not getting together until after graduating and getting jobs. Again, circumstances are awkward because Hermione can't figure out how to tell him that she's the thief he's hunting.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.
