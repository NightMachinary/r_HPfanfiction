The Trio plus Luna, Ginny, and Neville attend an Ayahuasca Retreat with Dumbledore as their Trip Guide. Fellow attendees include Tom Riddle, Severus Snape,Draco Malfoy, Delores Umbridge and Aunt Petunia. Hilarity and emotions ensue.

If Dumbledore sounds like Marianne Williamson that's even better.


** The base premise sounds very interesting actually.

It could be an opportunity to introduce interesting concepts such as shamanism, plant magic, soul magic etc.

I could definitely see Dumbledore leading an ayahuasca retreat. He seems to be the type into shamanism and all of that stuff.

** I need this concept as a fanfic in my life.

I read a fic (over a decade now so I don't remember the name) where the marauders smoked gillyweed rather than muggle weed.

I bet wizards have their own drugs.

*** MACUSA issued a citation against Dumbledore for helping The Beatles levitate The Pentagon during the Vietnam Protests plus Him and Yoko singing The Hogwarts School Song required a lot of Obliviators
