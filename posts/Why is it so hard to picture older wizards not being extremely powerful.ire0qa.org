I've seen so many fics where all old wizards are powerful bad asses and Dumbledore is just the cherry on top

like, Xeno is always made into a guy throwing off fifteen deatheaters at once with cool rainbow spells flying all around Arthur weasley is another one I've seen made into a powerful wizard

Eh basically all the characters' dads are op, Hermione's dad is a muggle? So what, he'll be running at the death eaters with a shield and a shotgun in hand..

I kind of fall into this problem too, with my view if magic being that there's no way a 17 yo is as powerful magically as an older wizard unless they're some magical prodigy like Dumbledore or Tom Riddle, maybe even Harry.

This all also applies to witches, lily potter/evans, molly, lunas mom...

So, why do we make older wizards and witches op?


** We tend to equate time with wisdom, and magic with wisdom as well; as such, time with magic means stronger magic over time, aka the strongest wizards are the oldest.

All of this assumes that magic takes a zero-toll on the user, otherwise we'd see old decrepit wizards struggling to cast more simple spells.

In the new movies, the ancient alchemist dude forget his name can barely walk, but he can summon a force field to contain grindelwald's demons? Huh k

*** Yeah, well Flamel is a large part of my reason to think magic comes from age instead of just getting all of it at 17 or something..

I assume it takes a zero toll, the only reason Flamel was like he was is because he used the stone, which I believe is based off of freely given unicorn blood.

I just assume you get a lot of magic at birth, a lot of it at 17 and then a lot of it every 50th birthday

** It's a trope. The Old Soldier who outclasses all the new young bucks, the Ancient Wizard who can rewrite reality, the cranky old dude who lives in a trailer park and can somehow punch through brick walls, etc. It's such a trope that Terry Pratchett parodied it in his Discworld series with Cohen the Barbarian and 'The Silver Horde'.

Old Magic People being powerful is the Harry Potter version of Joel Miller from Last of Us being able to hit so ridiculously hard despite greying at the temples, basically. :D

  What if adults acted like adults? If they take responsibility, don't get distracted by revenge, build capable governments, and don't try to hold three full time vitally important jobs at the same time: result? Shit gets done. Sirius raises Harry; Dumbledore is awesome; the Blacks are possibly awesomer; the Ministry is functional, and Lupin gets a very interesting job.

Also, iirc Joel wasn't that old. Iirc he was in his 40s in game 1, which would make him roughly 50 in game 2. His grey hairs were more likely a result of his stressful life then a sign of him getting old.

And yeah, he was late 40s in game one and early 50s in game two. Don't get me wrong, he's not obnoxiously strong, but he's still stronger than most in that 'Protagonists are basically the Fiction-World Terminator' sort of way. :)

It was more of an aiding-understanding comparison than a factual categorical quantification comparison. :)

** More time to learn tons of magic, a lifetime of success at avoiding death. Plus, there are plenty of counter examples of old people who don't seem particularly powerful. Elphias Doge, Bathilda Bagshot, Dedalus Diggle. Fudge and Umbridge seem middle aged and not all that impressive. The more important characters are more powerful but maybe that's why they're more important.

** To be fair, the examples I've seen most frequently used in fanfiction are somewhat understandable. Dumbledore, Abeforth, Voldemort and Augusta Longbottom all have a canonical basis for their fanon badassery. Likewise, James and Lily are usually portrayed as skilled combatants with lots of knowledge and power. And canon does say they defied Voldemort three times which could be taken as literal duels so I can get the basis there as well. Then you have people like Bellatrix Lestrange who is obviously a very skilled and powerful witch so time travel Fics like to run with her being one of those prodigies you mentioned. The same with Severus Snape. The same with Sirius Black. The same with Alastor Moody. The same with Minerva McGonagall. These are, in my experience, the prime candidates for powerful depictions in fanon.

On the flip side, the characters canon doesn't devote much time to can flip either way. Xeno being a good example of that, but I honestly don't think it's ever fair to lump a Lovegood in with an argument about fanon depiction. They're the ultimate variable and everybody in the fandom has a different idea for them ranging from crackpots to all knowing seers. For the most part though, the unattended canon characters are typically lumped in with the likes of Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Neville. Powerful, skilled but not overly so. Daphne Greengrass is a phenomenal example of this, as is Tracey Davis, Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott, Blaise Zabini, Theo Nott. If and when they show up in fanfiction, they're usually pretty on-level.

However, when canon goes out of its way to indicate that an adult is not all that special or powerful, fanon typically adheres to it. Molly and Arthur Weasley for example are almost never depicted as more than passable combatants if they're put into combat at all. The same with the likes of Professors Sprout and Slughorn.

Of course there are always exceptions and I've seen more than one fic where Flitwick can singlehandedly dispatch armies but they're outliers in my experience.

** Mostly because of the system we come with (there actually are some that makes it so magicals have an age in which their power hits the maximum and then starts to decline, though I can only remember Magiks of the Arkana).

In cannon we are told that there are wizards and witches more powerful, but in practice it is hard to get an actual measure or find a reason for someone being more powerful. The killing curse supposedly takes up a lot of power, however Snape, Voldemort, and every DE no matter the age or supposed skill-level can throw those around like candy, Fiendfyre that is arguably the most destructive spell used in the entire saga can be used by Goyle, who was always described as being a powerless idiot. The result of this is that we can't really get a measure of how powerful someone has to be to cast a certain spell since as far as we know anyone is capable of casting any spell. The whole thing gets even messier when we take into account that in no moment any character described feeling tired by overusing their magic.

The result is a magical system that paradoxically makes it so some are said to be more powerful than others at the same time that no difference in power seems to reflect in anyway on the magical's skill. Many writers than try to built upon it to fix the contradiction using cannon power levels as the basis of it. So Dumbledore is old and powerful, so it is only a mild jump to say that he is powerful partially because of his age.

Then there is the fact that by having an older character they would have had a long time off-screen to get stronger and accumulate knowledge. This plus the general consensus that physical factors shouldn't have much impact on magical power and we get the bare bones of a system in which being older makes the character stronger.

Beyond all that there is also the association factor. When we think about a powerful wizard we immediately think about Merlin and picture him as being downright ancient, so we are more likely to automatically link both of those characteristics.

*** You make some very good points there, I too do the "fix tha broken magik system" thing, by making it so that the characters in my world gain a lot of magic at birth, at 17 and then a percentage of their current magical power, which is then added to that power every fifty years since birth.

that makes Flamel by far the most powerful wizard that is known to be alive, but also kind of senile because living to 600 something isnt healthy for the mind or the body. The result is what we see in the fantastic beasts movies in which Flamel is barely standing and is so fragile that shaking a hand hurts him, yet he can raise a huge shield dome to contain Grindelwalds fire demon thingies..

** I also find that quite ridiculous. The average person isn't likely to be combat trained, no matter their power. Like even if, let's say, Arthur Weasley is quite powerful (and my attempts at fics typically have him as such, due to me using the "magical bloodlines get stronger with each generation" cliche), he's a /desk worker/. He has no reason to know combat beyond his DADA education and whatever basics he had to learn before being allowed to carry out dark artifact raids.

However, I also like to make use of obscure/family magic tropes, which if used well could make up for the lack of experience, or even power - if you don't know what something does in a world of magic, you will be forced on the defensive as for all you know, it might be immediately fatal. For the Xeno example, he could successfully defend his house because, unlike his daughter, he actually sees and interacts with his creatures, and death eaters on his home turf were swarmed by invisible magical hornets, allowing the otherwise harmless Xeno to survive.

**** Thing is, canon Order isn't exactly a squad of warriors. Nor particularly powerful. The original, first war Order was, but the second one is more or less whoever Dumbledore could manage to find. They guard the prophecy, hold dinner parties and send Remus + Hagrid on diplomatic missions, but besides the three aurors, Snape and Dumbledore, they're not exactly fighters. I'm not sure if can I believe they provide their members with actual training, seeing how even their saviour wasn't given any.

And my whole point about Xeno there is that if you take the unknown magics into account, he doesn't need combat training if he's attacked at his home. Due to having his psuedo-imaginary creatures attack the death eaters, his generic Hogwarts defence education is enough to deal /some/ damage before failing.
