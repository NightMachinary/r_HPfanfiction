I read it over a year ago and it was pretty good but I can't find it.

Harry is pretty much a psychopath, he can't feel emotions or anything of the sort. I think he ends up becoming a kind of mentor to Blaise and Hermione, he goes on a dueling circuit, he meets the Delacours on a hidden magic island(I think its an island).

I know there is one point where he plays the violin and everyone around finds it beautiful, and there is this part in the first or second chapter where he's painting a rose.

I also know that he somewhat joins forces with Voldemort and the light and Dark factions end up having different lands(i think)

I'm also about 50% sure the name of the story starts with an M.


** Dunno but try this: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless]]) the one you want sounds cliche-ridden. This one is truth in advertising, not a single Ruth is in it.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.

  He was a genius. He could paint, play music, talk to snakes, control fire. He was more powerful and intelligent then any knew. He had strong 'friends'. The problem was, he had few emotions. Dark Harry. I Do Not Own Harry Potter. -Slash-
