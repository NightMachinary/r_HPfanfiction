HELP! please, I know we arnt me t to do this butI've been looking for this story for months and can't seem to find it and I'm starting to go mad,.

The story is a Harry Potter time travel but it turns out that Harry was origanly from the past and was in fact James potters older twin he ends up in a arranged marriage with Bellatrix and tells her the truth about the future. The blacks and potters become close to stop the future from happening and I think that when harry wakes up in the future he is in his old nursery in potter Manor that he use to share with James when the were both babies and I think Harry is sorted into slythering and I'm not sure but I think lily and Snape get together
