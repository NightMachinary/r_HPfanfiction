** If you don't mind a self rec....I have a WIP that is canon divergent pre-series. I feel reasonably confident it's pretty original...Muggles are aware of the magical...it's a bit post dystopian in a way. I update twice a week. Warning - it is dramione. But there's absolutely no Weasley bashing.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2750775/1/The-Code][The Code]] is the first book in a series by Aduro on fanfiction.net. It is one of the most original ideas I have ever seen. I used to hate Draco Malfoy fics because I could not find many that were well written. However, this is now one of my all time favorites and is exceedingly well written. It's such a unique piece and I haven't seen anything like it.

** None...?

You want fics without cliches. But theres not something like fiction without tropes. It simply doesnt exist.

Because they are really good and cool, I recommend you:

  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.

** My fic - only trope it follows is a nod and wink at how silly pureblood politics among 11-year olds is.

AU after 1st year, canon divergent when Harry's 9 years old. Lots of international travel, ancient Mesopotamian mythology, gritty realism, creative and action-packed magical combat. You've never read anything like it :D
