Does anybody have any leads on a “good Dumbledore”, “powerful/political Harry” fanfic. Bonus points if Sirius lives.


** Just randomly what goes through my head:

- linkao3(1085412) --- Dumbledore is not very good, but not overly so
- linkao3(14078862) and its sequels
- linkao3(15687453) --- it is post-War, so Dumbledore is dead at the moment, but nevertheless I like it very much

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.
