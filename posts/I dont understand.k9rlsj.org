on here several time I've seen people get downvoted for no particular reason, if someone is looking for a certaint fic, just because you dont like the idea dont downvote it because of some tag or for the sake of it. you might not like it but that doesn't mean others dont, all it does is make it harder for the poster to find what their looking for, just move on without voteing it. or if someone is trying to be helpfull, leave a comment or something correcting it if they're mistaken. there's no reason to downvote people on this subreddit unless they are being scummy or breaking the rules all your going to do is make people more likely repeat their post all because you personally had a diffrent opinion on something that differd from theirs.


** I just downvote pedophilia or very problematic things, like SnapexHarry, SnapexHermione, TomxHarry, TomxHermione, SiriusxHermione, RemusxHermione, any student-teacher relationship etc.

Oh unless its time travel, where these characters are the same age as Harry or Hermione.

But this is not even common.

** sorry for the rant, but twice now ive posted for a looking for fic post trying to a specific one. and its gotten downvoted both times. and it dosent affect the people who downvoted ot so why do they feel the need to do so. i got a comment asking if i ever found it and i had to say no because it got downvoted with no comments before that, why does it matter if i want to read a certaint fic with certaint tropes you dont like. or whatever reason your downvoteing, it gives no criticisim, and dosent show why people have an issue with the post for somereason. im sure you would feel a similar frustration if it happend to you. all i wanted to do was find the first hp fic i ever remember reading.

*** Personally, I agree with you - what other people like or dislike has very little impact on what stories I enjoy, just like my preferences don't matter for their fic choices. The general argument I've seen is that those people don't want those things on the sub, so they downvote in the hopes that people will stop requesting or recommending them. The reasons for why they might not want that thing range wildly, depending on the person and the thing in question, so I can't really explain those without making this response obnoxiously long. :D

*** I find that so frustrating as well! If I recommend a Drarry fic, people downvote it, even if it's literally what was requested.

** I get the same thing. There are several requests I've put out and I get downvoted and no coments on. And heaven forbid you mention a serten Harry potter fic with his last name a tipe of bird.

I asked this same question and I was pretty much told that if they dont like the paring, what your asking for, or age difference you will get downvoted. If you ask for an unliked person there is a higher chance to be downvoted.
