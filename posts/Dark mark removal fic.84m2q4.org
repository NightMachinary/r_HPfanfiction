Hi, I read a fic ages ago where harry removes severus mark and replaced it with his own. This was a Philosophers stone AU, I'm also fairly certain that voldemort/quirell decided to follow harry also. Also when harry touched his own mark it was pleasurable rather than painful. I've been searching for it for ages but cannot find it anywhere! Any one know the fic I'm talking about??

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?
