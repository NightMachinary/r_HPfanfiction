I'm looking for a harry potter and marvel crossover where harry isn't a hero.Quite the opposite actually, i'd like a villain or anti-hero Harrry. By that i mean simply that he oppose the hero of the marvel universe.I don't really care if he's trying to save the world or conquer it or any other reason as long as he doesn't ally himself to the avengers or another hero and actually fight them.

I doesn't have any problem with slash or romance as long as it's not the center of the story.

The only one i found is a couple of one shot where female Harry is doctor doom.


** linkffn(A Child Avenged by PandasWearGlasses) is a one-shot that I wish was a full fic.

  Harry Potter is a good guy, really, but there are some lines that should never be crossed, and Nick Fury has just crossed them.

** The fanfic I'm writing has a similar premise. It's a crossover between Harry Potter and Spider-Man, and will eventually lead up to an epic confrontation between the two characters. Who is good, who is bad? You will have to find out for yourself ;)

linkffn(Amiss by generosity)

The next chapter is a big one, but I'll have to finish writing the following ones before I release them back to back.
