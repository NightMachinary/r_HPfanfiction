I've seen a lot of the opposite, where Harry time travels to Tom Riddle's time period, but not a lot of Tom traveling to the future by accident or on purpose. Anyone know of any stories like this? Thanks.


** Pygmalion by Colubrina on fanfiction.net is really good.

#+begin_quote
  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Tomione. AU. COMPLETE.
