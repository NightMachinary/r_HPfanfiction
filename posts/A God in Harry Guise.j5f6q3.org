No one knows what happened the night the Potters were attacked and Voldemort disappeared. The sole witness was too young to understand or even remember what happened. Albus Dumbledore investigated the scene himself with the aid of trustworthy Rubius Hagrid. It was they that pulled the miraculously and mysteriously unharmed child from the burning rubble of Godrick's Hallow. Unharmed, aside from a small angry cut on his forehead.

With wild magic still tearing though the Potter home, Professor Dumbledore's only true hope of uncovering what really happened was to peer into the babe's mind. Perhaps some good had come from this tragedy and the Dark Lord Voldemort was dead at last. With all the gentleness his vast experience could muster, Professor Dumbledore cast legillimens on young Harry Potter.

Something vast and ancient stared back at the impossiblely young and feeble Albus Dumbledore. An entity like none the old professor had even known resided within the boy and it knew him. It knew every sin he'd committed, every penance he'd offered. It's thoughts so alien as to be incomprehensible. It offered no malevolence, no judgment. It only existed, as the sun and the moon and the darkness in-between.

Professor Dumbledore reeled back from the gurgling baby boy. For a moment, a moment the old man would never forgive himself for, he nearly cast the infant back into the flames that consumed his parents. His better nature won out over his sanity, however. The boy clearly overcame Lord Voldemort in some fashion; perhaps permanently, perhaps not. Even if the mad man was gone forever, the child deserved a chance to show his nature. He would go to live with his remaining muggle family. He'd live as normal a life as he could manage. Then, when the time came, Harry Potter would change everything once again. That was certain.
