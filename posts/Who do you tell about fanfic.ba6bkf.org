Inspired by a particularly embarrassing moment just now, who knows you like fanfic? Has anyone ever discovered it accidentally?

I let my husband read my fics and now my sister knows too, I guess.

Royalties? Meaning like the royal family or whatever?

Cuz I always talk about my "embarrassing" hobby the same way (albeit in a foulmouthed American one): "motherfucker you're also 40 and you still watch the shitshow melodrama that is pro wrestling, so lay the fuck off my H/Hr fanfic."

** That I read fanfiction, my family and close friends know about (and a really geek friend kind of figured it out when they saw I was a huge HP fan). I think most of them don't really understand what it even means, though...

That I write, only my two best friends know (and only one has read my stuff, as she reads a lot of fanfiction too); and I'll never tell anyone else. I really don't want it spread, because I write dark and sexual stuff, and I don't want people who know me to relate that to me. Like, me writing something doesn't mean I do it, or believe in it. Or that I have a weirdly kinky sex life...

My roomies are more likely to listen to me prattle on about it and ask me questions. My girlfriend on the other jand says you are 34 years old. Go talk to someone else about this...

** I told no one growing up because of family exploding on me about my writing. (Heaven forbid I talked about people being abused and getting help within a fictional setting.) I've had supposed friends make fun of me too so it's been a private hobby of mine for over 25 years.

Told my husband when we were dating and he teased me, but I've recently found out he wrote some fan fiction when he was a kid. I picked on him mockingly, but encouraged him to rewrite it so I could read it. Yeah, that'll never happened. Wish I had local friends who could geek out about fan fiction with me. 😂

** My family and my closest friends know I both read and write fanfiction. I mean, I've been doing it for over fourteen years now, so it's just a part of me at this point. My husband is a big supporter of me being a writer, but he's never read any of my work. I haven't pushed it though. He prefers audiobooks over reading, so that's probably why he's never bothered. The only person who's ever read anything of mine is my good friend. She was my beta reader for a while, but her life got too busy.

As for casual friends...it depends. I feel like it's not that taboo of a subject anymore. I tell a lot of people that I write, but I usually talk about my original stories instead.

I also did discover one of my friends reads fanfic recently, I saw an AO3 tab open on her phone. I don't want to ask her about it though because I know how embarrassed I'd be, and she's not into Harry Potter fanfiction anyway so we can't really relate too much.

** I told my family pretty early on, maybe four months in when I could tell it was really serious. The one time I've met someone who'd read my stories in real life was after about two years of writing. Since then, I've (selectively) told friends from church and writing groups. I've never told anyone in my workplace that I write fanfic, although I've inquired of a couple people whether they read it. If one of them did, I would probably tell them.

I'm pretty sure no one's discovered accidentally because there wouldn't be much opportunity. Other people rarely see my computer screen outside of work, and I'm careful not to associate fanfic with any of my social media stuff that's connected to my real name.

** 3 years ago , I thought I was the only one who read fanfiction in the entire school. When I used to mention it to someone else they would look at me funny.

However 2 years ago in 11rg grade , I discovered 3 people in my class who also dabbled in fanfiction, though they read it on Wattpad. That day I was ecstatic to find someone else with the same interests that I had.

We had to abandon reading fanfiction over the course of the past two years because taking the science stream leaves little room for recreational activities. I hope to pick up again after May , however.

She's more into star wars, lotr, and marvel stuff which I'm rather thankful about, even if she's also a stereotypical makeup loving girl.
