** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27958/DianeCastle+Harry+Potter+and+the+Deadly+Heller.htm][Harry Potter and the Deadly Heller]] is a crossover with Buffy the Vampire Slayer. During the Astronomy Tower Battle, Ginny gains the Slayer power and takes the lead in Horcrux Hunt.

From the same author, [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] has the Trio engaged in a similar hunt for Riddle's artifacts. However, Year 7 is very different from canon in this universe.

The Horcrux Hunt mostly appears as flashbacks in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13312738/1/The-Granger-Principle][The Granger Principle]], linkffn(13312738). It's a dimensional travel in which an almost canon Hermione was thrown into a non magical universe during the Final Battle, without her wand. She tries to get back home over the next 7 years, but new powerful enemies are closing in on her.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929), Grindelwald breaks out and joins forces with Harry. Needless to say, the Horcrux Hunt takes on a completely different form.

UK military and allied wizards shot up Death Eaters, Umbridge Ministry, and Voldemort in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978). They struck on the day just before the Trio tried to enter the Ministry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux][The Seventh Hocrux]], linkffn(2818538), was written before DH came out, and is not to be confused with our sub favorite "Seventh Horcrux". This fic was well written and guessed several canon plot points correctly. Of course, its Hunt took on a very different form.

Speaking of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Hocrux]], linkffn(10677106), the Trio also went on a Hunt of some kind, but this Harry has all the initiative:

#+begin_quote
  Dear Lord Voldemort,

  I see that you have once again failed to catch myself and my companions, despite killing several of your Death Eaters. I've noticed that this happens a lot with you, and I am compelled to ask if you just really like killing your own people.

  Regardless, my sense of fair play urges me to once again inform you of our visit tomorrow.

  Love,

  Harry Potter

  P.S. I would like to assure you that I shall not be masquerading as Lucius Malfoy.
#+end_quote

While on the hunt, Harry finally managed to corrupt Hermione:

#+begin_quote
  "But what if I'm the next Dark Lord?"

  "I don't think You-Know-Who will like that very much. You'll have to kill him anyway," I said.

  Hermione giggled, smiling up at me. I don't know what was funny about that, but I took it as a good sign.

  I continued, "You'll be fine so long as you listen to your friends when they tell you that you're committing an atrocity. Then, later, when you're the Dark Lady of Wizarding Britain, you reward them by making them the Headmaster of Hogwarts."
#+end_quote

Back at Hogwarts, they found:

#+begin_quote
  Ginevra spun in place, short hair twirling around her head like a dress. "Welcome to the Chamber of Secrets!"

  Hermione glanced around. "So you're really the Heiress? I'd just assumed you had caught Harry's sense of humor."

  "Of course I am," Ginevra said. "I command the Basilisk."

  She hissed, "Come." Or possibly "Strangle." Her accent was terrible. The Basilisk slithered towards us, students scrambling out of its way. It came to rest beside Ginevra, eyes closed and waiting for instructions.

  "Go sleep twice," Ginevra said. "Only need look terrifying."

  I would like to reiterate the horror that was Ginevra Weasley attempting to speak Parseltongue. The Basilisk silently accepted this butchery of the language, returning to an empty corner where it curled into a ball.”

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
