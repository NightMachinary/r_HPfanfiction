Also, wouldn't it kind of drain the caster if it's using their hope and happiness and stuff to cast it?


** It's a long-standing problem. The thing is that, though they /do/ feed on /happiness/, Dementors /also/ thrive exclusively wherever there is gloom (they only find it safe to multiply when strife and misery is at its peak among humans, and they focus on Harry over other possible victims because he has so many reasons to be gloomy). So it seems that though it's the happiness they take, there has to be some gloom mixed with it for them to be able to consume it.

My personal theory (and it's just a theory) is that they can only take someone's happy memories while they're not thinking about said memories; hence why they cause gloom in their victims even from afar, diverting them from their happiness so that they can take it more easily. Within this framework, Patronuses are the opposite of ideal food for a Dementor: not only are there no sad thoughts to divert the being away from the happy ones since it's /made/ of happiness, but it's happiness that /actively fights back/ at that.

...The real answer, of course, is that Rowling wanted to create a species of scary, villainous spectres who spread gloom and depression, and of /course/ they'd be defeated by focusing on happy thoughts because Symbolism, and she didn't really stop to really think if the whole thing made logical sense in-universe.

This is utterly correct. In chapter 12 of /PoA/, we get the following explanation of the nature of the conjured Patronus (emphasis mine):

#+begin_quote
  Professor Lupin continued, “The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon --- hope, happiness, the desire to survive --- *but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt it.* But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it.”
#+end_quote

It is the generation of despair by draining away the positive emotions that gives dementors power. By having an intercessor incapable of feeling despair, a dementor or dementors are rendered essentially powerless, and are driven off.

---you seem to imply that it's the creation of despair itself that feeds the Dementor, and that taking away the happiness is only a byway. As I outlined above I think it is the reverse: your quote itself mentions that "hope, happiness, the desire to survive" are "the very thing the Dementor feeds upon". Dementors eat the happiness, but can only do so if they can get the victim to focus on sadness instead while they eat the happiness.

***** If that's what I'm implying, I failed at communicating what I meant. The despair allows them to reproduce and feast on the souls of witches, wizards and muggles alike. But deprive them of the despair/gloom/depression and they are unable to do so.

****** Ah, so you see the despair as "environmental conditions" as opposed to the happiness being "food". Makes sense, makes sense. My thinking is rather that they /choose/ to breed when there's much misery at hand, because much misery means easy prey means lots of potential food for offspring, as opposed to it physically /enabling/ them to do so, but both interpretations are canon-compliant.

**** It's a popular theory. I'm not entirely convinced, however; the Dementor on the train wasn't trying to Kiss him (that would be stupid), which is the only context in which the amount of soul would have been relevant. Besides, wouldn't eating a Horcrux-soul shard be akin to eating a rotten shred of goat entrails, from a soul-eater's perspective?

** Maybe it's like a really concentrated form of that emotion. So, like when dementors feed off of humans normally their positive emotions/thoughts/feelings are tempered with other emotions and make it tasty for them, but in super concentrated form its painful? Like eating salsa vs a ghost pepper.

On to using the emotion, I never thought if it as draining them to use it. It seemed to me like a buildup of mental energy to cast the spell, and once it's cast it kinda takes on a life of its own until the threat is gone.

** Rowling created Dementors at a time when she was facing strong depression. The Dementors are really a symbolism of that - like depression, it feeds on your hopes and dreams until you feel like you're not good enough or that you'll never be able to achieve success/happiness. The symbolism of the Dementors and the Patronus Charm, I think, is that a person who can truly remember their happiness and their hopes, and hold onto that feeling, will be able to drive away depression. Though whether that actually works to treat depression in real life is another matter entirely.

*** My headcanon is that when the dementor is too close and too powerful to summon up happy memories, a wizard can use feelings of determination and persistence to summon a sort of half-strength patronus. Not enough to drive the dementor away, but enough to keep it at bay and seek help.

This tells us two things:

1) Dementors get their happy memory burgers by making their target feel despair. They can't eat the Patronus at all.

B) Because the Patronus is only a projection of your emotions, there's no reason to believe it would somehow drain them out of you, nor does the text suggest that anywhere else. A Patronus is draining certainly, but that's because it's a powerful spell.

Kind of. Harry does narrate feeling exhausted after practising it. However, /any/ strong emotion is stressful to sustain, so it's more likely that he would have just as much trouble feeling anger or sadness as he would joy.

Whether one can "run out" of Patronus-joy specifically, there are several psychological forces at work, in different directions. One might become habituated to a particular happy memory, so that it becomes boring rather than happy; but one might also become sensitised to it, to make reaction to it more reflexive and robust. If there any actual psychologists reading this, it'd be interesting to know which applies.

** I'm with you; I don't think Dementors feed on happiness. They feed on despair, but their influence chases memories of happiness far away. It's not like someone meeting a Dementor who feeds on them suddenly can't remember their first kiss or something.

As embodiments/personifications of Depression, I think the canon interpretation is valid only in the sense that victims feel like happiness is no longer attainable -- 'Like I'll never be happy ever again'. That's the effect of Depression: it gets your mind swirling about the things you dread. And the answer to fighting Depression is to remind yourself of the moments you were really happy, because those are the ones that make you feel like the Depression isn't going to be forever.

*** In fact I included this reasoning in a story:

#+begin_quote
  I ended up in an argument with him over Dementors, a topic of much interest nowadays. Professor Lupin said that they feed off positive emotions, stealing away every happy thought you have.

  "That's not what happened!"

  "Miss... umm... Evans? You have an opinion?"

  I stood up as we had been taught to do when making an extended point.

  "You were there on the train! It didn't take away my happy thoughts..."

  Blaise Zabini piped in, "Do you even HAVE happy thoughts?"

  "Kinda my point, actually."

  "Nevertheless, Miss Evans, both the text and common knowledge indicate that Dementors induce an effect that makes a person feel like they'll never be happy again. The happy thoughts are gone."

  "That makes no sense."

  "As magical creatures, you will find that they operate under a different set of rules than normal beings."

  "No, I mean your position isn't supported by my experience."

  "Sit down, Miss Evans."

  Hermione stood as I sat down. "Professor Lupin?"

  "Yes Miss Granger?"

  "I think what Holly is trying to say is that Dementors wouldn't want to take happy thoughts."

  "Really? Explain. Perhaps we can learn a bit more by the discussion."

  "Well, they're like mosquitoes, really."

  The class laughed a bit, but Hermione soldiered on. "A mosquito won't bite you in the nose, because there's almost no blood there. They can see the heat coming from your arteries where the blood they want is flowing, so they naturally are drawn there. That's what they want, and they're built to go get it. Dementors are parasites, like the mosquito. They don't bring up your happy thoughts for them to eat; instead they prompt all your worst memories to come to the fore. They feed off the negative emotions, so that is what they have developed the ability to find. It explains--"

  "It explains why they went straight for me."

  Hermione saw my haunted expression and gave my shoulder a squeeze before continuing.

  "Yes, and it also explains why the only weapon against them is the Patronus Charm. The Patronus is the embodiment of a happy thought brought to life. If a Dementor fed on happy thoughts, the Patronus would draw them in like moths to flame or mosquitoes to blood, but the Dementor fled from your Patronus."
