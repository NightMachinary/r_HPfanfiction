This is driving me crazy cause I can't find it. Here are the details I remember:

-It was set in Hogwarts

-A phoenix feather was involved, I think the OC wore it as a necklace

-I think Sirius was involved and was possibly her dad?

-Lily Potter came back to life at the end (possibly)

-Ginny had a crush on Harry, but wasn't bashed in the fic. Instead, they both had a pretty mature talk about how Harry didn't have feelings for her and were able to remain friends (I think this took place either on a stairwell or outside Hagrid's cabin lol)

-pretty sure it was rated M because there was a scene (warning NSFW) where Harry wants to "explore" but the OC stopped him because she was on her period (strange detail to remember, I know).

-it was pretty well-written as far as these kind of stories go.

-I want to say the OC had black hair

-oh and the Phoenix feather was what brought lily back to life somehow at the end

Okay, I think that's all I remember. I'm worried that I'm combining two different stories in my head, but please, if anyone know this or recognizes it and can give more details, let me know. It's driving me crazy.

  What if Sirius had a daughter? What would she be like? Jenna spent her early life in an orphanage until the appearance of a man named Remus Lupin changed her life forever. This is the Diary of an Orphan. HPGW, RWHG in future chapters and maybe HPOC.
