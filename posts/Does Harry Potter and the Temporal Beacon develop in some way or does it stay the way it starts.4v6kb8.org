Sooo, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon) gets recommended a lot on here and i've been trying to get into it, but the Ron bashing and the super angsty love thingy Harry and Hermione have going on make that pretty difficult.

I got to the part where Harry poisons himself to test the beacon and Hermione tearfully confesses her love for him.

Since it's marked as an adventure fic, does it get more adventureish? Does the Ron bashing stop at some point? Does it become entertaining?

Thanks in advance.


** Not... really, in my experience. It adds some Dumbledore bashing later on, because one cannot have a time loop plot without a seemingly unbeatable threat, in this case a moderately competent Eeevil!Dumbledore. At least iirc, it's been a while since I attempted to read it, and I've since mostly gone off reading H/Hr.

It was an overly long and thoroughly mediocre read, though, as I recall. Sorry to say it.

Is he actually competant? I've been looking for a fic like that for a while.

**** Not really. And he's not really evil, more like, another iteration of “greater good” Dumbledore. What makes him look evil is his deep trust in Snape who is like 10 times more assholish than the canon one, and his inane plans concerning Snape and Harry (which results in him pretty much sending Harry to his death “because Snape says so and Snape is a holy knight”).

So ... yeah, if you are looking for a competent evil Dumbledore, bother not.

That said, it does have a rather nice approach to the triwizard tournament in general.

***** Yeah, I may have overstated his competence because I was mentally comparing him to the ones from Robst's crap. He clears that low, low bar, but not much else.

****** Don't worry, I know the pain; when compared to rubbish levels seen in many other fanfics, what we have here is competence indeed, even though objectively it isn't.

** The Triwizard tournament parts are pretty entertaining, but that's it. Not super great writing and drags a bit. Also no ending

*** Yeah I really want to read stories with more or different triwizard tasks. There's basically this, the jbern(?) one that ends pretty suddenly, and the sorting hat's stand. None of them are really great, other than the possible jbern one until he's like "fuck this story. I'm done writing it, but here's an ending because I'm a decent dude."

**** In my story "Patron", I've four tasks in the tournament, plus three competitions (Quidditch, Duelling, Curse-Breaking) between the tasks for those students who were not selected.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** The execution and cliches turned me off a bit, but there were many ideas that I did enjoy from it. One thing that was unique was how the triwizard tasks slightly shifted from one reset to the next because of certain differences. But yeah overall, it's a decent read if you can push through the cringey bits.

** I found the story to be very "meh", it only gets interesting towards the very end when someone who [[/spoiler][knows about their time looping]] appears, but the story ends immediately afterwards.

The idea I found very interesting, but the execution is poor.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** You may have fun with it if you treat it like a casual gameplay (or watching someone's “let's play”), only in text format.

Harry and Hermione gradually build up knowledge and prowess by [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming][gaming the time travel system.]] Things that change from one reset to another also include the triwizard tasks, the people they [[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Trainers][train]] with, and their loop-end confrontations with Voldemort, who himself starts to gradually get dwarfed by previously unforeseen dangers like the department of mystery.

Things that keep being annoying are the Ron-, Snape-, and Dumbledore-bashing, and that the story dies right when another player is introduced to their environment.
