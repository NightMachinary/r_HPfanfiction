:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Some time ago I started reading a fanfic but I didn't find it again.

Plot goes like this: A nearly adult Harry Potter (17 or 18) travels to another dimension were he finds himself back at time at 4th year. But there isn't a male Harry Potter but a female one which grew up very similar to him.

He takes her away from the Dursleys, adopts her and attends his last year in Hogwarts. In Hogwarts he is sorted into Slytherin and stops the 7th year Slytherins from bullying female Harry after her name came out of the Goblet.

I think male Harry joins the order and has some kind of potion addiction?

Any ideas what fanfic I mean?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope]]

It has Harry, Hermione, Neville and Luna travel to a dimension where Sirius was Sorted into Slytherin which caused a major shift that I really liked: James never grew up (I always liked the theory that James didn't grew up for Lily but for Sirius because Sirius ran away and came to the Potters and James helped him through that hard time) So James and Lily never started dating, Harry was never born and Neville was the Boy-Who-Lived. Neville of that Universe is also already dead, so are Ginny and Hermione (who weren't saved cause Harry never existed. Dumbledore also never knew about the Horcruxes because Harry never brought him the diary. So it's Harry, Hermione, Neville and Luna who told them about the Horcruxes and help them to find them in their world while searching for a way home. Harry and the others are all really fucked up in their own ways very realistic because their are literally child-soldiers.

*** I know I'm like 80 days late to the party but I just found this post and wanted to try out this story. I really liked the premise (Harry rescuing Hadley from the Dursley's and helping out against Voldemort) but what really bothered me was that Harry's.. kind of a dick? Like I know he has his own demons to fight but on the other hand he knows very well how Hadley is feeling in fourth year. And he's just like „Hi Hadley, just wanted to drop some unhelpful hints about the future, how are you? Wait, sorry, forgot I really don't care, bye“?? Like wtf man
