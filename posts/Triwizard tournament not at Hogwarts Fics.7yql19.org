Want to read some fics where the tournament is held at another school. Bonus if there is a description on how Hogwarts arrived in a unique way like Beaxbatons and Durmstrang did in GoF.

  A chance meeting and Albus and Gellert would become inseparable friends, until the death of Albus' sister. But what if Ariana had survived? Almost a century later, a boy named Harry Potter would survive the Killing Curse, finally bringing an end to Grindelwald's war. Now, as he finds a place for himself at Hogwarts, there are signs that suggest that the war might not truly be over.

*** I just read the first few chapters and am definitely interested. I have some concerns about the closeness to canon though.

Does Harry branch out in the friends depart? I don't mind Ron and Hermione but I also dislike an isolated Harry.

How about his magical skill? I don't want a Mary Sue but I also don't like ordinary Harry, I'd like him to be powerful and extraordinary in some way.

And last but Not least: shipping. I don't want to know who he ends up with but if it's Ginny or Luna or Hermione and the relationship plays a big role in the story I'd prefer to know now and not have my mood ruined by a ship that I hate destroying an otherwise good story. (also no slash pls)

I know I have pretty high standards but I'd rather not read 100k words only to abandon a fic later because I dislike something about it that only just came up.

** Note that both start at the first year, so there is a lot of words before the Tournament.

Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse, and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of either. Matou Shinji, the protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him a failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets a letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focuses on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements of both settings with author's original ideas. Features Mahoutokoro, Durmstrang, and original magical school. Ongoing, with currently irregular updates.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12177140][Phoenix Corrupted]] - Set in the world where Ariana didn't die in the duel, and Harry was Grindelwald's bane. Pretty boring for the first two years, improves drastically from the third year onwards. Currently in fifth year, updates weekly.

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand. A Boy, a Potter, and a Thief.
