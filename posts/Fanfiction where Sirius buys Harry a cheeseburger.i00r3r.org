:END:
I read a fanfiction a while ago when Sirius was freed from Azkaban, and ends up in a hospital . There's a guy who Harry calls Nemo, who take cares of Sirius. Remus also gets married to an OC who is short and has red hair. Harry's friends with Draco and another kid, and they both go to New York for vacation.
