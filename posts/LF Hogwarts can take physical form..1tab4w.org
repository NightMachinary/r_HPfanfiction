Hello everyone. I'm looking for some fics where Hogwarts can take a physical form. I would like if this version of Hogwarts mentors Harry or helps him in the story. Also if there are any that have a Harry/Hogwarts paring that's fine.


** Wow I never knew there was a Harry/Hogwarts pairing. Can't say I'm entirely surprised but it sure is something different.

Do you have any favorites of that pair that I can take a peek at?

*** I've only read one story like that and it was rather short. Only 14 chapters or so. I can't find it right now but I'll keep searching.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8378840/1/Passageways][Passageways]] by jerrway69 might be to your liking. Harry/Bellatrix time travel.

Incidentally, what's the "LF" in the title stand for?

** There are two stories that immediately come to mind.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9444812/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Unexpected-Power][Harry Potter and the Unexpected Power]] is a story by kb0. It certainly fits all of your criteria.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4753440/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Four-Founders][Harry Potter and the Four Founders]] was written by Darth Marrs and is the first part of a (loose) trilogy. The first one is pure HP story and the only tale in which Hogwarts is present as an entity/character. The sequels [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402371/1/The-Forever-Mage][The Forever Mage]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6859254/1/The-Lord-of-Light][The Lord of Light]] are crossovers with Star Trek TNG and Star Wars respectively and are likely not what you were looking for. I only mentioned them for completeness sake.
