Tom Marvolo Riddle

I am Lord Voldemort

Dr. Mortal Doom Evil

Which others could you come up with?


** There is the classic "Mr Tom, A Dildo Lover".

I don't think they'd be called "death" eaters if this one was adopted, though.

** I always thought it should be "Tom Marvollo Riddle" then the anagram could have been "Liam, Lord Voldemort" (as in "Alfred, Lord Tennyson").

Otherwise, any time Harry demonstrates how Tom showed him the anagram, any onlookers would surely have accused him of literally saying "I am Lord Voldemort".
