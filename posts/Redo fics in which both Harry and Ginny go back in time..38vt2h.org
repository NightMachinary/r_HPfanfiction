  AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love. This story is now complete! Stay tuned for the sequel!

*** I was getting in to it until

#+begin_quote
  Bellatrix threw off her bonds and raised her wand, pointing it at the back of Fred. He saw her lips move, and knew it was a Killing Curse. "Protego!" Harry shouted, and a shimmering shield erupted between her and Fred.
#+end_quote

Then it bugged me too much that the author had made such a rookie mistake to carry on.

***** But it's so wrong - I love time travel fics, /love love love love/ them. But protego doesn't shield from unforgivables. It's so... wrong.

****** You are correct, but it seems like he used protego to cut her off from firing the curse, not stop the hitting fred.

*** Spoiler alert!

Hate hate hate how they handle the Chamber of Secrets plot in this one. They're just doing exactly what happened last time, blindly assuming that nobody will get killed just because a bunch of coincidences happened last time---and then it actually works. Rest of the story is a fun read though.

**** I don't understand why they went back so far. Everything went well until the end of third year, why not start there?

**** I've heard this complaint before, and while it bugs me a bit as well, it's worth noting that they come away from that scene going "okay, that was a terrible idea."

And things start diverging more significantly after that.

Prior to the CoS incident, they were making their best attempts to keep things roughly the same while quietly rounding up horcruxes.

They didn't want to deal with the unknown consequences of making massive changes, so they tried to keep to the stations of the canon. They were basically trying to sleepwalk through their original lives while spending 80% of their energy secretly working out how to win the war. But after the chamber, they realized that change is pretty much inevitable and we start seeing much more significant divergences.

*** Didn't think it was really required. Just wanted a redo fic without the 'the love of my life is currently 10 while I'm mentally (insert vaguely old age here), isn't that sad/ slightly pedoish?'.

**** That's what kind of weirded me out about a lot of time travel fics - it was just the *weirdest* sort of grooming I could imagine. A bit like werewolves and their imprints in Twilight. So much creepy.

** So someone already recommended Backwards with Purpose, which is one of my all-time favorite fics.

Other recs:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7644616/1/Hallowed-Time-Twists][Hallowed Time Twists]] - Mixing the Potter kids with the Master of Death, not-so-secret horcruxes, haywire magic, and the dawning Second War could only end in catastrophe. All was well? Harry Potter really shouldn't have tempted fate like that. For the Potters are now stuck in a year where Voldemort is far more than a half-forgotten nightmare. --- Canon compliant, Next Generation Time Travel.

Both parents follow them into the past, so there's some nice Harry/Ginny interaction.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7737690/1/The-Rising-Phoenix][The Rising Phoenix]] - Pulled into an alternate reality where Voldemort still reigns supreme, Harry is expected to turn the tide. With Ginny by his side and no clear way back, Harry has no choice but to do it. But he's done this before so it won't be a problem, right?

Also, if you wanted to read Ginny solo, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486108/1/From-the-Flame-to-the-Spark][From the Flame to the Spark]] is good.

*** From the flame to the spark is good, but I couldn't really stick with it. The shoehorned OC and killing off Snape so early really ruined it for me.
