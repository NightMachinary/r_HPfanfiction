Harry: I never broke the law, I AM THE LAW!

Minister: What?

*During the battle at the Astronomy Tower*

Harry: Don't do it, Draco! Littering the streets is an offence!

Draco: *Does a double take* What?

*During the Yule Ball*

Harry: I am the law, and the law does not dance!

Patil: But the law is so handsome....

Harry: *Grunts* Fine.

*During the Malfoy Manor scene*

Harry: *Takes out daystick* Torturing a Judge's assistant.

*Whacks Bellatrix*

Bellatrix: OOF!

***** Yeah. Those were all 'Harry Potter-ifications' of various Judge Dredd quotes. Except for the yule ball, but I could totally see Dredd saying something like that. Him being as lovable as a brick wall and all.
