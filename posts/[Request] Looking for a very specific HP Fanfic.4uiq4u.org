After the mess with looking for "Hp and the Midnight Sun" I made sure I exhausted all my options, but nothing came up, so, here's rough summary of what I remember from the fic:

Young Harry comes into contact with Andromeda Tonks (or Amelia Bones, not sure anymore), whether he was raised by her or if it was by chance, I can't remember. Anyway, due to some obscure magic during maturity, he's required to have sex early on and ends up with a harem.

I remember it well because it had bashing of the usual suspects, which I always enjoy.

Anyone know the title? That alone would be an IMMENSE help
