Hey, I'm looking for a specific time travel fanfic and some similiar recommendations. I looked around and tried to search it but so far I didnt have any success (but found others that distracted me ...). Let's get started on what I remember and maybe someone knows what I'm looking for :

- Harry was traveling back in time as an adult
- Marauders era
- He adopts Remus Lupin ( first I think and he might have lived with his aunt before who didnt like him but I might mix something up there) and later Severus Snape
- In the end there's a (grand)child of him called Albus that becomes an unspeakable and finds out about the time traveling
- It was (relatively) long so 100k words+ I think
- I read it on ff.net

Aside from that I'm up for recommendations regarding time travel stories / dimension travel ( I prefer only Harry traveling :) ) like Yet another universe, Still Another Universe, Black Comedy, The lone traveler. Otherwise I'm always looking for humorous fanfictions like Harry the Hufflepuff or Calculation.

Thanks for any help :)


** I do not know the fic you are looking for, sorry. But some recommendations:

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/][*/A Long Journey Home/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/236698/Rakeesh][/Rakeesh/]]\\
  is my favorite time-travel story, fem!Harry travels back a few thousand years to ancient Egypt. A lot of the story plays in ancient times, before the middle ages.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/][*/0800-Rent-A-Hero/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4934632/brainthief][/brainthief/]]\\
  is a fun dimension-travelling story. The author asked for patreon-support for it, which got him a massive backlash, and thus abandoned it. It's sad that it happened, because it was a promising fic in many ways, and it had a cool take on divination. I also liked the characters.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/][*/Oh God Not Again!/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/674180/Sarah1281][/Sarah1281/]]\\
  is a very fun time-travelling story. It does some canon-rehashing, but always with a fun take on it. I enjoyed reading it.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/][*/Browncoat, Green Eyes/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649528/nonjon][/nonjon/]]\\
  is a great story by the author of A black comedy. Harry travels forward in time in the universe of the TV show firefly, after the show 'finished'. You do not need to have watched the show. It has similar humor to A black comedy, and probably the same amount of plot. So if you enjoyed ABC, you might like this one, too.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5199602/1/][*/The Thief of Hogwarts/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1867176/bluminous8][/bluminous8/]]\\
  is also a neat story, I found it fun.

*** Thanks, I've read 0800 and Oh God Not again and enjoyed both. It's always said when a long story is abandoned but at least it's entertaining while it lasts. I'm not a big fan fem!Harry but I'll have a lookt at them, thanks ! I watched Firefly a bit and didnt like it back then but since it's likely more humor than plot it can't hurt to at least try it. :)

**** ALJH doesn't focus on fem!Harry. There are a few elements in the story where it's semi-important, but it definitely isn't a focus. Definitely give it a try, at least the first chapter of the Merlin-Arc, and then decide.

***** Yeah, absolutely. I held off on reading it forever because fem!Harry can be a really dubious tag sometimes. But the story is fantastic and the author is amazing.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
