It's less about the /start/ of that realisation, more about how he and Harry manage to have some kind of relationship after the attempts at an apology we see in canon.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

** One I don't see recced very often is linkffn(4030448), History Lessons. It's a very Dudley-centric story about the impact a good teacher has on his life; this is one of the side effects. It's a lovely read!

*** Thanks for the rec!

It was a fun read, though I got to say Dudley regularly boxing, swimming, playing in chess tournaments, doing mock history news reports, programming video games, and working with robots on top of his school work was a bit of a stretch, especially when you think that earlier that year in canon, he had issues adding the amount of presents he was going to receive on his 11th birthday. Also, yeah it was marked as complete, but that ending felt way too sudden.

**** Hey, thanks for the reply! Super fun to hear people's thoughts on recs. I do agree that some of the elements (like those you mentioned) are sort of implausible given the Dudley we know. I run towards tolerating some OOC-ness if it makes for a good story, and since canon Dudley is basically cartoonish it didn't bug me as much. 100% agree with you about the ending!
