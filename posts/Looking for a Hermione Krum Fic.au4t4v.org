Read a two part epic length Harry Potter fic several years ago in which Voldemort successfully took over Harry's body in his early years and school, then it turned out Hermione was adopted and Bellatrix was her real mom. Eventually Hermione marries Viktor Krum and befriends the queen of all dragons. And the Death Eaters turn against Voldemort. Very complex, very well written, and I cannot find it again no matter what search terms I use. I know fanfiction sometimes gets taken down but has anyone seen this fic? It was SO good I wanna reread it...


** Linkffn(Strange and Invisible History)

It took me half an hour to find it on TV Tropes.

  The Lestranges, freed from Azkaban after the Dark Lord uses the Philosopher's Stone to rise again in 1992, discover that they've been called to serve in a way no one could have imagined. CP!
