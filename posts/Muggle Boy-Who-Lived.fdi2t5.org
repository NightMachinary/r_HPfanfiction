I know it was a Wrong Boy Who Lived with Harry's sibling believe to be the Boy Who Lived. Harry is given to his aunt and uncle, who give him up to a orphanage. He later becomes successful in whatever profession who took up in. Over in the magical world, Voldemort hasn't been killed and it is revealed that they have the wrong boy who lived. I don't remember much after that.


** Is Harry a muggle? Because if not, then that's the same as literally every single WBWL

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?
