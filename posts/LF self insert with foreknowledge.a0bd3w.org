Im looking for something i havent seen ANY of before, that of a person from our world, with knowledge of the books/movies/fanfiction, who ends up in the world of harry potter, and then TELLS harry and co about what is to come, and help him plan for the future. (I dont want him/her to only tell dumbledore, or manipulating events on their own, i specifically want them to tell hp and co and work together) Is there anything like this out there? Or is there a nice author who wants to take this as a writing promt?


** What's her name in Hufflepuff is a hoot and a half. It sorta fits your criteria

*** Thanks for recommending this! There's a real dearth of SI stories in this fandom altogether, but this is a legitimately great read regardless of category. The author's done a great job of writing out an interesting story involving canon years without just rehashing canon and has some really great interpretations of canon characters (hands down my favorite portrayal of Daphne Greengrass)

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Self-Insert Gen/Friendship

*** Heh. Looks like the author is having fun with that one, although OP should note that Harry is very much in the background.

** I read one somewhat like this recently, it was in one of the top subreddit searches for self insert. Sadly I can't recall the name.

Our erstwhile SI, goes to Dumbledore and tells him everything immediately. However, Dumbledore acts as though he talked about the weather. It turns out that whatever got him into the universe, prevents him from giving spoilers to characters. Instead, he has to first build in world reasons for why he could possibly have such knowledge, and then he can pass it on. A very interesting take on the SI genre.

*** Ahh, yeah i have seen this as well, but never read it, as i only understood that he was unable to tell anyone anything, which killed my interest. But if he can circumvent it, then i guess i can give it a try ^{^}
