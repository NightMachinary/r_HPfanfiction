** First of all, don't sit down and don't read depressive fanfiction, but move your behind and find some actual human being to talk to. Parent, psychotherapist, priest, or almost anybody and talk to them.

** I don't know what's going on in your head my friend, but know that there is a light at the end of your dark tunnel. Sometimes you can't always see it, but it's there. Shit will get better, it may take time but it will. I don't know who you are, but i love you.

** Try reading these:\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13274956/1/Harry-Potter-Squatter]] HP/PJO xover. I really enjoyed it because it is fluffy and cute. There are a couple cringey bits imo but overall it was pretty fun. The Dursleys did some pretty bad stuff though. Probably won't be as good without some knowledge of PJO. Incomplete.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12627473/1/The-Half-Blood-Romantic]] This is my favorite romance atm. Harry/Fleur and it definitely feels like a realistic attempt to get two people together. Incomplete.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux]] I know this gets recommended all the time but even if you have read it, it never fails to brighten up my day. A comedy about Voldemort becoming Harry when he went to kill him. Complete.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4726291/1/Eternal-Return]] My second favorite fanfic (my favorite in HP). It's a oneshot so I can't really describe much but it is pretty dark.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]] Another comedy. The humor is pretty crass but I enjoyed it. Harry and Ron's alcoholic future selves travel back in time and go through 4th year again.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar]] HP/LOTR xover. Manages to avoid all the shitty tropes that invariable come along with a LOTR fanfic. Probably my favorite crossover to date and 2nd favorite HP fanfic. Harry is captured by the Witch King of Angmar (Sauron's head minion), saved by an army of good guys, and travels Middle-Earth looking for a way back home. Little to no knowledge of LOTR needed. Incomplete.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade]] HP/Dresden Files. Pretty edgy, still fun. A fallen angel takes up residence in child Harry's mind and makes him into a powerhouse. Can be pretty dark at times but it's a great action fic imo. Absolutely 0 knowledge of Dreseden Files needed. Books 1-3 complete and ends on a pretty good note.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12414949/1/Black-coffee-with-sugar]] I honestly can't remember how this ends but it's a HP/DG story that started off pretty fun. Harry and Daphne were in a previous relationship and slowly get back together. Post-Hogwarts. Complete.

Finally, my favorite fic. It's not Harry Potter and it isn't super happy but here we are. IDK if I'm allowed to do this but you're depressed so idgaf.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6942921/1/He-Who-Fights-Monsters]] It's a Rosario+ Vampire fanfic (pretty bleh anime) that deals with a kid going to a High School for monsters. Certain events that happened in the anime don't happen and he's stuck alone in a building full of things that want to kill him if they find out who he is. Little if any knowledge of Rosario+Vampire is needed from what I remember. Complete.

If you ever need someone to talk to you can dm me. If you want I can dm my discord to you as well. Hope you feel better!

  AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP

This is a great comedy fic that features Harry as a vampire that was bought up by Remus. Harry is overly vain and constantly scaring first years.
