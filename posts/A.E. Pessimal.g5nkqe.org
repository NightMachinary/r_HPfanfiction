Any fics where Percy is more or less an A.E. Pessimal character?

That is to say, a bureaucratic nerd with the courage of a lion and heart of gold, who despite being the kind of person who takes great pleasure in a well-made spreadsheet, also secretly desires to fight injustice, with his puny nerd-fists if need be, but with all the skills he excels at if he can.

So basically canon!Percy, except he's perhaps a bit less of a prat at the beginning, and he wields the very powers of paperwork against corruption, Fudge, Umbridge, Voldemort...


** I always pictured Percy being the example of who Hermione could have been if she hadn't run into Harry/Ron.

** Some clarification about what the term 'A.E. Pessimal' is supposed to mean.
