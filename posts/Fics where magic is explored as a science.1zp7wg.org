** Pet Project explores it! I loved that one. Its Snape/Hermione and picks up after the 4th or 5th book.

** This is one of my favorite topics to explore! [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][One of my fics]] is inspired by this, tackling the bridge between magic and electricity, but I didn't go as in-depth about the science as I wanted to. Still, there are passages that might interest you (that I can pull out; it's a long otherwise unsciencey novel), generally gen, and a loving rather than mocking homage to Wizarding World quirks.

I see science-y fics pop up every so often, but they're either too focused on explanation vs story or abandoned quickly. The only thing I can find out of what I've saved is tangentially related--this [[http://thymoss.tumblr.com/post/71195783921/ad-astra-harry-potter-in-space-au-it-was][drabble]] on tumblr about Hermione and the magic of space flight.

** I just yesterday updated my AU fig [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10025665/1/The-Ministry-has-Fallen][The Ministry has Fallen]] and I'm going to try to take a more rational approach in how magic is thought of, if you are interested.
