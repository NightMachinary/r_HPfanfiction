I should probably clarify that I am cool with any iteration of Spiderman but my preferred is Holland's Spiderman


** Would you accept a crossover where Peter doesn't show up until the second book? It's still a work-in-progress and Peter's kind of a minor character in it.

*** Is this the Glasshouse you're thinking of? If it is't I'd still be chill with Peter not showing up until the second book.

**** No it's the one where Thor is Harry's father. Linkffn(child of the storm). Peter Parker's shows up in the sequel linkffn(ghosts of the past).

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  Sequel to Child of the Storm. Harry's life has changed a lot over the past year, what with the return of his father, Thor, murder attempts by everything from HYDRA assassins to Elder Gods keeping him on his toes and making a few new friends. But while Chthon and HYDRA are gone, all sorts of dark things have been stirred up, things thought long gone. And guess who they're after...
