HP fanfic writer Vance McGill wrote a time travel soul bond fanfic series (Links and Story ID's below), but had writers block and has not been able to complete it. I was wondering if there are similar fanfics to it. Any Suggestions would be great.

First of three: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8076284/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Bonds-Of-Time][Link]]. ID Number: 8076284

Second of Three [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8531904/1/Bonds-of-Time-II-Fighting-Fate][Link]]. ID number: 8531904

Third of Three: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10516568/1/Bonds-of-Time-III-Age-Of-Consent][Link]] ID Number: 10516568


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5251301/1/A-Second-Chance][A Second Chance]], linkffn(5251301): All Ministry Six went back in time, Harry and Ginny had a soul-bond.

  The war is over, however not all went to plan. Many died. Too many. Harry and his friends are some of the few survivors of the Order of the Phoenix, and after the war, attempt to live normal lifes. However, it seems fate doesn't want them to. Post-OOTP
