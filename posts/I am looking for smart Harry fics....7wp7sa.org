I have read HPMOR and fell in love...I am wondering if you guys know about other fanfiction where he is smart and there is a whole new story.


** I can always read some more smart!Harry fics, albeit, I prefer cunning!Harry.

linkffn(Saviour of Magic by Colt1; Harry Potter and the Lightning Lord by Colt1)

Huh, I thought I knew more smart!Harry fics. I don't even like these two... ah well.

*** only read these if you are new to fanfiction, if not the overpowered, all knowing Harry should be pretty cliche for anyone reading FF for more than a month, those are not necesarly bad, they are just unreamarkable, what Colt1 did there others have done better

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Annoyingly, most of the 'smart HP' fics are basically "This is Harry Potter. He reads lots of books. Look! See how nerdy he is. Now, because of the smart, he is now slightly less powerful than a deity of your choice, and also ripped."

The ones that get it somewhat ok are usually ones that are HHR nerd wish fulfillment. Not that I don't like that.

There are very few, if any, where much of the action and plot revolves around actual application and development of the intellect and information.

The fic I'm building is trying to do that. I hope.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
