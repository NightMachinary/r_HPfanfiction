You may or may not have read "The Bloodmoon Rises" by me, but anyway, heres the deal:

Yesterday I have posted chapter 6 (finally) and chapter 7 is basically done. However, there is a big change hinted in chapter 7 that I am very unsure about.

I would like if some of you could maybe read over it, give me your opinion and criticism.

Heres the chapter (Google Drive): [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q3FHBvDxZ_wK2xVJBVqIL3eljmeo-cU-PELxXJmV6uw/edit?usp=sharing][link]]

Its not necessary to read my fic beforehand. Just know that this is the chapter when Harry sets first foot into his new home and culture.


** Read through it; I hadn't read any of the previous chapters but I fell into the situation well enough to understand everything as it was revealed. I love the scene-making and Harry's perspective in improvising his way through an alien experience. I saw the twist early coming but felt it was still vague enough to make sense, and I liked Isla's reactions some of the time. Other times she seemed too impatient for a person with her depth of experience.

There are a few mis-chosen words and I think a few of the descriptions could be reworded but overall its a good piece of story.

So what's the question? (feel free to PM if you're trying to avoid spoilers for everyone else)

** I'm not familiar with your fic, but I have no problems helping with beta duties. I normally bring up small issues, like individual pieces of grammar and syntax, and then the more meta issues. Since you're just asking for general reactions, I'll reign in my normal grammar Nazi nature. The only thing I'll suggest is watch your apostrophes, as I noticed a few missing. I also would suggest keeping an eye on sentence fragments. In dialogue, it's easier to get by with them, but they're jarring in normal paragraphs.

Now, since I haven't read through the rest of the fic, I'm not entirely sure of the context, but even so, I still generally found it engaging. I don't have any major criticism, though I'm not sure how much of the conversion changed Harry's perspective, or if you characterized him slightly differently, but he forget a lot of his loyalties fairly quickly, and put his pleasure above them, especially considering the object of his new "affections". That aside, it's not a terrible step to take. Again, I'm not familiar with the context, but it definitely is interesting.

*** If you have time and are willing to beta, I'd be delighted. I have a fairly irregular updating schedule. My studies are demanding and take much out of me, but from time to time, I push out 20000+ words in a week. Editing often falls short due to this. PM me if you're interested to help me out there.

As my beta, you'd get grammar holocaust privileges. Cleanse my writing! My native language is german and the change to english is sometimes a bit jarring. Especially when it comes to sentence fragments I often find myself struggling to draw a line between the languages. In the english language they seem to be not as accepted as stylistic choices as in German, where its often a "write as you talk" style that is achieved by it.

In any case, thank you for the feedback. I'm still not sure if the decision would make sense for Harry, even after breaking ties with Dumbledore and the Order.

  Voldemort had not only sent his Death Eaters to the Ministry, but vampires as well. Hermione and Harry fall to them and find themselves in new, undead lives. While Harry struggles to remain human, Hermione becomes what was believed dead long ago. She becomes a Countess, an heir to Dracula. Unfortunatly, there are no books on that. Vampire!Hermione/Harry, Dark!Hermione Dark!Harry
