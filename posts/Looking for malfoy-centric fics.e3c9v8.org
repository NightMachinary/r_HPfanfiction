No dramione, preferably that keeps his dark alignment.


** linkffn(6432055) ... one of the best fanfiction of all. Probably not what you meant.

#+begin_quote
  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** Draco centric and canon compliant. Not Dramione. Your dark alignment preference isn't here though, but I think he's mostly in character. linkffn(The House That Cedric Built by Anna Fugazzi)
