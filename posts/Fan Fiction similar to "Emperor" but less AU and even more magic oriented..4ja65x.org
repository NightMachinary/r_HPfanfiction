I love Emperor, dont get me wrong, but its so AU that its never really fully immersed me. As a fan of FF where Harry plays a much bigger roll in changing the world (magical or more) then just defeating Voldemort, and is powerful (magical, political, godlike, or whatnot), its often a story people recommend.

However I would like recommendations on Fics that have a similar feel to Emperor, but are much less AU and deal more within the original world, and do not stray as much from the magical world. Also still have a full story arc from birth... even if the early part is rushed through like in Emperor.

Mature or higher ratings preferred because they dont hold back. No Slash. Not a huge fem harry fan unless its in the style of "Effects and Side Effects". I would prefer some romantic component (single or group/harem relationships are fine). Also, I am not particular to Harry's goals or methods but would prefer a not evil harry.


** The closest I could see to emperor is linkffn(6254783). Its not that world build-y but it is close

*** I know I know... I should probably clarify that I dont mean it didnt immerse me as a story, just that it didn't immerse me as a Harry Potter Fan Fiction story. It reads as almost its own book, not even needing the most of the original Harry Potter stories to exist, just needing some wizarding world background. Its for this very reason that I both love it as a book, and hate it as HP Fan Fiction at the same time.

And no I have not read Tyrant but did know about it. I had not read it yet because it was the understanding it was a Sirius focused story with Harry playing a minor role.

**** *Tyrant* is unfortunately incomplete. It's really a Caesar/Octavian story set in the HP universe, with Sirius taking on the role of Caesar and Harry being Octavian.

The story just stopped at the point [[/spoiler][where Sirius won a major victory over the conservative faction and had declared himself dictator for life. As you know, Caesar didn't live long after reaching that stage.]]

If history is any guide, the outcome of this story will be far more tragic than the canon, with family members and former friends turning on each other, and most characters would die. [[/spoiler][If Remus indeed played the role of Anthony, he and Harry would institute a major massacre when they took power, and Harry would force Remus into suicide in the end.]]

**** Ah, no worries. Even if I love that fic to death, I do agree that it has its flaws, the foremost of which is that you're right in that it doesn't really read like Harry Potter.

But you are right in that Sirius is the protagonist. Still, Harry is a prominent character and has his moments. It suffers a bit from the length - it's only 50k words, and as such, often glosses over some things that should really have been worked on.

***** Ill add it to my kindle and get to it at some point. I just generally prefer stories with Harry as the main character, although there are exceptions, and if its well done, its well done.

Example: I never thought I would ever like Fem Harry FF, and then I read one with a Fem Harry and actually enjoyed it as I found it very interesting the way the author worked it in (although to be fair it might not be true Fem Harry since its Male turned Female Harry).

****** Hm. Actually, have you read linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom by Mizuni-sama)? It's looooong, and will likely remain unfinished, but it has Harry growing into his own and making an impact on the political scene.

Apart from that, I can recommend rereading (as I assume you've already read them) Harry Potter and the Boy who Lived or Forging the Sword.

******* I have not, ill take a look. Its just too bad it will likely remain unfinished. I cant tell you the number of times I have loved a FF piece only to discover that despite saying complete or in progress, the author has been MIA for months or years. Makes me sad :(

As for the other two... I have read Forging the Sword but not Harry Potter and the Boy who Lived. I am still fairly new to the HP FF world. Ive been reading LoTR and Gaming FF mostly before now, and just recently got into HP, Eragon, and Twilight of all things... Fan Fiction worlds. Considering I grew up with HP especially, I am constantly looking back going where have I been to miss out on all this.
