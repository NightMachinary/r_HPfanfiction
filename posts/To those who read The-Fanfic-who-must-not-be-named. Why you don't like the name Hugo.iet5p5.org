I saw people criticizing it. But why?

Albus Severus I get it, but Hugo it's not a REALLY bad name. Right?


** Among all the problems of this fic, there are some people who criticize the name Hugo? That's not even a problem, that's like looking at a pile of shit and complain that the rest of the room is pretty clean.

Also, is Hugo even a character? His sister Rose has at least a few scenes, and even Lily has a cameo with her Sorting, but I can't remember him making any appearance there (and let's be honest, I'll not reread it to make sure).

*** I barely remember Hugo, but I know he is an official character.

And yeah, people complain about the name. I remember a comment in a post where someone was explaining why Hermione would never name her kid Hugo. And comments agreeing with him/her.

I feel like I should write to The Quibbler about this strange little community.

**** Oh yes Hugo is an official character of HP, who appears in the Epilogue. It's just that I find it strange to complain about his name when talking about the play, since he is (at best) only mentioned once.

**** I headcanon that Hermione named her kids after her parents, as a way to reconcile and be closer to them. Since we don't know their actual names, it makes the most sense to me. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

***** Not that strange, there was even a Hermione on HBP's production team. You can find her name in the ending credits.

This name has existed since at least 700 BC as the daughter of Helen of Troy and Menelaus of Sparta.

Shakespeare used this name in his Winter's Tale. Most in the fandom think the Grangers named their daughter after that Shakespearean character.

However, it's the French who really likes the name Hermione. They had 12 warships named her, including [[https://www.rochefort-ocean.com/en/explore/the-hermione-the-frigate-of-freedom][this replica]] of a frigate that fought in the American Revolutionary War.

The Royal Navy had [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Hermione][4 ships named after Hermione]].

***** There's also a pretty famous British actress [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0635820/?ref_=tt_cl_t3][Hermione Norris]] who has commented that she owes the film series for people actually pronouncing her name correctly.

*** It's this weird next-generation pre-ship Albus/Scorpius timetravel fic written by a notorious TERF who has created some pretty ridiculous posts about her Potterverse headcanons too.

‚Äã

It's pretty wildly out of character for Harry - he's a somewhat absent and bad parent to Albus Severus (2nd son, looks like Harry, sorted into Slytherin), Hermione is Minister of Magic which - is FINE but it feels a bit off to have her achieve that status at around age 40 or so given the lifespans of wizards. It also has this weird subplot (time travel, remember) about Cedric Diggory being a Death Eater.

It also introduces Voldemort's daughter as this weird Original Character and supposes that she was born somewhere around book 6, and that (okay, this is plausible and fanon but) Bellatrix and Voldemort were gettin' it on. She has silver and blue hair because of course she does, and of course she's a Parseltongue and doesn't go to Hogwarts because Reasons but she's super good at Magic despite that.

I mean as far as fanfic's go it's not The Worst Thing, but it's pretty dodgy, and has some definite "did you even read the books?" with regard to time travel and how it works in the Potterverse, some of the characters, and even some of the events of the books.
