**** Try these:

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][It's Called Adventure]] -- a Hugo, Neville, Scorpius light adventure story in the Forbidden forest.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=268282][The Morning Waffle]] - Fred, James and others host a radio show. One of my favorite humor fics.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=290483][Morocco]] - Rose/Scorpius action story. If you like action movies, you'll like this.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=272808][Al Potter and His Very Epic Plan]] - Al plots to get housed into Slytherin.

I have more recs [[http://oddhour.tumblr.com/post/42049412559/hey-recommend-other-hpff-fics-like-with-awesome][here]], depending on your openness to OCs; these are more strictly humor/romance.

** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6766/1][Through the looking glass]]

It's a mad scientist sequel, but i legitimately miss the harry / hermione in this story as well as the kids, It's a H/Hr story and very well written.

**** You can probably jump straight into Through the looking glass, with that said, Circles end was a good read though, so you may be interested in giving that a go to

Scorpius gets Rose pregnant, not usually a fan but it's very good.

**** Ahh! Really?! Eep! Please review and tell me what you think! That was a hard one for me. I actually took it down for a while before finally figuring out what I wanted to do and putting it back up and finishing it.
