I cant remember much about the story, but it began towards the end of the 3rd task. I remember that along with Hermione, Dumbledore, and Fudge, several aurors, and I think at least one unspeakable, were in the Hospital Wing with Harry. They decided to look at the event in the pensieve and, at the very last instant, Hermione joins them in said pensieve. I think there might also have been some Scottish-esque banter between the unspeakable and McGonagall.

Maybe this?

Google spat out chapter 12 when I looked for some keywords like "Pensieve", "McGonagall", "Auror" and "Hospital wing"
