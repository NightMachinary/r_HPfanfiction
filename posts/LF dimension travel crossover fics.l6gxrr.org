Just good crossover fics where Harry is sent to another world rather then the two worlds being merged together Mod Harry would be appreciated but not necessary No fem!harry no slash unless it is canon (I have no problem with lgbt+ themes just so long as they aren't the focus and don't destroy a characters personality)


** linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down)

10/10. Cannot reccommend it enough!

Edit because I should have read the thing better. There is non canon slash (tbh I didn't realise hp had canon slash...) But: it is minimal. It doesn't happen until over halfway into the fic and it serves a purpose to the story both in tension and character development ðŸ˜Š.

Story's great ðŸ˜Š. But it's just a reccommendation you can always ignore it ðŸ˜…

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.
