It's such a no-brainer!

Even forgetting the fact that both series are written by the same author, they share many similarities.

-HP while a fantasy, at its core is a mystery series. Cormoran Strike are literally detective novels.

-Harry Potter grown up and becomes an auror. Cormoran Strike is a private detective.

-Harry Potter went through war. Cormoran Strike was in the army.

-Both have mental and physical scars.

This thing writes itself!


** People writing crossovers are already a smallish portion of the fandom writing crowd, and I imagine a lot of people either don't know or don't like or don't want to like Rowling's other works which makes the crowd who'd write that an even smaller minority. I imagine most of the people who would be primed and interested in writing that crossover are probably already doing so for Sherlock or Dresden Files. That would be my best guess.

Seriously, I've been in the reddit ten months on and off and I haven't heard anyone mention Cormoran Strike before at all. I did a quick sub search and you're literally one of two people to mention the name in posts. I'd also never heard the name before myself at all and had to google to know what you were even talking about because the only dot connect I made was that the character name is one T away from being a duck.

** I like the Strike books, but they are very tonally different from Harry Potter, and nothing leaps to mind as a natural point of intersection for the characters. It's totally possible that you could come up with a good mystery that involves a wizarding murder in the Muggle world, but detailed creative plotting isn't most fic writers' strong suit.

*** I'm so pleased that this subreddit is consistently pro-trans, especially as someone who sees regular criticism for still reading and writing HP fanfic despite Rowling's views.

**** Absolutely! Trans men are men and trans women are women, and non-binary folks are non-binary. And everyone deserves love and support and not the trash spouted by jkr

** Because most fanfiction writers are young teens/kids, and the ones that write cross overs are usually looking for a way to make Harry either gay for their favorite anime character/vampire or a god given mortal form. Strike isn't exactly targeted at the demographic that writes FF and of the few people I know that have actually read the series, they only did so because JKR wrote it, and they wanted to support her writing outside of Harry Potter.

*** Yep, it's mostly just popularity. Crossovers are almost always with other works that have a large fanfiction community of their own.

*** As an author for the Strike fandom, I'm compelled to let you know that there are actually 76 pages of Cormoran Strike fanfic on AO3. None of it (that I'm aware of) has been written by teenagers.

There's a pretty strong fanfic community built up around Strike and some of the work is incredible. My own notwithstanding.

** As far as crossovers with other JKR's books go, I'd rather have a witch!Krystal crossover with The Casual Vacancy, but even fewer people in fandom read that one.
