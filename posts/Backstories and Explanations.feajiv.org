So, what interesting fanon backstories have you read in fics for canon stuff that doesn't have a backstory? Or what canon stuff have you read interesting fanon explanations for?

I've just read 'Your Patronus is What?' and thought the last bit about Aberforth and the Goats being because Ariana used to like playing with their family goats before she died, and the goats are his way of remembering her being Happy was quite cute and interesting. I'm looking for stuff like that. I've linked the fic below, in case you want to read it before clicking that spoiler black-out thingy. It's only a short one and mildly amusing. Essentially, I'm looking for backstories like that which explain details in canon.

Feel free to submit fics if you're getting ideas from them. Any pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome.

  So Snape's Patronus is a doe because he's in love with Lily, whose Patronus is a doe because she's in love with James, whose Patronus is a stag... Er, wait a moment, what was that again?
