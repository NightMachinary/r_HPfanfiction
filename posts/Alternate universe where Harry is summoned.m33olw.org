Hi to all! I'm looking for fics, preferably complete, where harry is summoned (or stumbles) to an alternate universe by the order to help fight voldemort, and he also gets to meet his parents!


** The ones that come to mind are these(they are all complete):

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1362757/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Mirror-Of-Paradox][Harry Potter and the Mirror of Paradox]] (Series) by Yih: I read this a really long time ago but I think it fits perfectly with your request.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/790488/chapters/1493333][World in Pieces]] by Lomonaaeren: I've read this, but for the life of me I can't remember the ending or whether or not it was satisfying...
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] by Kayly Silverstorm : I really really love this one. I read it a really long time ago but as soon as I read the name of this fic from my rec list, my heart soared. Beautiful.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/The-World-As-We-Knew-It][The World As We Knew It]]by Lady Alinor: I don't remember is fic at all but it's complete....worth a shot.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307886/1/Strange-Reflections][Strange Reflections]] by LeQuin: This is probably not what you are looking for. Dimension traveling is present but not for the purpose of fighting Voldemort...I believe.

This is all I can come up with sadly. This is such an interesting genre (Dimension traveling) unfortunately there aren't many finished fics... :(

#+begin_quote
  Harry finds himself thrown into a new dimension, surrounded by new and old faces alike. Will this be the chance he has always wanted? Will he be able to learn from his past and do it right? A new twist on the "the characters read the books" genre. EWE; Cannon through the end of 7th book; No reciting of the books yet covers the events

*** Well yes, but no parents. Still a really good fic though.
