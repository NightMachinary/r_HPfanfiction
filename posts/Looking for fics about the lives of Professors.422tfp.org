I just finished reading Just a Random Tuesday, linkffn(3124159), and I am really in the mood for more fics that are about Professors. Whether it's Minerva, Filius, Snape or Neville time travelling back to 1742 and teaching Herbology show me what you got! Thanks!

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

**** It does take a bit of reading to get used to the format, but it comes naturally after a few chapters. It helps that most of the characters have a distinct character voice that helps identify the speaker.

  Admit it, you've always been curious about what the professors were thinking while Harry, Ron, and Hermione got themselves into all kinds of shenanigans.
