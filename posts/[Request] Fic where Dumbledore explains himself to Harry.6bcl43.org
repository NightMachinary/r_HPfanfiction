I'm looking for a specific fic where following Sirius's death, Harry confronts Dumbledore, basically accusing him of being the manipulative Dumbles fanfic authors love, only for Dumbledore to flip the table and calmly explains his reasons and methods to Harry.

  My take on the manipulative Dumbledore stories - from Dumbledore's point of view. Written late at night, not proof-read. Will probably go over it later, if people think it's worth a tidy-up.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
