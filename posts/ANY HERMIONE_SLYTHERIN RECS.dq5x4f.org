  Less time travel more do-over, Harry gets the chance to relive the last few months every time he dies. Death is not treated like a slap to the wrist though, less "darn I thought it was going well" more "OH GOD I JUST GOT HIT BY A TRAIN /silently weeps/"

  Hermione Granger is special. She's always know it, really, even before she received her letter that informed her she was a witch, and even before she could do the little tricks that kept away the bullies and left her time for her books. It was too bad, of course, that she had never met anyone quite as special as her, but she was hoping that would change now that she was going to a right and proper school for witches and wizards like her. And she wasn't wrong, because the moment she laid eyes on Harry Potter she just knew he was very special indeed.

  In an alternate universe, Harry and his parents are absent from Godric's Hollow when Voldemort came on the Halloween of 1981, resulting in his twin brother, Andrew Potter defeating the Dark Lord and becoming the Boy Who Lived. Harry grew up with a miserable life, being friendless, ignored and utterly alone. That was until he met a bushy-haired witch whose childhood was much of the same resulting in the duo creating an everlasting bond that would forever shape the world, but would it be for the light or the dark?
