but only if later on Harry forgives her and they become friends/lovers. I don't like stories where she winds up a failure and cast away forever. Also if she dies, I just stop reading it altogether.

Anyway, are there any good fanfics where she ignores Harry's letters at the start of book five but realizes she's wrong later?


** Just to be clear, it's ok to bash Hermione as long as Harry later forgives her, but the other characters can stay in the dirt where they belong?

Outside of crack fic and parody, bashing a character is just boring. Ron and Dumbledore are probably the most bashed characters in this fandom, and in both case, people keep using the same 5 arguments to bash them in every fic. It's almost impossible to remember what happened in one specific story because, outside of some minute details, they are all the freaking same.

In comparaison, I think Hermione really has it easy. From the top on my head, I'm not sure I could remember more than 10 stories where she is bashed, and some authors even make a big effort to include her even when it's in contradiction with the plot (Good old Slytherin Harry! story where he is totally on board with Blood Purity and Death Eaters, but still make an exception for Hermione cause "she is smart").

*** Hermione's turned into a damsel in distress in a lot of Harmony stories - or a love interest with no agency for Harry to dote on, rescue and lecture about how books cannot be trusted, nor can authority - other than him.

** the fics with a superior harry tells everyone why they suck and waits until they learn his lesson and conform to his expectations.

** Bashing is never okay since it serves no purpose other than drag someone through the mud. You might depict a character negatively, but if you reach the point where you remove all their positive characteristics, what's the point? It makes antagonists weaker and anyone else is better served not being included.

Perhaps the only exception would be stories with distorted PoVs, like let's say Lavender's perception of Ron after his birthday, but even there's a point at which it starts to feel like beating a dead horse.

Of course, crack lives from bashing and there's no limit when you are writing crack (Champion's Champion for example, or the Coldmirror parodies on YouTube (in German)).

They appeal to readers who enjoy reading about certain characters being beaten to the ground over and over and over and over again. After all, if it's great the first time, then it's sure to be great the 200,000th time! Like that friend who says "I haven't seen you since last year" on Jan 1st when you saw him literally ten minutes ago on Dec 31st during at New Year's Eve party you're /still at/. Because that joke /never/ gets old, oh no, not at all...

Love stories are never okay because it serves no purpose other than to drag someone through a romance arc.

*** Every form of writing is okay. Just because you don't like it and deal in absolutes doesn't make it so.

I don't enjoy bashing fics at all but clearly a lot of people do.
