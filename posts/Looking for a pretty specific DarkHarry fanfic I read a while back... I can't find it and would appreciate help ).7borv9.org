It's a fic about Slytherin!Harry who's basically the next Dark Lord. He's pretty much in charge of Slytherin by his third year, is at odds with Draco Malfoy, and is "the King of Slytherin."

Lots of teachers (i.e. Dumbledore) notice how similar he is to Tom Riddle...

One really specific thing I remember is how he sat at the center of the Slytherin table, not the end.

Anyways, sorry for being so oddly specific, I just really wanna read this again.

P.S. it was on fanfiction.net


** Actually, it's not specific at all. There are loads of fics like that.

Maybe someone will remember it if the "center of the table" thing was significant.

** Pretty sure it's The Rise of a Dark Lord - linkffn(8195669)

It had the Slytherin King and table things. The problem, if I remember correctly, is that Dumbledore kept giving him the benefit of the doubt; Snape was the really suspicious one.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

** I think I know which fic you're talking about because of center of the Slytherin table bit. I'll be able to search later tonight if no one's found it, but try setting your search settings to 20k+ words, complete, english, character (a) as Harry Potter, and rated all. That's my default go to.
