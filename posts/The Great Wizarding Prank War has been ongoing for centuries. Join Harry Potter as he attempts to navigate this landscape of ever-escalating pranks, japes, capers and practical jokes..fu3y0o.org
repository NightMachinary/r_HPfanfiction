See title. There's been an ongoing prank war for centuries in the Wizarding World, and everyone who's born into the Wizarding world is in on it.

Muggleborn are, for the most part, eased into the situation - with the exception of Slytherin House, which delights in pranking fresh meat above all.

Alliances are forged in the name of playing better pranks - the Weasley Twins are hailed as pranking prodigies, and Harry forges an alliance with them early on.

Potions class, being the only class with risk of anything dangerous happening, is the only class where pranks aren't allowed. This is the only reason it's disliked.

All the actions attributed to Voldemort (and/or Death Eaters) are really the result of pranks gone wrong. Voldemort doesn't exist and has never existed - or if he did, he was simply a wizard with a horrible sense of humor.


** You have gone too far Salazar. You shall pay for your actions.

Ah Rowena, did my latest prank displease you?

DISPLEASE! I am livid; I am going to KILL you for setting my library of scrolls on fire.

You would have to get in a line Rowena; you can have what remains of him after I am done with him.

What do you mean my dear Helga. You seem rather upset with me. Hmm this would not have anything to do with me poisoning the food you made; would it?

I KNEW IT. I am going to feed you to Godric's Griffin.

How would you do that? Last I saw the griffin was running away with your filly.

You are dead. Godric is going to kill you. Slowly. Then I am going to bring you back so that we could kill you again and again and again. Your suffering is going to be ETERNAL.

I am sure it will be really unpleasant. But you will have to catch me first to get revenge. You never should have challenged me in the Noble Art of Pranking. I am the Greatest Pranker the world has ever seen. Farewell.

** Now this I'd like to see. I've only read Harry and his new group of friends pranking all houses in a few fics, but not this kind of prompt.
