:END:
Hello everyone,

I am looking for a very specific fiction where harry is a lot like the twins, the pairing is ginny/harry. And if i remember correctly his power is that he dosent know whats impossible and that makes hime able to do the impossible. Its a light hearted fiction, the story we all like but with but twisted with a wicked sense of humor.
