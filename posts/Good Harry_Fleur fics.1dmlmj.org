Hello guys and girls.

I am searching for some good Harry/Fleur stories. I find that fanfiction.net has surprisingly few long stories with that pairing, and I was wondering if you had heard of any?

I have read quite a few of those tagged Harry P./Fleur D. but I am hoping there are either some at other sites or some stories that are marked differently. There are fx. parings in soties marked solely 'Harry P.' and those marked Harry P./Sirius B.'.

So, fellow redditors. Have you found any you enjoy?


** Can't get a link on my phone, but Wastelands of Time and its sequel are good.

It's /really/ good. Spectacularly awesome time travel fic (groundhog day style).

** If you don't mind substituting Gabrielle for Fleur (I mean... they're essentially the same) there's [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] by Jeconais, which is very good, despite it being a soul-bond fic.

*** Okay, so I´ve just read Hope and I thank you for linking it to me. It really is quite good.

However I must disagree that they are essentially the same. Fleur is 3 years older than Harry and is supposedly a very skilled witch. She can help Harry mature and advance his skills, which is what I would really love to see.

Sadly, that's pretty rare. In Harry/Fleur, Harry is generally portrayed as a more mature/capable/assertive/powerful version of his canon self to balance their relationship. He is often Fleur's equal or her better. This almost always results in Fleur's realization that he is no longer 'a leetle boy.'

Edit: If you're looking for the 'sexy older woman helps inexperienced young boy mature' trope, your best bet is Harry/Tonks. It's much more prominent in that ship.

When you put it like that it sounds wrong. And there is a difference between 3 and 7 years. Also there is the timing. A lot of fics with Fleur talk about a Veela bond and how she is actually a full Veela (which is ridiculous since it was pointed out that she is only 1/4 and it is more of a trap to force people together than to actually attempt to write a good backstory), and even though I detest the whole bond thing I like how they use the new influence to help solve some of Harry problems.

Book 3 introduced Sirius but Harry can´t be with him because of politics and incompetence. Book 4 has Harry competing in a tournament meant for adults where he suddenly only has 1 friend to help him, and Voldemort looms in the distance. He needs guidance and he needs to shape up. This is the perfect timing to have him prepare for the war that is to come.

Equally we see Fleur dealing with reality instead of just taking things at face value. A lot of people seem to think her arrogant, but in the end she ends up humbled. She has, I think, though that she could do anything herself, but it the end she realices that without help you can sometimes do very little on your own.

** His Angel is pretty good. Harry Potter and the Technomage is good to. Start off slow but gets quite good. Sad it is abandoned though. :(

** Hard to believe there are not more...but I think the problem is "good" H/F or H/Gabby fics are hard to come by, moreso if you want them completed or on track to completion.

Most of the rest end up being very short one-shot types, or part of a harem. Nothing wrong with a Harem, but in most of them you lose the individual girls and it just becomes blond sex, brunette sex, asian sex, etc. I assume you are looking for relationship not just porn.

I am biased, but can only think of one really well done Harem, where each girl (for the most part) had her own character and interacted with Harry as an individual. Gabrielle was a huge character in that story, Fleur not so much

Maybe I should write one.... *edit: as I have been reminded...I probably AM writing one, so more like I should really get back to it and get Harry to Beauxbattons with Fleur and Gabby*

** I would have to recommend [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5403795/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Price-of-Being-Noble][Harry Potter and the Price of Being Noble]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2036266/DriftWood1965][DriftWood1965]]. It's a Harry/multi fic, but you might find what you're looking for. It's an excellent story with a well-written Fleur.
