Obviously, they are homeschooled before they start at Hogwarts, so that takes up some time. But they've got to have some magical toys and games for after-school work too, right? We've heard about broom riding, gobstones and chess, but there's got to be other things. What do you guys think magical children use to entertain themselves before Hogwarts or during school breaks? For the younger, maybe magical doll houses or animated toy dragons?


** There's all sorts of things to do, but it depends largely on the Wizarding family. If you live in the city or if you live in the countryside, it makes a difference due to the Statue of Secrecy.

*Art*

- Luna Lovegood is an artist, specifically painting and designing her own clothing--Lion Hat, anyone? Luna's eccentric, but by all means, children might like paining, especially if the paint itself is magic.

- We know that Colin Creevey is a Muggle-born, but it stands to reason that there are other students who might have an interest in photography. Moving pictures, and scrapbooking them, is not out of the question.

- Dean Thomas is Muggle-rasied, and his inclination towards drawing might also have counterparts in the Wizarding World. There may be color-switching inks or markers that really do smell like certain scents. Imagine paints that smelled like foods.

And there's more than just that--I bet Wizards are able to make "living figures" out of their modeling clay. Or maybe a sentient ball of clay is enough--you can make shapes with a regular lump of clay, but it can't play /with/ you.

*Collecting*

- Ron Weasley has a huge collection of Famous Witch and Wizard cards from his chocolate frogs. Harry starts a collection himself and it stands to reason other children would as well.

*Pets*

- The Magical Menagerie in Diagon Alley had rats that could do tricks, among other critters. Children have pets.

- Rats and cats and dogs and Puffskeins. Maybe winged horses if you're wealthy enough. Malfoy might have made friends with his family's peacocks, if he was desperate enough for a pet.

- Lee Jordan has a tarantula.

*Outdoors*

- The Weasleys have land with an orchard, the Lovegoods have land, Seamus Finnigan grew up in the countryside, the Malfoys have a Manor.

- These and any other number of Wizarding children could play outside.

- Luna probably spent most of her childhood wading by the riverside, looking for Plimplies.

- You can climb trees or large rocks. You can run in the fields. You can explore, looking for any sort of critter.

*Reading*

Yes, reading for fun counts as free time.

- Ron had a collection of Mad Muggle comics. There may be other comic book out there.

- And then there's books--Beetle the Bard and his fairy tales for one.

--------------

And don't forget families--kids would play with their siblings.

- They'd play board games--wizard's chess, and perhaps there's some board game equivalent to Quidditch.

- There's Gobstones and I'd bet "Barrel of Monkeys" with living monkeys.

- There's Exploding Snap--which appears to be a mix of Slapjack and a matching game.

- And then there's more mundane ways to have fun--how often do you think Fred and George amused themselves by harassing Ron or chasing Ginny to see if they could catch her?

** Maybe they play Death Eaters VS Aurors ? I didn't really think about the idea of what the life of a wizard child is like. I guess they must have animated toys and such...

** Yes, I'd say for magical kids, animated dolls and other figures are probably a popular toy. They probably do all of the same things we did as kids too. Collected things like rocks and game cards, draw, read, play instruments, sports, run around in family gardens and playing imaginary games. Help with chores, like cooking, or caring for pets, that kind of thing.

** I thought that maybe (and this is a headcanon mind you) that a nice hobby for a Wizarding child could be horseback riding- but like, instead of a regular horse have the kid ride one with wings. Sort of like the Abraxan horses that Beauxbatons used to pull their carriage in GOF. I played with a few ideas like racing competitions and things for a fic once but had trouble getting into it. I think The Lie I've Lived by jbern uses competitive broom racing as a hobby for one of its Beauxbatons OCs, I liked that concept also.

** Basically, what non-wizarding children did before VCRs let television take over their lives. They play outside, read, learn crafts, do chores.

*** I'm sure they'd have magical toys and games specific to the wizarding world and wizarding culture, though, so while they probably would in the large sense do the things you suggested, I was kind of aiming for the details of wizarding children's toys and games, but I might not have expressed my question adequately.
