Just marked my first fic as 'complete'. Roughly 350k words, started in April of 2020 and finished this morning. Feels pretty great to be able to say that.

[[/u/vg65][u/vg65]] has this reply he trots out whenever people ask what tropes are most irritating in HP Fanfics; I'm proud to say that I violate only one of them, and in a peripheral way at that.

My goal was to write a fic that had exciting action sequences. I started it with two fight scenes in mind (the CoS battle, and Harry vs. Voldemort), and from there wrote an entire fic to set up those scenes.

I'd never written fiction before; to this point, everything I'd done had been academic/scientific literature. You can /really/ see that inexperience in the first several chapters. Getting a beta made a big difference.

Nonetheless, I'm proud of myself, and if anyone wants to read an attempt at a 'slow-burn/realistic' OP!Harry, feel free to check out linkffn(A Simple Act of Vengeance)


** I'm really enjoying the story, but my only comment is that these are 11 year olds. They speak and act like adults a bit too much. It definitely isn't a complaint that will keep me from reading and enjoying.

** Six chapters in and, yeah, it's pretty good.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.
