I just finished a fic where the MC became a Q from Star Trek, hijinks ensued. I thought it'd be fun if there were any such fics in this fandom. Just to be clear, i'm not asking for OP Harry, not godlike Harry, not even Omnipotent Harry. I'm looking for a Harry that is so powerful that he can do whatever he wants, he can be godlike, he can be OP, or Omnipotent, but the point is that he is so powerful that Voldemort, Dumbledore, everything are only things that catch his attention if he wants it too, otherwise he decides that Hogwarts would be better if it was pink with purple polka dots, so he makes it so with but a thought.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

** I don't remember any of the names but there is the fanfic series called the Lone Traveler I believe. Harry becomes a god of knowledge, travel and free will. There are many well written stories in there, where he goes around different realities, universes and timelines just helping out. Usually helps out another Harry. Sometimes helps out a young Tom riddle to a different path. Sometimes gets sent to star trek and helps out Picard or Janeway. Sometimes star wars. But mostly Harry Potter universes.

*** linkffn(Lone Traveler, God, and Wizard) is the most recent incarnation of the trilogy. I think the first is called linkffn(Stories of the Lone Traveler).

Just click on the author profile and you get the other related stories as well. Not actively updating at the moment, but he may do random LT updates on rare occasion.

  It's finally happened: The Lone Traveler became a God. With the Divine name Marek Ilumian, Patron God of Free Will, Minor God of Knowledge and Travel, sometimes he goes over the top. But he's all about giving people a choice - or at least the opportunity to Choose. And having fun, of course. And Pie. Lots of Pie. Completed but I've added more.

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

  Death messed up his job at Halloween 1981 and now neither Voldemort nor Harry Potter are dead. As if that wasn't bad enough that noisy little brat appears to be able to see him. All of that was quite unexpected. Still it doesn't explain how he somehow found himself stuck to raise the baby. Alright, now that's just awkward. Complete (sort of)

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.
