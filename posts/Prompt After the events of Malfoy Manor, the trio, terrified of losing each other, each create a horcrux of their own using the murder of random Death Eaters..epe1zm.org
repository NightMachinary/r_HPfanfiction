Dark!Trio, obviously. Preferably the trio are together romantically (no explicit content). If their mental stability is slightly degraded as a result, even better.

Thanks!

Note: I have already read Sum of Their Parts. It doesn't fit the prompt, but I suspect someone would immediately rec it.


** Doesn't fit the prompt exactly but it's really similar in tone? Read it all the way through for why.

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. Meanwhile, George's parallel isolating tendencies show Harry what might have happened if he'd not given into temptation.

** Would probably require all three to have some severe psychological trauma -- considering how dying is probably better than creating a Horcrux.\\
Not unimaginable though. I'm curious where other authors would take such a fic after their little secret comes to light.\\
I'd probably make it a four-way fight between Voldemort, Trio, Order, and Ministry which would leave none happy or alive.

*** I mean we don't really know that dying is better than making a Horcrux. I mean from the good side's moral standards in canon sure, but ultimately it's up to the individual whether or not it's worth it. We don't know all of the details of making a horcrux nor do we know the full extent of the effects it has on the creator of one. Our only example is Voldemort, who is the most extreme example in the canon's history. His body is deformed and his mind seems damaged, but he also created more horcruxes than anyone else in history, lived for 13 years as a wraith possessing animals, people, then a homunculous, then was ressurected in a dark ritual we don't know much about. If you only create one it's possible to have no real negative side effects other than tearing your soul, and we really don't know how negatively that impacts the afterlife. Also if you don't plan on dying the that's not really a concern. Not to mention that, if you were to make a horcrux out of a moment of desperation like the one suggested in the prompt, later on you could come to regret your decision, which is the only way to reverse the process and repair your soul. I don't know if that would work if you were /planning/ on regretting it later, but from the author's standpoint it does allow the main characters a way out in the end.

**** Which is why I'd never allow it, of course. This is my personal taste speaking, but if I wrote a character who figured he could just regret creating the Horcrux later on to solve everything, I'd deliberately set him up to fail because he can't bring himself to regret what he achieved.

That way, the character has to pay with something for what he gains. Feels much more real to me than some unicorn-happy-ending.

And about the morality of it -- sure. We only have canon. Obviously.\\
Still, canon clearly states that creating a Horcrux mutilates your soul in horrific ways and implies that you cannot move on to the afterlife like others can. You can change that, obviously, but that's what canon says.

** Super late to the party but have you read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3499913/chapters/7691726][What it Comes Down To]]? There are parts that are explicit but not in a porn type of way. It's an AU where the trio are captured earlier in their journey but brought to Malfoy Mannor and tortured there. Not a horcrux journey either but thought it fit the tone of the prompt.\\

  On the hunt for the Horcruxes, the trio are captured and subjected to horrors at the hands of the Death Eaters. This is more than just a torture fic, it chronicles their lives, their struggles, and their relationships in the aftermath.
