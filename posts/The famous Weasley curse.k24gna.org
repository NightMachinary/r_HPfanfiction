:END:
Several fan fic authors have brought up the theory that the Weasleys were poor despite their apparently high standing in pureblood society because of some dubious event or curse that happened to one of their ancestors.

The prompt is simple: Bill Weasley became a cursebreaker to break the curse on the family.


** Bill is trying to break the curse on his family in this, though the curse isn't 'being poor'.

  Harry finds himself thrust into his four-year old body, after Voldemort killed him in the forest in what would have been his seventh year. Knowing what he did, he decided to fix some things he never had a chance to before. He'd not go into the magical world untrained this time. OP Harry. Science, magic and discovery. Harem.

** That's too complicated ... try to have seven children on one government salary, and you will find out fast what does it mean to be poor. And I think the wealth of the magical society is highly overestimated in most fanon. Close tiny community (fifteen thousand per UK & Ireland is more like a village than even a town) just cannot generate much wealth. I think that Malfoys' pretence of grandeur is just that ... pretence.

*** yo why are people always in here trying to disprove prompts? It's not in the spirit of the discussion.

I know how easy it is for a large family to be poor, because I'm in one.

*** What about Malfoy's comment? "redhead and worn out clothes, you must be a Weasley"... Doesn't this point out to Arthur brothers and at least close ancestors being poor as well?

**** I am not saying that Weasleys were super-rich, and Draco was so clever he didn't have to see beyond five previous Weasleys who were already at Hogwarts.

***** Draco didn't know the older Weasleys. He was just starting. Weasleys being poor is an information he got from his father in all likelihood. Lucius was of course more aware of Arthur's siblings and ancestors family finance than he was aware of who Bill, Charlie, Percy and the twins were.
