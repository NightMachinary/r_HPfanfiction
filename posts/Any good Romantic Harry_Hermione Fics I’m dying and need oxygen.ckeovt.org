** I've never heard of the story you mentioned, quickly googled it...

So it's a story set long after Hogwarts where Harry no longer sees her like a sister and they develop a relationship.

I can't read the entire thing right now as I'm halfway through another fic (1M+ words), could you mention a few more things that you'd like to see in recommend fics? It's much easier to recommend something when I know what you're looking for without having to read through a long fic that I might not like myself first.

Personally my absolute top favorite completed post Hogwarts Harry/Hermione relationship (after both had other relationships) would be linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief), but since I haven't read Unlike a Sister all I'm basing this recommendation on is that it's H/Hr and post Hogwarts.

Edit: Unlike a Sister has way more chapters posted on FFN than AO3, if you've used AO3 you might've overlooked those

**** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

It's almost entirely just the events of the year 1996 after secrecy ended. International geopolitics are thrown into mayhem, religions struggle to accept the existence of wizards, scientist get a whole new field to study and Voldemort gets his hands on nukes. Oh, and Osama Bin Laden cancels that plane idea in favor of bombing the american ministry of magic (not MACUSA because the fic is old). Only like 10% of it is actually about the people at Hogwarts, most is events around the world.

I'm actually like 95% done with it right now, I started it a while ago and now it's getting time for the finale against Rasputin.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  During the battle at the Department of Mysteries something unexpected happens and a knight from a place far, far away suddenly finds himself in the strange world of Harry Potter. How will Harry, as well as the rest of the wizarding world react to having a paladin thrust into their midst? Evil closes in on all sides, yet the Light still shines in the Darkness. Slight AU.
