**** I'm not aware of one that regularly pulls from Shakespeare, though you'd think there would be a fan with a bit of poetry in their soul who would do so.

For a single quote, I've got this 3-way conversation in Holly Polter:

#+begin_quote
  "Severus still has an important role to play if we are to succeed in defeating Voldemort once and for all," said the Headmaster. "He is still trusted in their camp, still has the inroads to the enemy's plans that we would never be able to access through anyone else. He is far too valuable in too many ways not to afford him the leeway to do his work. Very dangerous work, I might add.

  "And so I ask you both to set aside your indignation and your hatred. Let Severus do his job, as only he can."

  Holly said, "Y'know, even though I agree with you--"

  "You agree?!" Harry was close to losing his mind, he was sure. "He burned you alive! He's a hateful, murderous, unholy wretch of--"

  Holly snapped a look of anger at him that shocked Harry silent. She said, "He's rotten- I know. I didn't forget that. You don't get to hang out only with the angels, Harry. We're moving into big boy decisions, and success depends on you being able to work with those you hate. That's not even a 'maybe'. Battles are won by the killers, not the priests, and diplomacy requires talking with and even making agreements with thieves, goblins, politicians and other backstabbing scum. And those are just your allies."

  The Headmaster quoted, "*...there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers.*"

  "My favourite Shakespearean quote- Henry V, before the Battle of Agincourt. So Severus Snape is relevant in two ways," Holly said. She then turned to address the Headmaster, "But I feel compelled to mention..."

  "Yes?"

  "Snape doesn't help anyone but you, and Lily's protection disappears when Harry turns seventeen. If Snape isn't being helpful to others by then, we lose nothing by cutting him loose. In fact once this coming summer is over, his part in providing the protection is effectively done. With Harry here during the school terms, Lily's protection isn't required. The difference of a month between June and July next year just isn't worth putting up with Severus' poison after 1st September. I'd suggest you warn him that he's got until then to prove his value to someone other than you."

** An Aunt's Love features Harry participating in theater and reading/performing Shakespeare, so there are some quotes and monologues used in the story. The story is unfinished (hasn't been updated since September).

** Quotations= noun.

It was a Shakespear /quotation/

Quote= verb

Can you /quote/ Shakespear well?

I don't want to be a douche, but this is EVERYWHERE.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1318815/The-Carnivorous-Muffin][The Carnivorous Muffin]] tends to write fics that quote/reference scifi and classic literature. In particular, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] has some Shakespeare quotes from Hamlet, As You Like It, etc. at important moments. It's a delightfully surreal AU fic which I highly recomend.
