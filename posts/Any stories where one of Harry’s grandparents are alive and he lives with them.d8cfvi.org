I think it'd be interesting to see how Harry would grow up if he was in a situation like Neville where people who loved him raised him, but he also had to deal with all the expectations his family would have for him.


** linkffn(the last peverall) is sorta this, linkffn(honor thy blood) has something like it but not exactly.

  Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right? (FemHarry)

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Less than a year after the death of the Potters, Rose Evans and her husband Lyle take care of their orphaned grandson, Harry, and try to take steps toward a future where he'll be loved and accepted. Spring is coming, and with it, the memory of stiring warmth, and the first real hope for life and growth. ( The au where Harry's muggle grandparents were alive and well)

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.
