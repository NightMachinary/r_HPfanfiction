[[http://www.hdhols.com/sesheta_66.html][101 Way to Heal Your Wizarding Woes]] by /who_la_hoop/

#+begin_quote
  Harry is a trainee Auror, and Draco is living at Malfoy Manor, bored and petulant with nothing to do, and no career prospects. Draco's attempt to heal himself via Muggle psychology---including writing a series of 'why I hate you' letters to Harry---backfires when an overanxious house elf delivers the results to Harry. Harry is bemused, Draco is angry and together they have a lot of issues to work out.

#+begin_quote
  It seems 95% of H/D writers feel compelled to write a "Harry And Draco Are Forced To Be Together By Something Beyond Their Control And Then Unlikely Stuff Happens That Leads To Twoo Wuv" story. Count me among the 95%.

*** I thought, hey the 101 story was really good. I'd better check out the other stories and then read Beautiful World.

I AM NOW VERY UPSET. WHY WAS I NOT WARNED OF THE SADNESS!? :(

I like cute and fluffy. Yes it's a lovely fic but now I'm all sad and shit. You need to type out warnings for this stuff.

***** There's no warnings on the fic either. Unusual but maybe I'll 'mail the author. There are a lot of depression triggers in this one.

Cheers for the rec anyway, very well written.

I love Severitus as well. I'm currently reading a Drarry/Severitus fic called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2968030/47/Family-Means-More-Than-Blood][Family Means More Than Blood]] that's pretty good so far (Snape adopts Harry).

My Severitus favorites:

Have you been to [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/browse.php?type=categories][Potions and Snitches?]] It's a Snape/Harry Gen/Severitus fic archive.

Edit to add: I forgot about [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=2025][Blood Magic]] (BioFather Snape) and [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=2872][The Secret Father]] (BioFather Snape)

** I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11018361/1/Once-Upon-An-East-End][Once Upon an East End]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264616/1/To-Be-Back-Again-in-the-Rest-of-the-Room][To Be Back Again in the Rest of the Room]] and loved them.

I re-read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6367207/1/Of-Secret-Shags-Talks-and-Fainting][Of Secret Shags, Talks, and Fainting]] not to long ago and remembered why I love it so much. Slightly angsty but it's hilarious.

For a pre-slash H/D with Snape as a sort of mentor to Harry, try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7337825/1/Parsimony][Parsimony]].
