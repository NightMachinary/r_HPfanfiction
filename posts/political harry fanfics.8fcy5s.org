i am looking for good harry potter fanfics in which harry is smart and a major political player like lord potter or black. even fics in which house potter is a major house, with lots of ancient history and powerful. any good recommendations?


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/]]) Harry is politically powerful in this fic. Twist: he also possesses mage sight (he was blinded after Voldemort's attack and became a powerful wizard despite his disability). It's amazing. Quite a read!

*** I was aware of this fic for a long time after finding it listed in the favourite sections of the authors I like on FF.net.

All that time I dismissed it, thinking it was one of those pity party, feel good "overcome hardships" sappy, saccharine stories.

But it's so much more than that, I started reading it today and I'm already on chapter 7 and I can't stop!

I would never have bothered if I hadn't read your description. Thank you for changing my mind, it's a fantastic story!

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I remember liking Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin a lot by the Sinister Man. Some of their early reasoning for why Harry wasn't raised with his family is a little iffy but the more you read it the more it makes sense!

Has some really good wizard etiquette stuff and lore from what I recall but it's been a while sorry!

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** My series, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn; The Chessmaster: White Knight) heavily features politics, and eventually a political Harry. It's multiple POV, so there's a healthy dose of politicking in the first two even though Harry and friends are still young.

  AU. When a surprising discovery leads to an unusual occurrence, a centuries long trend is broken and plans whirl into motion. Rumors of a stone, a mirror, and a mysterious door float through the halls of Hogwarts as a prophecy comes into play. Meanwhile, two men fight a shadow war in a vain effort to control the Wizengamot... Sequel now posted! Over 70k hits!

As international influences begin to creep into British politics, Dumbledore isn't the only one worried for the future. Thomas Gaunt is concerned as well, but for very different reasons...

** Black Sky has some 'light-weight' politics... female!Harry Potter (Dorea Black), currently has 295 chapters tends to get new chapters 5days every second week. ("I will now be taking a few months' break from writing Black Sky -as I did about this time last year and the year before-") and tbh the story could be ended with an epilogue right now (so it's a good time to start reading)

potter-stuff is done after like [[/spoiler][45chapters]] rest is the crossover.
