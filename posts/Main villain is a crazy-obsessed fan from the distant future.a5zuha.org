Weird request, I know. I was wondering if there were any well-written fanfics which played with this idea:

Several generations after DH, one of Dennis Creevey's direct descendants, let's call him Eobard Creevey a la Eobard Thawne, becomes obsessed with the exploits of Harry Potter (or even better, Albus Severus Potter). He travels back in time, only to discover his destiny as the main villain. This drives him insane, to the point where he dedicates his entire life to ruining Harry/Albus.

Discussion: If there aren't any fics like this, would you /want/ one? Why or why not?


** What about a fic where there was no war and Harry Potter is just this ordinary kid with loving parents and a wife and 2.5 kids and all of a sudden this random muggleborn starts following him around ranting about He Who Must Not Be Named.

** That sounds like the entire exact plotline of the first season of CW'S The Flash.
