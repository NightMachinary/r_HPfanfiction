Hi friends! I have finally reached the end of my fic list and am looking for some new, well-written ones. I really prefer canon compliant pairings and am looking for something centering on Harry's generation (doesn't have to be Harry, but not marauders or next generation). I do like some AUs. I am a sucker for Professor!Potter fics and /well-done/ (emphasis on that) time travel. I do branch out occasionally but I can't read fics that don't have Harry/Ginny pairing or Ron/Hermione pairing - my brain just won't accept anything else. I don't really care if the stories are WIP but it would be nice if they are updated regularly. I know that I'm kind of picky but any suggestions are welcome.

Some of my favorite, to-die-for fics are "Strangers at Drakeshaugh", "The Aurors" (FloreatCastellum and any of their other fics), "Grow Young with Me", "Blackboards and Broomsticks" (I would die for this story), and finally, "Backward with a Purpose". I'd be forever grateful for suggestions! Thanks everyone :)

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** Hmm. You /might/ like the linkffn(Innocent) series. It's set during Harry's generation (starting when he's eight), but brings in a lot of characters from the Marauders' generation. And being only partway through fourth year (regularly updating), there's no real pairing yet for the students, but Ginny is very much present (far more than canon) and interested.

The premise is that Sirius accidentally escapes Azkaban five years earlier, and lacking any leads on Peter, he instead checks on Harry and offers him another home. Which triggers a huge uproar over the "kidnapping", and accelerates or changes a lot of canon events. The series is over a million words thus far, half of which is in book 1.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
