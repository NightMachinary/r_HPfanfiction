** There are plenty of stories which would fit that request BUT are simply atrocities against the English language and good taste. The average Indy!Harry fic has betrayal, sex, incest, unlikely allies, Goblins, assassins and shit, but that alone does not make it a good story.

Besides badly written smut (pink fat mast), 99% of fanfics are far from GRRM's level simply because most authors, myself included, lack the writing abilities to write such a large scale world with many independent characters. You can see that pretty well in your average "Ministry Six"/"postwar Weasley family" fic where there are plenty of main characters, but none of them is even remotely developed or do more than one-dimensional actions and saying the same 10 lines over and over again.

And, let's be honest here, most readers are not interested in that kind of world. The description of my own /Dawn of Darkness/ mentions "a web of deceit and intrigues woven across Europe" and yet most reviewers expected a fic centered around Hogwarts and were completely losing their shit when I had the Ministry pull some shady shit after reminding them of Sirius Black's case three or four times in the very same chapter. Most reviews for that chapter were reminding me that the Hit Wizards do not have the authority randomly arrest Harry (which they in fact had) or that it was the wrong thing to do (really?).

**** Linkffn(12774582)

Be warned, it's a little heavy on the fluff in between the murder and intrigue. The later chapters are more plot focused and a new one should be released within a week.

  When Harry invited Tonks to Slughorn's Christmas Party, he never expected to stumble into a relationship with his friend. Nor did he expect to be engulfed by a web of deceit and intrigues woven across Europe.
