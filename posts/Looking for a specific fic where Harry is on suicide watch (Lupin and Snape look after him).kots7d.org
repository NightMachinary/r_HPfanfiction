:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I think Harry attempts suicide and Snape and Lupin find out? Probably a hurt/comfort severitus type fic, and may well have occurred during a summer holiday from hogwarts.

I remember this fic being on fanfiction.net, but thats all I've got!

*** Oh yeah of course! Thank you so much, I'd somehow convinced myself it was a really obscure fic and was slogging through trying to find it for ages

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.
