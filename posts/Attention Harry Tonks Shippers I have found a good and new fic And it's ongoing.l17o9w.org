So yeah, Dichotomous Centre by WaskeHD. It's really good writing. The characters have a lot of depth and the relationships are built over time and in an organic manner which I personally find to be well done.

Some people may not like it because well, we want to know the ending as soon as we can because we can't take the tension, but regardless of it, it's the kind of story you'd still like to read.

It involves a sexually confused Harry, a Gender confused Tonks.

Even if you don't like to read slash, you can read this because of how the relationship is portrayed.

The story is beyond the usual smut and lemons that plague these Fics, and focuses more on trust and building the relationship and I think it's beautiful. I really recommend you guys check it out.

  Starts the summer Post GoF and is a Character and Relationship focused story. Don't really know how to summarize without spoiling stuff. Up until this point everything has pretty much been as canon with only one small exception. Cho Chang wasn't Harry's only crush during Goblet of Fire and it has repercussions on who he becomes as a person. Bi!Harry, I suppose I should warn you.
