Nagini is an animagus? what thef uck

Hope this isn't outside the boundaries of this subreddit but jesus that threw me for a loop


** u/emong757:

  Nagini is an animagus
#+end_quote

Apparently, the actress (Claudia Kim) plays a Maledictus, a female individual whose blood was cursed from birth, eventually leading to them turning into a beast. The cursed is passed down from mother to daughter (per Harry Potter wiki).

​

But I liked the final trailer, much more than the first two. It looks visually stunning and there's a lot going on. It makes me wonder how long the film will actually be. From this trailer and past ones, the filmmakers have a lot to fit in (unless they cut a lot out). Also, I wasn't much of a fan when they cast Johnny Depp but he looks pretty amazing in this one. The scene where he escapes MACUSA transport over New York looks to be a crowd-pleasing scene. Still can't say for sure if I'll see this in theatres (as I didn't like the first Fantastic Beasts).

*** > Maledictus

I had never heard this term before! According to the wiki it was from an article when the film title was announced. Very interesting, I'm excited to see where the Nagini thing goes. Maybe the movie will show Tom Riddle meeting her and forming a bond.

****** If we get the full five films, one of them could take place in/around 1945 when Grindelwald is defeated, which would be a good time frame to have barely-adult Voldemort happenings. By that time he had at least two horcruxes made. But I'd hope it would be really minor, more of a passing thing or Dumbledore expressing concern.

Maybe Dumbledore consulted Newt when the Chamber was opened, but when Hagrid was 'caught' no amount of testimony would have swayed the ministry in favor of a half giant with an illegal pet.

(Thanks! Nice flair lol)

*** Bit surprising you won't go to theatres. I found Fantastic Beasts to be very enjoyable in theatres- great effects.

I'm not expecting these stories to be as rich as the HP series, but they seem like very entertaining movies, which I think will have maximum effect in an actual movie theatre. I rewatched FB when it came was put on HBO but I don't envision myself rewatching this series as much as the HP series, but I'll still catch up them all in theatres.

**** I'm on the fence with seeing it in theatres or not. I saw the first one opening weekend and while I enjoyed the first half of the film, I found the second half to be a disaster. Afterwards, I saw it only once more (on television in a hotel in New York) and even then I was distracted through most of it and didn't really pay it much attention. This one does look better than the first but I'm not 100% sold on it just yet. I'll probably wait for the reviews before I make a decision.

The magical world has SO much potential, yet it feels squandered by the fact that most wizards/witches don't know how to utilise it, compared to other magical universes.

And looking back to the Boa Constrictor encounter in /Philosopher's Stone/ (and the Basilisk having enough wit to know to obey the Heir of Slytherin and no one else), plus the very fact of Parseltongue's existence, it seems like snakes in the /Harry Potter/ universe are just smarter than in our world.

I especially do not like it because it is 0% genuine. If Hermione was not white, if Dumbledore was gay, if ANYTHING - it should have been mentioned in the books, otherwise it comes across (almost definitely truthfully) as her pulling things out of her ass.

The only time it was mentioned that Hermione's skin was dark in the books was during the opening chapters of PoA where it was mentioned she looked darker and Ron had freckles, both being indicators of looking different than they normally did. Ron wasn't mentioned as a white boy because that's the norm in 1990s Britain. The times you mention someone's skin color, or hair color, or anything, is when it stands out from the norm or you're trying to meet a word count minimum. In the prior's case as an example: you wouldn't describe a Saiyan's (from DBZ) hair color since all of them have jet-black hair. The only exceptions are Nappa (bald) and Trunks (half-saiyan with purple hair).

** Anyone curious about the Deathly Hallow symbol in both trailers? Clearly the elder wand is involved in the movies, but by having the full symbol (and having just the stone and cloak in the most recent trailer), it seems to imply that the other hallows are relevant. I could imagine ways of getting the cloak involved, and they sound a lot like something from fanfiction - having Harry's grandfather participate in the fight against Grindlewald, for example.

Nagini being a maledictus, I have to admit, I'm a bit mad about. Removing agency from women and forcibly turning them into a beast... and Nagini specifically, who is a woman of color, essentially ends up as a pet/slave (he sends her on missions, milks her venom, gives her orders, and people call Voldemort her master) to a white supremacist? Like... did JKR not stop and think literally one moment in the past 20 years (so she claims) that she's been thinking about this about how sexist and racist that is?

Most people feel surprise/sad (beautiful girl has basically “terminal disease”). And she is a maledictus, which means she may be a full snake. In this case human slavery concept is not a thing as you won't say your pet is your slave. No need to jump to accusation so fast with so few information. And skin color is not a thing in HP. I didn't see Tom Riddle being white and the Nagini actor being colored people as improper.

**** I'm also an Asian woman, so your point with that is...? This is the only place I've seen where people DON'T think it's racist or sexist. I've seen a TON of people who are pissed off about it (and, as per usual, that brings in the flood of all the other things JKR has done that are problematic).

Anyway, the fact is that Nagini is treated like a pet, but... she's still a human unwillingly stuck in the body of a beast who does Voldemort's bidding. That's... slavery. I'm not sure what else you would call it. As a human, she works in a circus and changes to a snake for entertainment. I'm not sure how you don't see how this isn't remotely problematic at all (not to mention, on top of the whole issue with Native American culture and Ilvermory, JKR has a running track of racist issues going on)? You can say skin color isn't a thing in HP, but there are mentions of it in the books (of both skin and ethnics) which are represented in the movies as well (Cho Chang, Patil twins, Lee Jordan, Dean Thomas, etc.). If you want to forget the Asian thing, it still doesn't remove the fact that this is a curse that only affects women (a curse that they can't revoke or consent to--the curse or the changing into a literal beast), and then we have Nagini. This could have been a whole thing about subversion, but instead it turns into another layer of racism and slavery.

And yeah, Tom Riddle is white. He's literally described as being "whiter than a skull."

*** Since we're talking about curses and villainous masters, I don't think it's a case of 'unfortunate' implications. The ones inflicting the Maledictus, the ones using Nagini as a servant or circus attraction or monster -- they're Bad Guys. Of course it's cruel, inhumane, unjust, and otherwise nasty. That's why we want the heroes to /fuckin' kick their sorry arses into the Fiendfyre/.

**** It's not about who the bad guy is or that the character's story is cruel, inhumane, etc. That would be fine. Racism, sexism, cruelty, etc. exists. No one (including myself) is saying not to include these things in stories (they can lead to excellent tropes and narrative subversions to critique the prevailing racism and sexism narratives in the current media). However, that's not the case here as JKR specifically combines this backstory with Nagini (the pet, servant, horcrux of a megalomaniac psychopath). The problem is that:

1) JKR specifically created this to solely dehumanize women (who already get enough dehumanization in media), and now this specifically with Nagini being dehumanized forever because she's literally forced to become a beast for the rest of her life.

2) Latinate curse being applied to an east Asian woman (who are already often portrayed polarisingly as either demure fainting flowers--Cho anyone?--or dragon ladies) with an Indian stage name... for whatever reason we don't know yet?

3) Putting said east Asian woman character to work into a wizarding circus full of living oddities (and, again, who later becomes a servant).

There's a million other options JKR could have done. Created a new character, kept her as Nagini and made a narrative about appropriation and the issue of racism, slavery, etc. but out of everything she chose this. But we all know that it's really JKR pulling a marketing stunt. She's trying to tie everything back to the original storyline to keep attention.

By your logic, all movies are cash grabs then. The MCU, Bumblebee, Marry Poppins Returns, etc., etc. Film distributors and the film industry they operate in are a business. One of the main goals, not the main goal, but one of them is to make money.

Of course they do. The MCU proved that venture to be profitable - which is what film distributors want for all their films.

Well, yeah, to play devil's advocate for a bit, I think there's an argument to be made that these are "cash-grabs" more than other movies might have been. You could define cash-grabs as when the producers specifically decide to make movies along a certain template because it'll make money, as opposed to writers and directors coming up with a project first and then asking for funding.

Before anyone asks, this is kinda-sorta-but-not-really true of the /FB/ films. They /exist/ for an extremely cashgrabby reason --- we know this because Warner Bros. decided to make them on their own, then started looking for a writer. However, the end product is what happened when Rowling heard of the cashgrabby scheme, highjacked it, and went "well if you're doing a /Fantastic Beast/ story you won't do any of the lame nonsense your writers were going with, /I'/m going to be writing it /my way/ as an /ambitious epic/ and you just hang on to your veeblefetzers".
