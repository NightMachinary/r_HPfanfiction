:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read the fanfic on FFN around 3 - 4 days ago, the fanfic takes place in Book 7 (Deathly Hallows). When Harry Potter attempted to destroy the Locket Horcrux which fought back by pulling him underwater, nobody came in time to save him & he drowned. Only to wake up in a younger version of his body coughing out non-existent water. After regaining his bearings Harry finds out he is in a alternate universe where he isn't the Boy-Who-Lived (I think it was Neville Longbottom?). Harry Potter's Hogwarts acceptance letter arrives (again), he buys his supplies & later boards the Hogwarts Express.

When it came time for him to be sorted Harry was either not paying attention or didn't have the chance to ask the Sorting Hat for somewhere else, so it sorted him into Slytherin. I recall Harry being shocked over his sorting & later that night getting into a fight with Malfoy & attacking him in the common room. Harry goes through his classes again, I think he was nervous of Potions because of Snape singling him out. But Snape treated him like any other student.

I believe Bellatrix Lestrange or Black (I forgot if she was divorced in this fanfic), was the Head of Slytherin house & later confronted Harry about his aggressiveness towards Draco Malfoy. After arguing Bellatrix decided to intimidate Harry by threatening to adopt him.

The name of the fanfic was something like "The Meaning of Magic" it had around 5 chapters & may have been deleted by the Author. I found it to be a really good fanfic in my opinion & was ready to bookmark it but I can't find it anymore.

EDIT: I went through my browsing history & found a fanfic called "The Next Great Adventure" which gives a 'Story Not Found' error when I tried to read it.


** can you give a link?

Edit: so we can see if it is cached anywhere.

*** Only if it's been previously recommended, I'm afraid. Also, I don't believe it caches the whole story either, just the general info about it.

** My best guess is that it was published on July 2nd, going by the dates of the

I wonder if it was plagiarized, or pre-written before being uploaded, being 5 chapters long with less than two weeks of from being uploaded.

Regardless, I haven't been able to find more information about said fanfic
