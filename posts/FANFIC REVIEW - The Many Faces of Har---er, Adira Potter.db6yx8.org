Name: *The Many Faces of Har---er, Adira Potter*\\

Genres: Drama, Gender bender,

Summary: The first four years of the Harry Potter story but Harry is a */transgender/* character and a multiple. Being a multiple means that Harry (or eventually as he will be known "Adira") shares his body with multiple personalities, each personality is their own person, have their own thoughts and memories, but they also share a collective memory.

¿AU or Canon? While the transgender and multiple are AU, the story follows closely the Canon, giving additional explanation to know plot holes, for example the Weasley Twins know that a man named Peter Pettigrew is sleeping with their brother but when they go to check they found nothing (they think it is a ghost or the map is malfunctioning), or changing certain events that lead to the same ending as the cannon, for example in the Chamber of Secrets Harry convinces the Basilisk to joins his side but then it is forgotten for the next two years.

¿Should I read it? If you have a problem with transgender characters, bisexuality or homosexuality then this is a hard pass. I was looking for a gender bender Fic and I more or less got what I wanted.

¿Did you like it? Yes and no. At the end, sadly, I got bored with the multiple personalities inside of Harry. At the beginning there were three personalities, but at the end we had seven and there could be more. I was really interested in the "multiple" concept but at the end I believe the story is more about showing the public about the "multiple" concept instead of the story. What I mean is that a lot of the story is the characters coming into terms with Adira's and other Potter's situation instead of fighting Voldemort.

Final note: This is the second review I write and I by no means understand enough about transgender people or people with multiple, so I am sorry if I oversimplified some concepts or got them wrong. It was with no ill intent.


** Bit too canon-rehashy for my tastes, really, but I like the concept and the writing's good. The multiple and trans situation is without a doubt the most interesting thing about the fic, so I don't mind that it gets a lot of attention... besides, the various peronalities and their often conflicting attitudes bring a certain... freshness to what often threatens to be a straight canon retelling. In the end, they were what kept me reading the story, and what kept things interesting. Also, I really like the name "Adira." I might not have liked it for a fem!Harry who was BORN a girl (doesn't quite seem like a name Lily and James would have picked for their daughter), but for a transitioning Harry it works. Especially since it was a name Harry came up with on the fly while in disguise, liked and adopted as her own.

I do wish the author had had the nerve to stray away from the beaten path a little more, plot-wise. There are SOME changes, and some of them are pretty neat, but the overall course of the story doesn't really change, even if Harry does. Maybe the sequel gets a little more original; I didn't get around to reading that yet. Planning to do it because I really like this incarnation of Harry... and that should count for something because I can count on one hand all the fics where the depiction of Harry was the highlight for me.
