*Requirements*

- As always, I do not care much for length. As long as necessary

- Harry wandering about the Castle, again

- Harry telling Dumbledore about Lucius Malfoy selling Dark objects

- Weasleys panicking in Diagon Alley

Bonus:

- Filch encountering Harry and screaming some summer-holiday appropriate variant of "Student out of bed!"


** +But the cabinet in the RoR doesn't work. That's why Malfoy spent so much time in there to fix it.+

Edit: I forgot Harry visited the store in the Chamber of Secrets. I was thinking about 6th year. Please ignore my post.

*** It didn't work because Peeves had broken the cabinet at Hogwarts later in second year. Beforehand the cabinet wasn't broken. In fact, I'm pretty sure it was put in the RoR because it had been broken recently.

**** It was put in the Room of Requirement by Malfoy to repair it privately. He discovered it when Montague was pushed into it in OoTP, where it was still in the corridors.

***** Ahh, I thought the twins pushed him into the cabinet in the RoR.

*** Doesn't it? The one on the Hogwarts end doesn't work - but that's because Peeves smashed it during CoS. So the pair of them should have been working before then, including when Harry showed up in Borgin and Burke's.
