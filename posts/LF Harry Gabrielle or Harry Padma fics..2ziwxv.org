Looking for fics where Harry hooks up with either Gabrielle or Padma Patil. Hopefully well written and complete.

** For Harry/Padma:

It's not a major part of the story, but there's a Harry/Hermione/Padma "pairing" in the background of Larry Huss's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6275865/1/Remus-Lupin-PI][Remus Lupin, P.I.]]. 100k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.

Jeconais's stunt fic [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/The_Object_Lessons_Trilogy/index/][The Object Lessons Trilogy]] is also a very readable Harry/Padma (typical Jeconias fare--powerful, self-assured Harry moralizes, rights the world, and gets the girl). 20k words, complete, written during the peak of his popularity for the following prompt:

#+begin_quote
  Well, this is all Crys' fault. He posted in my Live Journal that I could write a story with the summary of "Harry goes for a drink of water," and people would read it. Well, I can't let that sort of challenge go, so here is the first in a trilogy of stories about boring events. The other two are "Watching Paint Dry," and "Watching Grass Grow."

** Lets see. If you want Harry/Padma you have to be willing to accept that there's going to be very little actual pairing.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4323036/1/Gentleman-Usher-of-the-Scarlet-Rod][Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod]] - Basically just flirting but it's a good Padma and a good story.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4201201/1/Rustlings_in_the_Dark][Rustlings in the Dark]] - I don't think I finished reading this. It has the problem many completely changed years do in that the story just doesn't feel as well thought out at the canon story for the year. Still I remember the grammar being pretty good.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3084932/1/Life_in_a_Different_Timeline][Life in a Different Timeline]] - Short and doesn't really do much with the idea but it's Harry/Padma and interesting for a 10 minute read.

Harry/Gabrielle is a /little/ better represented but not much. Problem is finding fics that aren't sex-slave or Harry/Harem.

- [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] - Basically /the/ Harry Gabrielle fic, even if there's very little connection between the characters and their canon selves. The fic that launched the ship.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5212671/1/Harry-and-Gabi][Harry and Gabi]] - Basically a vanilla romance where Gabrielle is actually 13-14 if I remember correctly.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8358170/1/The-Hero-and-the-Veela][The Hero and the Veela]] - It has a lot of problems with lordships and manipulative Dumbledore if I remember correctly. Can't be picky when you're looking for unusual pairings.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5490079/1/The-Little-Veela-that-Could][The Little Veela that Could]] - This fic starts out so damn depressing I've never really got more than a third of the way through. It's lovely, but by god it's a downer at the start.

Also the fic that would have buried it if it hadn't been the first. It's so cringey. Everytime this fic is mentioned, I feel the need to post this bit of dialogue:

#+begin_quote
  “So, what's the problem?” Ron asked, moving back onto the matter at hand.

  “When Gabrielle realised that she had been saved by ‘Arry, she immediately decided that ‘e waz ‘er mate, and let herself be mated to ‘im.”
#+end_quote

Hope is like many fics that were released 10 years ago, very bad by todays standards.

** Two Harry / Padma stories I've re-read a few times are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3445755/1/Chance-To-Get-It-Right]["Chance to Get it Right"]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5286576/1/Where-it-Takes-Us]["Where it Takes Us."]] They're both post-Hogwarts stories.

I feel certain I've read some that haven't shown up here in the comments yet, so maybe I'll poke around again later and come back.
