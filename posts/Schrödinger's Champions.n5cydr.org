Harry slams into the ground after escaping the graveyard after the third task. Clutched in one hand the Triwizard Cup, in the other dead body of Cedric Diggory. Just after his revalation of Voldemort's return and Dumbledore helping him to his feet the pair are knocked to the ground by the arrival of a second portkey right on top of the first. With a groan a bloody and battered identical second Cedric Diggory appears clutching an identical second Triwizard cup in one hand, and the identical second very dead body of Harry Potter in the other.


** Just as they are finding their feet, in rushes Hermione, looking winded and not a little singed, and clutching a cracked time-turner. "Professor Dumbledore, I am so sorry, but I had to try!"

*** Dumbledore points his wand in her direction, and she is suddenly unable to move. None of his usual joviality is in evidence. "And who would you be, Miss?"

"Hermione, Professor... I'm really her... This is not Polyjuice."

"Does anyone know a Hermione?" Dumbledore asks.

Nobody present does.

** Alive Harry reached out to dead Harry, not quite processing what he was seeing. The instant they touched, there was a tearing sound and a bright flash and Suddenly there was just one alive copy of Harry, one somewhat shellshocked and very alive copy of Cedric and one cup.

​

Cedric turned to Harry, still processing having memories of being dead.

​

"So the afterlife is..."

​

"I guess so. You also used a time turner to save me?"

​

"Yes. I guess we broke reality a bit there."

​

"Yep."

​

There was a pause, as they both processed that, before Cedric spoke up again.

​

"Wait... so if neither of us died... what happened to balance out the fact neither of us died?"

​

​

Somewhere in Little Hangleton, a magically created flesh golem exploded, torn apart by the forces of causality and a paradox caused by two idiots with time turners. The resulting bone shrapnel took out most of the wizards there, and the survivors spoke only in mad mutterings about fractal schoolboys and endless vanishing corpses.

​

Meanwhile, Harry and Cedric had dinner.

*** In my fic I wrote that in two almost identical realitys (with changes like one Albus using orange pijama bottoms the night before, and the other one using blue ones) Albus and Scorpius used the time-tuner and swapped realitys. The explanation is longer and complex but it explains that what they were doing was entering to different realities based on intent and not actually time-traveling.
