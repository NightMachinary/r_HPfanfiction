*** I second this. I diedâ€‹ laughing reading it (I got better). I suggest not reading in public if you don't want to look like an idiot. Especially since you can't explain it to anyone else.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

*** Oh god, I love that one! Ideally I'm think Harry Potter in the Naruto Universe but I'm just getting to the Naruto fandom so I don't know what's popular. :)

  Harry was never the only person with a penchant for tripping into the most absurd of situations. Reincarnated!Hermione. Somewhat darker than the usual take on Naruto. Political machinations. Character progression. Strong friendship, no romance.

** I personally loved Auryn. Abandoned, but still a good read. linkffn(7403329)

Also, I seem to recall enjoying Growing Strong, but I haven't read it in awhile. linkffn(11022041) EDIT: And Growing Strong's sequel apparently got an update recently, which is why I was reminded about it.

  Based on esama's 'Subject of Change', no pairings yet. When Harry Potter died, he didn't expect to end up meeting a giant fox, a pervert, get changed into a girl and end up with some kid who had was capable of giving Snape the warm and fuzzies.
