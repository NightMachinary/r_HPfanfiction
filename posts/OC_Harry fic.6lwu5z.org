  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** I'll also add linkffn(Behind Blue Eyes by Paffy), which is a post-OotP fic. This one is rather hit and miss with people. People either like the MuggleOC or dislike her. I find her to be a pretty well rounded, non-Mary Sue, so I tend to like her more than not. As for the writing quality, I find the start to be a bit lackluster and other than one or two details after year six starts, there is no real divergence from canon, but that's almost to be expected.
