"Hermione" The dark voice of the man next to her spoke to her, as she was kneeling in front of him.

​

"Yes Master?" She said, raising her head to the tip of Salazar's beard in the inverted chamber of secrets.

​

"I need you to do this, and I need it now" The man's green eyes shone brightly, looking like an almost exact copy of the well-known spell * Avada Kedavra * "Send a message to Ron, and tell him I've already taken care of Dumbledore. The lion must go home to his pack."

​

---In the end, they were actually talking after a long night drinking with their friends doing random crazy things, like flipping the chamber of secrets with rum going to Australia turned into animagi.

​

I mean, nothing dark, but that they speak in a way that seems to be a dark Lord and everyone confuses him.

​

And with Hermione having a fetish of being "Student" and Harry being a good husband-child.


** Dumbledore is now gone... off somewhere and we need to stop Snape from stealing the Sorcerer's Stone

I have released the basilisk... from Riddle's control.

Dementors spread! Away from my Patronus.

'Ron will die by midnight!' Harry attempted to guess for professor Trelawney

My words are written in blood... well, fuck you Umbridge!

I killed Dumbledore... a little inside when I told him I didn't actually have a Hungarian Horntail tattoo.

Hey guys! Have you noticed that using the Imperius Curse simplifies things a lot?

*** The last three are my favorite! Especially the last one since it is actually the truth ;)
