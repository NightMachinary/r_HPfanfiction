Wanted to see what other people think is the reason that Harry Potter has the largest number of fanfics wrote for its fandom


** Because it's the best selling book series of all time. For comparison, the HP series sold five times as many books as the Hunger Games series.

On top of the sheer sales figures, you have the cultural phenomenon associated with it - those sales were concentrated within a small period of time, and the launch of each book was an event. But even more important than the books was the period of time between them - time for people to speculate and salivate for what was coming next. People literally grew up with these books - I more or less was the same age as Harry when each of the books came out.

On top of that, Harry Potter basically made fantasy mainstream. Before HP normalised it, fantasy was for geeks and social outcasts. It also made YA literature more generally into a big business by creating an entire generation of readers. You would never have something like HBO doing Game of Thrones if Harry Potter hadn't first pushed fantasy into mainstream entertainment.

There hasn't ever been anything like it since and I doubt there will be in the future. The marketplace that the HP series created is now too crowded for any given series to come along and completely dominate it.

*** Timing is a factor too. Right at the rise of mass internet access meant HP fanfic was easier to find and share than in fan magazines and whatnot like Star Trek was back in the day.

** It's the perfect storm of all the reasons people write fanfiction. The Harry Potter series has decent world building, good characters, and a great plot. When it came out, it revitalized the children's fantasy market at exactly the right moment to capture the attention of the people that would be most able to use a major technological breakthrough (easy access to the internet) to expess their love of the series. It generated a huge and mostly silly controversy that further attacted the rebellious sorts more prone to writing fanfiction. Lastly the later books produced a lot of speculation that people expressed via fanfiction. All of this created a tradition of fanfiction writing that continues to today. The only fandom that I think got close to repeating this perfect storm in recent years is My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.

*** To add on to the world building, characters. and plot, they were really enticing and fun, but also incomplete and sometimes contradictory. This allows people to play around with some of the contradictions or ideas not fully explored, which makes the universe a perfect playground for writers.

** I think it's also because of how other authors can create story plots while staying within the HP universe. It can make them more imaginative and write in different genres with it.

** As someone said, the world is an amazing playground for writers' imaginations. It's so expansive with aspects the books threw in little hints about but never developed (old pureblood families, goblins, Ministry politics, the first war, just to name a few).

Same with characters: the books allude to fascinating/tragic backstories but they are just waiting to be fleshed out by other writers. I've been writing fanfic about Sirius Black and Remus Lupin for 14 years and haven't gotten tired of it yet!
