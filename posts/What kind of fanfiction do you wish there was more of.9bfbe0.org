What kind of stories do you wish were explored more in HP fic but aren't? Or at least you wish there was more of even if some do exist.

Listing any kind of story (or aspect of story) is fine, except just saying you want more of a particular pairing or character. So by that I mean not things like, I wish there was more stories about x pairing or x character in general. But it's fine if its specific to a kind of story. So things like, I wish there were more fics about x (character or pairing) in * insert any type of story idea here*, saying that is fine.

And what kind of fics/stories do you wish there was less off? Once again not about a character or pairing in general. But it's fine if it's about a character or pairing in the context of a specific type of story/fic.


** I can't believe I'm saying this, but I wish there were more Time Travel fics.

​

What I mean is I wish there were more good ones. There are so many that are either a) terrible or b) unfinished or c) both that it makes it hard to find ones to read. I love the concept, and is probably my favorite trope in Harry Potter fandom, but finding good ones to read is so hard.

*** I wish there were more time-travel fics, but what I want is the opposite of 99% of fics.

Time-travel to the future. How has the wizarding world changed 30 years, or maybe 100 year, into the future?

**** Technology and magic also make a tenuous pair in the 90's, let alone the current times. Another 30-100 years would honestly be relatively impossible to try to determine the timelines of both magic and technology, and then to further try to determine the relationship therein, outside the two finding out about each other and/or the apocalypse.

*** I'd like to see some more Time Travel stories with more unique travelers.

Harry and Hermione and to a lesser extent Ron, Ginny, and Luna have been done to death.

I want to see what happens when Neville goes back in time. I've searched for years but haven't found one.

Heck, I've even found one where Dudley goes back in time, but never Neville.

  Dudley Dursley, 37, has only just put his daughter on the Hogwarts Express and said goodbye when Platform 9 3/4 is attacked. In the ensuing explosion, he blacks out - and wakes up as an eleven year old back in Privet Drive. Confused and wary, he finds himself blundering through his life all over again, and unfortunately, being eleven isn't the only surprise in store.

**** If you're going to read this story get ready for 40 chapters of alternate universe with absolutely no explanation. By the time the author bothered to explain their AU changes and what happened, I had stopped caring.

Also, Red Knight is not for Hermione fans. And the AU premise is a bit stupid too.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8sk8m4/lf_fics_with_good_polyamory/e13e9ey/][This post i made in a thread about polyamory]] should whet your appetite. It is all mostly romantic Trio!fic and all mostly one-shots and short fics, but if you browse the Harry/Ron/Hermione tag by word count on Ao3, there are some solid novel length fics.

A lot of Trio friendship and romantic fics were written before Book 7 were released as well as the last 2 movies that really downplayed Ron's involvement or any positive traits he had, so i think your best bet might be to trawl the archives or livejournals from 2004 to 2009ish

*** Man, there's one that I remember reading a number of years ago, back on RestrictedSection. I couldn't find it for years after that, and now since that's defunct I'll never find it again. It had the relationship between the three of them down pat, realistic consequences to their poly relationship, the length, the sex, the worth. Wish I even had a title. But in my opinion, a well done Trio fic is worth its weight in gold.

** I've always been really interested in reading fics about the Black family. I've found quite a few good fics about Sirius because I'm not too concerned with who he's paired up with romantically. Usually, I like Sirius fics that are about what would have happened if he'd survived the battle at the department of mysteries, or fics where he raised Harry.

I would like to see more fics about Bellatrix, Andromeda, and Narcissa. Specifically involving what their relationships with each other were like as kids and around the time they were Hogwarts students. I would also like to read fics about what happened when Andromeda decided to marry Ted and got disowned. Their dynamic and the fact that the three of them led lives on wildly different paths just interests me.

*** I always love Black Family stories especially ones that explore pure blood society. But I prefer long fics and most of the ones I find are one shots

There is this one long fic I read recently called Renscentia that explores the Black family a bit . Its a AU of if Regulus somehow survived and focuses more his relationship with Sirius. But there is alot of talk of his connection to Bellatrix and Narcissa from his POV. It's amazing but it's really the only fic I've read about the Black family that was along the lines of what I wanted.

**** I also prefer longer fics and have trouble finding them, or if I do find one it's an unfinished/abandoned fic which sucks because I love these characters.

Pure blood society and the way it's shaped each of these characters is part of what interests me about them. I sometimes feel like the Black family (except for where Sirius is concerned) is overlooked by the fandom in terms of fics, and that's why there are so little of them.

That sounds interesting! Thanks for the fic recommendation.

When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again in '95, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the ashes.

While not the main focus, there are quite a few scenes about the Black family without Harry's part in it, some from Tonks' PoV and some from Andromeda's. Especially chapters 7 and 8 explore the Black sister dynamic, with 6 and 8 also showing that Nymphadora is her mother's daughter.

** I've wanted to read stories about Harry and Hermione at the Ministry. Given how comically incompetent it was and how badly it kept fucking them over, I'd like more stories that explored their frustrations at having to be part of the machine to try and reform it. Realistically, with Kingsley as Minister and those two getting highly placed, I'd expect them to get the desired reforms within a few years and bounce. No way they'd be interested in careers there, I just can't buy it.

*** In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][my only fanfic]], linkffn(12925628), I have created the following scenario (JKR here is the initial of the reporter, not J.K. Rowling):

#+begin_quote
  JKR: That's so adorable! But then you decide to go work at the Ministry, while she returns to Hogwarts. It means another year of separation for you two!

  HJP: It wasn't easy, but circumstances required my presence in the Ministry. It was in total shambles. It was disgraced beyond recognition after being overthrown twice within a period of ten months. The people were furious and outraged after hearing what happened to the children at Hogwarts and to Muggleborns. Within a few days of the Battle, they were marching on the Ministry and Wizengamot, led by none other than Molly and Augusta Longbottom.

  HJP: Kingsley came to me and explained the situation. If the mob had stormed the Ministry, it would have completely collapsed. ICW might have assumed Britain would no longer be able to enforce the Statute of Secrecy, which would had led to an intervention. We - Kingsley, the DA, and the Order - would have been held responsible, and Voldemort remnants could have potentially returned to power. That was a situation we absolutely wanted to avoid. So I called up the DA and used the emergency Floo at Hogwarts to arrive in the Minister's Office. We openly appealed to the crowd and eventually worked out an agreement.

  JKR: The agreement that led to the full reorganization of the Ministry and the Wizengamot?
#+end_quote

I'm currently writing more for my little series. Basically. after Harry began working there, I expect he and his friends to find out what a wretched hive of scum and villainy the Ministry really was, and he could NOT afford to leave that place to those people. So he was stuck. Fortunately, Kingsley and the totally reformed Wizengamot stood behind him, and they had the Auror office fully under control. The next is a little excerpt of them venting their frustration (and some dark secrets after the Battle):

#+begin_quote
  Seamus: We can't do this? We can't do that?! What was that soulless motherfucker thinking? He thought he could hide behind that foul “I'm just following order, we have to follow procedures” excuse? You know what, if anyone of those Death Eaters escapes because of that motherfucker and more innocents are harmed, I'm going to personally tear that motherfucker from limb to limb!

  Neville: Language, Seamus, Language.

  Seamus: Sorry, Neville. I shall rephrase it to “inbred soulless motherfucking Ministry minion”! It's not just that little piece of shit, there are a whole bunch of those inbred soulless motherfucking Ministry minions who still think they own this damn place. We fought, we bled, we suffered, and we died, and those shit think they can still order us around? It's about time we teach them a lesson!

  Ron (laughs out loud): That was bloody brilliant, Seamus. That felt so good! Sorry, Neville, I hope you take no offense?

  Neville: None at all, I and Seamus went all the way to hell and back. We understand each other perfectly well, although I certainly wouldn't express myself that way in front of Kingsley. But Seamus has a point, there are still too many from the old Ministry, with their arrogant and corrupt attitudes. Kingsley might have cleaned out the Auror office, but it's only a part of the DMLE. We need to change that, and soon.

  Harry: Which means more politics. I hate that. I thought we had it after the Wizengamot was purged, thanks to your gran and Molly of course. But the rot in Ministry goes far deeper than my worst imagination. They weren't just forced into serving Voldemort. They did it willingly!

  Dean: We can't be too reckless though, or else we might face a full-fledged rebellion.

  Seamus: I say bring them on, lure them into the open, and then we will deal with them like we did with the Carrows...

  Neville: Seamus!

  Seamus: Oh, sorry Neville. I'm really really sorry this time.

  Harry: What did you do with the Carrows?

  Ron and Dean both turning their attention on Neville and Seamus.

  Neville: I think this will sooner or later come out. Seamus, do you agree that we should tell them the truth?

  Seamus nodded.

  Neville: Good. After you three went to sleep, we remembered that the Carrows were still tied up in the Ravenclaw Tower. So I led scores of DA members and we tortured them into pieces of vegetables. Then we killed them and explained that they were killed trying to escape. I'm not proud of this action, but I have no regrets. For what they did to hundreds of my fellow students, they totally deserved it.

  Ron: Bloody Hell!

  Seamus: Neville, it's not only you! We all agreed, especially Ginny...

  Neville: Seamus, what Ginny did is not our right to tell. Harry can ask her directly.

  Dean: Why didn't you call me to join the party?

  Neville: You were asleep as well, and Luna said not to get you involved.

  Dean: Luna was part too? Why did she leave me out? I have every reason to get back at them!

  Neville: You have to ask her, Dean. Luna cares very much about you, and she certainly had her reasons.

  Ron: You have my support too. Those two totally deserved it. I'm glad Ginny had her revenge. It's a pity Mum got Bellatrix too quickly. Harry?

  Harry: I certainly can't blame you, since I crucioed Amycus Carrow for spitting on Professor McGonagall.

  Others: You did what?

  Ron: Wow, I never knew you had that in you, Harry! You got Cruciatus to work on your first try?

  Harry: No, that was my second attempt. I first tried to cast it on Bellatrix in the Department of Mysteries, after she had murdered Sirius. It didn't work, and she taunted me by saying that “I have to mean it!”.

  Harry: Now that I remember it, Ginny did feel somewhat off when I met her in the common room after waking up. Does anyone else know?

  Neville: Professor McGonagall knows. Although she disagrees, she understands us.

  Harry: We will need a full pardon on all of our actions against Death Eaters during the War, and we will need significant freedom of actions against them in the future.

  Ron: Does that mean you want us to use Unforgivables?

  Harry: Maybe not Unforgivables, but lethal force for sure. During the Final Battle, they were throwing every dark curses at us, while we mostly answered with Stunners. A simple Rennervate by their fellow murderers meant they were back in business. It was criminal. We would have lost far fewer if we had fought back more effectively.

  Harry: Remember, we had Doholov and Rowle down in that Cafe, and we let them go. God knows how many more Muggleborns, Muggles, and Hogwarts students they had murdered afterwards. Remus was killed by Doholov, and it was my misplaced mercy that Teddy lost both of his parents. I should have listened to you then, and killed them on the spot.

  Ron: No Harry, you can't blame yourself for that! Dolohov murdered them, not you! Besides, Voldemort had my whole family as hostages, and if we had killed them, he might have retaliated by killing my family!

  Harry: Maybe. Maybe it was the right decision on that night, for us. But then during the Final Battle, we also had Greyback down after he mauled Lavender. Why didn't we put him permanently out of business there? Why?

  Neville: Because we were students then, not trained killers. They failed us, so we had to step up to do the dirty work. The Ministry, the whole lot of them, they all failed us.

  Seamus: Damn right, Neville! So what are we going do about those inbred soulless motherfucking Ministry minions?

** *What I Want More Of*

- More well-thought out "For Want of a Nail" fics, that treat one seemingly small change as something that has real consequences. /Weasley Girl/ is a good example--there are a lot of changes that happen when Ronnie is running around with Harry, instead of Ron.

*What I Want Less Of*

- Bashing
- Unrealistic dialogue
- Unrealistic spell-casting: First years do not learn mid-level spells like /Stupefy/ or /Accio/ (Though one wonders why Rowling wrote something so simple as a Summoning Charm as something learned halfway through their education)
- Weasley-bashing
- Children Involved in Politics. Harry is eleven. Nobody is going to listen to an eleven-year-old and take their opinions seriously. Anybody who does "listen" to an eleven-year-old and take their opinions on issues as workable policy is either pandering to the base, or has an equally dismal understanding of the issues
- Acting as if the Harry Years are set in the 2010s. Movies aside, the books are set in the 1990s.

What happened to Russian wizarding community after the revolution? Did German Wizards carry out a policy of 'de-Grindelwaldization'? What does an American wizarding community look like, given that it's had to spend the last century dancing out of the way of an aggressively sprawling suburbia and eternal urban redevelopment?

How did the principles of Confucianism worm their way into Chinese spellcasting? How did early Spanish settler Wizards interact with the native shamans of South America?

I know it takes a bit of a tier above average to build your own locations, characters, spellcasting, etc. rather than building within the well-trod halls of Hogwarts, but there's so much interesting shit out there.

  The New World is just as ancient as the Old World, and just as full of secrets. But when European wizards came here, they wanted everything to be just like it was in the Old World.

*** In the odds were never in my favour, a goblin fortress had gone silent, no communication, and was in full lock down. Five thousand goblin warriors, a group of human curse-breakers and female Harry are dispatched to investigate. Gringotts was suspicious of betrayal from the curse breakers, hence why they sent a witch who had only completed first year instead of a goblin to investigate. The group uncovers what happened and in the ensuing chaos, female Harry is the only survivor (mostly because goblins do not retreat). This happens in chapter 20 and, without spoiling it, I think would satisfy your eldritch horror (or at least large magical monster) wish. linkffn(11517506)

I'm pretty sure that the story goes in an original direction since I started writing it because I found nothing similar. Harry and Tonks get themselves caught in an escalating international conflict while trying to figure out what the hell is going on. There's no bashing (besides a short passage about Dumbledore's Horcrux Masterplan in chapter 1), no canon rehash and Tonks has to save Harry from a spot of trouble instead of him being stupidly overpowered.

** Hmm...kinds of fics? Not specific ideas?

Well...I'd like to see magical creatures with more characterisation. It seems like whenever I see goblins, they're either a plot device to give Harry lots of money/political power, or faceless mooks in a goblin rebellion. No fics come to mind where a specific goblin with their own motives, likes, dislikes, etc, is a protagonist or antagonist.\\
Same with centaurs, they rarely happen except as background stuff or plot device. Whenever I see Dobby he's a plot device to move Harry's stuff around and do magical things he hasn't learned yet.

So yeah, I'd like to see fics that use creatures as characters rather than plot devices. And maybe explore the stereotypes. If Griphook believed that Harry & co would betray him, why did he help them to Bellatrix's vault in the first place? Did he plan to return Gryffindor's Sword to its rightful owner, or was he plotting to steal it for himself? What are the centaurs of the Forbidden Forest so worried about losing that they would isolate themselves from other races? Are trolls and giants really stupid and violent, or is that propaganda used to justify their displacement and subjugation?

...For that matter, why /are/ those various magical creatures covered under the Statute of Secrecy? What drove witches & wizards in 1689-1692 to hide not only the existence of magic-using humans, but all magic and all other sentient beings on earth, from just one species?

But the problem I find with them is more often than not the obstacles in the story seemed designed not for Genius Harry but Book/Movie Harry. I mean it shows how much smart or badass he can be sure, but now everything just feels easier for him. And that's cool for a while, but then the lack of tension ( when there is supposed to be),because Harry gets past everything too easily gets boring.

***** I agree with that it's hard for me to find a smart Harry story where he's actually a intetesting chatacter. They often scrap his personality but give him nothing particularly interesting in exchange ( let alone likable). It's the problem I had with Methods of Rationality. I liked the idea so much but I found Harry's character intolerable. And in the chapters I read it seemed more focused on showing how smart he was in the most obnoxious way, rather than proceeding with the story. I know alot of people like it and there is alot to like about it. I enjoyed alot of other aspects of it but I just couldn't stand Harry in that fic.

A lot of the popular femslash pairings are, honestly, fucking disgusting in my opinion.

The prime pairing I'm referring to here is Hermione/McGonagall and other similar massive age gaps.

Other than that, a lot of fics/pairings are pretty uninspired in general, and the quality just doesn't compare to the het fics that are out there, and it's mildly sad. Give me some more solid fem!harry femslash fics that aren't massive angsty piles of trash like Butterly Effect, or some more Hogwarts-era fics that focus the spotlight on a femslash relationship, rather than having most of the halfway decent ones take place after the books.

(I'm aware there are plenty of femslash stories in the fandom-- a fic count of 650k guarantees that, but there's a shortage of pairings/plots that specifically interest me so that's my wish.)

Someone asked her why that was the case, and another person asked whether her characters were very religious. Conclusion: no sex, there's something wrong with your characters, lol. I mean, I personally enjoyed the plot and that mild romance, I didn't miss mature content at all. The author said she thought the wizarding world was old-fashioned when it came to intimacy, and people were rather astonished by this. Another problem is that when people write about sex, they make everything so explicit, and do that in nearly every chapter. Apparently being subtle is far more difficult than describing every intimate scene. Ok, I should stop rambling, but this bothers me a lot, I'm glad to find someone who agrees with me.

But considering Hogwarts is a boarding school for children aged 11-17, and you share a dorm room with a number of your peers for that entire time, I'm surprised there aren't more fics exploring the...ribald side of being a teenager. Dirty jokes, walking in on each other in, uh, "compromising situations," bragging about sexual encounters that almost certainly didn't happen, etc.

Basically the old "there are several hundred students and only 20 teachers, they're definitely having sex" thing, but through the lens of growing up and friendship instead of smut.

*** I love anything that expands the HP magic system. Either by introducing something new expanding on something old, or making more in depth exploration for already exists.

As for slash shipping I see no reason why slash stories in particular need to be labeled. But I generally though think all ships that get explored a decent degree should get labelled ( minor side ships that barely get mentioned whatever).

I say generally not always because I feel a little conflicted. Sometimes the romance might end up being a suprise or a plot point. So revealing the pairing regardless of if its m/m, m/f, or f/f might spoil your story. Or perhaps you didn't have a ship in mind when you started, and as you wrote one relationship seemed particularly compelling. So you put it in when you decided to go that route. So I hessitate in saying your ships should always be labelled. Sometimes that's not a option. But in most cases, especially if you are going to make a ovbious relationship I think it's a good idea to label.

**** The story I was in conflict with the author about was a naruto story where a character is taken from canon and dropped into an alt world, with some time travel involved as well.

It was great seeing a strong character weakened and also everyone else is wondering if he is a sleeper agent/ an imposter because he displays skills he did not have prior to the displacement i guess is what you could call it.

Where the slash comes in is just arbitrarily in the last 3 chapters of the story. Then the author abandoned it anyway so those three chapters essentially do nothing for the story.

Real quote from the author. Seriously those PMs are pretty great.

But if they get to couple status later on in story then I expect build up. Naturally if its romance thats a given but even if it's not. Action adventure plots don't require a romance. If you didn't want to put in the effort of developing one then just don't put it in. I'm not sure a warning with help with that though. Bad writing is bad writing knowing that ship would have been randomly put in doesn't really make it any better. I remember reading this one fic that actually had pairing I liked . But the romance was non existent and not labeled and I figured it was a gen fic then out of nowhere romance it just seems dumb even if you like the pairing.

** Fics that deal with the Department of Mysteries. Not like boring stuff either, spies are okay but not what I'm after. We only saw a couple of rooms filled with the stuff they get up to in there, all of which make you wonder "what don't these people do?"

Alternate Post-PoA stories. I get that GoF is arguably the most popular book in the series, but the whole events of the third book leave a lot more room to maneuver than any later point in my opinion, at least without just pulling in a bunch of OCs or instituting huge changes. What would have happened if Sirius had gotten his soul sucked out? What would have changed?

A Harry-parent/mentor fic. More specifically, I want to see a Harry who raises Teddy and/or Delphini. I had this idea for a fic that went like this (outline):

- In the aftermath of the war, the majority of the magical community became rather staunchly anti-anything-related-to-the-Death-Eaters. To wit, they wanted to drive off any and all werewolves (Lavender Brown's family were an ardent support) and exile or execute anyone related to the inner circle.
- Harry, after working as an auror and being targeted for his boasting about the Elder Wand in DH, stumbles across Euphemia Rowle, mortally wounds her, and discovers the infant is Voldemort's kid.
- When he wants to report this, he realizes what would happen: best case scenario she is imprisoned somewhere, but more likely they would try something a little more violent. Harry, given his upbringing and Dumbledore's words ('It matters not how we are born, but how we grow to be.') decides to take Teddy and Delphini and run, but not tell anyone who Delphini is or where he's going for their protection. He left Ginny unwillingly because she was nearly killed once or twice in an attempt to get to him (being noble and all that).
- So what the story I want here is basically Harry is Kratos from the most God of War (4) and is protecting one or both of them while they travel around the world, not staying anywhere for to long. This constant protective role means he needs to keep learning to fight and defend them, so he earns an even greater reputation around Europe and the rest of the world as they travel.
- The story would pick up in 2006, where Harry finally relents to Teddy's request to see the Quidditch World Cup. So he ends up contacting Kingsley and Hermione (her and Ron being Harry's only correspondents in Britain), and they set it up for them to attend.

Sounds awesome, huh? Well, I think so. Harry as Kratos, Delphini/Teddy as sort of a brother-sister (Atreus)? What's not too love?

Its almost impossible for me to believe that nobody would come after him for the Elder Wand - its supposed to be the greatest wand in history (or they believe it is). And attacking his friends and family is exactly what people would do to make Harry surrender it.

Anyway, mostly its a thought process. Its not likely something I'll actually write. The point is, thats the sort of thing Harry would get wound up and do (he has a very warped viewpoint on what the right thing to do is more often than not in canon).

****** Don't get me wrong - I agree.

But I think you're overestimating Harry's ability to learn from his mistakes. Much of that is part of his personality - save people whenever he can. Its been shown that a side effect of childhood isolation is often overprotectiveness of any future relationships one will garner, to the point of ridiculous behavior. Harry never really sways from this.

And one of the few things CC had right about Harry in the future (my opinion) is that the trauma and loss of the war, as well as walking to his own death, would leave him with serious PTSD issues. And given his more introverted nature (not talking about himself), he probably would never really deal with it. That said, I don't think watching your parents being murdered would provide real catharsis either.

******** I get where you're coming from. But this isn't about angst. If anything, it about Harry raising a metamorphmagus and heir of Slytherin on his own, while protecting them, and how this changes them all.

Harry wouldn't be angsty. Suddenly he has two kids tagging along with him (maybe Kreacher is with them and is sort of a nanny). Its about how he and those kids would change as a result. About them traveling the world, staying out of the limelight and seeing new places.

The point is its about Harry who was forced into a serious protector role himself. He has to grow and learn and figure out how to do this with no real help (Kreacher may remember the Black kids, but I doubt he's the paragon of childrearing).

Thats why I compared it to the Kratos/Atreus relationship in God of War 4. Harry's had a famous past, and one day he would have to tell each of them what they were. Teddy was a one-in-a-million (this is my own story point, not canon), since werewolves can't have children (again, not canon, just for story), and only happened because it was with a metamorphmagus. Delphini's father is a mass murderer who killed /his parents/ and her mother killed /his godfather./ How would he deal with that, reconcile it with his beliefs about love (see: naming his kid after Snape because 'he was a good person in the end').

Besides which, wizards and witches as a general rule seem to err on the side of the irrational. That might be why they are actually able to use magic (they were born with a certain mental capacity). This leads to many of them being cooky, and the more capable the odder their personalities (Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape, etc.). But thats just my own thoughts.

No Andromeda was killed, which was part of the issue (Nordic werewolves had a cult believing teddy was child of prophecy).

Ginny was used as a hostage at one point to get to Harry, basically they attacked a quidditch practice in Holyhead.

The first arc of the story is supposed to start in 2006. I don't care about pairings much, but the plot basically has him still in love with Ginny. This is part of the reason he is willing to let them be seen in the larger magical world: England is playing against Korea (lets us see magic not from Europe) and Ginny was a chaser with the national team.

But then the cup gets attacked post-match and an Italian Dark Lady named Bellona stages a distraction to kidnap the daughter of Voldemort. Story goes from there.

After all, the first time Voldemort was defeated plenty of pureblood Slytherins held onto their prestige and power (Lucius Malfoy is the most obvious example, but certainly not the only one), and while Harry & co certainly don't like the Slytherins at Hogwarts, there's no evidence that the House is at the bottom of any social hierarchy. If anything, I think it would be easier for Voldemort sympathizers (if not outright Death Eaters) to excuse their actions after the second war, since Voldemort totally taken over for most of a year - "I only cooperated because otherwise the Death Eaters would have killed me and my family with absolute impunity" would likely make a compelling excuse, and would be difficult to disprove.
