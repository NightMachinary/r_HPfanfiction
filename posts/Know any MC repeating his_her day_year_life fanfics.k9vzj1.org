The other day I was reading this person's drabble on Ao3 where Harry has apparently repeated his life 276 times already because of Death. As I read it I remembered this fanfic on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] where Ron is for some reason repeating the same day over and over and over and over and at first it's fun, then annoying, then depressing, etc. Sadly it's discontinued, but still enjoyable.

Moving on, I was wondering if any of you read a fanfic where the character repeats the same day/week/year/life? Or something like that.

Edit: For those who want to read it, here's the Ron fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1339788/1/Groundhog-Day]]

*** That actually would be funny if the day they kept repeating was a holiday and by the end of the fic the character hates it.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22023307/chapters/52557616][Time and Again]] by manixzen is a fic I really love.

Involves Harry/Draco, cool magic artifacts, and a whole lot of mundane inconveniences that really speak to me
