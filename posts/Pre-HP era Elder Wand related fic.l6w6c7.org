:END:
I remember having read once a fic where Livius and Arcus were rivals who both tried to outdo each other in spell creation so they start a race to steal the Elder Wand from Loxias. Eventually they manage to steal it but they end up killing each other over it. Loxias is killed by his mother later on for losing the wand. Do you know the name of the fic?

Alternatively, do you know of any good fics about previous owners of the Elder Wand?

Thank you!
