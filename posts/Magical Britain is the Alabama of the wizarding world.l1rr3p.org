I know it is fairly obvious that it is but the difference is Alabama adapt and change while magical Britain is stagnated


** Seems unlikely.

- Dumbledore is was chosen as the Supreme Mugwump of the ICW.

- England was chosen to host the Quidditch World Cup in 1994.

- British wizards go around looting other countries without any apparent consequence (Bill Weasley/cursebreakers).

- Durmstrang doesn't accept Muggleborns.

- We know that by North American standards, magical Britain is considered dangerously liberal with its approach to fraternisation with Muggles.

- No international group interfered in the Voldemort conflict despite Voldemort representing a clear danger to all.

I think all signs point to magical Britain being (a) unusually liberal for the magical world, with the rest of the world likely being substantially more anti-Muggle, and (b) sufficiently powerful as a nation that other nations do not seek to interfere in its internal affairs.

This largely follows JKR's broader theme of magical politics mirroring Muggle politics. It makes sense from that perspective that Western European magical nations would be the most liberal, likely so liberal that the rest of the world consider them deviant/dangerous.

*** I'd say Britain is pretty powerful in the magical world. Do you think it's a coincidence that the magical world outlawed interference with muggles around the same time as British and other European muggles sailed around the world conquering everything in their way?

**** I'd agree to the extent that it even makes sense to analyse the magical world as consisting of nation states.

While it's true that we know the magical world consists of national magical governments, I sometimes think it is overstated how much these resemble states in our Muggle understanding of what a state is.

In many ways, I feel like the more accurate analysis of the magical world is of a global club with regional chapters. Wizards are collectively engaged in an Illuminati-level conspiracy and there seems to be a high level of cooperation between them. See, for example, the way the British Prime Minister's phone call with a foreign president was re-arranged at a moment's notice in HBP - via the foreign president's mind being altered at the whim of the British magical government.

We also know that the ICW (i) is able to censure national magical governments, (ii) passes law like the Statute of Secrecy which have direct legal effect in all magical nations and (iii) is engaged in a project of the unification/standardisation of magical laws such as those governing cauldron bottom thickness.

This presents the ICW as a very EU-like organisation - or at least, much closer to the EU than the UN. It is an organisation with real legal bite, not just a venue in which diplomacy takes place. But of course, unlike the EU, its membership consists of /the entire world/.

In her article listing the British Ministers for Magic, JKR writes:

#+begin_quote
  Evangeline Orpington 1849 - 1855 A good friend of Queen Victoria's, who never realised she was a witch, let alone Minister for Magic. Orpington is believed to have intervened magically (and *illegally*) in the Crimean War.
#+end_quote

This is quite a remarkable statement, when you think about it. In the name of protecting wizarding secrecy, the ICW has effectively outlawed the use of magical warfare between nations - though we know it was widely defied during World War I.

The existence of a supra-national body with the authority to authorise and forbid wars between magical states has enormous implications for inter-state competition.

In light of all of this, I just don't see the magical world's geopolitics of consisting of anything like "great power" politics where individual nations throw their weight around. The avenues through which that weight can be thrown are severely restricted by secrecy and tempered by the high level of cooperation between magical governments.

Rather, I picture the wizarding world as a single global community, where the "great powers" are not individual magical nations but rather individual powerful wizards.

***** Seeing how say the German local parties like to throw their weight around on the federal level and didn't give a damn about Voldemort massacring wizards in Britain, I really don't think treating the Magical World as a club with local offices means it's any less competitive than the Great Powers of the 19th century. That "high level cooperation" seems strictly limited to preserving the SoS, nothing more.

****** I suppose my ultimate point was about sovereignty. If the ICW is entitled to forbid magical nations from taking military action, then this is a significant infringement on the traditional notion of what a sovereign nation is.

Consider, for example, the Dominions of Canada and Australia. They were almost entirely autonomous in domestic terms, but their foreign and military policy remained in the control of Westminster. The lack of control over their own foreign and military policy was, on its own, sufficient for them to be considered part of the British Empire and not independent sovereign states.

In terms of sovereignty, it is perhaps more accurate to consider the ICW a single sovereign state - a highly decentralised empire. Its regions can compete, of course - but only within the terms set by their overlord.

******* That still doesn't explain the lack of international support against Voldemort. And you don't need to consider the ICW a single sovereign state - even sovereign states are bound by international law and agreements, and "don't break the SoS" sounds like an agreement, not some nation-building cause.

Well, on that front my view has generally been that most other nations simply don't care - they probably think that Voldemort has the right ideas and perceive him as a natural correction in bringing Britain back in line with the international norm.

Though this is mostly based on the fact that Durmstrang don't accept Muggleborns and the depiction of magical NA in Fantastic Beasts.

********* Is there a degree of "Well, Voldemort's not going to break the Statute, so whatever" in there as well, or is it pretty much just that they think Voldemort's got the right ideas, and a Bizarro Voldemort who wanted to push Britain further in its already-weird direction /would/ be met with international opposition?

*** The North American Magical Government makes no sense! Why would the Scourers be a purely American problem!? It was implied that they immigrated to the US for fucks sake. Apparently, witch-trials were a big enough problem in the US that they completely cut ties, but fucking why! Europe killed significantly more witches! It doesn't follow! Not to mention that if American magicals were even somewhat similar to their muggle counterparts, there would have been a massive outcry against Rappaport's law. People are freaking out over being required to wear masks for fucks sake!

If Magical England is similar why were the Wizards who emigrated allowed to set up their own government without English oversight? Why did they go into the cities? If they're so concerned about secrecy, why wouldn't they set up their own enclaves? Most of America was open at the time to make permanent settlements, but instead, they congregated in Muggle Cities like New York. With the main creed of their organization being secrecy, why would they allow them to congregate in /muggle areas?/

I would grant them being this dissimilar to American Muggles if they didn't /live among them./ We literally only see a governmental building, and the American Witches we see in Fantastic Beasts live in a No-Maj apartment. So they literally have less distance between No-Majs, while simultaneously being more concerned about contact with them.

Nothing makes sense! Gah, Rowling why!? All you needed to do was explain it better!

*** “British wizards go around looting other countries without any apparent consequences” is a gross oversimplification. Do you think all archeologists are locals to the area? Do you think special skills are never outsourced. Do you think Bill gets paid solely in ancient artifacts he's discovered while removing curses?

** I usually see this as the basis for when fics do the trope I call 'Overseas Wank'. Harry leaves 'backwater' Britain and the 'below international standards' Hogwarts for the super amazing Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, Uagadou (amazing wandless magic, wow!), Ilvermony (where everything's better than at Hogwarts), etc.

Oh, and everything's falling apart because of Dumbledore hording the knowledge for himself and keeping everyone like dumb sheeple.

I tend to exit those fics if they don't show that Hogwarts and Britain aren't really that bad.

**** I'm pretty sure about that. I just have no clue what OP was trying to say with that. Is it because it has a reputation for incestuous relationships and being racist? Well... in that case there are worse parts and Alabama does not even come close to the racism depicted in the stories.
