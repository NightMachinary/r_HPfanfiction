** Not sure if this is the kind of "pureblood culture" you are looking for but most of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1614796/Ellory][Ellory's]] works fit for sure.

** I've written an AU story, "Patron", where pureblood culture is more distinct compared to muggle culture - quite a lot more fantastical as well. They split from the muggles in 1692, and didn't follow the muggle changes, instead developing differently - more archaic in some ways, far more progressive in other ways compared to muggles. They use magic far more than in canon, and they "went back to our pagan roots" to give christianity the finger, so to speak - although after a thousand years of Christianity, they had to guess more than rediscover pagan religion. They have rituals they do - although most aren't really religious, just like today's Western Europeans.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Linkffn(Perfectly Normal by BrilliantLady) explores a fair bit of this, with strong pagan influences.

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Harry, canonical level child neglect/abuse. Complete. Part 1 of the "Perfectly Normal" series.
