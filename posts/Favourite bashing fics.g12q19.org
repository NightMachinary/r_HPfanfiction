** Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion is one the best known bashing fics, although it is also a crack fic that takes the bashing to ludicrous, albeit funny, extremes.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
