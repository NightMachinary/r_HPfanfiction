  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

**** This j have to agree with. While the NecroHarry trope is mostly unexplored in terms of good fics, this had it all - good character development, a system of magic explained by the current rules, and a very simple yet unyielding goal which made you understand why Harry would be a necromancer. Loved it so much.

  Well... Harry is pissed, his relatives tipped his inner balance, so he snapped and turned dark. Yes, this is a very dark!Harry story. This is also going to be HarryBellatrix. So if you don't like it, don't read it. Contains also some graphic violence.

** The story that immediately comes to mind I want to say is by an author named Silverlocke, followed by a few numbers, can't recall the name of the story itself, though.

Basically, Harry snaps and Ron and Hermione lead an opposing faction. I want to say that their factions were called the Black Tide and the Crimson Shore.

I thought it was good at the time, but keep in mind that its been a very long time since I read it. Probably over a decade ago now, and I know I had lower standards back in the day.

Edit: this was on FFN.

  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".
