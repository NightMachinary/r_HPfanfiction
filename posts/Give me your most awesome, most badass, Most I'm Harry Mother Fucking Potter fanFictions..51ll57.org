I'm looking for a Harry that doesn't cry, doesn't wine, doesn't want to be just Harry. I'm looking for a Harry that embraces his life and fame and takes destiny by the horns and tames it to his will.

** That would fall into the "Power Hungry" Harry category:

*Emperor*, linkffn(5904185): he wanted power before he even entered middle school, and he would do anything to realize his vision. This is the quintessential 'power hungry' Harry fic.

*Blindness*, linkffn(10937871): this super!Harry was not very power hungry, but he would do seriously nasty stuffs in pursuit of knowledge.

*A Black Comedy*, linkffn(3401052): he and Sirius together were enough to out-duel Voldemort, so I would qualify this Harry as super. Not so much after political power, but he and Sirius definitely took no **** from anyone and messed around a lot.

*Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106): Harrymort was awesome, and he revered in his fame.

#+begin_quote
  I, of course, never argued against anything that made me seem more powerful.
#+end_quote

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167): after getting over his whiny canon stage and defeating Voldemort, the establishment betrayed Harry once again. He was joined by Ron, Hermione, and the DA in his quest to overthrow the old regime, by any means necessary.

***** Is it so hard to read the sidebar to get the exact code? Left Bracket, your spoiler, right bracket, left parenthesis, backslash, the word "spoiler" without quotation marks, and right parenthesis. Just like this: [[/spoiler][He gets so OP he raises an army of corpses to fight a creature. The creature took dumbledore's arm.]]

** linkffn(11815818; 11115934) Both are crossovers, SAO and LOTR respectively, both stories update regularly, have a powerful (with reasonable explanation) Harry, though the 1st is a more powerful semisuper!harry. They're also well written, so that's a plus.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

*** My post said nothing about whether he had to work for it or not. I do enjoy the stories that explain how he became powerful. There are some good ones out there involving time travel or dimension hopping where Harry earned his skill and power.

*** You have a point, the trick is mostly showing that arc of gaining power and the consequences therof, and a lot of fanfiction feels like it's written to excitedly get to the finish point where Harry has X powers and is the best wizard evah.
