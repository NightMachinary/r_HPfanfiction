Long fanfics please.

I don't care about bashing, but if you do, I prefer Weasley bashing.

​

Oh, and without 11-year-old Harry who humiliates everyone, and is smarter than Dumbledore, Merlin and Voldemort together. This is too annoying.

​

I've read some famous ones, like, Marauder's Plan

​

/+And bro, if you send me one that I like, I'll be forever grateful to you, because I've been looking for a fanfic like this for a long time!+/

*** Such a great series, though the first one is a little bit rough. Luckily it's also really short, and all of the sequels are much longer.

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right?
