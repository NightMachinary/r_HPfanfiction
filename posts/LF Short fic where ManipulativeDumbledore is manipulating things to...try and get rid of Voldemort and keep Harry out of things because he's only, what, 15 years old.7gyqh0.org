Good!Manipulative!Dumbledore in other words, who actually has a reasonable, logical definition of Greater Good and doesn't do anything horrifying.

To be absolutely precise, I suppose I'm looking for a parody of Manipulative!Dumbledore fics, where when Harry goes discovering evidence that Dumbledore's been taking money from his vaults (issued bonds that he's been responsibly paying back, at worst) and has some nebulous scheme (o noes!), it turns out that all the fanfictions he's been reading are wrong and Dumbledore really is behaving ethically and trying to make Magical Britain a better place for everybody.


** I can't remember anything else about the fic, but there was one where Dumbledore was making monthly withdrawals from Harry's vault. Turns out he was depositing the money right back in because one of the rules of Gringotts in the fic was that if your vault didn't have any activity to a certain amount of time, they started charging you.

** Bit of a spoiler, but in my fic, Dumbledore used Harry's magic to fuel the blood wards, but magic in my verse works like a muscle, so he was really giving him a workout for his magic, because Harry would need every advantage he could get to go up against the guy who had mastered verbal compulsion on a level near the Imperious by the time he was eleven.

He also destroyed the Diary entirely on his own.

  There was no way Lily Potter would let her son anywhere near her sister, so she told Dumbledore about her cousin in America. After Halloween 1981, the Fentons gain another son. Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter or Danny Phantom and related media.
