Like reverse Murphy's Law.

For example, he never encounters a red light when he's crossing the street, he was immediately found and adopted by the most doting family in the world who raised him with love without ever spoiling him when he was dropped off at the Dursleys' doorstep, he wins every coin flip and dice roll, he constantly finds money on the streets, and any time he would possibly get hurt, something intercedes on his behalf, preventing him from experiencing harm, physical, emotional or psychological.

Bonus points if he exploits this luck to his advantage.

Double bonus points if he's completely oblivious to it.


** "Shit" he thought as he dodged the Buldger that had decided that his face was the only viable target in the stadium once again "That was to close" He saw Fred bat it away from him once more.

He spotted the snitch near the rafters and sped away after it with Malfoy hot on his tail. They were speeding over the rafters as he neared the snitch and he saw it make a sharp turn to right to lose pursuit so he slowed down and took his hand off the broom to catch it. As his hand closed around the Snitch he saw the Bludger out of the corner of his eyes. He braced himself for the impact when his luck kicked in.

Malfoy who was too focused on catching up to him /hah/ /no matter how good your broom is, you can't beat me Malfoy/ and could not see the snitch overshot him and put his face right in the path of the bludger. */SMACK/*

Malfoy rolled into him due to the force of the impact and him off his broom. "Shit" he thought as he closed his eyes and braced himself for the fall. But his luck had other things in mind as fell into the waiting arms of Hagrid and all his friends and housemates surrounded and cheered for him. He looked over at Malfoy who was being stepped on as more of his housemates tried to get closer to him and winced in sympathy.

All thoughts about Malfoy left him when the Chasers reached him and pulled him into a group hug. He should have known better than to worry, with his luck nothing could hurt him.

**** It could be a sort of Thetis and Achilles thing, with the Styx being a cauldron of Felix Felicis. Say there's a whole "dArK rItUaL" that gave Achilles his quasi-immortality (and maybe the potion can vary depending on the desired affect). With the liquid being a luck potion instead of the torrid waters of the Underworld, Lily could just go "ah, fuck it!" and yeet Harry into the cauldron without holding his heel because Old Voldy's comin' to town.

** Dumbledore looked at the infant at his feet. Life had been so cruel to him. An orphaned child of prophecy, doomed to spend his childhood fighting a war he could not escape.

Dumbledore had hoped his relatives could raise him right, away from all the game of the wizarding world. Two discrete reports from agents he sent to scout them out had put rest to that idea. Sadly, it was still the best place for the boy. The Dark Lord's forces had suffered a setback, but were not defeated. They maintained a hand at the reins of power, even with the loss of their lord. Baby Harry would find himself coopted into some neferious purpose if he stayed in the wizarding world.

Or dead of a "mysterious" accident.

So Dumbledore, being one of the greatest magicians of his time, did what he had to do. It would be risky, but it just might give the boy a chance.

He had spent the better part of the last six hours raiding all the apothecaries in this hemisphere of all their best potion ingredients. With the chaos of the war and the fall of the Dark Lord (and a few choice spells), it will look like run of the mild looting.

The small fortune lay in a small, bottomless pouch on the doorstop at his feet, next to a sleeping Baby Harry. Harry has not been moved from where he had left him hours earlier, before surreptitiously returning, finally free of the prying eyes of his deputy and groundskeeper.

With a wave of his wand he transformed the pouch into what appeared to be an internal organ. If Dumbledore had been more of an expert on anatomy, he would of recognized it as a cross between a pancreas and a kidney. Without such knowledge, he simply verified it looked like it belonged in the human body before levitating it with his wand.

The organ suddenly shot at baby Harry, disappearing into his abdomen.

It was done. Assuming Harry's body didn't reject it, he now has a magical factory releasing a small amount of Felix Felicis directly into his blood. With any luck (heh), the Felicis would help the infant not reject his new magical component.

Harry was destined for interesting times. All the luck in the world could not give him normalcy. But at least he was heading into it with the best weapons magic could muster.

** I can imagine a few hilarious situations with this odd ability.

-First year: The Troll attempting to knock Harry's head off with it's club, only to have Harry trip over a loose rock and instead of hitting Harry it hits the marble wall causing the wooden club to bounce back straight into the Troll's face.

-Everytime Malfoy tries to sabotage Harry's potion he gets a case of butterfingers and ends up dropping things into his own cauldron.

-Snape keeps trying to catch Harry doing against the rules but everytime he's about to catch him he ends up getting distracted, tripping over his cloak or even having the wind blowing dust into his eyes.

I love this premise now. thanks.

** Harry walked through the halls of Hogwarts, spells flying around him yet not one hitting him. He almost drowned in a bulk batch of Felix felisis when he was a baby. That may explain some of his strange behavior. A streak of green light flew past his head, while the floor collapsed beneath where his feet had been a couple seconds ago. He walked up to the great hall and dodged another killing curse. He wondered whether he could ever be killed. Honestly, after that stunt with the shopping cart in the third year, he didn't think it could really happen.

“Harry, I dare you to go down the astronomy tower in a shopping cart.” Ron said, too tired to really comprehend what he was asking.

“Ok. I'll do it at midnight tonight. That should give you enough time to spread the word.”

“Wait, bro, I wasn't being serious! You could die!”

“Do you honestly think that could happen? I have had about twelve attempts on my life since I started school, and I'm still here, so what could go wrong?”

“Well, you haven't been trying to die all those times, so you might because you tried.”

“I'll take the risk.” Harry said with a laugh. At ten before midnight, Harry Potter and about 50 other students where at the astronomy tower with a muggle trolley, a stopwatch, and a blindfold (courtesy of Fred and George) ready to leave. Harry climbed into the cart, put on the blind fold, and let the two large Slytherin boys pick up the brunette and his container.

“Are you sure you want to do this?” Ron asked, obviously afraid for his friend.

“I'll be fine. Drop it boys!” Harry screamed as the boys dropped his cart off the side of the tower. It felt like the coolest roller-coaster ever made. The drop straight down, the feeling of his bottom coming off of the trolley just a bit, and the pull in the pit of his stomach, just waiting for it to pull up, though he knew it never was. The crash was more than a bit jarring, and he could feel his right leg snap. The entire staff heard his scream before he blacked out.
