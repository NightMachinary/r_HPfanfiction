Hi all, first time posting here and I'm hoping to get some guidance from fellow fanfiction readers. I am looking for a new next-generation or Marauders fic to read and can't seem to fall in love with anything. I was completely spoiled by the Little0Bird stories (I have read Questions and Answers 5 times now) and nothing I've read since is holding a candle to her writing. I'm hoping to get some recommendations from you all. People who have read Little0Bird and found other stories that they love or people who just know some killer next-gen/marauders.

I don't like to stray too far from the cannon and I've never been able to into AU's, but other than that I am all ears.

Also if you haven't read Little0Bird I always recommend her stories (if you can't already tell).


** Would definitely recommend the Its Teatime series by elizablue, canon couples set after CC, focuses mainly on Scorbus but a good balance of next gen and older characters, with good OC's. Also recommend jenorama's fics and FloreatCastellum fic's, both on Ao3 and [[https://ff.net][ff.net]].

Link is for first story in TeaTime
