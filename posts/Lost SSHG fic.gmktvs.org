So I read these stories on AO3 about a month ago and no matter how much I try to find it I can't so if anyone could let me know that would be absolutely amazing. Story one: Hermione is captured and forced into some sexual acts on Snape and a bunch of DEs. Of course Severus is on the light side and after that, Snape takes her back to his home and heals her. I read a lot of these fics so they have blended a together so I won't say anymore about this in case I'm wrong Story two: There's a marriage law put in place and because of what happened in story one Hermione doesn't want to be forced to consummate. Her and Severus make an agreement to marry without a sex life. The ministry finds out, forces them to have sex. The first time they do and after I remember Hermione usually takes top. They start to catch feelings. Anyways, Hermione gets attacked by Pansy Parkinson who takes her to Bellatrix who casts a curse on her to forget her entire marriage with Snape. They work to get it back and along the way discover and establish their relationship. Some oddly specific things I remember about the second one: 1. Snape cries a goddamn lot 2. The marriage thing happens really fast 3. I'm quite sure Draco is on the good side married to Luna, but I remember that the whole group is quite close to Hermione and visit her in Snapes quarters a lot 4. Their closest friends could guess they had feelings for each other right at the marriage 5. The first time they have sex Snape offers to be handcuffed 6. The second is longer than the first story, like 20 something chapter while the first I'm quite sure is 15 7. The wedding pictures play a big role 8. George plays some kind of prank at the wedding and Snape like hexes him 9. I think Christmas is a whole big thing but I might be wrong Anyways if you want more details just lmk, but if anyone could help a poor girl out it would be much appreciated. If you find it I swear to go I will break quarantine to give you a hug.


** Shoot I feel like I've read the second one but I can't remember!!

If I ever do, I'll let you know!
