Hey there, I started writing this fanfic: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4053307/chapters/9120445]]

quite awhile ago and I was wondering if you thought it was worth continuing. Just poking around to see who's interested. It's an experimental fic inspired by one that I hated. Any and all constructive comments are much appreciated.

Cheers.

EDIT: This is a story about Voldemort having a contingency plan. It creates chaos, thousands die, muggleborns are on the run, and those that survive the plan haven't the foggiest on what's going on. It follows Hermione, Harry, and France.


** You should probably include a summary if you want people to give it a go.

** If the second chapter didn't have the same point of view confusion of the first few paragraphs, I'd give it a shot.

*** Didn't realize what you meant until I went back to read it with this thought in mind. I see now. Will edit later (have to leave now).

** The tags "Mental Institution/Breakdown/Instability" and the line "Harry woke up" make me think Harry is waking up in the loony bin. Is that where you're going with it? Honestly, I'm not really interested in those stories. They seem popular though, so I'm sure you'll have readers.

*** It's not where he wakes up but he will get there. It's not the main focus anyway, this is about what happens when the magical world goes berserk.

Thanks for your input.

** Would the fic it's based off of be /The Hogwarts Strike Team/?

#+begin_quote
  An older and more experienced Harry and Hermione return to their first year at Hogwarts. Their goals? Assassinate Death Eaters, destroy Horcruxes, and deal with Voldemort's hidden contingency plan... by any means necessary. And maybe they'll fix a few other things along the way.

***** Heheh, mine was based off of a different contingency plan type fic. This one took place in a mental facility and was a Drarry fic, I felt that it did not cover the repercussions adequately.
