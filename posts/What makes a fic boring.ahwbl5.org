I read one story where the premise was really interesting (can't remember if it was adding an unique OC or something like that), however I got up to about book three in their retelling of basically what was what Rowling wrote and nothing had changed.

Yes, this is very aggravating. There are some fics that are very well written, characterizations, early plot setups, world building, all look great. But then their authors inexplicably tried to railroad the plot back to canon rails. My biggest gripe is a repeat of CoS:

- A 13 years solved the plot in an entry level creature book whereas the entire staff was basically running like headless roosters. It's really one of the worst manifestations of the “useless adults” trope in children's literature.
- Petrifications in Basilisk attacks are actually the exception. You need tons and tons of luck to have 6 petrifications instead of someone getting killed.
- Dumbledore knew Hagrid was innocent, and he should know where Myrtle was. Why didn't he ask her a few questions during the 50 years in between? The CoS plot would be instantly solved if Myrtle just answered how she died. I personally think it's another case of “useless adults” or “stupid characters” tropes.
- JKR had a habit of dragging the plot until the end of the school year. Fic writers are under no obligation to do that.
- Basilisks were extremely dangerous creatures. Just imagine how many would have died if that thing had gotten into the Great Hall during a Feast! Since Hogwarts was Magical Britain's ONLY school, the damage of that attack to its future could be worse compared to London hit by a megaton range nuke. If Dumbledore really cared about his students and was not a dumbed down plot device, he should identify Myrtle's killer as a Basilisk long time ago and take drastic steps immediately after the first attack.
- Basilisks had one huge Achilles heels: roosters. I expect Dumbledore to seed the entire Castle with roosters after the first attack, if he figured out the truth of Myrtle's death.

**** This was and remains the biggest roadblock that is preventing me from starting to work on a fanfic idea I had around Halloween about 2-3 years ago.

Essentially, my basic idea was that Harry, Ron, and Hermione are sorted into different Houses, instead of all ending up lumped into The Default Good Guy House(Gryffindor). The reason I wanted to do this was to try to flesh out some of the other houses more, and particularly to eliminate the "Gryffindor = Good, Slytherin = Bad" that so thoroughly pervades the first few books.

But I could never figure out how to take that and construct a story around it that didn't end up just rehashing the books anyway, so I shelved the project. It comes back to nibble on my brain every time I watch one of the movies or read one of the books, but I can never get over this obstacle.

** Premises aren't inherently boring. It's the execution that matters.

I don't mind if Harry finds out he's inherited the Black lordship. It's Harry reading his Gringotts goblin blood test and seeing that Dumbledore installed a "block" on his magical core and repressed his creature inheritance, then going on emancipation rampage that follows the same plot as every other Indie Harry fic that makes a fic boring.

Tropes are story-telling tools, but if a story is nothing but a string of tropes, it will never be a compelling narrative... and that is what makes a story uninteresting.

One tool that I've found useful is the Personality, Bond, Ideal, Flaw system from Dungeons and Dragons 5e. In a few short sentences, you go from a name to a dynamic character.

Another tool is the "How do they know them, what do they want from the other character, and why can't they have that?" system from [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wES5ufXETdE][DramaSystem, as described here]].

** Endless strings of chapters which add nothing to the story.

I read a fic once in which more than 50% of all chapters consisted of nothing but everyday activities such as eating, sleeping and going to classes. I don't mind scenes with everyday activities, but if the general plot suffers from them (or worse, if there is no plot), I will stop reading. I really like the class scenes in the books because they are fun, usually help develop the characters and often become relevant later in the story. I would love more fics which cover everyday life in Hogwarts in an interesting and magical way.

*** That sounds like the fanfic equivalent of a webcam livestream.

What the HP book do RIGHT is how classroom/homework scenes aren't included unless they are directly relevant to the plot of the story, to establish important information or introduce characters, like setting up Snape as an antagonistic red herring in Book 1 or Lupin's boggart lesson hinting at his wolfiness.

A lot of HP fanfics fall into the habit of copying the book scenes without using it as plot set up. They do it just because the books do it, and it's basically filler. I skim through every time Snape's "brew glory, stopper death" speech that is copied word for word.

For example: I don't actually mind the premise of a 'Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-whatever' story in theory, but they often end up boring because suddenly Harry has all the money in the world, his magic is 'unblocked' or he has 'family magic' or sth /and the antagonist stays at the same level as in canon (or is weaker!)/

** For me, it's lack of agency.

If in a time travel fic they “can't disrupt the timeline” then the fic is pointless.

Same with marriage law fics (with a few notable exceptions) - why tf would they bow to the will of a corrupt ministry?

Also most veela/creature/mate fics, same innate reason. “You HAVE to marry him or he will die!” is a common thread there. Correct summarized answer: “So am I a slave? Does my happiness mean nothing? K. Peace out, magical world. See ya.”

Any time you take decisions or ability to make said decisions out of the hands of your characters and place them in someone else's I become less interested in the fic. Doubly or triply so if you make it some handwave bullsh reason like most of the above.

The best HP fics are the ones where he can make his own choices, for good AND for bad, and then suffers the consequences, again good or bad, of those decisions.

Just had a plot bunny thinking about this. Hogwarts without an automatic Sorting for first years. You have to earn your way into a house by your actions by the end of the first year, and you will be invited to join. No Hat present. The traits of the houses remain the same - so Hufflepuff still “will take the lot” of people who don't earn/work their way into another house.

*** Concerning your first point, I thought I agreed until I read a story where Daphne Greengrass worked at the DOM (how she got the job was not part of the story), and Hermione (some other but relevant ministry position) got into a bit of a threeway fight with Pansy and her, a spell richocheted off of a time turner she was working with, or something like that, and the three of them got thrown back to their Hogwarts years. The timeline was disturbed and unstabilized, and it kept throwing them forward and back uncontrollably. Their best hope to stay alive was to remember not to disrupt the timeline further, which meant they had to try and recreate every innate conversation they had, word for word, while simultaneously working on a ritual to right the timeline - the end result of which could even be that they got deleted entirely so the universe could continue to exist.

The story's opening scene was the three of them drunkenly hooking up, though, so there's a lot of interpersonal drama going on. The time travel fiasco, though, is interesting.

Your last idea with the sorting is brilliant, I'd read the heck out of that, though.

** Too much description of inconsequential things. Describing a ritual in detail is fine - that's probably important to the plot. Describing every single item the new Lord Harry bought in Diagon Alley is tedious.

And while sometimes I might need to know how someone is dressed (disguising themselves, important meeting, etc.), don't bog it down. "Dressed muggle in a jumper and jeans", but I don't need to know the jumper is blue and they're dark skinny jeans.

** Lack of progress for the good guys. If the plot's first half can be summed up as "things get worse", I get turned off - that's fine for the start of the plot or arc, but not when it keeps going. I want to see improvements. I don't expect Harry to beat Voldemort in his first year, but I don't want to see him suffer and struggle just to keep things from getting worse for most of the story. Have the good guys win on the way. Solve smaller problems. Make things better.

Another thing that turns me off is the "Harry getting a lightsaber means Voldemort is getting a Death Star" plot. If Harry gets an advantage - new ally, new power, whatever - I loathe it if the next scene shows Voldemort receiving even more help, or something that counters everything Harry received. Show me how the changes affect things, don't neutralise them right away. If whatever advantage Harry gets is too strong, then reduce the advantage before handing it out. In canon, Harry only won through luck and plot railroading anyway, so the bad guys really don't need a boost.

In the case of Harry Potter fanfiction, giving Harry something special usually balances things out a bit, given that Voldemort was always so much more powerful. But plenty of authors give Harry some power that removes tension, feels cheap, and ultimately ends with Harry curbstomping most foes.

Which is where the advice is usually given.

When is this advice ever given when Harry gains a small advantage? Probably never. No one is going around throwing that line at people because they gave Harry a powerful wand, or made him decent with fanon Ancient Runes, or gave him an expanded trunk, etc.

It's said in regard to the stories which have Harry wipe the floor with Voldemort because he was given a super magical core, or an unblockable spell that destroys all his Horcruxes instantly, or whatever.

I especially hate secret relationship or secret friendship trope where it's obvious the author made them secret just to avoid dealing with any changes to the plot.

What is even the point of asking "What if?..." if you aren't going to actually explore the changes? It just makes for a boring and frustrating fic.

I also find a lot of 150k+ fics boring even though a lot of people love them. It really tries my patience when 15k worth of words do not progress the plot or develop the characters in any way. So many times I felt that a fic would be so much better if the author just edited out half of it.

** There needs to be a point to the story. Each chapter must enhance the story. If a chapter isn't plot based, it's filler must include essential character development. Otherwise it seems like the author is just using old tropes and just winging it.

Execution matter more than premise. Dialogue must be realistic, otherwise it's unreadable.

There can be something such as too much detail. I don't care what a character wears unless it's a special occasion or if it really matters. Shopping trips don't need to be described in detail unless something completely unique happens.

The main character must have a conflict or struggle. Otherwise it's not a story, it's just meandering drabbles. It's not realistic for someone to get their way every time. The bad guys must be believably competent.

If there is a class happening at Hogwarts, either the author should introduce a new magical concept, or have an event that affects the dynamic considerably. Going over concepts covered in canon is a waste of my time.

Slice of life can be done well if I care enough about most of the characters.

Have a set of events that occur from one POV and then switching to a different POV to show another character's reactions is pointless. I don't need to read the same thing twice. One POV is enough to see the reactions of everyone else.

Boring stories are reliably predictable. It's good to have some mystery and suspense and hanging threads. Not everything needs to be resolved immediately.

** This is more of a general gripe I have with fanfiction, but when a fandom gets to a point where certain tropes are done in nearly every fanfic with next to no change between writers, that's when I start to get bored.

People get so mired down in headcanons and fanon and the temptation to write the exact same scenario they've read a thousand times before that they just end up adding to an evergrowing pile of generic fanfics instead of trying to give it their own personal spins, and it gets boring.

I don't want to read characters reacting in the exact same way, in the exact same setting, with nearly identical lines of dialogue. I want to see them do something new with either canon or whatever premise the writer has chosen.

Also, over-dramatization/Flanderization of characters is sure to get me backspacing. I'm also kind of bored with 'secret sibling' OC fics... /coughcoughLookingAtYouJKRcoughcough/

** Over explanation of inconsequential characters and introductions. I once read this one where Harry starts a company and goes through the entire hiring process for each of his initial 12 employees. Each character, who were not important to the plot at all, were given like a full page of information about them in the most dry and tedious way possible.

"This character is 25 years old, the graduated from this school with a degree in x. They like long walks on the beach. They worked as an x for several years before now."

Also, when authors introduce characters from canon in a similar way. They'll give a description of a character's personality with a paragraph when they popup. It's like they've never heard of the word "exposition" before.

** Subject matter and writing style. As someone above mentioned, boring is subjective. My personal preference is canon compliant stories that make the world more "adult" (themes and behavior, not necessarily rated M). Therefore, I will happily read an aimless plot if the writer is talented because I read for quality and analysis over plot.

However, most fanfiction writers don't have that level of skill. So, in the average fic, subject matter is key. Does this fiction have characters or situations I want to see expanded? I'd read about my favorites doing just about anything if the setting or time period is right, and would skip over the most highly recommend fic in the world if it focused on characters I don't find compelling.

** When the bad guys are supposed to be grown adults and somehow a group of 15 year olds are kicking their asses with stunners. Basically any story where the good guys always win, they never truly suffer, nothing bad happens except for to the bad guys. When nothing new happens in a story. I once read a story that I don't remember much of that ahas a focus on podmore sirius Harry and mulciber for instance. I've only read the one story like that and it was rarely boring. One other thing is when there's no challenge to gain skills. I think it was in the more important than any broomstick fic that I read it where Harry and Hermione spent a week mastering non verbal magic then a week mastering wandless magic. At like 14-15.

*** Your problem lies less with good guys always winning, but mostly with ridiculous power progression of teenagers.

The core problem though, still lies with canon as most adult good guys are basically useless or even counterproductive. The supposedly super powerful and wise Dumbledore is reduced to a plot device that only sorts out the aftermath. Some fanfic writers obviously overcompensated to the other extreme.

There's also need for feel good curbstomps from time to time.

Not that there are no suspensions of disbelief, but when there are abundant plot holes and continuity errors - I've even seen things as blatant as someone saying "X is impossible" in chapter 1, then someone does X later on, and no one even seems to care or notice.

*** Well, isn't JKR a repeat offender in this regard?

Examples:

- Fidelius charm: Potters can't be their own secret keeper, but Weasleys suddenly can.
- Trace: Tom Riddle can bypass it using his uncle's wand and commit murder, while Harry can't do anything to just his own life.
- Unbreakable Vow: why is Voldemort not using it on every one of his Death Eaters? Why not the Order, or the Ministry?
- Veritaserum: why don't Death Eaters have some ready in DH? Hardly anyone is an Occlumens in canon, and memory charms will make confessions equally useless. If Bellatrix has some on hand, the Trio will be totally fucked, but that can't obviously happen because of plot reasons! Weak.
- CC fucking around with established canon facts, such as Time Turner
- CoG might be fucking around with established canon facts, although final jury is still out. But Aurelius Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall in 1927 don't sound promising.

**** I never said she wasn't - especially with anything remotely related to numbers.

That said, each of those points are either widely separated in word-count (so they are not quite in one's mind), or they are at least explainable by any of numerous fantheories.

- someone might have improved the charm in the intervening years
- the Trace not being on the wand is only a WoG and JKR's WoGs are notoriously contradictory
- the Vow could have some limitation (e.g. on the number that can be maintained at once, or there is some cost to having made many that Voldie deems not worthwhile)
- Veritaserum might be hard enough to make or store that Snape hasn't had time to make some, or they've already used up their stock questioning people trying to find the Trio
- memory charms can be broken (Canonically, Bertha Jorkins)
- There might be tons of Occlumens running around and not telling anyone - none of the POV characters would be able to tell...
- CC is canon over my dead body
- CoG... at this point, FB is either retconning (preconning?) or is AU

JKR avoids this pitfall primarily by being vague - she thereby leaves a lot of room for fantheories to fill in the holes.

You don't have something like in book 1, every source saying, including an in-story happening confirming, X, and everyone knows X, and then later on, not-X happening in full view of everyone, and no one, no even the narration, takes note that not-X happened.

** Boring is subjective anyway. I have been told my writing is boring but I don't think it is, lol. Mainly what makes any story boring is a lack of conflict and tension (or taking a vast amount of words to get to it) and that seems to be quite common in fanfiction. I think though that quite a lot of fanfic readers really don't want conflict and tension. They want to feel safe.

** Not necessarily boring but I don't prefer stories with many time gaps. I want to know what the characters are going through and how they are changing in those times, not just randomly jump forward to a changed character. I feel like new writers do this when they are intimidated by writing a linear story, they think oh this will be perfect I'll just jump forward in time it will be poetic. But really it just turns me off. I want to read a story not a series of events.

** Putting things in that are extraneous to the plot, or don't advance the plot in meaningful ways. If it's just there to show off the author, leave it out. I keep a database of stories I've read or plan to read. Two that I won't read again have comments that indicate that the authors spent too much exposition on /exactly/ how they would reorganize classes at Hogwarts, or on showing off their command of Tolkien's elvish language.

I don't mind a smattering of another language, but delimiting French or goblin or what-have-you using italics or some other means is less jarring.

** I've noticed that what often /kills/ stories - in that it almost always end in them being abandoned - is when the natural logical progression of the story hands someone basically unlimited power, to the point where said someone can basically end every plotline by sneezing.

For example, to use a non-HP example, there was a fic I read where the main character started off being able to slowly modify their body - and 'learn' from other's powers to to that better.

The fic died right after the protagonist realized they could use their power to bud and make clones of themselves, and become both virtually unkillable and capable of exponential growth, which rendered all remaining canon story arcs moot (the entire remainder would have boiled down to "go grey goo then eat the Big Bad")

Such cases are hard to write one's way out of.
