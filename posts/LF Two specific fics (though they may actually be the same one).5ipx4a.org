Fic one has Harry opening a small school. I know it was near a beach/ocean and I think if was mainly for muggleborn/half bloods but I could be wrong. I know people came to inspect the school and one tried to attack a student and either slammed them against the wall or (I think this is actually what happened) gets slammed against the wall.

Second, Molly Weasley tries to attack either Hermione or one of her parents and I think shot by Hermione's father and tries to have them arrested for assault on a pureblood or something. Thank you!

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.
