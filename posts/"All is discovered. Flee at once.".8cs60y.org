Inspired by the couple of prompts [[/u/PixelKind][u/PixelKind]] did, here's one of my own.

~ahem~

  “I once sent a dozen of my friends a telegram saying 'flee at once - all is discovered.' They all left town immediately.” -Mark Twain
#+end_quote

Write a short scene where this happens to (your preference) the Slytherins at Hogwarts, the Hogwarts staff, the Ministry of Magic, the Order of the Phoenix, or the Death Eaters.

(Or, you know, any group that's funny; Chudley Cannons, Gryffindors, the Dursleys, the Forbidden Forest centaurs...)

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section
   :END:
*REQUIREMENTS:*

- Joke-length scene, anywhere from 50 (short and sweet) to a thousand (what are you doing, starting a new story?) words.

- There must be some reaction (fleeing, taking hostages, turning themselves in and confessing, etc) from at least one character.

*BONUS POINTS FOR:*

- A mass exodus of people with guilty consciences, up and beyond those who got letters (not just the Dursleys but their entire neighbourhood flee?).

- Some terrible crime being exposed or horrific incident prevented by the prank (Mr Crouch flees and leaves his son to be discovered?).

- Some highly embarrassing truth being revealed (Goyle has a perverse fetish for dragonhide boots?).

- Someone/something /completely unexpected/ does a runner (the house-elves of Hogwarts abscond, Azkaban prison itself sprouts chicken legs and swims away...?).


** "Oh come on, Harry, it'll never work."

Harry turned to Hermione as he was tying the latest, ever-so-slightly-personalised letter to Lucius Malfoy to an owl's leg in the Owl Office in Hogsmeade, "There's always the tiny chance that it will. Besides, I'm only out 4 galleons if nothing happens."

"Don't let Ron hear you say that, he's still moping a bit about the DA fake galleons..." Hermione muttered.

--------------

Lucius Malfoy frowned; who would be sending priority owl post to him? At least he could be sure it was free of any curses, the seal on the bird's other leg proved it was from a qualified owl office and they were fastidious about refusing to take cursed letters...unless the seal was faked...

After waving his wand in a few detection patterns just to make doubly sure, he carefully removed the letter and opened it.

His eyes widened. His legs wobbled. His forehead began to sweat. The handwriting wasn't familiar, nor was there any signature, but...

/You've been exposed. Escape Britain immediately./

Lucius darted up the stairs of his manor, "Narcissa!" he shouted.

--------------

The next morning, Draco Malfoy's usual seat at the Slytherin table was empty.

...Actually, quite a few seats at the Slytherin table were empty. Some were missing from the other houses too. Dolores Umbridge had vanished from the staff table along with, strangely, Filius Flitwick.

"Harry!" Hermione hissed across the Gryffindor table as the Great Hall murmured curiously about the vacancies, "Just /how/ many of those letters did you send?"

"I forgot!" Harry whispered back, "I lost track after the first three hundred!"

** It was chaos, born of a calm breakfast.

Breakfast wasn't meant to be calm. Breakfast was meant to be chaos. But....as Daily Prophets failed to arrive, letters never showed, and Draco Malfoy waited for his care package, people began to panic. Where was the mail? Had something happened?

By the end of the day, the Wizarding World had descended into out right chaos.

It wasn't just Hogwarts.

It wasn't even limited to Magical Britain.

Or the Magical World.

All over the world, no matter how primitive, or how intricately engineered, cages were empty. Nests not abandoned, but gone as though never having existed - even feathers, used as lining in other bird nests, disappeared.

Owls had left the realm, taking with them every bit of physical evidence that they had ever been there.

Of course, no one ever figured out it was due to a poorly trained young raven who mistakenly took a warning meant for "Mundungus Fletcher" to an owl named "Mundungus Fetching", sent by a dyslexic associate of Mr Fletcher the human.

** It was meant to be a joke. A bit of fun, to try get a rise out of a friend. I mean, she wasn't a close friend, but she was still a friend. Well. Acquaintance, really. It's hard to have friendships with other houses, and really, what's the point? Our own House is already 'like a family', and who needs more family? Not the Weasleys. So yeah, I know my classmates by first name, nod to them in the halls, chat here and there. It's not like my parents and grandparents days, where all the Houses were wary of each other. Then, it was perfectly normal for Hufflepuff to turn on a student, for Slytherin to be ostracized, for Ravenclaw to be ignored. These days, the Houses are pretty friendly to each other.

And then, I send off this note. "All is discovered - initiate Plan Omega ASAP."

The next day - well, the entire House had disappeared. I heard they STILL hadn't broken into the sealed common room - though the Map verifies that none of them are on school grounds. Uncle Harry confiscated it, of course. Can't really argue though, I want to find my cousin, too. I'm just thankful Weasleys mostly go to Gryffindor - apparently, all alumni have disappeared. That means someone who used to belong to a House, according to Aunt Hermione. Gran must be going spare - apparently the family clock has stopped working, but at least there's only one grandchild missing out of the entire lot of us.

You wouldn't think it though - honestly, it's the last House you'd expect to have a secret, let alone a Plan Omega level one. I wonder what would have happened if I said Plan Hinkypuff or something. Plan Niffler - ha, that'd probably be worse! Everyone suspects the Hufflepuffs - Slytherin is too obvious, these days, and Gryffindor can't hide a thing, but Hufflepuff are so nice that they scream "it's a cover! We're evil!".

No one looks at a Ravenclaw.

**** Oops. Probably should have spent a but more time on it. Basically, a next-gen Weasley, probably Fred or Roxie, sent the note as a joke to a Ravenclaw mate. Turns out Ravenclaw have a secret ongoing plot/research/experiment that probably breaks the laws of magic, as well as lots of other laws as well, and that they had an ultimate escape plan titled Omega. Omega basically is a total shut down of all things Ravenclaw, which includes the Tower.

It's a play on the fact that Slytherins generally always do have some secret agenda, and that the Hufflepuffs are often used in parody fics as being a secret cult, or communists, or undercover badasses, but no one looks at Ravenclaw. They're just solitary nerds. So I thought they'd be the least obvious House, and tried to write it so that it came as a surprise twist at the end. With Albus Severus in Slytherin, Teddy and conceivably others in Hufflepuff, you might assume the missing cousin, Hugo, is one of them.

** "Hey, Fred 'n George, you know how Patronus messages are a thing?"

"Yeah...?"

"Well, I just heard about this Muggle prank that I think we could adapt..."

*===[LATER]===*

Dumbledore was pondering the meaning of Life, Paperwork, and Lemon Drops, when an ethereal stag burst into the room. Expecting a message for himself, the Headmaster was shocked when the Patronus turned to portrait of Phineas Nigellus and spoke in a low, deep voice.

"/Flee at once: all is discovered./"

The portrait blinked confusedly as muffled cursing came from his frame. "What-"

He was cut off when his frame swung outwards, revealing a moderately sized space behind it. An overgrown ferret clutching a bulging sack leapt outwards and scampered for the window. "FUCK SHIT BITCH DAMMIT HOW THE SHIT DID THEY FIND OUT FUCK SHIT DAMMIT SHIT" The animal slipped the sack over its shoulder and jumped out the window, still cursing.

Dumbledore's lemon drop fell out of his mouth as he turned to the other portraits in the room. "Did... did any of you know there was a Jarvey that lived there?"

The Hogwarts Heads of ages past shook their heads silently, still bewildered. Dumbledore nodded pensively before looking at the yellow candy dissolving on the desk. "I don't /think/ these are the spiked ones?"

** K, totally doing this. Harry & Co send a message to all the professors to get Snape to leave Hogwarts. All the other professors flee except for Snape, because why not.

Have the first 770 words written, need to finish. Will probably be about 2-3K in the end, so a bit over your limit, but whatever :P Will try to post it tomorrow
