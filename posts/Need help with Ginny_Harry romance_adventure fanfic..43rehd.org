Hello guys! I'm looking for Ginny/Harry, romance and adventure fanfic. It should be canon (I mean pairings and events during the war, though some people may be alive). I've read like everything what little0bird wrote and recently I finished "Backward with purpose".

I pretty much want the continuation of events from the books.

- Dumbledore/Snape/Sirius can be alive.

- Harry and Ginny ought to be in love in each other. I don't want some breakthroughs when one breaks out with other etc.

- It would be awesome if action happened right after the battle of hogwarts.

- It can be in alternate universe, only if Harry and Ginny do something together and they are rather young, not 40-50 years old.

- I don't want Harry to be weak in duels etc. I mean he defeated Voldemort, and in some other fanfictions he is losing duels with some other firstly met wizards lol. That doesn't have sense.

Please help me guys xD


** I recommend anything by sbmcneil (pottermum2008 on SIYE) and Brennus.

** I'm a big Ginny fan, and she ranks with Hermione as my top HP characters. Harry/Ginny postwar smut stories is one my favorite fanfic themes:

*In Case of Emergency*, linkffn(4625848), has a pretty decent plot.

*Polyjuice, Memory Charms, and More*, linkffn(4291790), contains sex scenes in which Harry and Ginny used polyjuice to take each other's form. It's written by the author of 'Backward with Purpose'.

*It's Complicated*, linkffn(11567591), has BDSM scenes.

*Dealing With Demons And Prats*, linkffn(7448513), is actually quite dark as it deals with torture under Carrows' regime.

Then there is *Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650), written by Brennus. The author promised lots of sex and violence, and so far I've seen plenty of sex. The writing, characterization, and plot are pretty good.

  When Harry and Ginny broke up, they thought they were each doing what was right for the other But is it possible for them to be "just friends", especially when it seems like someone keeps trying to kill them? Mature sexual themes.

  Everyone deals with stress and loss differently. Ginny prefers sex with Harry. The fact that her brothers do the same with their partners doesn't mean they approve, however. Harry/Ginny with mentions of other pairings. M for a reason.

  It started with a surprising proposals from an unexpected source, but that was only the beginning. Soon, Harry finds himself dealing with forces beyond his imagination and dreams, and ultimately finds that the world is not what he believed it to be.

*** Woah! Thanks for the reply. I'm totally gonna read "Abraxas" and "Polyjuice, Memory Charms, and More". The other ones doesn't really appeal to me.
