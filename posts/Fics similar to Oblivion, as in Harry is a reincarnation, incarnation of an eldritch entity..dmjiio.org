As the title says. Recc any fics that have Harry as not only Harry Potter but also something else... something... greater.

Any mythology or idea will do. God, God-Emperor, Archangel, Devil, Demon, Cthulhu, Flying Spaghetti Monster, Thor etc. etc.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** Harry is unwittingly the godlike personification of Death in most of The Carnivorous Muffin's stories. Each fic tends to explore the existential implications for Harry, Tom Riddle, and humanity in general. The main fics:

** Well you reminded me of that fiction where Harry was the embodiment of Christ and Delphi was the embodiment of feminists and freedom and it got really really weird. I really needed to get that one off my chest. Thanks for listening.

  He's not the Boy-Who-Lived. He's not the Chosen One. He's not even a hero. Quite the opposite in fact. He's a being of such terrible greatness that at one point, those who were hated as devils and worshiped as deities, saw fit to seal him away. Now he's back and he wants his throne. Let Order reign...

** Oh! I have one! Its called 'Be The Death Of Me' hweianime.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5936137][Heres the link]]

Summary: Or how Death lost Harry Potter's soul, had a small mental break and took a vacation. A vacation as the Boy Who Lived. Because irony.

Published:2016-02-07 Updated:2019-09-27 Words:455300 Chapters:42/?

Actual summary: So, the major forces of the universe are personified as entities, and the entity,, fate? I believe? Asked Death to spare Harry Potter because she has Plans for him, but the reaper in charge of that messed up and put Harry's soul into the cycle again. So Death decides 'fuck it' and lives out the life of Harry Potter. There's some really interesting takes, such as dementors being basically Harry!Deaths children, and everyone freaking out. I know one thing is that all living creatures are attracted to Death, but non human beings, like centaurs, spiders, and goblins, are able to feel it more, and are aware of what Harry Is (the fic explains it pretty well). So basically Harry is constantly getting jumped by rando animals. There's even a Malfoy peacock that can be summoned by Harry unbuttoning his shirt. Its great.

Features a pretty neutral Harry, and its SnapeXHarry. Its also overall just very sexual. Good grammar and plot though. So.
