:END:
In all honesty, I'm not entirely sure that I didn't simply imagine this story. My google skills hath failed me.

Okay, so - I think it might've been a time-travel fic, though I'm not certain about that, but what I remember was Harry threatening the Order into 'removing' Fudge (while they were in the medical bay) and they go through some trickery to get him out before Harry's threatened deadline and report back to Harry, apparently worrying that he was going to try kill the man, but Harry gives the usual Indy!Harry type speech about using his fame and resources properly with a mix of Fudge is inappropriate for a war minister commentary. If memory serves, it's over a year old.


** Sadly I don't know what story it is, but I can at least tell you that you did not imagine it. I read it too. Or at least i read a story where Harry travels back in time and gives the Order an ultimatum to remove Fudge.

Damn, now I have to know what fic this was... Will let you know if I find out.

  The war is over. Voldemort won. The light's last hope is a desperate ploy, concocted by an insane genius, that probably won't work anyway. Now Harry must find a way to win a war he's already lost once before.
