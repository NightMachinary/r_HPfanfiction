I have read many fics where authors go on rants or just state their opinion. One of them being how Harry and Ginny never really had a "spark" between them and how it doesn't make sense that Harry would like Ginny. So I am wondering if there are things that are in the books that would give explanations for the rants of the authors.

P.S. Most of the fanfics I have read weren't bashing or badly written fics.


** The movies are very simplified and streamlined; there's a lot of characters and plot threads that plain don't make it from the page to the screen.

Some characters have been altered and given a lot less depth -- Ginny is one of them; while she's a minor character for the first four books, starting with book five she really steps up as a character. While I wouldn't say she's THAT deeply-explored in the books, she does get a lot more development than she does in the movie.

Another thing the movies do is pretty much botch Ron and Hermione. In the books the two are a lot more complex and nuanced characters, their separate goals and desires coming across more clearly.

The movies have a tendency to remove Hermione's flaws, while enhancing Ron's flaws -- which not only makes both of them shallower and less interesting, but also tends to alter the character dynamic. The movies aren't about Harry, Ron and Hermione; they're about Harry and Hermione, and this doofus named Ron whom they sometimes let tag along.

** Read the Books (especially OOTP) and you will understand how badly Ginny got bashed by the movie screenwriter Steve Kloves.

*** In reference to Order of the Phoenix, Michael Goldenberg wrote its screenplay. Anyway, I believe I read in an interview somewhere that Steve Kloves believed (especially in the beginning) that Harry and Hermione would end up together, and even championed the pairing after Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows was released. I'm not sure if this is 100% accurate but whatever was put to screen by either Kloves or Goldenberg was passed by JK Rowling, so she obviously didn't have much of a problem of how badly Ginny got bashed in the movies. Then again, she didn't give much character development to her in the books so that argument may not carry much weight, if any.

**** Maybe those Hollywood types presented her with a detailed market analysis that showed if the main two movie characters received the greatest emphasis, the NPV (Net Present Value) of the project would increase by 77% in their proprietary DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) analysis.

This of course meant JKR would make additional XX millions Pounds per Movie, based on the ~$930 million global box office for the first one.

For hundreds millions of Pounds, she should have no problem sacrificing a few of her characters.

***** Perhaps. But the first film made $974.7 million at the global box office ($317.5 million in North America + $657.2 million overseas). It was actually the second-highest grossing film ever on a worldwide basis at the time, not adjusted for inflation, only behind Titanic's mammoth $1.8 billion record. Fun fact: Outside of the United States, Japan was Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone biggest market from a box office perspective.

***** Maybe they wanted to do something akin to D&D with Game of Thrones, where they diverge from the given plot at some point and write their own ending. To be honest, you do not need to rewrite a lot of scenes for a Harmony endgame so maybe the writers hoped that they were allowed to do their own thing.

** Hm...I know Ron had a few of his scenes removed or given to Hermione.

For example, in the Shrieking Shack during Book 3, Ron is the one who tells Sirius that "If you want Harry, you'll have to go through me". The film gave that line to Hermione.

*** Re-reading it I see that it is. But what I mean is that most of the bashing fanfics tends to have quite a few grammatical errors and generally write either the Weasley's as bad people or write Ginny as some useless character. The fics I read weren't like that but well written and when I say "rants or state their opinion" I mean that they write an A/N giving their thoughts on Harry/Ginny or why they chose the pairing they did because they think it doesn't really make sense have Harry/GInny.

** Well, the books portray Ginny a bit better than the movies as they show /some/ interactions between her and Harry, and those do show that they are potentially compatible as a couple, but ultimately she does not have a lot of screen (or script) time and a lot of her character development takes place completely off-screen (or off-line).

The thing with the people ranting is that, contrary to how it is in real life when a lot of character development of our own love interests happens “off-screen” (for us anyway) and compatibility is or at least should be a real concern, in media it's generally accepted that no matter the personality differences and whatever other stuff that may divide them, if the hero and a character of the opposite sex (or gender, I suppose, let's not limit ourselves here) interact a lot then they very much can be a couple and often end up as one.

Combine these two and it's /very/ easy for people to reject Ginny as a viable love interest for Harry.

** Are you asking if the books go deeper into the Harry/Ginny relationship?

*** Pretty much yes; considering that most rants or A/N tends to be about Harry/Ginny relationship.
