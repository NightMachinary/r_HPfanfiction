So I was reading linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) and there was a little moment with Katie that made me really want some good, fluffy, decent length Harry/Katie fics. I've not really read many so all recommendations are welcome. Thanks guys!

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

**** Yeah, I think it was one of the first "novel fics" I ever read.

It's a trilogy- I remember the second one being especially good.

***** One of the first novel fics I read was by, then munkeymaniac, now James.spookie, it's the lion tamer series it's Harry/Daphne Greengrass so I don't know if you're into that, but it's a really good trilogy.

*** I took a quick look at this story, are you sure this is Harry/Katie? I think the first one is Harry/Hermione and the next two might be Harry/Ginny.

**** Yep. It's been forever, but as I recall he hooks up with Hermione briefly, and then seriously dates Katie for a while, and then eventually ends up with Ginny.

*** Sounds interesting. I can see Tom being Harry's friend/mentor/ghost stalker as being very entertaining. Thanks for the recommendation.
