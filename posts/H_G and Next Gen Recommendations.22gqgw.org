** I rec my own fic shamelessly. Harry Potter and the Bonds of Time Saga. One complete fic, 91 chapters, and a sequel with 60+ so far. And a third story will come.

It is a Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione fic, and Harry and Ginny have a Soul-Bond, and Time Travel to the past. Mostly Harry/Ginny centric.

Also link to my profile. All of my stories are H/G and R/Hr. Except for the Next-Gen fics Ickle Firsties, (but I didn't get very far in it.) and very old fan-fic of mine, Family Affair is Next-Gen, but not canon, since it was written before DH.

** Check out my [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4642049/][list of favorites on fanfiction.net]]. You could try my story, but there's only three chapters so far.

On the favorites, from the top, Ignite, Thicker than Blood, Backwards with Purpose, HP and the Nightmares of Futures Past, Compliments, The Magic Word is Sorry Not Please, Getting it Right, and Lessons Learned are all either H/G or Next Gen. Backwards with Purpose and the Magic Word is Sorry... are my favorites out of those.
