I'm curious. I wonder if this idea has been explored


** Spoiler alert, obviously...

This is set in the correct time period and Harry does indeed face off with Grindelwald. I dont remember how exactly the battles end, but this is a solid read. linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies]])

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

Albus Dumbledore was too late. Someone else managed to defeat Gellert, leaving chaos and too many questions behind. Tom Riddle, who recently graduated from Hogwarts, was fully committed to become the greatest Dark Lord of all time, chasing immortality and surpassing Grindelwald's legacy. It's too bad that Unspeakable Harry Potter had something to say about that. HP/TR. Time travel

*** Not really, he defeated him and send him to prison. Regardless, I think the gist of the question is easy to understand.
