** Only one that I have read is Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon linkffn(2857962). It is a crossover with Firefly. I had never even heard of Firefly until reading this and could keep up just fine. It's also quite fun. I'm currently reading Harry Potter: Geth by mjimeyg linkffn(10784770). Never played Mass Effect games and therefore I've had to Google some things every now and then. Otherwise it's very entertaining and well written enough for me.

*** You should def watch Firefly then. It makes the story a lot more funny imo, because the author was great about getting their personalities, and the fact that Mal and Jane mellow a lot over series/movie/years. There's also that chapter with Jane's statue.

** I quite like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6832255][Harry Potter and the Avatar's Return]]. Also [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719529][Ninja Wizard: The Adventures of Harry Potter, Dimensional Traveler]].\\
Both of these are crossovers with Avatar:The Last Airbender. Ninja Wizard has some Naruto in he first book but I wasn't sure if you meant Naruto as in none or Naruto as in you've seen it so I included it anyway.

Crossover with Avengers (and a Supernatural) I feel like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/586020][All Hallows Eve]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/212879][Misunderstandings 'Verse]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8410168/1/Steve-And-The-Barkeep][Steve and the Barkeep]]. The last one I'm not 100% sure how much Avengers knowledge would be needed. The first time I read it I only vaguely knew Captain America and hadn't seen the first Avenger movie but I enjoyed it.

** linkffn(Something Wicked this way comes; Swords and Sorcery:No Route Back; Slowly and then All at once Again; By Courage and Love; Mystic Knight Online) The Eragon ones are fairly close to Eragon Canon, so its like reading the books with Helena(femHarry) thrown into the mix. Both start similar, but diverge in the 5 first chapters, mostly because they have complete different personalities.

The Fate UBW is quite easy to follow, there isn't anything waahh, so there's that.

The SAO one is the same reasoning as the Eragon ones.

The Disgaea one is just Harry summons a demon. I've never heard of the game before reading this and just finished it today, without issues.

** You can check out my RPF HP Crossover if you'd like!

It's complete, but not fully posted yet. I'm putting up about 2 chapter a week. It would definitely make my day if you wanted to give it a go.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13125917/1/Trading-Places][Trading Places]]

When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard as he learns to separate the magical fantasy world he's always known from its dark reality. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, Dan's happy days at Hogwarts are certainly numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. But what can Dan do, in Harry's place? And how high will the cost be... to switch them back?

​

Also, I've been reading this HP/Daria Crossover, which I'm enjoying quite a bit. It has a fun writing style. I haven't seen more than 1-2 episodes of Daria and know basically nothing about it, but this story makes perfect sense to me. It's a WIP.

What if Minerva McGonagall successfully persuaded Albus Dumbledore not to place baby Harry Potter with the Dursleys, but instead place him with another of Lily Evans Potter's blood relatives: Helen Barksdale Morgendorffer? What would happen as she tries to place the Boy Who Lived with a young family in 1981 Austin, Texas?
