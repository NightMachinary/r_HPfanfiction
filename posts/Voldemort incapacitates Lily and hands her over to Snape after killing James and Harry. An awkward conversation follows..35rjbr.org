** Tag. Neville's it. Lily immediately realizes this and, despite her world falling apart around her, knows she needs to warn the Order.

The rest of the prompt is sort of the boring part. Snape is canonically a good guy, so he'd try to get her to Dumbledore while explaining he's a spy. She's out of her mind with grief, hates Snape, and thinks he's literally the worst. He agrees. Ooo, sad. The end.

Sounds like a good lead-in to a rather straight-forward Neville-is-the-boy-who-lived story, just with a grieving Lily and (likely) a dead Snape. He explains why he's rescuing her, she learns he heard the prophecy that lead to her husband and son's death and kills Snape for betraying them. Maybe by her own hand, maybe by insisting he's tried for being a Death Eater (which means life in Azkaban).

Would be funny, actually, replacing Snape with Lily in the story. Voldemort drops Lily off with Snape then goes to kill Neville immediately after Harry (as was the plan). Lily warns Dumbledore, but the Order arrives too late. Lily kills Snape while Dumbledore is away.

Dumbledore takes Neville to be raised by his canonically crazy, abusive, and likely blood supremacist (though probably not Death Eater) uncle and, one would assume, aunt. Can't be his canon grandmother, because she's his father's blood relative, not his mother's, and that's how the blood protection Dumbledore uses works in canon. If getting thrown out a window is preferable to being a squib, we can safely say at least some of Neville's relatives aren't great people, but I don't see them directly supporting Voldemort like the Blacks.

Back at Hogwarts, Dumbledore discovers Lily murdered Snape in a moment of mindless fury. He makes her agree to be Hogwarts' potions master in return for covering it up. Lily hates Neville for slightly irrational reasons when he shows up at Hogwarts ten years later, mirroring the Snape and Harry situation. Neville has been trained his entire childhood to be the best, as well as suffering under the pressure of being the boy who lived. He thinks he has to be the best at literally everything, and is shocked and angered to find an uppity little mud- err, Muggle-born beating him in almost all his classes. Lily won't stop killing Defense teachers, and no one believes Neville when he says she's going to kill him too.

Could be good stuff. Yeah, I might do a oneshot on this. A slightly racist and stuck-up Neville growing increasingly* afraid of his Head of House Lily, and her just coldly murdering people right in front of him.

*** I really like the idea of Lily chainsawing her way through DADA professors. Though I think that would simply be the one's Neville might observe. I suspect there would also be a large number of 'unsolved' homicides where Death Eaters just keel over or vanish. Much like that fic... Reunion? The one where a bunch of Peggy Sues go vigilante and Harry is angry at Neville for kill stealing Snape... only accomplished with potions and blood magic.

A vindictive Lily on a rampage would be... terrifyingly hysterical, or just plain terrifying depending on the tone of the fic.

*** I would love to read a novel length story of this. Now that you've outlined it I also really want to write one, but I would much rather read it.

Lily killing the Defence teachers is fantastic. "But Professor Dumbledore, I *saw her* kill Professor Lockhart!" "Run along to bed now Neville, it's getting very late." "And she killed Mad-Eye Moody." "Ah, well, young minds are so imaginative..." "And Umbridge." "...A tragic accident, of course..."

*** I get the feeling you're not being totally serious anyway, so feel free to ignore this, but either Neville's dad or mom could have protected Neville the way Harry was protected by Lily in the books - it doesn't have to be the mother. The only reason Lily's death saved Harry rather than James' was because Voldemort had meant to keep her alive at Snape's request, but she wouldn't get out of the way, and Voldemort got annoyed.

So if someone was able to convince Voldemort not to kill Neville's dad, and Neville's dad stood in the way, the protection would have saved Neville in the same way.

**** I see what you're saying, but magic in Potterverse is symbolic. A mother's love and sacrifice works there, a father's doesn't so much. You're also adding in an extra complication with someone having to convince Voldemort.

It was Voldemort deciding he didn't need to kill Lily and offering her the choice to step aside that did it, not Snape asking him to spare her. I can see Voldemort giving Neville's mom one chance after stunning Lily for Snape, just because the symmetry amused him and she was a pure-blood.

***** I'm not sure if the ages work out, but there was a fic I read a while ago where Frank and Bellatrix (pre-crazy) were involved, and then... I don't recall what happened but Frank ended up with Alice and Bellatrix embraced the Black madness. Bellatrix wouldn't want them spared exactly, but may have asked Tom to bring her back a new toy...

***** I disagree with this, but I think it's up to interpretation and however we feel like reading the book. However, I will say the idea of a mother's love being more important than a father's does not sit right with me, and I do not think that's something that JKR would write into her books.

****** Never said more important. Just not suitable for passively protecting her son and his home after her death. That's the symbolic nature of the sacrifice, a witch's curse against Voldemort ever being able to touch Harry and a blessing on his home to keep him safe.

A father's sacrifice, and a wizard's curse on Voldemort or blessing on his son in a western tradition, would more suitably involve traditionally male tasks, such as being a provider and active protector. The focus wouldn't be on hearth and kin.

I'd see that being something like visions of danger, inspiration in magical item crafting and use, and skill with active protection charms to fight against evil, like is hinted at with Harry's patronus mirroring his father's animagus form.

Nothing says someone couldn't make a story in any way they like, but those are the themes in play in canon.

***** That's not canon.

From book 7, after Harry 'sacrificed himself':

#+begin_quote
  "You won't be killing anyone else tonight," said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other's eyes, green into red. "You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people - "

  "But you did not"

  " - I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?"
#+end_quote

It's nothing to do with her being his mother, that's just her motivation for the act. It's the sacrificing yourself for others while having the clear option not to.

And the only reason Voldemort offered Lily that choice was because of Snape, he's not the kind that cares about people that stand in his way generally.

****** And that sounds like much more of a male version of the sacrifice effect--instead of Voldemort being unable to touch him or his family, Harry's fellow combatants were protected from Voldemort's immediate threat of violence. Lily's protection didn't work anything like that. It is clearly something totally different.

(I'm not even going to get into how illogical it is that magic should work that way. Like Lily was the only mother in recorded history to ever passively offer her life in exchange for her child's, or Harry--sort of--for his comrades in arms. Bah.)

It wasn't Harry, Petunia's family, and their home being protected through a blood relationship, which is how Dumbledore said Lily's protection worked. It was a group of individuals whose only connection to Harry was that they fought on the same side as him. A lot more people than with Lily's protection, too.

Again, I never said a wizard's sacrifice was less or ineffectual, just that it was /different/, and it wouldn't make sense to just have the exact same effect from it. If anything, that quoted text confirms JKR understood and used those gendered symbolic differences in choosing her magical themes.

Completely unprovable. Voldemort being a relentless psycho, mass murdering everyone who crosses him, isn't shown at all in canon. And Lily didn't even try to fight back, at all. Sparing her could have been because of her oddly passive resistance, or it could have only occurred to him at all that night because of Snape, but it isn't shown that otherwise he murders everyone who stands against him. Rather the opposite.

He takes the Ministry and Hogwarts and his long-time political foes still live, and their children continue to attend school with minimal (non-academic) repercussions. Even Neville Longbottom and Ginny Weasley. Even McGonagall, who fought him directly in the last war. In fact, the Weasleys only went into hiding when they thought their helping Harry was about to be exposed and used against /him/, not immediately after the fall of the Ministry or even because they feared being executed if caught. It was really only Muggle-born who were being harassed on a large scale, and that was lead by a non-Death Eater, Umbridge.

Voldemort went after the Potters not because they were next on his list, but because of the prophecy. Otherwise, there is no indication he was interested in breaking into their homes and killing them or those like them. That wasn't what he did when he regained power a second time, either.

All the Voldemort cackling insanely, blood in the streets, torturing and murdering for sport stuff is pure fanon.
