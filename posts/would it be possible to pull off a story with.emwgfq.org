a Boggart as the main villain?

​

Its an idea im toying with......is the concept just too out there or silly to take seriously as far as I can tell its never been done before so I dont have anything to compare it to


** What if a wizards worst fear was a boggart that didn't respond to "riddikulus"?

** The boggart would have to be a lot more dangerous than canon boggarts. Most wizards and witches can easily defeat a boggart in canon, so it wouldn't be much of a villain.

**** Boggarts just come into existence in dark places with magic similar to Dementors. You would need a place fear to create a really powerful Boggart. But you could also consider mixing the boggart with something more lethal. What if through a spell a boggart accidentally mixed with a lethifold. These creatures actively go out and attack and can only be warded off by a Patronus

******* The idea is that the Paitent,William greatest fear is his mother. She abused him for most of his life and over the years came to believe that she was a demonic entity and not a real human. He grew up to become a police officer and became the target of particularly depraved serial killer......... in his deeply disturbed state.....he starts to believe the killer is an angel sent by god to save him

so his solution to finally be rid of his abuser was to go onto a press conference and goad the killer into killing her for him. but then when that happens he becomes catatonic because of the guilt.

So the Boggart absorbs the full force of his delusion and over a year comes to believe it is his mother. His greatest fear is that she would find a way to return so it doesn't act against him for ten years because it is “healing” from the damage that was inflicted upon it.

It feeds on the trauma of the patients over the years to rebuild its strength and occasionally when the right person comes along nudges them to do something very bad (because that's what demons do)

.........and can only be killed by the same weapon that killed her before........wielded by the same person

It's meant to be a freak of nature..........its not just fear its absorbed a man's psychosis so its built itself around that.

The idea is it's the power of belief............A regular Boggart will scan your mind and take on your darkest fear BUT always knows that it IS still a Boggart. This one believes it is an ancient evil disguised as a woman.....so why would shouting a silly word at it do anything?

​

I do plan on its main helper being Greg Goyle who was preety unhinged at age 17 at nthe age of 37 hes in the hospital for a reason and so it comes to him in the form of Crabbe and convinces him to help

** It could. It worked for Pratchett, though he called them Bogeymen instead of Boggarts.

A momentary disclaimer on my part though - I once ran a D&D campaign where the main villain was a sentient tentacle monster living in an underground Greek Bath that ran a crime syndicate across an entire coastal nation of fantasy cities. So take my advice on villains with a grain of salt. :D

The game turned out great though. :)

*** Well my idea is that the Boggart lives in the basement of a mental hospital designed to bridge the gap between muggles and wizards and has been feeding on the fear of one the muggle patients. His fear is his abusive mother. She was a serial killer. He killed her when he found her out

However it feeds on him for so long it truly comes believe that is her returned life and has taken on her personality. It uses Greg Goyle to kill people for it..... while playing mind games with the aurors and muggle police

**** Yeah. That could work really well. I'd make sure to keep in mind what kind of serial killer you're wanting the Boggart to be and write with that in mind. It's the main failing I've seen with thriller-genre fanfics, having the villain feel too scattered and inconsistent. In published fiction, the best villains all seem to be the one's that are really consistent and clear in who they are, what they do, and how they're killing. If they change, they're always given a reason to change (authorities closing in, inability to get the old resources of murder, etc). That could be really fun to play around with, a consistent killer who changes constantly as it meets new people with new fears.

***** Her whole thing is that she went after children......she would kidnap them and they would never be found. The press dubbed her the Pied Piper.

And then she would confess to her son and make him forgive her and absolve her of her sins.....he is her confessor.

So what she does is she uses Greg Goyle to after Hermione and take her children away and then let them be found with a message. She wants her son to come and help them on the case (he's a policeman in the NYPD ......so they bring him from New York and they are trying to conduct an investigation without tipping him off that they are magical........pretending they are muggle police

It takes on the form of Voldemort so people will see him and it can feed on the fear but it's primairy is

****** Well, firstly, if he was her confessor but killed her when he found out about her murders, she'd either not be prolific enough to have a name in the media or only start confessing to him later on in her spree. I'd maybe make it that she was close to being found out or something to motivate her to finally tell him and try get him to forgive her. Then police burst in after he kills her and that's why he goes to a mental hospital rather than jail. Sympathy insanity plea.

I... can't really tell whose son your NYPD policeman is, but it might be better to make him a detective since NYPD beat cops wouldn't really do much investigating. They're more door-kickers and takers of statements, to my understanding. Could you try explain everything after 'he is her confessor' in your post in a little more detail, please? 'cause right now it sounds like the boggart's son is both a mental hospital inpatient and an NYPD policeman and I don't think that's what you're trying to say.

******* Sure it's hard to explain in a post

Right basically the idea I'm working on will provide the main plot of the third part of a three part series.

In the second part we are introduced to a young catatonic man that is an NYPD police officer. He's not the main story but is more of a side plot to the main story. It's eventually revealed what his mother was

Then in part 3 which is set ten years later. He has risen to the rank of detective so when the Boggart starts committing murders it mimics the MO of killers he helped capture over the years to bring him back to England.

So he finds himself working alongside Ron Weasley who is the Auror on the case.

Her confessor angle is that when she takes the kids.....sometimes killing the parents she leaves behind messages for the police usually extracts from the Fable of the pied Piper of Hamlin.

But no one knows who she really so he confesses to her son......she can't tell anyone or she will be caught so she makes him listen to her reel off her crimes

******** Ah, okay right. Thank you, that makes things a lot clearer. It's a 'drawn back into old stomping grounds with a villain focusing on personal manipulations of the investigator' kind of a thriller.

Well in that case, yes, I think that'd work quite well once you clear things up and simplify it a little. It might help to write out a list of the main characters and their motivations (ie. what do they want?) and the main sequence of events that lead to whatever happens in the first chapter (ie. the boggart impersonates the serial killer mother, the comatose police officer goes back to NYC and works up the ranks, the boggart somehow gets Goyle involved and starts killing, people notice, Hermione's kids get taken and a message asks for the NYC detective to return). The way you write it makes your plot seem a little convoluted, so simplifying will help. At the very least, it'd let you ask for advice on this subreddit a little more easily. :)

It also might help to work out the Boggart's motivations a bit more. You say it wants the NYPD son to come to England to work on its case, so why does it want that? It mimicking the MOs of past people he caught would make it more likely to get caught so it has to have a reason not to take the self-preservation path. Is it trying to get caught after a chase so the son will forgive it, for example? What's the goal there? Even crazed lunatics have a goal that makes sense to them.

Other than that, and to answer your original question, yes. This could really work. Just prepare to get comments on how this wouldn't be possible with canon interpretations of Boggarts. I'd enjoy your take, but some people in this fandom really don't like new views on things sometimes.

********* Thanks so much for your help. It's hard to summarise what is essentially two stories. The second story in the series does the leg work of explaining the woman to an extent. Through exposition .....the third story goes more into it and just how she operates

It's just difficult explaining it all concisely.......it does make more sense in the actual story.

As for what she wants...... revenge. She wants to break him basically to show her superiority.

Also why wouldn't people like it? I thought Boggarts could sometimes take on a specific form and stay in that form permanently

Immune to riddikkulus spell also

I thought of ”what would be a living thing fear so usual the boggart wouldn't need to change” and came up with a loved one dying as the answer

There is also if the fear in the form is so great the person passes out, then boggart turns to dementor and sucks out soul
