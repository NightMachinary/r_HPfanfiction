** I've been searching around for good HP/PJO crossovers forever, and the prognosis isn't great. Even though it's the highest number of crossovers available for HP on FF.net, there just aren't very many quality ones.

The only good ones tend to feature fem!Harry, like linkffn(Godling Ascending), or anything by Engineer4Ever

  Response to DZ2's 'Harry, the Twice-Blessed Half-blood' challenge. Fem!Harry. Herakles Potter knew she was odd. Exactly how odd turned out to be far odder than she originally thought.

** Beauty on the Battlefield linkffn(11874253) is really good even though it seems like its abandoned at this point :/

War Song is a great one-shot linkffn(11276146)

But yeah, most of them are either really cheesy or just not well written :(

  A Twice-Blessed demigoddess is born, and she's got a lot of work to do. Operating under multiple prophecies and fighting two wars, Helen Potter rises to the challenge with enough time left over to destroy her enemies and fall in love. Of course, nothing less could be expected from the Daughter of Ares and Aphrodite. Fem!Harry.

***** On the off chance, you're serious. No it's not like Goosebumps. Percy Jackson is another series of fantasy Young Adult novels. Mainly it's that Greek Gods still exist into modern day and their offspring, demi-gods, sort of all train at Camp Half blood. You might have seen that they made a couple films a few years ago, they had Alexandra Daddario in em.
