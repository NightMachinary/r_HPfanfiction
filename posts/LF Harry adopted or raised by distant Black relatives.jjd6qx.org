I can't remember much, I started it and thought I saved it but haven't been able to find it again. It's some distant Blacks, I think they are squibs but know about the wizarding worlds. If I remember right Vernon Dursley like gets a job opportunity and they come over for dinner. They meet Harry and know who he is and know Sirius is his godfather and they some how get custody of Harry. I think threaten or blackmail.
