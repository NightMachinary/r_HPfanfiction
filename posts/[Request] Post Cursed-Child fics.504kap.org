  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

** linkffn(12089286) has been re-written to include Cursed Child elements. When the follow-ups come out (The writer had written 5-6 before and then pulled them), they might have more.

  Part One of Seven. Draco Malfoy: ex-Death Eater, former bigot, widower and single father. His children worship the Weasleys who clash with the decor, something is rotten at Hogwarts, and he doesn't really know what he's doing. But maybe he's getting the hang of it.

** u/Taure:
#+begin_quote
  pick up from after the end of Cursed Child

  Albus/Scorpius would be great
#+end_quote

Given that Cursed Child ended with Scorpius asking Rose out, and fairly firmly established Albus' interest in women (and older women at that), I can't help but feel that these are rather inconsistent.

*** I think the whole script is inconsistent in this respect. It turned it round at the end to make the two boys firmly heterosexual, but even for me (and I have no interest next-gen stories or in Scorbus or Scorose or any other pairing of that kind), there is massively more chemistry between the two boys than anyone else.

It has been accused of queerbaiting and I can see why.

*** Just write a fluffy romance fic with both Scorbus and Scorose. Maybe Albus is also interested in Hermione, as he couldn't get over those passionate kisses at the Ministry?

** Check out picascribit on AO3--they've hopped on the Scorbus train lately, and have been writing consistently SUPER good fics for a while now.
