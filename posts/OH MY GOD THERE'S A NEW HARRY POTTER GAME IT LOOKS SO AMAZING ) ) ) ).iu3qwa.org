******* Yeah it's a lot cheaper than the Series X, but it's digital only, and a little less powerful. My understanding is that the only major power difference will be it can only go up to 1440p, whereas the X will have true 4k.

Still an amazing deal if you don't care about 4k and want a next-gen console for cheap.

Q: What is J.K. Rowling's involvement with the game? Is this a new story from J.K. Rowling?\\
A: J.K. Rowling was not involved in the creation of the game, however, her extraordinary body of writing is the foundation of all projects in the Wizarding World. This is not a new story from J.K. Rowling.

Q: How does Hogwarts Legacy fit into the Harry Potter Wizarding World?\\
A: While Portkey Games are not direct adaptations of the books and films, the games are firmly rooted in the Harry Potter universe. While remaining true to J.K. Rowling's original work, Portkey game developers chart new territory by creating fresh ways for fans to immerse themselves in the wizarding world.

Q: Is Hogwarts Legacy an original story?\\
A: Hogwarts Legacy is an open-world, single-player, action role-playing videogame (RPG) set in the 1800s wizarding world. The story has players experiencing life as a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry like never before, as they live the unwritten and embark on a dangerous journey to uncover a hidden truth of the wizarding world.

Q: What is the original story of Hogwarts Legacy?\\
A: Players will experience life as a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1800s as they embark on a dangerous journey to uncover a hidden truth of the wizarding world. They will grow their magical abilities by mastering spells, brewing potions and taming fantastic beasts.

Q: How do you play Hogwarts Legacy?\\
A: Hogwarts Legacy is filled with immersive magic, putting players at the centre of their adventure to become the witch or wizard they choose to be. They will grow their character's abilities as they master powerful spells, hone combat skills and select companions to help them face off against deadly enemies. Players will also encounter missions and scenarios that will challenge their morality and determine what they stand for.

Q: Can players choose and switch their Hogwarts house in Hogwarts Legacy?\\
A: Players can choose their Hogwarts house at the start of Hogwarts Legacy. We'll have more details to share at a later time.

Q: Will you see Harry Potter, Hermione Granger or Ron Weasley in the game?\\

Q: Will Hogwarts Legacy adhere to Wizarding World lore?\\
A: Yes. While Hogwarts Legacy is not a direct adaptation of the books and films, the games are anchored in Wizarding World lore. Avalanche is creating a unique gaming experience that is inspired by J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World, in which players will find new and unexpected locations, characters and story elements.

Q: Does the game take place only in Hogwarts Castle?\\
A: Hogwarts Legacy takes players beyond Hogwarts to new and familiar locations including the Forbidden Forest and Hogsmeade Village.

Q: What is Portkey Games?\\
A: Portkey Games, from Warner Bros. Games, is the games label dedicated to creating new Wizarding World mobile and videogame experiences that place the player at the centre of their own adventure, inspired by J.K. Rowling's original stories. Portkey Games offers players the opportunity to make their own narrative choices and engage with the Wizarding World setting to discover new and unique experiences. The label was created to bring gamers and fans new gaming experiences that allow them to delve into the Wizarding World in immersive ways where they can create their own magical stories.

Q: What does Portkey mean, and why have you chosen it for this label?\\
A: In the Harry Potter series, a Portkey is an object, enchanted to instantly transport anyone touching it to a specific location. Most of the time, a Portkey is an everyday object that would not draw the attention of a Muggle. For Portkey Games, it symbolizes how games under this label will transport fans to their own adventures inspired by the Wizarding World.

Q: What type of games will be developed under Portkey Games?\\
A: Portkey Games will enable developers to create a variety of new and immersive gaming experiences that are all inspired by J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World. These experiences have not been written by J.K. Rowling and will not be direct adaptations of the books or films. These are games that have been created for the fans, by game-makers who themselves are fans of and have been inspired by the Wizarding World.

Q: Are Portkey Games created with J.K. Rowling's approval?\\
A: Each experience offered under Portkey Games will take place in the Wizarding World and will be authentic to the Wizarding World. J.K. Rowling is supportive of Portkey Games and has entrusted the design and creation of the games to WB Games and the developers involved.

i hope that houses actually matter, that it's more than cosmetics and dialogue ad-libs but actually relevant to your character's behavior, different narrative beats and how teachers and other students approach your character. that's probably a bit much, maybe they can have that in the inevitable sequel ;)

** My hangups are on the spell mechanics. It's not going to be fun for me if it's like it was in previous video games where you cast spells at someone that do HP damage and you can press a key to shield yourself. I want a stunning spell to stun something; I want impedimenta to stop something; I want to be able to block, hex-deflect, shield, and move objects in the way of spells.

The issue with that is that it would be a bitch to balance. The only real way to do it would be to have some mechanic to make learning and casting spells skill/progression based. But that might ruin the fun of the game itself.

Edit: The game studio's previous games do not inspire me with confidence either.

Edit 2: one day, when I become a billionaire (so in a dream world), I shall fund a vr game where you cast with wand motions and incantations.
