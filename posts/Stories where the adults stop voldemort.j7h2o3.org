Adults as in not Harry's gen Marauders gen or older but like as adults. They are out of school maybe it takes place during Harry's time in hogwarts but he's not very involved. Either the prophecy doesbt exist, or is wrong, or its a weird interpertation, or it does exist but Harry has to do like the bare minimum the least amount of work.

Maybe like a au where more of the marauders generation live. Im partial to focus on Sirius but really anything goes

no oc x major character

no dramione

no anyone of harrys gen x anyone of marauders gen

no bellatrix x anyone

no incest

no sirius x marlene ( ideally)

no sex swap

apart from that anything goes


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/][Petrification Proliferation]] are two great examples.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]] also works.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], James and Lily stopped Voldemort the first time with a nasty trap and some luck. All good Marauders survived. The second fight against Voldemort picks up after 2010, when Harry is well into his adulthood and a warlord himself.

They stopped Voldemort during the first war in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4269983/1/][Anything but Slytherin]], but...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]] has Grindelwald leading the fight against Voldemort and minions. Harry and his friends tagged along, and profited greatly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]] is basically Voldemort vs Voldemort. Kids just played along and had no clue about what was going on.

The Ministry did most of Horcrux Hunt in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/][The Accidental Bond]]. Harry and his girls have also gotten great support from the Grangers, the Delacours, and Sirius.

Gilderoy Lockhart is the most important person in stopping Voldemort and saving Sirius in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/][When in Doubt, Obliviate]].

** linkao3(The Ghost of Privet Drive by AndrewWolfe) describes itself as a story "in which an actual functioning adult is turned loose in an adults-are-useless world." Voldemort's actual defeat is still a sequel or two away, but the responsible adult is definitely not the type to let the kids get involved if he can help it.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter.

**** Not “wrong” and certainly not “with him”. I have absolutely no idea how he is as a person, but he and RobSt are two most extreme (and most popular) cases of all what's wrong with Harmony stories: not much development of their relationship (usually none at all), and these relationships are not very well written (because they are so perfect together, and they so well fit together, and did I mention how much their relationship is flawless? ... /SNORING/) and they are two biggest bashers of both Dumbledore and Weasleys, they are perhaps even authors of the trope; in “Thank You Ms Bones by old-crow” linkffn(3230439) old-crow probably reached a peak of the Ron Weasley bashing when he gleefully announced that his death by starvation in hands of Death Eaters was all his fault anyway, because

  If he'd ever bothered to learn anything from his brothers, rather than his endless obsession with chess, he would have picked the lock the first night that he was there and escaped. Instead he sat there playing with his pieces as he slowly starved to death.

  Things didn't entirely get swept aside after the conclusion of the TWT. Dumbledore doesn't get his way. Riddle or Fudge won't either. Some OCs have large roles.
