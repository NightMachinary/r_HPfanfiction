So, I enjoy reading fics from the perspective of characters in Slytherin. Either canon or noncanon Slytherins (Harry, Draco, Pansy, Hermione, OCs, whoever).

What I don't enjoy is fics where the focus is mostly on teenagers who for some reason are hyper fixated on politics and traditions and other rigid traditional social crud. Like I get that it's the house of pureblood snobs or whatever, but also these are teenagers not 110 year old cult leaders. I feel like a lot of them just wouldn't have patience for that crap with the amount of homework and other stuff they need to get done.

Does anyone have any good fic recommendations? Like I don't mind if there's a little bit of that, but I keep running across fics where these social rituals just totally consume the storyline and it's not what I want to read.


** That would be quite funny. Malfoy turns up all "I am the Youngest Lord! Bow down to me!" and the collective response of Slytherin House is just "What? Are you kidding me? Fuck that, I have Transfiguration in the morning and I still have no idea what the spell for 'Quokka to Aardvark' even is!"

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

  Harry Potter spent his eleventh birthday in a cabin on a tiny rock in the middle of the sea, listening to his cousin snore on the couch.When a knock sounded on the wind-swept, rain-drenched door, it was not a giant fist (or a half-giant's fist). It was a short sharp rap that sounded once, twice, three times before Minerva McGonagall simply charmed the lock open and stepped inside. "Apologies," Minerva said crisply, as Vernon raced out brandishing his rifle and Petunia pulled Dudley up off the couch and behind her. "I wasn't sure you could hear me over the weather.‚Äù The rain fell down behind the professor in a roar. She was perfectly dry.Minerva fished in her pocket without looking, because the only things allowed in her pockets were only ever exactly what she needed. ‚ÄúI've come to deliver this," she said, pulling out a letter and handing it to Harry, who was cross-legged on the floor, "because our owl post seems to have been unable to get through.‚Äù‚ÄúAnd I've come to deliver this," she added, pulling out a second letter, "because Hogwarts by-laws require a professor to hand-deliver acceptance letters to Muggleborn families for their explanation and comfort."

  Severus remembered dying---that last hopeless look into Lily green eyes. Now he's back in the past, inexplicably in the infant body of Harry Potter. Oh, and there's something wrong with Dudley. Weirdness ensues. A different time travel fix-it. Likely the oddest Severitus you'll ever read. Inspired by Path of Decision---I See the Moon---Athey's Rebirth. Betad by Eider Down. Complete.

** [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][the changeling]] is one of my top 3 favorite fics. I think it might push the edge on what you're looking for, but it doesn't have any weird Lord Peverell Potter or whatever (I avoid those so hard I'm not even knowledgeable enough about the tropes to properly mock them). It is complete with several completed sequels.

This is a oneshot, but just lovely. In [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/4330836][the heir of something or other]], Harry is sorted into Slytherin.... and it's miserable. Excerpt from the summary:

#+begin_quote
  This was not wishing Harry an easy path. This was not wishing the boy a warm House. This was Harry, three weeks in, sleep deprived and considering running away and going back to Privet Drive. This was Harry in the back of Potions class, blank-faced under Snape's disdain the way he'd perfected under the Dursleys's torments.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/19312162/chapters/45935500][The Devil You Know]] is, imo, hilarious. It is very much a dark comedy. Harry kinda dies at the beginning and the horcrux in his head wakes up and gives him.... I hesitate to say guidance. Let's call it direction. There's no bashing. The sequel is a WIP that is updated regularly.

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?
