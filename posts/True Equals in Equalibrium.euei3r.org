I'd like to see more fics where Harry and Voldemort are true equals, but in every sense of the word and Fate is fully willing to cut a bitch to make that equality happen. If one of the Order dies in a raid, Voldemort gets a sudden burst of anger and kills one of his Death Eaters the next day. If Voldemort steals a fortune, Harry wins the Lottery. If Harry gets a romance-partner, Voldemort finally indulges Bellatrix's weird fetish for him. And so on and so on.


** That sounds like really depressing. By that logic everyone in the order would either die or end in prison and Harry would also die at the end of the story.

*** Your thinking too literal in what happens to everybody else. It refers to Harry and Tom eing equal in everything, that doesn't mean if they lose a follower it is in the same way. Maybe Bellatrix is killed and Lucius goes to prison, to keep balance Tonks falls pregnant and Remus takes her away from the war to raise a family.

You could also keep balance by only changing one side of the equation. Voldemort loses the vampires as allies but gains the giants. Harry loses Grimamauld place as an HQ but the ministry acknowledges the war and joins the fight.

It would also make an interesting story because the only way the war could be won is with incredible strategy and cunning because both sides are perfectly matched. No final duel to the death but instead a well thought and exicuted plan to get the upperhand where no advantage exists.

In the spirit of keeping everything equal, when Voldemort is defeated or dies he would then have no followers-when the war is won nobody sees a reason to listen to Harry and he leads nobody because there is nothing to lead them to. Voldemort is forced out of his home into the realm of death or the after life-Harry is forced out of his home by the press that refused to let him live a quiet life. Voldemort is sentenced to an eternity of suffering in the after life-Harry lives for ever as an immortal and suffers endlessly as he watches all those he loved move on. Voldemort seeked immorality but recieved a death at the normal age of 85. Harry wanted a normal life but recieved immortality.

You just meed to be creative with how it is balanced and focus only on Harry and Voldemorts relationship as equals. As long as they are loss for loss and gain for gain they are always equal. Could be a very interesting story that I sadly can not write due to lack of skill.

**** Exactly. Equal, not identical. If it was a video game, their metaphorical 'organisation strength' bars would always be at the same level or adjusted to be as such.

It'd fit the themes of strategy and sacrifice in the story too, appeasing the 'Ron is a master strategist' types, the 'Machiavellian but well-meaning Dumbledore' peeps, the 'I want Voldemort to be an actual threat' lot too. The ultimate chess game. :)

***** You could also actually have both or one of them figure out how the prophecy is effecting them. Say Harry brings someone into his ranks that is a hindrance to everything he does but keeps them controlled. That would mean Voldemort also gains something that is constantly disruptive and he may have more trouble working around it. Using the prophecy to influence the other side by changing your own could add an entire new level of strategy to the story.

****** That could be fun. It'd take work to keep it away from 'For The Greater Good!Dumbledore', but yeah. Actively playing with the balance would be hella interesting.

**** I agree but that isn't what OP seemed to be asking for in his prompt he was extremely literal.
