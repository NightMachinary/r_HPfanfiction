Pretty much just anything. I want a smart tom riddle, who looks at 1st year Harry and sees a child (i.e. no threat). Or like a past Tom Riddle looking at crazy Voldemort and just being like fuck this guy and offs Voldemort by himself. It doesn't necessarily have to be Tom centric but if the fic features a sane, calculating Tom Riddle/Voldemort that would be cool. I want a Harry who looks at Tom Riddle and realizes he is never going to win, not unless he takes some seriously drastic steps and like 30 years of training. No preference on pairings be it gen, het, or slash.


** Carpe Noctem (not quite sure how to insert a link) is a WIP but I personally find it really good, the premise is that when Voldemort dies at the battle of Hogwarts he wakes up in 1943, in the body of his 16 year old self and rid of his insanity (he's still a murder happy psychopath but he's not a raving lunatic anymore). The conversations between Tom and Albus are really well written and also interesting.

The fic does use the headcanon that making Horcruxes drove Tom insane. It also makes a point to establish or at least strongly imply that even when Voldemort 'regains' his sanity as it were, by traveling back to right before he finished completing his first horcrux, he's ultimately only as sane as his 16 year old self was, which considering said young Tom Riddle decided to make multiple horcruxes in the first place, is likely not very, but much more compared to the Voldemort we know.

** I really enjoyed "Black Coat" by Hermione Prime (not sure how to put a link). It's a light read and about the only time travel fic that I enjoyed. It features a charming/charismatic and surprisingly well written Tom Riddle who has more of a frenemy relation with Harry (nothing romantic). They travel back to the future and Tom is disgusted when he learns what became of him.

** If you like character driven fics then "Birds of a Feather" by babylonsheep linkao3(15996890) and "My heart is a fist of barbed wire" by dwellingondreams linkao3(18224369) have saner but still sociopathic Toms.

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy in an orphanage who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms between them---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend".But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle.1930's-40's Childhood Friends AU.

  "Now I have three heads: one for speech, one for sex, and one for second guessing." - Analicia SoteloHer door clicks open and nearly clips her in the face. It could be a sudden draft, but Amy is doubtful. Her fist clenches shut around the marble. It is pretty. She could look at it for hours, the way it catches the light. It's almost like a sweet. Want curls up in her chest like a cat. She thinks she'll keep it. A gift from the big grey orphanage, just to her.“That's mine,” comes a thin, cold voice, and she sees the boy across the hall for the first time. His room is directly across from hers. He is pretty, she thinks, like a drawing from a book. The lines of his face are smooth and pale. His hair is dark and neatly parted. He holds himself very rigidly, like a miniature soldier or a wind-up toy. “That's mine,” he repeats, sharply.(In which Tom Riddle is not the only strange child to come out of Wool's.)

  [Working on chapter 29!] Voldemort conquers wizarding Britain. Harry is allowed to live, but why? Attending a darker version of Hogwarts, he struggles with vengeful classmates, a strange connection to Dark Marks, and worst of all, Tom Riddle whispering inside his head. AU dystopia in which the Dark Lord discovers his human horcrux. Mostly gen, though praised for its gradual platonic intimacy between the two arch-enemies.One reviewer says of KYEC: I just found this story a couple of days ago, and I'm thoroughly gripped by it. I could barely stop reading in between chapters, but had to, of course, since your tale is already so deliciously long. The plot is thrilling and well thought-out, and your characterisations are spot-on.

  Harry pulls the diary from Ginny's cauldron after having seen Malfoy slip it inside. What begins as a friendship with a kind man trapped inside a book turns into a story of obsession as Tom Riddle seeks to protect his horcrux and Lord Voldemort returns to find his throne threatened by none other than himself.

  The Dark Lord lingers. Severus spirals. Did Harry Potter ever truly exist at all?[Severus Snape splits his time between the war effort, a mysterious plot hatched by his students, the ever nefarious Dolores Umbridge, and the physical and mental well-being of Harry Potter. The last one turns out to be more difficult than it sounds. And then things take a turn for the worse. OotP AU in which it turns out the Dark Lord had more than one way to return from the dead, and Severus discovers just how far he has left to fall. Expect dark humor, a liberal dose of angst, and plenty of Severus Snape's personal opinions.Other things to look forward to in this fic include: Dolores Umbridge's frankly deeply disturbing crush on Severus Snape, Minerva and Severus as best bros, Albus Dumbledore as a really bad prankster, Lucius Malfoy as a poncy git, Kreacher the house-elf, a Harry Potter who seems more and more different every day, a surprisingly pragmatic Hermione Granger, and a Severus Snape who for some reason can't stop dreaming about the Dark Lord.]
