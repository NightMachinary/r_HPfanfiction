I was rereading linkffn(The Many Harry Potters of Little Hangleton) and found myself really enjoying the Sherlock chapter, Ch 13. I was wondering if anyone knew of any fics with a Harry like that.


** Well, there are actual Sherlock crossovers, like linkffn(A Study in Magic), where Sherlock and fem!John encountered him while fighting Moriarty, and adopted him.

*** I did like Study in Magic, but it didn't have the hyperintelligent Harry I was looking for, just normal Sherlock

**** If you want a hyperintelligent Harry, that's HPMOR, but be warned that Harry there can be insufferable and a lot of people hate that book.

** the Prince of Slytherin series has a subplot where Legilimency basically enhances Harry's deductive reasoning abilities and general capacity to observe things about other people, as well as knowing what to say to manipulate people. it's fascinating, although it doesn't really get explored until third year.
