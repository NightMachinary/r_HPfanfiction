I've been reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6281862/1/Firefly][Firefly]] and in it muggles basically kill the planet and hunt down and murder every witch, wizard and magical creature.

I'm looking for fics like this, but instead the magical community wins, and eradicates all of the muggle population.

There was a story a while ago I read that had a similar premise, Harry couldn't die and kept coming back with memories of all of his past lives. Eventually he teamed up with Voldemort with the intention of killing the entire muggle population. I think the fic is dead now, but I would like to know if there are any fics like it out there.

** It takes 350k words or so to get there, but this is a premise in Teufel1987's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]].
