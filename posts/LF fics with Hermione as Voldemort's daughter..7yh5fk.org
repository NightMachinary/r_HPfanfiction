I've started reading a new story by cleotheo (Step Into Darkness) where Hermione finds out she's actually Voldemort's daughter and the Order kidnapped her as a child. It's a work in progress and I'm currently up to date so I was hoping to find other similar stories I can read until updates are posted!

Not too fussed on pairings, length or any thing like that. Thanks in advance :)


** What I want is a scene on Hogwarts Express where VoldemortDaughter!Hermione and BWL!Harry compare notes and conclude that talking to snakes must be a standard part of the wizard package.

** Don't know any specific titles but there are several like this in the Dramione fandom (where cleotheo is a well-known author), might be a good place to start

** I tried /Step Into Darkness/, but it starts with profound OOC, bashing, and plot railroading in the very first chapter.

First, there's Molly and Sirius conspiring against her. Fine, let's roll with Molly being over-overprotective of her children. But, there's also Sirius, who knows what it's like to come from a Dark family and should have a bit more empathy.

Then, when Hermione overhears that conversation, she immediately starts planning to go to Voldemort for protection, as if all her personal morals, ethics, and attachments just went out of the window. (Does that count as bashing?) This is probably the most downright ridiculous part, because even if we accept that Hermione suddenly lost all those things and is only looking out for herself, the story just kind of forgets that she could go to /Dumbledore/, whom Molly and Sirius mention several times in the conversation as someone who /supports/ Hermione being around.

*** I guess the author wanted to write just it to make Hermione as LV"s daughter without considering the plausibility.

**** It's not the plausibility; I'm willing to suspend disbelief that, by some convoluted means, Voldemort's offspring ended up being raised by a pair of dentists.

My problem is with what Hermione does after she finds out. It'd be far more in-character for her to conclude, "New hobby: patricide."

And, I would /demand/ the following line from her at some point in the story, addressed to Harry: "My name is Hermione Granger. You killed my father. Thanks!"
