Yes, probably an AU thing. So when James dies (or is on a long journey), Harry finds out, that his Mother wasnt the only Love. In the attempt to find out more about his Father, he is looking for this Woman. He finds her and talks with her. She is suprised at how much Harry looks like James and possibly getting attracted by his lookings. They both may grow closer and maybe have a sexual relationship (thats totally optional, but i would like this development)
