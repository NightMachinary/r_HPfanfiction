I'm writing a Tom Riddle fanfiction about some students that attend Hogwarts at the same time as him. I want to keep it as close to canon as possible and want to make 7 books. I have ideas for about three of the books. Any ideas for what could've happened while Tom was at Hogwarts? If you want to know more about what my story is about and details surrounding it I'd be happy to tell you. I'll take any help I can get at this point.


** He was probably reading in the restricted section for the majority of his time or with the slugclub or like charming teachers into doing things for him

** WW2/Grindelwald's War was ongoing so

- People being conscripted/volunteering for the military (or the Red Cross, etc).
- Refugees from the continent.
- Grindelwald supporters or spies among the students
- Muggle relatives being affected by air raids or rationing.
- Delegation arriving to seek Dumbledore's help.

This was before the curse on the defense position so you could have a duelling club/tournaments.

** You can play with fashion of the Wizarding world. Would it be influenced by declining economy situation on muggle side? We see clothing ideas in fantastic beast but mostly in American MACUSA, how does it looked like in Britain?

We see the students in uniforms not unlike in muggle schools but would they really use sth like that in Hogwarts? Why not sth more modest or Victorian?

*** Let's not forget about chamber and the basilisk. Wouldn't Riddle had to steal some food for it? Maybe meet centaurs/unicorns/other creeatures in the forest while hunting?

** You could involve the war somehow. Isn't that the time where Grindelwald and his crew of psychos rampaged through mainland Europe? Tom Riddle attended Hogwarts from 1938 to 1945, exactly during the WW2.

Maybe write about some students that want to recruit Riddle as a Knight or something, and they get pissed when he rejects their offer. Something like that.\\
Or he accepts just out of curiosity to learn more about his... enemy? and then he meets someone there that he makes friends with. He learns that the individual is forced to participate by his parents who are supporters of Grindelwald - while the individual is fully against it because... reasons.\\
Maybe it's a She and forced to marry one of Grindelwald's bad boys after graduating? Who knows!\\
Or its a He and his parents want him to join the front and prove himself as a worthy /Knight of the Greater Good/, but he is miserable at combat while at the same time a genius pioneer that Riddle started to respect due to his skills.
