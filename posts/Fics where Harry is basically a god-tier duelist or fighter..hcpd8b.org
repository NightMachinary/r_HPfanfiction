Hey guys, i've saw many OP Harry fanfics, but most of them seem to be much unreal to me.\\
In canon Harry is a real slacker, and even so he has a fighting instinct so strong that he was able to defeat a Basilisk with a SWORD at 12 years.\\
Canon Harry is basically a prodigy fighter and a very talented user of ofensive magic, like curses, and he doesn't even train that hard.\\
What i want i not just a OP Harry fic.\\
I want something where he really is a powerhouse at fighting, dueling, etc, but he is normal in other things.\\
He's a prodigy fighter, even considered a genius, but average for other things, maybe because he trained really hard, or it features an adult Harry that is times stronger than the teenager.

No Fem Harry.\\
No Slash.\\
If there's pairings in the fic, No Harry/Hermione or Harry/Ginny\\
A Little long but i would love something completed

That's it !

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
