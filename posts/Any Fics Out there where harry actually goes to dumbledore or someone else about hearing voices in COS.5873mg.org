Basically as the title says, are there any stories out there where Harry is actually more concerned about hearing the basilisk in the pipes and goes and tells Dumbledore early in the story? I never liked how he just listens to Ron and Hermione and doesn't tell anyone. People are being attacked and he's hearing voices. If he'd told someone, something might have been done earlier, or at the very least Dumbledore could confirm to him that he's not going crazy. Harry can go to another adult too, doesn't have to be Dumbledore.


** Pretty sure he does in Identity. It's the third in a Sirius-raises-Harry AU series though, so you might want to read the others first. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10858061/1/Identity]]
