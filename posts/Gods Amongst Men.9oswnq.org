*** Quite right. Anything with bashing is just lazy writing, and author's bias showing. This isn't a story. It's a fucking lecture. Anyone who read crap like this should be ashamed.

**** Isn't this comment you just showing biased opinion. Lots of writers use Ron bashing as a story point and to be honest in lots of storys with this make sense, including this one. Ron clearly has a major inferiority complex and with the timing their friendship can crumble quite easily. And while Dumbledore isn't actually a bad person I do believe he is extremely mis guided authors sometimes tweak that to make it a bit more extreme. Just because you don't like something dosnt mean you can shame others into sharing your opinion.

***** It's like me not liking drarry or Hermione/ Draco. It's completely unrealistic and farfetched but I won't go out people down for liking it. It's their opinion I just don't share it

***** I mean another post just pointed out how Dumbledore let Draco keep nearly killing his classmates for a year because he “appreciated the difficulty of his position” That's not a paragon of wisdom or morality or even basic decency.

** Literally the fourth paragraph in Harry's magic gives him a six pack for no apparent reason, I honestly don't understand the appeal of these type of fics.
