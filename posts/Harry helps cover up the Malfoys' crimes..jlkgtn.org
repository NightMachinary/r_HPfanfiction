**** OK. In that case:

"Is there a sign on my wall", asked Harry, "that says dead Death Eater storage?"

"No", admitted Draco.

"If you look my address up in the Hogwarts alumni, does it say dead Death Eater storage?"

"No"

"So /why/", Harry growled as loud as he could without waking Ginny, "Is there a dead Death Eater in my kitchen?"

** “Har...” - I ain't through! Now don't you understand that if Ginny comes home and finds a dead body in her house I am gonna get divorced. No marriage bond , no trial - fuckin' divorced. I know cuz Hermione and me made those dammn laws! And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced. The last time me and Ginny talked about this shit was gonna be the last time me and Ginny talked about this shit. Now I wanna help you out Draco, I really do. But I ain't gonna loose my wife doing it!
