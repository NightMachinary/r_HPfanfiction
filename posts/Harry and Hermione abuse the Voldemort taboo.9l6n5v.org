I'm looking for a particular fic where Harry and Hermione use the voldemort taboo to lure Death Eaters into a forest and dumps earth on top of them. Ron backs out because he doesn't like it.

Thanks for any help.

Can't you express your opinion on the TOPIC without random capitalizations, superfluous! exclamation points, incorect speling, and, my god it's too absurd to mock, /emojis/?

**** Alma is a well known member of this community and she has learning difficulties. In the grand scheme of annoying behaviour on the sub I would rather someone posts with her constant positivity and enthusiasm than more correctly written insults and negativity.

***** I could, then, point to Rule 8 and say that this is a classic example of somebody giving their opinion of a request in a request thread, which is explicitly forbidden. Believe that overrides either annoyance.

Also, the original post was entirely negative towards OP's request as well as two of the main characters. You can't hold that comment next to mine as an example of positivity.

****** That wasn't what you were actually criticising her for though, was it? The point is that is how Alma talks/writes because of a disability. She's harmless and consistently bullied on here.

******* This is an anonymous comment board on the internet. There's no way I, or anyone else including yourself, is going to know in passing the difference between moron and mentally challenged, nor is it our duty to. Truthfully, if they can neither follow the rules or express themselves less painfully, perhaps they shouldn't be posting here at all.

********* And, again, they were entirely negative in their first post and then proceeded to attack me personally in response to two sentences mocking their grammar. So, frankly, no. If what I said offers even the slightest chance they'll not use Penguin of Doom speak next time they comment, something which their post history shows they're fully capable of doing, then I'm content with what I said. Of course, my mother abuses me, my father is disappointed in me, and I was just broken up with while simultaneously getting fired so I'm just so goddamn mean and not a decent, normal person.

********** you mock somebody out of nowhere, when you could've said nothing at all, then act all offended and "attacked" when they retaliate for it? like you're the one who was wronged? fuck that shit. you started it with them by randomly choosing to mock somebody in the first place. so guess what asshat? i'm reporting your post, and go to hell over it.

*********** Oh, the devastation.

I'm not offended, just pointing out the hypocrisy in holding one commenter up as a Saint when they went personal when all I did was mock an act. I said nothing about them as a person, and only criticized the comment structure. And honestly, if criticizing /that/ comment is random, I'm not sure to what extent someone would have to destroy English for you to take note.

**** Can't you try being a decent, normal human being and resist your urge to be mean and petty and mocking to somebody just because of how they express themselves and behave, when NONE OF IT EVER HURTS YOU? How goddamn fucking hard is it to just NOT SAY ANYTHING? TO NOT BE RUDE AND CRUEL? HOW HARD IS THAT FOR YOU?! What the fuck is even going on in your life that you just had to stop and do that? Seriously WHY? Did you get fired at work, did your partner break up with you? Is your mother abusing you, did your father say he was disappointed in you? What the HELL IS IT that makes you so goddamn mean inside that you just can't NOT DO IT?
