I'm looking for stories similar to "Home Of Snakes" by FlitterFlutterFly where Harry travels back in time and either raises himself or tries to change the wizard world. Also stories where he has a do-over, complete with Dumbledore manipulation and/or Lord Potter. Have read several do-over stories so I'm looking for stories that don't get recommend as often.

I don't read anything with less than 80k wording so please let it be over that.

Found that story to be fascinating and well written.

Also, I know most hate those kind of stories, but I love them so please don't start a discussion in this thread :)

I'd also second The Games They Play, which doesn't have the same political angle as House of Snakes does have a similar feel. I'd also say give Greater Than, Lesser Be a try even if it is below your word limit as it is probably the closest and is rather good.
