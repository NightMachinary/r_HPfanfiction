I don't want to see the stereotypical bank scene where the goblins tell him he's worth millions. Just, “oh yea, I bought you a Firebolt. It's fine, your friendship is worth more to me than gold”.


** "Hey Ron, I didn't know what to get you for your birthday, so I bought the Chudley Canons"

"Ha! Fat chance of that!"

Harry didn't look as if he was joking, "Truly, here is the paperwork,"

Harry handed him some papers, Seamus and Dean approached in surprise. "Mate, this seems to be in order, you truly did it you mad man!" Said Seamus

"So, are you going to give Ron a Quidditch team for his birthday? Are you kidding me?" asked Dean.

Ron was speechless. When he finally found his voice a frown came to his face, but Harry cut him off.

"None of it. I would, but he wouldn't accept something like that."

"So... What is this bloody thing about?" asked Ron.

"Oh, not much." said Harry, "I just asked them to rename their pitch"

"You what?"

Harry grinned, taking out a few tickets, "Who wants to go next weekend to a game in the recently remodeled 'Ronald Weasley Arena's?!"

"You're bloody bonkers!"

Harry laughed, showing them the tickets with that name on them, "Wait till you see the rest. I asked for Fred and George advice, since they are more creative. You really have to try the Ickle Ronniekins Pickle Chips! They're brilliant, the twins even had them turn your face orange at the first bite!"

"You git! You didn't!"

"You don't believe me? You'll see..."

Seamus was almost rolling on the floor in amusement, "Keeper Caper Dip to go with that!" said Dean.

Ron threw him an armchair pillow when Harry said it was a good idea.

"The twins also came up with this Burger idea. Romione Double Decker! You know, for you and Hermione. Healthy doses of nutritious lettuce with big chunks of bacon."

"Are you out of your mind?!" Ron boomed, blushing, "You-- didn't? Right?"

Harry smirked, "I'll bring you a menu!"

"Are you mental? What if Hermione hears about it?" Ron hurried distressed.

"Hear what?" asked Hermione, suddenly coming into the common room.

Dean had the widest smile as Seamus almost fell in amusement. "Nothing!" Ron hurried, terrified, "Something about Quidditch, you wouldn't be interested"

Harry stepped in, "About a Canons game, for Ron's birthday. You can come if you want to."

"Of course not, she has to study and some other rubbish!"

"Well, if it's for your birthday I can certainly make some room-" Hermione started moving her hand to the tickets.

Ron however made for the tickets and took them all, "Oh no, not worry, it's nothing big really, we can celebrate, later, or before, I reckon, however you like.." he sttutered, then made for the dorms, "Isn't it too ruddy late? Well, see you tomorrow... Err.. night!"

Hermione frowned as she was left with the smirking boys, "That was just rude... What was that about?"

"Oh don't mind him Hermione," Harry said, "Ron just skipped dinner and is grumpy"

Seamus chipped in, "True. Reckon he's picturing himself putting his teeth on a certain bacon Burger"

Harry and Dean laughed at that, leaving Hermione even more clueless.

The girl rolled her eyes as she left them, "Boys!"

Dean put an arm around Harry, "So what are getting my birthday?"

The boy just shrugged.

** "I'm so glad that after we got married that you insisted we keep Dobby on." She smiled, remembering the conversation. She hadn't wanted a house-elf, but when Harry told her what he was paying Dobby, she'd changed her mind. Harry was paying him the same as a Muggle housekeeper would be paid. It was almost half of Harry's salary and she wondered how he could afford it, but then Harry showed her his royalties from his grandfather's hair potion and she knew they would never worry about money.
