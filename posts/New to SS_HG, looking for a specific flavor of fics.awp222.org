Are there any good, long fics where Hermione's sort of the more assertive of the two, and she protects Snape from abuse and is cared for? I love me some Snape whump, and I've mostly been in the slashy side of fandom, but I've been curious about SS/HG for a long time now and would love to sample a few fics of this nature, if there are any.


** Check out Ashwinder. It is a site dedicated to SS/HG. For some reason, despite this being my favourite pairing, I cannot think of any, though they definitely exist.

*** Thanks! The few times I've searched on my own, I haven't been very lucky to be honest, and I get a bit discouraged. I'll register at Ashwinder and try again, though.

  Devsgma and Darnedchild have combined their talents to tell you the story of what has happened to our favorite pair. It starts with a few letters from one extremely grouchy potions maker to the manager of a used book store.

***** I honestly have to re-read them all, I don't remember them that much XD I remember that the one with Hermione being a Spy was hard to read because of all the angst but I'm glad I read them. Normally I also read mostly slash but I also recommend Snape with OC, they can be surprisingly good :)

****** I see! Most of the fics I've encountered seem to be straight up romance, or favor Hermione in a distressed situation or with a distinct power imbalance in the relationship in favor of Snape. I just prefer reading the opposite. I mostly stick to slash as well, but I just really love Hermione, and the thought of her being her protective badass self over Severus, and I end up on these random hunts for SS/HG fics of that nature now and then, but rarely ever find one.

Interesting about OCs. Would you happen to know of any good Snape with OMCs? I only remember reading Josan's old fics, haven't really sampled anything else outside of those.

** I'm a big SS/HG Shipper. I'll have to dig in to my favorites to get you some specifics, but to tide you over every single story written by corvusdraconis linkffn(5751039) is one to remember!

If you can keep up, you won't be disappointed!

Starting reference for beginning of awesome: One Step Forward, Two Decades Back linkffn(11047955)

I have read and re-read these fics multiple times and they are my go-to for crackfics.

Also, off the top of my head, there's: The Problem with Purity by Phoenix.Writing linkffn(4776976) and Pride of Time by Anubis Ankh linkffn(7453087)
