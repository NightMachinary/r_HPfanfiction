After a few posts in the last couple of days, I've come across a rather valid point on self promotion after being uncertain about the subject for some time. It made me want to start this discussion.

My current fanfiction is under heavy editing every other year as I continue to mature into a different and arguably more educated taste since I'm doing a degree for Professional and Creative Writing, so unless it has some real support, I don't plan on promoting it any time soon.

But I'm genuinely curious and feel like this would be a helpful guide for anyone new to this subreddit who wants to promote their stuff and what reactions they might garner if they do.


** I think that it's okay for fanfic authors to promote their fanfiction, as long as it's done in a reasonable way. Like there are SO MANY fanfictions out there that new authors who may be amazing would hardly get noticed if they didn't attempt to promote it in some way or the other.

I think things like posting on tumblr/forums/etc. is fine; I think where authors go too far, though, is when they leave a review on another story that's something like: "Great story blah blah oh guess what, I've written a story, check it out!" That just feels...petty.

** Sure you can self-promote, but you should limit it to the proper threads, such as the monthly writer's discussion threads or threads that are specifically asking for fics like yours. Conversely, going around linking your fic to every person that asks for a recommendation is incredibly crass and somewhat masturbatory.

** Was it my comment to a certain over enthusiastic new writer that prompted this? I told them that self promotion was looked down on here, but I don't actually believe that, I was just trying to soften the blow.

I think self promotion is absolutely fine as long as it's done in a polite and humble manner. I prefer it in the context of asking for feedback or meeting someone's request, but I don't seem the problem with saying "hey, I'm really proud of this" as long as it's not all the time.

*** Actually it was!

I'd never really seen an opinion up to that point on the subject (only been around a month) but I felt it was rather helpful considering how you did it so nicely. As someone who is fairly new to this, I figured this thread could help if someone wanted to self promote.

I can't imagine my original fic from when I started a few years ago being promoted and going down well here. I was proud of it, but I was far too sensitive to any useful criticism.

I'm rewriting it now (plot bunny won't bugger off) and it's almost foreign to the original thanks to maturity, a heavy reality check and changes in taste. But I personally don't think I'd self promote it anyway.

Overall my experience on this seems quite positive with some certain rules of etiquette to consider (DON'T SPAM might just be the major one).

** I generally don't mind it, but the specific times that I /like/ it are:

When it's a highly followed or well regarded story that's finally finished, or updated if there's usually a lengthy delay between chapters.

A well known or highly enjoyed author starting a new story.

Self promotion where their story fits within a request thread. As long as it fits, go for it!

It's basically the same way I feel about promotion in general. Is there a /purpose/ for the promotion? Yes? Cool, go for it.

However, I do believe the author should ensure that grammar, spelling and punctuation are up to par before even thinking of self-promoting.

** I'm in favor of authors promoting their stories (within reason). I think we have a fair amount of talented authors here, and I enjoy their commentary and discussion and being able to interact with them... so I'm happy for them to get something out of it. My favorite is when people add their FFN handle as their flair, so I can look their stories up on my own if I think they make salient comments or something.

Right now, I think people post and in general let the votes decide. Self-promotion is generally not well received here when the writing is of poor quality (spelling/grammar errors, OOC, etc). But I'm always happy to get a new story to read. If the self-promo'd story is not to my taste, I just move on and don't downvote or anything. If the author wants feedback, I often post or PM them.

I think this sub has a good balance of promotion right now. I completely echo [[/u/Faeriniel]]'s sentiment. While I hope the balance stays as it is, and our subreddit doesn't just become a self-promotion echo chamber... some is ok. (:

Fair warning: It's being heavily edited which is why the first few chapters sound so different to the others, but I'm getting through them. It also involves multiple OC's and is the rehashing the series trope turned on its head (obvs will be reasons for this).

** I tend to be rather pusillanimous when it comes to posting my own work, whether it's a completed piece or a brief description. I get this feeling of trepidation in my stomach that some may dislike it, especially when other people are posting things that I have read and are higher quality than anything I have ever written.

Because of this, I tend to not advertise my work at all and allow it to run its own course. I don't really care about views, comments, reviews, etc. I just want people to enjoy what I have written.

Edit: Due to a lack of understanding, I wish to clear up my post a little. It's fine, as a whole, to promote your work and stuff, but I, as an individual, don't. There's some horrid fanfics that are recommended constantly, whether due to a joke or not, and some that aren't recommended at all and are /great/.

Self-promotion isn't really any different to regular promotion, is it? It's just you posting instead of someone else, which this place has a flair for.
