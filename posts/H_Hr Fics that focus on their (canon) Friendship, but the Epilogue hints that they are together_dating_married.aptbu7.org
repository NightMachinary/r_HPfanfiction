Title says all. It can either be Canon compliant, minus the epilogue, or a post-hogwarts Fic, that have them solve other Cases or having focus on their slice-of-life.

The Fics epilogue can be a time skip, like the Canon one or just a last Chapter of the Fic. Although im not rejected if H/Hr are romantical involved in the Epilogue, i would like to read such that just hint, that they are together now (like its vague enough, so they could still be just friends)...if thats possible.

Hmm, i realize, that give hints, that they are married, might be the hardest one and its not so vague anymore. But i still leave it open.
