I would love to read a Teddy Lupin/young!Sirius Black pairing because I think Sirius Black would totally like that blue haired punk kid. I haven't really found any fics with that pairing and some people might think it's a little strange, though let's admit there is weirder things out there...

I would actually be interested in any good fics in which Teddy meets the marauders so if you know any good ones you can leave me a rec or maybe even write a fic if you are interested!

** Here's an old one with that pairing, although Teddy isn't the one who timejumps. It's a bit angsty if I remember correctly, but well written.

#+begin_quote
  Sketching portraits of Sirius Black had been Teddy's way of avoiding life in the present for years. He never expected one of them would come to life, but then, he might have known that interacting with any kind of magical parchment invented by a Marauder would only open up one epic can of worms.30,800 words. NC-17. Sirius/Teddy. Past Sirius/Remus. Past unrequited Sirius/Harry. Entirely canon- and Epilogue-compliant, including deaths, marriages and offspring. Teddy is 19. Written for bigbangblackout. Summer 2009.
