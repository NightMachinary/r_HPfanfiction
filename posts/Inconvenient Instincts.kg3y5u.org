I've read several fics where (normally OP) Harry has some instinct/sense that is used to fast forward the cannon plot (e.g. discover Wormtail, find the Room of Requirement, suspect Quirrell, etc). This is normally either from some creature inherence / animagus abilities or a kind of magic sense / mage sight.

Some fics have the second being an issue, where Harry is overwhelmed/blinded by the magic of Hogwarts/Diagon Alley, but the only half-decent thing I've read where creature/animagus instincts become a problem is linkffn(growing up kneazle) where Harry has a HARD time having a positive relationship with Sirius (or Mr. Black as Harry insists. Sirius, dog star, problems.) and Remus. Are there any other fics out there were this is a plot point (preferably excluding any mating urge, man fanfiction is WEIRD sometimes)?

TLDR: Fics where creature instincts become a problem.

  On the cusp of Harry's third birthday an impressive display of accidental magic will change his life forever. When Harry is rediscovered nearly nine years later, what will become of our intrepid hero when he finally attends Hogwarts? Sequel now posted!

** Well, in my story "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief", Hermione learns how to become a cat animagus, and she doesn't handle the mental effects as well as she thinks she does. Apart form feuding with Sirius, she also has the urge to defend "her territory" against other cats.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

Parselmouths have snake instincts and some slight physical alterations.

  Being a Parselmouth came with the inherent predisposition to understand snake behaviours and imitate them. It was relieving Harry wasn't going to kill anyone with venom, nor petrify them with his gaze. But also, somewhat frustrating as it was all completely useless. None of the skills that came with being a Parselmouth would help Harry survive Voldemort. In might, in fact, have the opposite effect. For all Riddle's fury that Harry was the cause of his elder self's defeat, he was fascinated by the fact Harry was also a Parselmouth. He had grabbed Harry's face, turning him side to side looking bemusedly enraptured by Harry's threat display. “At your age, I was imitating much more vicious snakes than this, Harry.” That may have been all well and good, but Harry didn't feel very vicious. He felt very threatened and in over his head.
