It feels like every Harry/Ginny story I've read either pairs her with Ron (alternatively Malfoy/Snape) or bashes her to hell and back. So do you know any story H/G story where Hermione plays a major role but is NOT in one of the aforementioned relationships and not bashed?

No harems, femHarry/Ginny is fine as well.


** As far as I remember she ends up with Charlie in Remember. linkffn(4936039).

To be honest, I have no problems with R / Hr. On the other hand, I don't mind seeing Hermione with someone else. However, I can't see another matching character for her in the HP universe. The only alternative would be a Muggle OC. Unfortunately, I have never seen the latter. Ah, well, that's not true, in Careless Talk, she ends up with a Muggle. linkffn(11928952).\\
Well, if she's being bashed in Careless Talk is another question.

I have yet to read a decent depiction of their relationship outside of "Harry joins them in a triad" one-shots (and those were all pretty explicit). In 98% of the cases, their relationship as written wouldn't last more than a week and yet the authors claim that their constant fights and misunderstandings are signs of their undying love. That's not how a successful relationship works.

**** I'd say you're just reading the wrong stuff.\\
On the other hand, I suspect everyone reads what confirms his view of the world. You always remind me of Hermione when I read your comments. The 98% suggest that you've been working on the project for a while.

***** Look, I am not a fan of Ron, or any Weasley besides Ginny, because I find them unrelateble. I was raised a single child and therefore the entirety of Ron's issues aren't something I'm familiar with. I'm not interested in him as the MC because those stories usually involve his entire family. Therefore I only see his relationships in the background.

BUT

That doesn't change how his and Hermione's relationship is usually written (love expressed through fights and insults). Or Ron/Luna which supposedly works because he lets her prattle on about random creatures. Real relationships do not work that way.

And yes, quite a lot of relationships with Harry in them wouldn't work either. That's the reason I'm not touching indy Harry stories, or Death Eater ships.
