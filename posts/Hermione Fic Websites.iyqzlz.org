So I miss the website Granger Enchanted. It had tons of Hermione fics with different pairings. You choose the pairing. Are there any Hermione centric fic websites out there? I love Ashwinder. I prefer Hermione paired with Harry, Draco, or Severus, but I'm open to anything.


** There's several Facebook groups, at least one has file sharing.

** Sorry I don't have an answer to you, but can you say why you enjoy Hermione/Severus as a pairing? It just kind of baffles me.

Have a list of HP Fic Sites. Some of 'em have Hermione on. :)

**** Happy to help. There's also the HPHarmony subreddit linked in the sidebar, which may be able to tell you more. There's probably also some specific FFNet Communities or Ao3 Collections specialising in those pairings, if you wanna try google for them.
