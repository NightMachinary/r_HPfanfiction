Edit: To clarify, I definitely agree that "Harry Crow" does not deserve the attention it has on FF.net. But I would go out on a limb and say that robst's stories are still amongst the top 5-10% of all stories on FF. His writing mechanics and canon knowledge are both good, and the first time you read them you don't cringe very hard.

**** The concept was nice, at first, and there were some things I agreed with.

But honestly, going through that story is like a war of attrition. Each chapter just saps your will to read rather than add to it, which is a bad sign. Reads more like a textbook sometimes. My original complaint about the story was that it was going nowhere with the plot.

When it finally had a semblance of plot, I found myself missing the good 'ol days. The dark and serious plotline doesn't really work for the story.

I think the author started out wanting to do a fic that only covered first year. In the beginning that was great... now that we're past chapter 100, its hamstrung the fic. Too much is trying to happen in too short a period of in-universe time. Like [[/u/techgore]] said, there are limits to how much you can cram into a fic about a bunch of firsties.

*** I think for a lot of its adherents, it was their first introduction to fan fiction. It has good production values (spelling, grammar, punctuation), it surpasses the original in many ways, and it has some better-than-average power/cleverness fantasy indulgence.

After reading some of the best fan fiction around, HPMOR does seem somewhat juvenile, a bit over the top in places, and has a few too many nods to the reader.

The author's better in short form and in nonfiction.

It has consistent characterizations, from a technical standpoint is definitely on the highest levels, doesn't go for a lot of the cheap tropes, and I suppose if someone likes preachy super!Harry stories then it really is good... but that's not for me.

That being said, I can totally get where you're coming from. It's slow, requires you to have a vested intrest in philosophy before you start reading, most of the jokes require in depth knowledge of specific media to even understand. Harry can be annoying as fuck sometimes.

All in all, I view it as the Pacific Rim of fanfics. To me it's the best ever, but it is not for everyone.

** When A Lioness Fights.

SS/Hermione - the plot and characters are so incredibly stupid that I thought it was a crack fic at first. Nope.

For example, first chapter: Hermione being a genius and apparently liking Snape, decides to save him from the suffering of being a spy by substituting herself for that role.

Her plan is to (A) meet Voldermort in person. (b) Inform Voldermort that Snape is a traitor while convincing him that she is a crazy fanatical groupie (c) spend an unspecified amount of time until Voldermort lets her go. (d) Head to meet Dumbledore to inform him that Snape has been outed. (e) Tell Dumbledore to tell Snape that it's not longer safe to answer Voldermort's calls and he can no longer act a spy.

The story starts with (e). No consideration is at any point given to the likelyhood of Snape getting summoned immediately after she outs him, before her "genius" plan gets about to warning him.

In next chapters there are brilliant exchanges like "Hermione, the stimulant potion you are taking will kill you in a few weeks. Most definitely less than a month." Reaction of brilliant Hermione - "You must let me keep taking it - I have only 1 maybe 2 months to go before achieving total victory for our side". No one corrects her arithmetic.

That's how the story starts. It manages to get even dumber after that.

7k+ reviews, almost 4k favs.

** The Firebird trilogy has been recommended here several times recently. It has an interesting premise with a few obvious solutions that were ignored for the sake of drama. The chosen solution was poorly applied. You have a shortage of men and still allow them, in the flower of their youth, to engage in dangerous activities? Insanity.

It purports to show a society rife with misandry and short on misogyny but shows a society with a fair bit of unconscious misogyny and only overt misandry.

The reason behind the shortage of men makes little sense to me. It's a supposedly cumulative intergenerational effect from using wands crafted by women. I don't see why the effect should be cumulative, though.

*** Did you even read the series? Everything you said is wrong.

What dangerous activities are boys allowed to take part in that have a high chance of killing them? It doesn't matter if they're hurt, doesn't matter if they are comatose for life, so long as their testicles work and magic is pretty good way of ensuring that happens, even if they never wake up. All the really dangerous stuff, like fighting, is done by women. The ministry employs hitwitches as enforcers, not wizards, because it's too likely they'll die.

I don't even know where you got your ridiculous thoughts on the balance of misogyny and misandry in that series' world. Misandry is what the world's culture is based off. Misogyny is only present among the wizards that hate witches for the way the world is. Anything else against women is just prejudice against something about them, their blood, their magic, their actions, etc., not that they're women.

It's not cumulative. The problem with the wands is that they're made for females, not that they're made by females. In that world, the match of wand to magical is a great deal more certain than in canon. The wand doesn't pick the magical, it just matches them based off of gender, type of magic, etc. The issue is that men are forced to use female wands to limit the amount of magic they're capable of using. By using a female wand to stopgap the magic is basically converted to being more feminine and then forced back into the wizard. The forced introduction of this magic then begins to fuck with the wizard over time and makes it far harder for him to deliver a male sperm.

Quidditch and cursebreaking, for instance. Scrimgeour was Head Auror, so that's another position that exposes people to violence.

Several girls of mixed heritage claim that they were attacked. Umbridge doesn't believe them. Harry Potter corroborates -- without even having been there -- and Umbridge accepts his story.

Misogyny in the writer's head is clear: most of the female characters seem to have no concern other than marriage and children. Luna Lovegood, for instance, could have bargained at one point for her family name's exoneration. Instead she bargained for the ability to bear children. Let's not get into the rape-y mechanism in that scenario.

They explicitly state that the birth imbalance is increasing over time. Either they're issuing progressively less suitable wands over time or it's a heritable problem.

Made using women's humors, I should have said. It's implied that wand crafters use their own biological material in the process, and a wand for a witch must use a witch's humors and vice versa. So in most cases, a wand crafted by a woman is crafted for a woman and vice versa.

** Delenda Est.

Baring the popular crap stories (Harry Crow, looking at you), the way people see this as a great story confounds me. Every character has the same voice (be you a young student or the minister of magic, "whatever" is a legitimate response in the 70s), everyone but super!Harry and mildy-super!Bella is incompetent and rather stupid (to the point that when they're not it feels extraordinary), and at the end the author just throws in so much fan service by giving every popular character some time that the story nearly unravels.

Don't get me wrong, it's a smooth read. But every time Dumbledore says "I'm sorry, the Order can't help fight because they have families" and then Harry solves everything on his own (or other things like this in order to show how awesome and super Harry is) makes me want to facepalm.

The political maneuvering, harry preparing for war, and the novel idea of the multi-dimensional portkey made from a rubick's cube were all well done. Then, right before it feels a little too mary-sue fix-fic harry finds himself thrown forward back into a world where for all we know Voldemort has had free reign for 20 years.

It's the second half where the fic falls short. Instead of what we got, we should have had a world where Voldemort did win (mainly because there was no boy-who-lived scenario to disembody him for 15 years.) And in the middle of Voldemort's regime, we have Harry returning with the 'guerrilla warfare strongboxes' and the benefits of the political allies he made earlier. It should have been Harry rebuilding the Order and overthrowing the oppressive regime in a way that would have continued the flow and voice of the fic up until that point.

Instead we basically get book 5 order of the pheonix where a third party already knows all the answers to the correct questions, and that's exactly how the rest plays out.

**** Even in the first half there are some weaknesses. The difference is most people aren't used to a super!Politician!Harry. He earns most people's trust instantly, is automatically rich and powerful, and organizes the entire wizarding world into a war footing in no time at all, after installing his own regime. Side characters (Dumbledore, Snape, Lily, Cygnus) are completely one dimensional and bordering moronic: of course Snape would attack a professor and can't understand that dark arts isn't defense against the dark arts because he's a moron. Of course Lily goes all doe-eyed (sorry) when around a James clone without noticing the resemblance, and all it takes is one sentence to change her outlook completely about both James and Snape.

It's not quite obvious as the second half, but the first half (while better) is still one where Harry goes from someone who has experience as a mediocre student and a war, yet suddenly becomes the most influential power broker of the age with just a few demonstrations of power/awesome. I'm not saying it's a bad story, just overrated.
