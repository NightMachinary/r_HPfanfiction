He just doesn't target Harry. Why would he, he doesn't want the publicity.


** He brought down the Black family by getting Andramada to fall in love with a muggle creating scandal and infighting; effectively removing Black family gold from the war.

**** Harry upon hearing it feels inspired and decides to do the same with the Malfoys... however since he sucks at manipulation his attempt ends three days later when he flees Gringotts on dragon-back while polyjuicing as Snape with all the things from their vaults (and also some of the surrounding ones -either because he didn't know for sure which was the right one or because he thought it would be less suspicious)... now his revenge against Draco being rude to him is finally completed, and the only price was freeing a very angry and hungry dragon upon London while causing great damage to both the only bank on magical England and it's primary shopping district. And oh yeah, there was also that whole thing about kickstarting a goblin war... but he /did/ manage to get revenge before becoming senile, so... still a victory?

** Aunt Muriel was not always an accountant. Molly and Arthur don't like talking about Muriel, because that would mean talking about life before they were bound to Dumbledore and Muriel's magic was locked away. They like giving their kids the image that they're not slaves forced to fight a war.
