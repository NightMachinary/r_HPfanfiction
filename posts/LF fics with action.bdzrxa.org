I like action and one canon rehashed Voldemort confrontation a year isn't enough. I want more. Battles, break-ins, duels, infiltrations, raids, riots. A proper, complex war with death eaters, aurors, order members, common criminals, revolutionaries, vigilantes and foreign soldiers all fighting each other. Where constant vigilance is the only option to survive because anyone could be under polyjuice or the imperius and could start casting fiendfyre any moment. Where the "just use expelliarmus, don't kill" attitude has to be quickly abandoned. Where the war spills over and other magical countries get involved. Where every second character, good or bad, is dead by the end. And no death eaters get away this time. If the main characters are a bit more ruthless and desperate than in canon it's exactly what I'm looking for.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/][I am Lord Voldemort?]], linkffn(12980210), has everything you want, from bad guys's POV. This new, updated Voldemort is quite fun to read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is all out war and political machinations. The magic is nerfed a little though as the author assumes anti-Muggle Ward failed after the collapse of the SoS. Unfortunately, this fic has not been updated for a long time.

Then there are Starfox5 fics you have already read.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** The fic linkffn(falls to shadow) has a good amount of fighting but it does have prequels and doesn't focus on Harry, he's a very rare side character and is full of OCs

Edit, wrong fic, linkffn(falls the shadow by slide)

  What would have happened to the four, if Niko hadn't found them? What would they have become then? A collection of one-shots where the circle had to survive without Winding Circle. Companion pieces to 'Always Us'. Chapter 8, winter is coming: Sandry's war for the throne would soon begin, and Briar, Daja, and Tris take the last steps of their journeys to her side in the darkness.

  Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret, lost but hidden in her mind, so she is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve, to be bred and monitored until her mind can be cracked.
