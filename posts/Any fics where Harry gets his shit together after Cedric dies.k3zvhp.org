I'm kinda talking about those cliche fics where Harry has a shopping montage and is suddenly a big reader and he becomes super good at magic and shit. Of course, they don't have to be cliche or anything, but that's basically what I'm looking for.

Things I want (doesn't need to be all of them, just some):

- complete or actively updating or at least 50k words if it's abandoned
- canon pairings or gen (Neville/Luna is fine)
- shopping montage!
- harry gets rid of his glasses or gets better-looking glasses
- harry actually does good in school
- harry doesn't let umbitch get to him
- grey harry
- wandless/nonverbal magic
- harry gets good a duelling
- parseltongue
- DA
- harry reads in the grimmauld place library? (that's just a wish at this point)
- *Sirius doesn't die!*
- harry creates his own faction in the war
- not focused around bashing, but bashing's fine if it's eventually fixed or whatever
- politicking
- harry doesn't think slytherins are the epitome of evil!

Things I *don't* want:

- harry/hermione
- harems/multi shipping
- first person point of vew
- harry/daphne
- *crossover*

*Thank you for any recommendations!*


** Honestly not sure if you're going to find such a fic without Harry paired with Hermione or Daphne; many "wake-up call" fanfics involve one or the other.

Can't really think of any that fit this description even ignoring pairing concerns, but it sounds interesting at least.

*** I think I saw one or two knocking around that were Harry/Ginny but that was back in those halcyon days of my fanfiction youth about 5 years ago, I can't remember what they were called or any of the specifics. I'm pretty sure if you trawl Pre-OOTP on SIYE or any of the fanfic sites you'll find something.
