** 'Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived' is the only one that springs to mind, though that one isn't even technically a WBWL fanfic.

Most WBWL style fanfics are built around Harry getting cast aside in favor of his twin, so its only natural that they wouldn't particularly like each other.

In 'Sarcasm and Slytherin' the Potter twins end up on decent terms as the story progresses, but they still don't really like each other all that much.

The same thing applies to 'Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin', though as of recently they are back to disliking each other again, through no fault of their own either.

*** Second the rec for HP and the BWL, such a shame it's abandoned, but certainly an amazing fic and worth reading.

Without spoilering POS, they do end up forming a friendship, although complications do occur about it.

S&S is a fic that I generally advise avoiding due to it's atrocious bashing and poorly written characterisations of Dumbledore and James.

**** Your mileage may vary.

To me PoS had really bad character writing and bashing. James (and occasionally other characters) behave irrationally in ways that don't make sense with their motives and background as stated in the fic. (James' idiotic behavior has a plot reason that is revealed later on, but to me that couldn't excuse the painfully terrible writing of his character in the first 20 or so chapters.) The author repeatedly writes scenes in which the PoV character(s) monologue while the antagonists stand still and silent like cardboard cutouts to take the entire verbal beatdown. I can see how that makes for fun escapist reading, but it strikes me as extremely unbelievable and blatant bashing.

S&S also had James in an antagonist role, but to me it did a better job of portraying his personality, background and motives as consistent within the AU of the fic (with hints of hidden secrets driving his behavior), therefore to me the portrayal was more believable. The same goes for S&S's portrayal of Dumbledore. The author of S&S also has a better knack for writing dialogue confrontations that have a realistic back and forth. Thus, I don't consider S&S's portrayal of its antagonists to be bashing. +Unfortunately, S&S was abandoned by the author, so we may never know what the author was intending to reveal about the antagonists later on.+

TL;DR:

Depicting a 'good' character as an antagonist isn't always bashing, and readers have different opinions about where that distinction lies.

(Edited: The fic isn't abandoned; see below.)

***** S&S wasn't abandoned, there were some issues with the account iirc so they continued on a new account, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24721513/chapters/63876325][here's the latest one.]]

***** Perhaps it has since be fixed since I read it. But the whole Sirius trial thing has to be the stupidest bit of writing I have ever had the displeasure of reading. Dumbledore and James's attitudes towards dark magic frankly make no sense given how little difference there is between dark and light magic in the fic. S&S is a good fic, with some great bits of writing. But holy shit is it's bashing utterly ridiculous. That James would send his best friend knowingly to Azkaban for using 'dark magic' or whatever is the height of stupidity. Perhaps it's all explained away in the later chapters, but I quit after halfway through book 5 so I never saw it.

James's idiotic behavior is annoying but well within character for him in POS, to the point where I actually love his character. The drunken letter on Harry's sorting was annoying, but given what is later revealed, James getting piss blind drunk when he finds out his son went to Slytherin is utterly understandable. I think of James in POS like Harry in canon, if he was forced into more realistic scenarios. James is constantly trying his hardest to save everyone and puts himself and his own desires always second place to averting the prophecy . His problem is not that his heart is in the wrong place, but he is merely a decently strong Auror whose heart is in the right place, fighting against opponents so far above his level it's not even funny. Pretty much all the monologuing during dangerous situations in POS is explained away by occulemency but I can see why you might dislike it.

** A new one is Fellowship of the Potters. When Orphanage-raised-Harry meets Dursley-raised-GWL Rose, he instantly becomes protective and loving towards her. A lot of standard tropes but looks like its going to be done well. Like the fact that Harrys extreme power actually causes trouble for him. Also has Dumbledore bashing, though hes actually decent at hiding being evil and McG is good. Ron hasn't been seen yet but likely will be bashed as well.
