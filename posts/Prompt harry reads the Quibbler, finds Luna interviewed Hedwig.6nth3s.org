** Harry looked at the copy of the Quibbler someone had just dropped in front of him. Looking around, he hesitated then opened it. Knowing Luna, she had disillusioned herself just to deliver the magazine. Or--he turned and checked his satchel. His cloak was still in it.

Turning back, he slowly began to read, debating looking at the cover to see if there was an article he should especially look for. His thoughts on that were forgotten as he got heavily into the story about how Atlantis was being utilized as an armory and training grounds by Merfolk as they prepared to wage war on the Veela nation. The more hormonally driven part of his mind suggested joining the French Foreign Legion's magical equivalent so he could protect the Veela in hopes of great gratitude from a pack of them.

The next article made him freeze.

Hedwig Potter Speaks Out

By Luna Lovegood

I, the intrepid Luna Lovegood--Lovegood by name, Love Very Good by reputation--braved the cold northern winters to traipse down to the Owlery in hopes of gaining an exclusive interview with the lovely and vivacious Hedwig, Harry Potter's Snowy Owl. Our conversation follows with translations done by my Owl-to-English Quill.

How did you come to be Harry Potter's closest companion, Hedwig?

Preck, Pre-Prink, Preeeck! We should start at the beginning. I was born in Canada to some of the finest mail owls. My mother and father were both such incredible postal owls I decided to migrate here to the UK to carve my own world.

How did Harry come to find you?

I was a gift from Rubeus Hagrid. He had been tasked with reintroducing Harry to the magical world. He had elected to let Harry do a bit of his shopping on his own so he could get a pick-me-up after the ride at the Bank--which sounds like a hoot of a good time to me--and surprised Harry with me in a rather shabby cage.

Harry made a mental note to get her a better cage.

From there he gave me my public name while studying his history textbook, his favorite class in muggle school but now one of his least favorites.

What's his favorite class, Hedwig?

He excels at Defense. Even with the terrible teachers they've had--like this years is wildly incompetent--Harry has gotten the highest grades, including setting new records for his OWL in DADA. So proud! He does well in most other classes, save potions where that Greasy Git reigns. For someone who professes to be a Potions Master it would seem he would want to make sure everyone enjoys his class but he does his utmost to make sure all save Slytherin house hate it. We owls discuss it all the time.

Who do the owls think is the best professor?

Oh, definitely Grubbly-Plank. Harry prefers Hagrid--which is totally. Understandable--but Grubbly-Plank is as accomplished a healer of the strigidaeian as I am a predator of stupid mice. In fact: be right back.

Hedwig disappeared then reappeared a few minutes later holding a struggling pine marten kit. I left her alone to enjoy her dinner.

** "Harry's going to do his nut if he sees this," said Ron.

"Shut up, Ronald, or this is going to be a horrible DADA class. If Harry can't pay attention, we're both out of luck."

They both stuffed their copies of The Quibbler into their bags. Unfortunately, Harry didn't show up to DADA class. He didn't show up to Herbology either. Both Ron and Hermione were worried, and promised to have a look in the common room before lunch. When they went there, there was no sign of Harry. Ron checked their dorm room. Still no Harry.

They got worried, and tracked down Professor McGonnagal.

"Harry isn't in his rooms, because he's in the infirmary."

The blood drained out of Ron and Hermione's faces.

"May we go visit him, professor?"

"I don't see why not. Madam Pomfrey mentioned that he managed to eat his lunch about an hour ago."

"Thanks, Professor!" Both Ron and Hermione took off for the hospital wing at a dead run. They wanted to make sure Harry was OK, and knowing that he was in the hospital wing could only mean one thing: he'd tried and failed miserably to hex Luna Lovegood into next week.

"Who'd have known Loony--"

Hermione smacked the back of Ron's head.

"Sorry! I meant Luna, would be so powerful?"

"We'll find out soon enough."

When they got into the hospital wing, they saw Harry, sat with the Quibbler open in front of him, with his entire body shaking. Hermione was alarmed. "Harry! Are you OK?"

"What happened, mate?"

Harry put down The Quibbler. He wasn't crying. He was holding his sides and trying to keep behind great gales of laughter.

"He's lost the plot, Hermione. Better call Madam Pomfrey."

"I'm FINE, Ron," said Harry. "I just had a bit of a run-in with the floor. The floor won."

"WHAT?"

Harry looked very sheepish. "Luna left a stack of Quibblers in strategic locations all over the castle. I saw her drawing of Hedwig on the cover, and go curious. I took a copy to my bed, and read it. Two paragraphs into the article, and I laughed so hard that I fell off of the bed, and hit my head on the floor. Percy found me when professor Lupin sent someone in to see what happened to me."

Ron and Hermione looked startled. "What could be funny about Luna interviewing your owl, Harry?"

Harry recomposed himself with considerable effort.

"You didn't read it?"

He got identical head-shakes. "No."

Harry opened up the magazine to the appropriate page. There was yet another large drawing of Hedwig, placed right next to the interview. The interview that Luna had done with an owl. And had asked probing questions to. And had filled in whatever it is that the owl had responded with. In owl.

** I just have this idea that Hedwig is Archimedes from The Sword and the Stone. Something Merlin did gave his owl an infinite lifespan. Not actual immortality, only unaging.

*** Maybe that's why Hedwig's snowy white, despite only males of her species having that coloration...

*** Oooh, I like this idea. I wonder if there are any fics that have that?

I know that the short fic Calculation has a sooper-smart Harry and a smart owl who he calls Archimedes, who teaches himself to read and (by the end) talk to Harry, but I don't know of any that cross over with TSatS.
