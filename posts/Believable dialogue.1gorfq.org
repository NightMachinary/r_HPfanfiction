This is more of a writers question than a readers, but when reading the books what accents to you give the characters?. By default I always read Ron with a Yorkshire accent and Hermione and Harry with proper queens English.

So how do the accents written in ff effect your reading experience? and I suppose for fun, post your favorite verbal between exchange from a fic


** As an American, I don't really think of the accents unless the dialogue is explicitly written to emphasize the accent (e.g., Hagrid, Mundungus, etc.), and even then I'm not familiar enough with them to accurately label them according to their respective regions of origin.

*** Essentially this; I don't mind accents unless they're established in canon. The most important part is consistency.

I think a knowledge of accents lends a better flavor to dialogue when used correctly, so it'll help as long as you actually know how to write the accent.
