Hey all! I'm using this as a way to vent about a pet peeve of mine amongst those who may understand it, feel free to do the same!

I love how a lot of fics play off the idea of ancestry being important. My family is really into it, and ideas like certain traits or magical abilities being passed down in a family is my jam. But, too often, authors mess it up when it's a maternal trait.

The classic example is the Weasley family being extremely fertile. This in itself is plausible, but when Ginny Weasley is said to be fertile just like her mother and all other Weasley women, there's a problem. Molly was born a Prewett and not a Weasley. If it's said that the fertility was passed down her maternal line it'd be fine! But Molly is only a Weasley woman through marriage, so unless there's a magical reason she gains her new family traits, she shouldn't have access to the bloodline traits of the Weasley family.

There are many ways to have a female character inherit things through her maternal line, and I've seen it done well many times. But when you add the family name, you need to be very specific about where the ability comes from and how it's passed down. Phrasing is key. Sticking with my example, either Molly gained Weasley fertility when she married the family, or her fertility has nothing to do with the Weasleys at all, rather it's passed through her maternal line.


** Yeah, if they stated that Weasley men father a lot of children, that'd work fine, but unless you hand-wave it with "Family Magicks" and spouses taking on the magical traits of the families they marry into that doesn't quite work. The so-called "Weasley Temper" is the same way - Arthur is pretty chill whenever we see him, as are at least most of the older Weasley boys; Molly's the one with a temper that Ron and possibly Ginny picked up from her.
