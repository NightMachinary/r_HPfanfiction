Hi there!

I'm looking for any fics where Harry is a girl (either born or somehow turned, don't care) and she is in a relationship with a male character */that is not Draco/.* Any male character will do, preferably more popular characters and not a rare pair. Would prefer completed fics.

â€‹

Thanks in advance!!! :)


** Linkffn(Riddle And The Ancient Contract)

This is one of my favorite fanfics of all time. Fem!Harry/Marvolo Slytherin(Tom Riddle)

Edit: It's not complete but it gets quite far.

  What if it wasn't anything the current Potters had done that saved little Harriett Potter as an infant? What if the child prodigy Thomas Riddle had tweaked the horcrux spell before creating them? And what happens when they discover that nothing is exactly what it seems? FemHarry, DumbledoreBashing EXPLICIT SEX/ MENTION OF RAPE. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED. ON HIATUS - COMPUTER DIED

** linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao) --- slightly too much smut (and BSDM) for my taste, but even with skipping parts of no interest to me, there is still rather nice story remaining. In the end Harriet and Draco become friends, but her romantic interest is somebody else.

  Harry gets a surprise on his seventeenth birthday when he discovers a secret Lily Potter took to her grave; a secret that will change his life forever.He must learn to interact with the wizarding world all over again, and discovers the darker sides of inequality and misogyny. Not HBP compliant.

  Karma is real. It's a lesson that many have to learn the hard way. James and Lily Potter made the biggest mistake of their lives. The daughter they abandoned was more than they thought, and she becomes everything they wanted her twin to be. Belladonna Potter has her own plans for her future and no one will stand in her way. Hard work forever pays. A/N:fem!Harry, Wrong-GWL, Tomarry.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.
