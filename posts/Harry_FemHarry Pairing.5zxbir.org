*** I'd say it's because this pairing has a taboo feel to it. It''s like incest taken to another level. It's also a completely fantastical scenario which could never happen in real life, which makes it interesting. And finally there's the idea that your opposite-gender "clone" would understand you and could relate to you more perfectly than anyone else.

  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Holly/Harry/we're not sure what'll happen. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in subject to entanglement).
