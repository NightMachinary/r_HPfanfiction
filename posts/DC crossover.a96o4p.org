I've read a bunch of marvel crossovers and I enjoyed many but I was wondering if anyone had any good dc crossovers. (Preferably not harry having sex with all women who exist.)


** The last part of rorschach's blot "Make a Wish" trilogy is a crossover with DC. linkffn(Make a Wish; The Hunt for Harry Potter; Terminal Justice by Overkill AKA Irrational Intelligence)

** A completed story/series is the Last Mage series where upon being borne to Earth, Kal-El was found and blood-adopted by the Potters to replace their stillborn son.

The stories are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191520/1/The-Last-Mage-Of-Krypton][The Last Mage of Krypton]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12357124/1/Rising-From-The-Shadows][Rising From The Shadows]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12564837/1/A-Distant-Storm][A Distant Storm]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12831094/1/A-Challenge-Unexpected][A Challenge Unexpected]].

The third one is noteworthy in that Voldie and Grindelwald go on a road trip and it ISN'T a crackfic!

** I got an itch to go through the hp/DC archive on fanfiction.net, and it was honestly pretty lacking. I only looked at the m/f and no pairing fics, so it is possible I missed some good fics if they are slash... Some ok fics, nothing stellar.

Harry/Kara seems to be the dominate pairing, but I think it is just like 3 prolific authors pushing the pairing. Some interesting ideas here (Zatanna knowing about the magical world but being unable to tell anyone;. Magical worlds problems being minor and insignificant compared to DC's universe ending situations).

For 'ok' fics, I recall one where Dr. Fate got pissed off at the magical war spillover and stomped all over them, and another where Captain Marvel went to Hogwarts. Again, some interesting ideas but nothing that made my favorite list.

The only fic I ended up following on the entire crossover list was linkffn(12552385) which seems to have promise but is still early...
