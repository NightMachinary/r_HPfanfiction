Hey all. I have a physical job which allows me to listen to my phone while I work. I enjoy my HP fanfiction and I have a text to speech app which allows me to listen to it in the daytime.

Now I want to listen to "Prince of the Dark Kingdom", but the misspellings and typos are very unfriendly to the listening experience. Are there any mirrors which have attempted to 'clean up' the writing?


** Sorry this isn't helpful for you, but just wondering what text to speech app you use?

*** @Voice Aloud Reader. It is a good app, but when it comes across a word it can't pronounce (such as a typo) it spells it out.

**** If you DL the epub versions and use google text to speech within google books, that works quite well. She doesn't spell out misspelled words (so far) to me...you'll need the google talkback or text to speech (or both) to do it.

** VoiceDream Reader (originally iOS, now on Android, if I'm not mistaken) doesn't have the problem of spelling out words it doesn't recognize. I can't recommend it highly enough.

One great feature of it is that you can purchase lots of diffeent voices from... three or four providers, I think. Different accents and ways of speaking. I use British English voices for Potter fanfics.

I recommend Ivona voices - Ivona is a company that provides voices for text-to-speech purposes and are available in other apps and services. You can listen to samples on their website. They are much, MUCH less computer-ish than other voices (including those offered by other services that VDR uses - I honestly regret purchasing those others, they aren't worth it, IMHO).

I mostly use Emma and Amy. Emma is a bit higher pitched and sounds a little younger; Amy is a bit deeper and sounds a bit older. I find that Amy sounds better on headphones with less bass while Emma sounds way too high pitched on those same headphones.

Also, VDR lets you create your own pronunciation dictionary, which is great in Potter with the odd names and words.
