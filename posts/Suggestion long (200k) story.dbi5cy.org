** The longest that springs to mind from my reading is the linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series. Quite a good read, too. First four books complete, fifth is active, over 1M words.

Methods of Rationality is quite long (over 600K words), and complete, but opinions on it are sharply divided. If you haven't tried it, I do recommend giving it a go and making up your own mind. It has several fan sequels, too, such as Significant Digits (about 300K), and Following the Phoenix (over 200K).

Also, linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles) is canon-compliant and a really good reinterpretation of Severus Snape's character (over 600K). There's a reasonably good alternate ending/continuation, too, where Snape survived the Battle of Hogwarts. Warning: You may lose a lot of respect for canon!Harry by reading this.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** These are mostly Hinny fic recs, starting with A Second Chance by Breanie, California Dreamin' by jenorama (part of her Potterverse), The Changeling by Annerb and its two sequels. The It's Teatime series by frombluetored is a great read, showing the beginning of the Scorbus relationship (starting after CC) and how it develops, going into the next gen and adulthood, it also heavily involves the Potter family. A great read with lots of great OC's. I also recommend another Scorbus series, The Quietly Series by starlightpeddler for similar reasons.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?
