I just thought they would be interesting to read.


** I have nothing to recommend, but I would like to read something like this as well.

Care of Magical Creatures is treated very much in the same way as Hufflepuff. Nothing turns me off a fic faster than when a character says something like, 'Hufflepuff? You mean the house for average people?'. As if Hufflepuff is the place for non-achievers and the forgettable. Give me a break. The reason I bring it up is because Care of Magical Creatures is disregarded in a similar war.

I think it would be really interesting to read about a Harry that focuses on magical creatures. There's definitely a plot there for that.

**** u/Cersei_nemo:

  To be fair, the books seem to support that notion

Um... Cedric Diggory? Nymphadora Tonks?

Other than that, yeah, none of the "important ones" survive the war, except Professor Sprout. But then again, you have your martyrs like the ones mentioned above.

****** Cedric certainly did important things. He would have been chosen to be the only Hogwarts champion if not for Harry. He was chosen over every other entrant in the school. That's significant.
