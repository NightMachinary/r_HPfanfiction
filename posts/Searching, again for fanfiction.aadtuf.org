Hey there. Same thing as last time, only now the fanfiction I'm looking for is about Harry going back in time and being a teacher...in that work, he arranged his hair in some way or was dressed in some particular clothes (don't remember) which showed he was available for marrying and he ends up signing a marriage contract for Bellatrix Black (she's a fourth year I think)...also any good work with him going to the past and being a teacher or being part of a powerful family.

â€‹

Thanks.


** Sounds a lot like Linkffn(Delenda est) except for the marriage contract thing.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]] Harry takes a job as the Defense professor in the 1970s. There is a comedic scene in which Bella and Harry talk about clothes, but I don't recall there being any marriage contract. linkffn(12511998)

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** I read myself those 2, but it's not that......I remember that Harry and Bellatrix where on an island or at a villa and Harry has a vision or something and Bellatrix panicks and she has to call his "relatives" to get him out of that state...also, Harry was adopted or something in a very powerful family....so when he goes with his "brother" to the black family to negotiate, Harry and his "bro" scare the Blacks....also, he took some antidote (I think) as he was warned the Blacks will put something in their wine to persuade Harry to give them every advantage possible in the contract....
