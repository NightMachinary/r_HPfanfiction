Hello!

I am looking for fic recommendations of slash fan fiction that you liked even though you usually don't like/hate slash.\\
I think linkao3(the Second String by Eider_Down) falls into that category, but to be fair there isn't that much romance going on.


** [[https://lop.shoesforindustry.net/][Lust over Pendle]] is about the only slash fanfic I ever got on with. It's from 2001, so it's AU from a lot of the stuff from the later books. It is, however, entirely /brilliant/.

  PPS Kindly let Neville know that a really annoyed note from his grandmother follows by separate owl.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** I don't hate slash fic at all, but it perhaps does make up a smaller portion of my favorites list than not slash. I suppose Face Death In The Hope is technically slash given the pairing listed, but 53 chapters and 234k words (plus a 9 chapter, 49k word companion fic) in and there's been no slash content thus far. linkao3(5986366)

 

For fic that actually has slash content, my favorite would be Whispers in Corners. Though there is a reason that Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run still gets recced every once in a while. linkao3(1134255) linkao3(7331278)

** linkao3(House Proud by astolat) because the idea of sentinent wizard homes just enthralls me and it's incredibly well written. I also think the characters are very similar to how they are in canon.

I don't mind slash fic however, though I don't seek it out. I love that fanfic has fics for everyone.

** I liked Gelosaþ in Écnesse quite a bit, but I'm also a sucker for time travel fics so that offset the slash (I skipped over those scenes tbh). Note that there's two pairings listed: the het pairing is not the final one. linkao3(2352896)

** The only slash I really dislike is Harry/Death-Eater fanfic as it's often either slightly gross (Harry trying to bang people who believe he and people like him are animals and all) or quite 'The Death-eaters did nothing wrong/Aren't as bad as everyone says' apologist fic.

The only two in that vein I've actually enjoyed are Again and Again by Athey, and that's only because the idea that Eternal Return would eventually wear you down Stockholm-Syndrome-style to care for the only person who seemed to understand what you've been through. It's Harry/Tom Riddle.

The other is Like a Ghost in My Town series by Batsutoutsai. I just find the storyline interesting enough to mostly ignore the pairing, and seeing some of the reactions and family-time interactions in the second one.
