I recently saw it listed as someon's candidate for one of the top 5 fics written, I also see it recommended very often and as I had never read it, decided to give it a go. I've read the first 10 or so chapters and I'm not a fan but I was wondering what everyone else thinks of it?


** People say Alexandra is 'unlikeable' but I didn't feel that way about her at all. She's a 11 year old girl in the first book with a fiercely rebellious streak. I've met plenty of people like that at that age, they exist and Alexandra represents them.

Unlike a surprising amount of people, I never held interest in HP fanfiction for the mechanic of Harry Potter as a MC, perhaps because after hundreds of fics, he just started to read like a SI. Frankly, in AQ, her personality was what drew me in. It felt vibrant and real, which is rare for the HP fandom where most fanfics where authors are too afraid to give meaningful character flaws to their protagonists or their impression of flaws is to turn them into edgy sociopaths.

Perhaps for some people, Alexandra might've been the first time they encountered a MC that was less than upstanding in their unruliness because frankly, I've encountered too many truly loathsome protagonists throughout fiction that the charge of Alexandra being 'unlikeable' feels greatly exaggerated.

In any case, to discount AQ because of the MC is a disservice to its best aspect: the worldbuilding. The world of Magical America is very well developed, far better than JK Rowling's lazy canon America. It truly feels alive and genuine rather than a lazy caricature penned from Britain. Native Americans actually play their own role in magic and the setting befits the diversity of a country nearly the size of the entirety of Europe with regional magical cultures like the Ozarkers. The inevitable culture shock clash between the ingrained American muggleborn racial mindset and the magical pureblood mindset was fascinating to see depicted.

*** I suppose there's a difference between liking a character in the sense that you would enjoy their company, vs liking them in the sense that you want them to win and achieve their goals. The more mistakes of judgement someone makes, the worse it would be if they won, so, people can feel a tension between the protagonist trying to achieve their goals, vs the reader's sense that that would be a bad thing. It's hard to enjoy reading when you know that what's happening shouldn't be happening.

**** I don't see that as the case in AQ, to be honest. While the POV of the story is through Alexandra, the story doesn't narratively justify her flawed actions or behaviour as positive things or in the right. Instead they're are presented as is for being the flawed actions of an often impulsive young girl. It's human to make mistakes and for some, that means digging yourself into a hole. Alexandra gets herself into many scenarios that are self-inflicted, but the cinch should be that the excess of such actions have proportionate consequences.

For Alexandra, the consequences of her actions aren't immediate, so I suppose in that sense readers who want the gratification of seeing her hijinks promptly refuted may feel tested, but those real consequences do ultimately come.

***** What you're saying about her flaws reinforces my point. She makes mistakes that cause problems, which means that readers may feel an undercurrent of not wanting things to go her way because her way is harmful. It can be hard to enjoy reading in that situation, which is possibly what people mean by "unlikeable".

It's not necessarily bad writing, people just don't always enjoy it.

******** Ah, I see. Personally, the sentiment feels derived from scope and exposure. Readers used to the mechanics of HP fan fiction, where Harry as a MC is much more mild, and where authors have a tendency to fall in the '11-year old adult' routine may in conjunction with the wholly new setting and cast of AQ may find it more challenging to come to grips with her personality. Having been exposed to published fiction with truly loathsome protagonists, perhaps that's the difference I find in viewing her ascribed 'unlikeability' as rather exaggeration.

** I love the Alexandra Quick series. It has great world building and I feel like the author managed to capture the feel of the original books in a way that most fanfiction doesn't. I did find Alex to be unlikable at the start but she really grew on me. And the mysteries throughout the stories kept me hooked to keep reading. I also really enjoyed how the whole series is sort of a fun house mirror version of the books.

** I read Book 1 and Book 2 then stopped, MC was unlikable for me, being brash and making irrational decisions. Yes a bit like young Harry in PS and CoS, but it didn't have the same charm as the original series. Harry is an uneducated child that discovers a whole new world, Alexandra is just a problem child, who wants to prove to the whole world that she's there, a bit of the same as Ron's inferiority complex toward his older brothers, but for her it's the whole world that needs to give her attention, so she keeps doing wrong and dangerous things. Her character progression was not fast enough for me to stick to it.

** It is known for being very high quality but I never could get into it. It simply does absolutely nothing for me. I fought my way through the first part because I really wanted to understand the love for the series and wanted to like it but had to give up out of boredom and because I found the MC *very* unlikeable. Actually, all the characters are unlikeable now that i think about it.

I think of it more as something kids and young teenagers can read and enjoy after they finished the books. As a fanfiction it is nothing special.

That being said, the MC is unlikable and takes quite a few years to mature. The latest book back slides too. I loved some of the middle years but the latest book was just too much.

** Alexandra is what every child at once point wished it could be: running headfirst against the wall -- and making the wall crumble.

That -- in its joy and sorrow -- is the theme of the story. The sheer unbelievable amount of determination and personal agency, the responsibility that comes with being able to thus shape the world, and the consequences of doing so (and failing at it). And for that, I love Alexandra wildly. I'm rooting for her as fiercely as I never did e.g. for Harry.

On the other hand, the series does a stellar job in contrasting this agency, making it a powerful tragedy in the best, ancient greek sense. To quote Schopenhauer -- "A man can surely do what he wills to do, but he cannot determine what we wills", and a such, we are treated to an ever-escalating feedback loop of action and consequence. A world that wouldn't leave Alexandra alone over a tiny thing such as finding out who her father was is now (as of the last book) about to topple, and every step that led there had to happen, because both sides couldn't have acted in any other way, being who they were. That's the greek Hamartia -- a tale of necessity, the inability to outrun the fate that is created by virtue of your own existence, because no matter where you go, there you are. You don't get that very often in FF.

So yes, IMO one of the best FF there are, even if the mechanics in the early parts are rougher, but it's been a controversial one ever since it started.

**** It's more divided than that; plenty of people do like and recommend it. You can get seriously downvoted for bringing it up, but I think that says more about people not observing proper Reddiquette than it does about an actual consensus.

Honestly, when you take a look at the average fanfic, or even the top ten on FFN, I can't understand why MoR attracts so much hate. For all that the protagonist and the author may rub people the wrong way, it does do a lot of things right. It mocks many aspects of canon, but I don't recall any specific character being bashed (granted, this Harry doesn't like Ron very much, but the story overall treats him ok). It has a lot of humour, even if it may not be everyone's style. It's long, complex, complete, and has very few typos. And it has a fantastic antagonist.

And I found it to be a very thought-provoking read. So that's laughing, thinking, and depending on your level of investment in the characters, there certainly are scenes that could make you cry. Any fic that does all three is probably worth a look, if only to decide whether you like it.

Did you finish the whole thing?

***** It's very impressive. But holistically as a story? not so much. It's thought provoking, but never manages to do so without seeming condescending.

I think you underestimate how obvious and grating the preaching is. HPMoR is honestly the most preachy of any story I've ever read. It's practically designed to be fanfiction second. If you can stomach it or even like to consider the subject matter, it's very good. Otherwise, it's miserable and obnoxious.

It's also the story that got me into Harry Potter fanfiction. So i'm a little fond of it for nostalgia reasons.

****** That's a fair assessment, and yes, the fact that I find the philosophy discussions interesting does help. I don't mind people saying that it wasn't for them, that they're not interested in pondering utilitarian ethics. It's things like the comparison to eating faeces that cross a line IMO.

(And it was the first fanfiction I read, too. I don't recall the exact circumstances, but I think I'd just seen it mentioned several times, and became curious enough to take a look.)

Ok, but remember, the standard I mentioned was to compare it to the average fanfiction or to the FFN top ten. And by that measure, it stands well enough that I don't understand this subreddit hating it so much. I mean, I haven't read /all/ of the top ten, but I certainly found HPMoR to be a more impressive effort than eg To Shape and Change, more memorable than Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is, and in the absence of Nightmares of Futures Past, the top contender (ranked by number of favorites) is an M-rated Dramione fic - which is an automatic red flag as far as I can see.

It doesn't have to be perfect, but I think it at least merits "to each his own" rather than comparing it to eating faeces.

Whether you agree or disagree with him, you can learn something from his arguments. He does include characters who disagree with Harry, and on a number of occasions it turns out that they were right and Harry was wrong including the ending, where he discovers that Hermione was quite right to be suspicious of the Defence Professor, and that Dumbledore was actually doing the best anyone could in his position, while Harry very nearly destroyed the world, the day after nearly handing it to Voldemort on a platter.

** People's greatest grievance with the series is that Alexandra is hard to like. She's abrasive, untrusting, and makes mistakes. For me, that's what I love about it. It's a well written series with twists and turns that, while not groundbreaking, were a pleasure to read.

The world building is exquisite, with deep consideration to what and how a magical America could be. From the isolated Ozarker people with their brilliantly written dialogue, to the new age magicals with all their hippie goodness. It's very well put together and you only get hints of that in the beginning.

I don't like recommending fics on the basis that they get better later on. And, while Alaxandra does develop and improve, she does not lose that abrasive aspect that so many people don't like. If you can't get through the beginning, I don't see much point in asking you to slodge your way through something you don't like. Other people have given better, more well thought out perspectives on the series and if you're on the fence, I'd recommend it. Just don't make yourself hate it by forcing yourself to read something you don't like.

** Although I quite liked the first book, even on my first read-through, I will also acknowledge that it is by far the weakest book in the series. If you hated Alex's character, then your opinion probably won't change with later books, but the writing quality and editing does improve pretty drastically in Book 2.

The reason why so many people like the series are pretty simple:

I. The characters:

#+begin_quote
  "Boggarts aren't intelligent, Alex." He finally turned his head to look down at her. "They're Dark creatures, but they're not smart. They pull fears out of your head and give them form, but that's it."

  "So... whatever they show you just comes from inside your head? It's not real?"

  He was silent again for a moment, and then said, "Just because it's inside your head doesn't mean it's not real."
#+end_quote

In most fanfiction even canon characters are often reduced to indistinct author-inserts, with little real personality. Alex may be frustrating to read, but she is a consistent, complex, and tragically flawed character, which is something even some published novels struggle with. And she's far from the only compelling character in the series.

II. The Storytelling:

#+begin_quote
  "That is how men have always justified evil. Add the sums, solve the equations, calculate the benefit, write off the harm. As long as it is just columns and figures, not your own living children, it is a necessary sacrifice that happens every day, but elsewhere, to someone else."
#+end_quote

Being written in their entirely before being published, the AQ books have better storytelling than 99.9% of fanfictions. The amount of foreshadowing present in the series is downright amazing at times. There are things hinted at in Chapter 1, Book 1 that don't get revealed until Book 4. And whenever there is a big twist, it's almost always the kind that fits perfectly into the story, and makes you go "Of course! How didn't I think of that!"

III. The Worldbuilding:

#+begin_quote
  "America is an old land, Alex. The New World is just as ancient as the Old World, and just as full of secrets. But when European wizards came here, they wanted everything to be just like it was in the Old World. The problem is, back in Europe, wizards had been there for thousands of years. They controlled all the magic. They'd gotten rid of anything that could oppose them, long ago."
#+end_quote

The Alexandra Quick series has the best magical America, even counting canon magical America. The American mythology and folklore, the diverse cultures, the new magical concepts and worlds, the parallels to muggle America. Even the internal politics of the Confederation are explored. AQ's setting feels like a coherent, living, breathing world, in some ways more than the JK Rowling's wizarding world.
