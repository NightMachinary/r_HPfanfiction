I mainly read Harry and Snape (non-slash) and Hermione/Snape fanfics /(ones I've already read:/ [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cdkuzu/my_severus_snape_fanfic_library_list_please_help/][/https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cdkuzu/my_severus_snape_fanfic_library_list_please_help//]] /)/ . But I'm also wondering what other fanfics may be out there that have great Snarky Potions Master going on, regardless of ship.

I don't like m/m slash, so please don't offer that. If it's just going on between secondary characters and I can ignore it as part of the background, then that's OK. m/f or f/f is fine.

/Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions/ is probably the best Snarky Snape I've ever read. More fic suggestions like this please?

I need more grumpy, hilarious Potions Master in my life!


** Snape is very well written in linkao3(Runic War Warding). It's primarily a fem!Harry/Voldemort fic, but Snape is written very well whenever he gets a POV

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.
