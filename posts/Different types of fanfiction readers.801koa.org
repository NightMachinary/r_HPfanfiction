** haha yea, theres the 'i have headcanons, and i will tell you all' types

the 'hey lets switch up some genetics in here' fellas

and then the 'oooh kinky' ones.

and then I'm off in the corner desperately trying to explain various spacetime shenanigans and why theoretically wizards could just be really good at lying to the universe.

******* See the update [[https://redd.it/7x1cdx][here]].

TL;DR: Reddit changed their rules to be more ambiguous regarding sex and minors. Thus, so this subreddit doesn't get banned, our rules have changed. If the characters are underaged and getting frisky, take the fic links to PMs.

**** Wonder if anyone out there has taken the "Hermione = Harry's pet" trope literally? Like maybe she accidentally turns herself into a cat (not just a cat-faced girl, like in CoS, but a full-on cat) and Harry decides to take her home and take care of her since nobody else will?

**** ~goes to look at it and wonders if there'll be hair-brushing, cuddling, and taking-for-walks~

Well, there's brushing. Ctrl-F didn't find any cuddling despite the title, and inexplicably there's a My Little Pony reference.
