Don't care if story contains slash, so long is relationships aren't with huge age differences (HP/SS) or with people who'd never end up together (HP/DM).

Also do not mind Mentor!LV (or plots like it), so long as there is ample reasoning for it and HP isn't some crazy racist.


** It's not much, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11420609/8/The-Wizard-Who-Meddled-With-Time][chapter 8 of The Wizard Who Meddled With Time]] has Sirius admit that he did attempt to blow up Peter Pettigrew, killing all those muggles in the process.

** I'd like to see this as well, although characterizing Hermione as just a goody goody seems wrong. Among other things, she drugged people to impersonate them, blackmailed a sleazy journalist (and trapped her temporarily) and led Umbrige into a situation were she had to know Umbrige would probably get murdered (maimed at best).

*** Oh, absolutely. Hermione is one of the most pivotal characters in the series. Let's not forget she brewed a N.E.W.T. level potion to spy on other students in a rival house, ether.

I'm, however, searching for a fanfiction and you can't deny that in a lot of fanfictions they forget how much of a complete bad ass Hermione was. I'm only hoping to find a Hermione who is more... /direct/ with her rival's comeuppance.

** Linkffn(the prisoners cipher) has Harry as an insane maniac locked up in the Ministry and no one knows why but him

Linkffn(By the Divining Light) has the story starting out after Neville, the BWL, is already dead.

Linkffn(Unspeakable things) Malfoy disembowels Luna, so Harry breaks his arms and forces Malfoys wand hand into his head and casts a blasting curse.

Linkffn(The Lies That Bind) did not shy away from sinister shit. The Bellatrix situation was particularly gruesome.

Linkffn(Phoenix Corrupted) has Ariana survive, so Gellert and Albus stayed friends. Creates a whole knew world where Voldemort is teacher and Grindelwald is the Dark Lord.
