At one point or another I am sure that many of us have seen Dumbledore preach about forgiving or treading down the path to darkness.

Does a story exist, that highlights the complete idiocy of that mindset?

Taken to the opposite extreme, someone could technically spend an evening cutting bits off of Dumbledore, and killing him if he refuses to forgive it..

Has someone written something that points out the gigantic holes in that school of thought?


** I'm not so sure Canon Dumbledore was that much into forgiveness. The only one he tried to turn was Draco Malfoy, even though his attempt was quite clumsy and negligent. I think angry readers read too much into that one case and created a fanon Dumbledore who wanted to forgive at any price.

Now, if you want to read tough Dumbledores who are on top of his game or at least somewhat competent, try these stories:

*** The Dark Lord Never Died certainly has one of the better ruthlessly pragmatic Dumbledores I've seen. He's calculating and executes his plans with a disregard for individuals that speaks of a general fighting a war that's lasted 20 years. Overall it's the type of man I picture cannon Dumbledore would have become had his war not had a 13 year long cease-fire thanks to Harry.

*** AND SNAPE (despite the fact that he was a despicable human being)...and then there's the fact that Dumbledore didn't kill Deatheaters in any fights we have seen (he could have killed Bellatrix in the ministry for example, it's not like he had to fear someone punishing him for it! She's a convicted criminal and has broken out of prison, so killing her is ok IMHO - especially since prison can't seem to hold her (with her master breaking her out!))

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

#+end_quote

/(edit: spelling)/ You can argue that pretty much in every case below Dumbledore turned out to be correct regarding his stance. The problem, however, is that he was being correct because HP's universe was indulging him --- or, rather, indulging Rowling's faulty philosophy --- and not because logically what he was saying had much merit and validity.

You can also argue that [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Will_and_Testament_of_Albus_Percival_Wulfric_Brian_Dumbledore#The_Golden_Snitch][Dumbledore's will]] (as well as many other similar incidents) indicated that Dumbledore had some means for predicting and manipulating probabilities of reality in favour of his goals. But if that was the case, I think Rowling would've lampshaded and exploited such a good plot device much more.

And even if that /was/ what Rowling had intended by design, does it really carry a good [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop][aesop]] for children and young adults? If we were living in a world where magic had to be factored into our decisions, with all its “deepest” and “most impenetrable”, then perhaps yes. In our world, though, letting an enemy run away just in the hopes that --- one day, when we're at the mercy of said enemy, --- they won't be able to proceed and critically harm us just because of the mercy we've shown them previously, would be an extremely stupid philosophy to hold.

Same with keeping Kreacher in a position where it could compromise Order's OpSec in a wide variety of ways, same with letting Draco try his hand at various ill-advised assassination attempts for an entire year, with keeping Mundungus an Order member despite his multiple blunders and straight-out felonies, etc, etc.

  And Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at Dobby, and Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment.

  “Don't you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, *Mr Malfoy*?” said Harry.

  Lucius Malfoy rounded on him.

  “How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?” he said.

  “Because you gave it to her,” said Harry. “In Flourish and Blotts. You picked up her old Transfiguration book, and slipped the diary inside it, didn't you?”

  He saw Mr Malfoy's white hands clench and unclench.

  “Prove it,” he hissed.

  “Oh, no one will be able to do that,” said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry. “Not now Riddle has vanished from the book. On the other hand, I would advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord Voldemort's old school things. If any more of them find their way into innocent hands, I think Arthur Weasley, for one, will make sure they are traced back to you ...”

  “But --” Harry looked at him, aghast. How could Dumbledore take this so calmly?

  “But -- I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin killing *Pettigrew*! That makes it my fault, if Voldemort comes back!”

  “It does not,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Hasn't your experience with the Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed ... Professor Trelawney, bless her, is living proof of that. You did a very noble thing, in saving Pettigrew's life.”

  “But if he helps Voldemort back to power --!”

  “Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt. When one wizard saves another wizard's life, it creates a certain bond between them ... and I'm much mistaken if Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry Potter.”

  “I don't want a bond with Pettigrew!” said Harry. “He betrayed my parents!”

  “This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me ... the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew's life.”

  Harry couldn't imagine when that would be. Dumbledore looked as though he knew what Harry was thinking.

  “I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, Harry,” he said gently. “He would have saved Pettigrew too, I am sure of it.”

  “And *Kreacher* told you all this... and laughed?” he croaked.

  “He did not wish to tell me,” said Dumbledore. “But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I---persuaded him---to tell me the full story, before I left for the Department of Mysteries.”

  “And,” whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees, “and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him---”

  “She was quite right, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “I warned Sirius when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our Headquarters that Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect. I also told him that Kreacher could be dangerous to us. I do not think Sirius took me very seriously, or that he ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human's---”

  “Don't you blame---don't you---talk---about Sirius like---” Harry's breath was constricted, he could not get the words out properly; but the rage that had subsided briefly flared in him again: he would not let Dumbledore criticise Sirius. “Kreacher's a lying---foul---he deserved---”

  “Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Yes, he is to be pitied. His existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobby's. He was forced to do Sirius's bidding, because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved, but he felt no true loyalty to him. And whatever Kreacher's faults, it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher's lot easier---”

  “DON'T TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT!” Harry yelled.

  Standing against the ramparts, very white in the face, Dumbledore still showed no sign of panic or distress. He merely looked across at his disarmer and said, “Good evening, *Draco*.”

  Malfoy stepped forwards, glancing around quickly to check that he and Dumbledore were alone. His eyes fell upon the second broom.

  “Who else is here?”

  “A question I might ask you. Or are you acting alone?”

  Harry saw Malfoy's pale eyes shift back to Dumbledore in the greenish glare of the Mark.

  “No,” he said. “I've got back-up. There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight.”

  “Well, well,” said Dumbledore, as though Malfoy was showing him an ambitious homework project. “Very good indeed. You found a way to let them in, did you?”

  “Yeah,” said Malfoy, who was panting. “Right under your nose and you never realised!”

  “Ingenious,” said Dumbledore.

Had Dumbledore and the Order killed half of the Death Eaters in the Ministry battle, for example, and had the Order set up ambushes that killed half of the Death Eaters at the Battle of the 7 Potters, and had we seen more Death Eaters die in the Batlte of Hogwarts, then we'd not have this idea about Dumbledore forgiving everyone.

As it is the Impression is that the good guys don't kill, and Dumbledore as the leader gets the blame.

** I always liked Harry's response to Dumbledore in Three to Backstep:

#+begin_quote
  "You also speak of forgiveness, Headmaster. Well, before you can have forgiveness there must first be recognition by the perpetrator they did something wrong; /and/ be sorry for doing it. That's remorse. Next is repentance. They must, more or less, vow not to do it again. Thirdly, they must face atonement. In part, that's punishment. Then, once they feel genuine remorse, have accepted they've done wrong, repented and made a promise to fix their ways... and been properly punished for it... then, and only then, can forgiveness be considered. Not before. Even the /Holy Bible/ recognises that. You seem to just want to skip the important steps and get right to the forgiveness part. /That. Does. Not. Work./"

*** Yea that one pretty much best hits it on the head. The 'Holy Bible' bit annoys me slightly though, religion has never held a large roll in the HP world and it seems pretty OOC for Harry to bring it up in an argument/debate (though maybe that's individual to the fic?).

**** As far as I can remember, that was the only mention of the Bible in the fic. I think he was making the point that Christianity was big on forgiveness, and even they didn't forgive the unrepentant.

***** Fair enough then, it's just one of those things that I've learnt to look out for in fics that point towards it not being worth my time.

****** Yeah, that's why I didn't link it initially. It's a guilty pleasure. Though certain scenes are priceless (defeating the dragon in the first task was great!)

  Albus Dumbledore gets an unexpected visitor in his office one late summer night. The Headmaster finds himself talking to a monster he never knew could arise from his actions. Darkish.
