I just reread linkffn(his angel) and was wondering if there were more fics like it where Harry acts in his own best interests but is then dragged into the war No bashing no slash well written fics only pls no fem Harry preferably without evil dumbledore


** Sorry to kinda derail this for a sec, but is /His Angel/ worth the read even though it says discontinued? I have put off reading it for the longest time because of that.

Edit: I did some looking and one that I recommend is Harry Potter and the Metamorph on FFN. Hope that helps somewhat.

*** It is worth it It takes tropes that I usually hate I like bonds and uses them properly And even though it says discontinued the last chapter is a summary of what the author had planned for the rest of the fic

*** Depends on what type of fic you're looking for. It's a guilty pleasure bash-fest. I read it a long time ago, but it's not something I'd recommend.

  Starts off from the Quidditch world cup, Harry finds a more important reason to fight for and that sometimes, a fairytale or legend is a lot more than it seems. Discontinued. Sorry.
