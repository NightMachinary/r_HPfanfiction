Basically, I want a fic where Harry's kinda powerful and is described to be ethereal or whatever. It doesn't have to be a genfic, and there can be pairings, though I'd prefer Harry to not be with Ginny, Luna, Hermione, Fleur, Cedric, or Victor. No harems, either!

What I'm looking for is where Harry is either in Slytherin where he's kinda a leader/the king or whatever (though that's not a requirement) or where he's in another House and somehow amasses all of these loyal followers. He doesn't even have to be really dark or anything, either, I'd just prefer he not be super light or under Dumbledore's thumb. Hell, he can even be a Gryffindor with a crap ton of followers!

Thanks for any recs!


** dont really have anything that matches your request, but there are alot of creature fics that describe him as beautiful and the like
