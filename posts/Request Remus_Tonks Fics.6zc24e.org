So next to Harry/Ginny Remus/Tonks is one of my least favorite pairings, at least in canon. I love Rowling but her romance was mediocre at best in my honest humble opinion (Although Molly/Arthur is one of my favorite canon pairing). So I'd love to read any stories (specifically multi-chapters) with Remus/Tonks as a main pairing, or at least having a large role.

Bonus if any of the stories with Remus/Tonks is after the second war, if not it's fine. But would be great to read them. Remus and Tonks got killed way too soon.

Any rating is fine.

Yea, about that... check out linkffn(a little more time by jess pallas). It's a really cool story about Teddy Lupin trying to save his parents and focuses on the romance between Remus and Tonks. Really nice, unique story.

  DH Spoilers Was it possible to save two lives without altering history? Was it possible to given them a future twenty years after they had supposedly died? Teddy Lupin thought so...
