I want scenes of an Indy!Harry having a go at Dumbledore in the middle of a Halloween feast, and Dumbledore just has no idea what's he's talking about, or is hurt that Harry could think that. Is there anything like this?


** linkao3(6192976) is what I instantly thought of, but it doesn't quite fit.

  My take on the manipulative Dumbledore stories - from Dumbledore's point of view. Written late at night, not proof-read. Will probably go over it later, if people think it's worth a tidy-up.

*** This is what I thought of when i read this post. In the grande scheme of things as well as considering how long the fic itself is, the revelation is not that influential to the end plot.
