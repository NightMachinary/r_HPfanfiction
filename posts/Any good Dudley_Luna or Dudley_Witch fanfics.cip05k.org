I recently read a fic that had Dudley/Luna. Hopefully the author will continue it, but in the mean time I would like some recs that are similar.

Prefer, Dudley/Luna but it can Dudley/Witch.

linkffn(Unlikely, Impossible, and a Little Bit Looney)

Thanks

  Dudley was captivated from the moment he met her, but their relationship won't be easy. After all, how could a Dursley last with someone so un-Dursleyish as Luna Lovegood?

** Linkffn(magical relations) features a wizard!dudley and is a pretty good read. Sorted into a different house from Harry. And it's been a while since I've read it, but it's through the summer after 5th year, so I'm pretty sure there's been some kind of pairing explored for Dudley

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

** I actually like the idea of Dudley meeting a witch and starting a relationship without knowing she's a witch. Then he invites Harry over to meet his girlfriend/fiancee, and the whole witch thing comes out because they went to Hogwarts together.

*** Omg! Yes! This would be excellent. Do you have any recs?

Edit: Actually, what you described is very similar to the fic that I mentioned in the OP.

Do you have any other recs though?

**** No, I've never actually read anything like this. Sorry!

I just got the image of Harry locking eyes with Cho Chang and absolutely cracking up laughing.

  JK Rowling once said in an interview that she thought about having Dudley have a magical child on platform 9 3/4s at the end of book seven, but decided that no magical blood could survive contact with Vernon Dursley's DNA. In a long list of ideas she got wrong about what should happen to her characters post-canon, I've always thought that this was pretty near the top.Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he has an encounter that will uproot the course of his life, change his relationship with his cousin and his parents, and introduce him to some really fun new alcoholic beverages.Mostly non-ship focused, but there are plenty of relationships happening in the background. Despite my reservations, this mostly takes the Harry Potter epilogue as written, but makes a few significant changes the plot revolves around.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
