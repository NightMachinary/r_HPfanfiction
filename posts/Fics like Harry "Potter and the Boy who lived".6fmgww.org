So I recently came across this absolute stellar fic and I was wondering if there are any close/like that. The most I looked forward to a reunion of Harry and Nathan for the TWT but it sadly never came to that. Also does anybody have info about the author and if there is any chance that the story will be continued?


** Welcome to an example of the "One-Of-Kind"-Story.

Like A long journey home (for me at least) there is simply no story which comes close at the moment in a similar genre. Sure, there are a few Raveclaw!Harry stories, and some more WBWL-Stories, but non like the one you mentioned. I fully agree that this story is great.

** I think there's a few more chapters on the DLP forums than those on ff.net, but that's it. I don't think there's anything that comes very close to the worldbuilding in that fic.

*** Thank you very much, gonna register myself over there asap to read the remaining chapters, too bad it wasnt finished. Is it common for fics to be completed elsewhere further than on ff.net?

** You should precise what you are looking for. Durmstrang? Academically-focused Harry? Harry who is not a Boy-Who-Lived?

*** I think this poor fool has, much like me before him, fallen in love with the fic and is desperate for more. If the Santi ever finishes writing it i will give him my first-born and perhaps my wife if he makes it long!

*** How would that find similar fics? The term "boy who lived" is basically in every Harry Potter story.

*** I think, based on the description, that OP was looking for something more than an 'other boy-who-lived' story. I'd assume that they're looking for a story with a similar relationship to the one they read, rather than just any story where Harry isn't the Boy-Who-Lived.
