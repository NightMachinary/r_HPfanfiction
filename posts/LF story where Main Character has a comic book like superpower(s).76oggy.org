By this I mean things like telekinesis, teleportation, cosmic powers. That sorta thing. And yeah, I know they can use magic, but I mean something like, ________ has had telekinesis since a young age. It would be cool if it isn't wandless magic, instead it's some other force, but I just want that sweet, sweet, bassassery. Teleportation is preferred, as is gen. Thanks.


** linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon) has the protagonist using invisible Doctor Octopus arms.

** Linkffn(11226939)

It's short, and almost certainly dead.

In his first year at Hogwarts, Harry starts rapidly developing his kryptonian heritage.

  Harry Potter is far more than even the most imaginative Wizard can imagine. The truth was hidden from everyone, save one man. How will Harry cope with the fact that he is far more than just a wizard. Warning Character Death.

*** Alternatively, there's linkffn(12191520) by TheBeardedOne. Very very good series. I read it on a whim and was surprised by the quality. It's a Harry is Kal-El story, but the world building is great. Give it a try. It's completed, with a completed sequel, and a third currently updating. I think it's around 200K words altogether right now. Very much worth your time

**** A potentially rude-sounding question, but a question I feel has to be asked: how in bloody hells is it quality if the author can't even spell “Avada Kedavra”?

Because for me, and probably many others too, continued attempts to get through it do rely on the answer to that question.

***** Despite that, it's actually quite entertaining.

Of course, I cringe every time I see a their/they're/there or your/you're error, so I feel your pain.
