So a long time ago I read an incomplete fic, and I remembered liking it. I would love to read it again, but I am having issues finding it. Help would be appreciated!

--------------

Things I /know/ the fic includes:

1) Opens on the year of the Triwizard Tournament

2) Harry is older than canon (6th or 7th year) and is /not/ in Gryffindor

3) Harry's younger brother is in 4th year and is friends with Ron/Hermione

4) Harry and his bro have a good relationship

5) Harry has a leg injury and a limp because of it

6) Harry has an OC former girlfriend in his house

7) It's Harry/Fleur

--------------

Things I am /pretty sure/ the fic includes:

1) Harry's brother has a crush on (or possibly just started dating) Hermione

2) Harry's house is Ravenclaw

3) Harry's brother is the BWL -- their parents are dead

4) Harry's injury came from helping and/or rescuing his brother + friends in their canon-ish adventures

5) Harry and Fleur end up meeting (unplanned) in an out of the way corner of the castle (a terrace i believe). It was "Harry's spot" or something, which Fleur happened across

6) Harry is kinda grumpy

7) Harry's best friend is a canon-named character. I believe it's Roger Davies

--------------

Thanks for any help!

** Wow, what a find! I was so sure I had exhausted the roster of non-cliche sibling fics out there. To find one that even passes for readable is exciting.

Edit: It does hit some cliches, but the writing is good enough, and the dialogue natural enough to where I can look past them

*** Yeah, I prefer sibling fics where they get along well like this one, as opposed to hating each other. Good ones are few and far between :)

Any good sibling fic recommendations? I'm on a bit of a sibling kick right now, spawned by a re-read of linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]])

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

**** Well there's the obvious linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived). Then there's the less well known linkffn(Anti-Hyphen). A lot of people like linkffn(The Prince of Slytherin), but I could never get into it.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance, HIATUS, but being worked on as of 2-1-16

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
