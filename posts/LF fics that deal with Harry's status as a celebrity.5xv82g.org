Other than in books 4 (in the romance department), 5, and a little bit of 6, Harry's celebrity status separate him from his peers, other than people staring at his scar a lot. Are there good fics where Harry has to deal with even more hero-worship, the press alternatively worshipping him, and hounding him and attacking him even more than in the books?

  First year: "Celebrities," Harry said. "Fame makes them mad. I take it the wizarding world doesn't really have them, then?" Draco and Ron exchanged glances. "No, not really." AU, assorted oneshots and snippets.
