*** That was mine, too. It wasn't finished back then, but it was still massive and I read it in a few days.

I tried to pick it up again, now that he is done, but i couldn't get back into it.. I'm kind of curious how it ended, maybe i'll give it another try.

I somewhat enjoyed the ending, but in many respects it feels more like an "origin story" for HJPEV and [[/spoiler][Hermione Granger]] as the heroes of a sequel that will never be written (except by fans over in [[/r/HPMOR]]). Things were wrapped up between Harry, Dumbledore, and Quirrel, but the ostensible central conflict of HPMOR (finding the Hidden Truth behind Magic and using Magic and Science to end Death for everyone) was left only partially solved.

I'd say it goes to show the split priorities of MOR as a story - how it tries to juggle too many plot threads and tries to be too many things for the reader, straying from the premise in the process - but what the fuck do I know? I'm not, like, a professional critic. Maybe I'm coming off as too charitable to the story.

***** Here's a good review by a professor:

[[http://danluu.com/su3su2u1/hpmor/]]

Pretty awesome deconstruction and rebuttal to anyone thinking it's a cohesive story.

Basically the philosophy and pedagogy are bad, the plotting and pacing are terrible, there are major issues with conflicting themes and lack of consequences, and HJPEV is an obnoxious self-insert for the author.

** It was actually linkffn(Seventh Horcrux). So I guess I'm proof that you don't need to be familiar with fanfiction tropes and cliches to appreciate it.

Plus it handles time travel the best.

** In middle school, I took a lot of personality quizzes. It was just a very 2006 thing to do, you understand.

Well, on a website called Quizilla, there was a trend where you would take a quiz answering questions about what boy from Hogwarts you wanted to end up with, and you would get a

#+begin_example
  **~~[[LONG RESULT, GIRLS ONLY]]~~** 
#+end_example

Anyways, eleven year old me was really into Ron Weasley. So I would binge-take these quizzes. There were ones for your marriage after Hogwarts, playing spin-the-bottle (so naughty! Usually these involved the boy being very sweet and tenderly kissing you).

At some point I started /writing/ those quizzes. Then it was a natural progression into finding FFN and HPFF and realizing, wow, there's a whole community for this stuff.

A part of me wishes I could still track down some of those Quizilla fics. The other part of me is glad most of them have been lost forever. I couldn't tell you if they were honestly very good or if I was just so desperate and naive that I didn't care.

** Eh, for a lot of post-GoF readers like me, it was Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent, linkffn(288212). Some rascal had the bright idea to convert it to a pdf, rename to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and spread it through Kazaa (old p2p file sharing application, popular in 2003). Which is how we desperate HP fans got a hold of it.

This led to searching who actually wrote the thing - it was obviously pretty well written but it was doubtful that JK was suddenly writing Harry/Hermione sex scenes xD. This led to discovering fanfiction.net. Which was a brutal eye-opener, because in those days NC-17 fics where prevalent in the site.

** A little story just called "Charm" by silverquill11. Not on ffn anymore but I did track it down on another site a few months back. When I first started reading dramione was my thing. This was post hogwarts mostly fluff, but it was the first story I ever really followed as it was coming out, excited for each new chapter. It's actually the reason I created an ffn account, I wanted to leave a review, the author did shout-outs at the end of every chapter. She left the original shout-outs in the story on the new site, and it's really neat to see it still there.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
