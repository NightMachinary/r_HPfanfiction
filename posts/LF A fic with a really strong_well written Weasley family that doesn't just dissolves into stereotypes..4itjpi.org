I'm sure there's plenty, I just normally don't go looking for Weasley fics. Call it a weird hankering but I just want to read some good character development for those characters.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

** Forging the Sword by MystShadow gives a really well written Weasley family, albeit not in focus (save Ron). I'm especially fond of the portrayal of Percy and Mr. Weasley. One of my favorite segments:

#+begin_quote
  It was pretty impressive, though. Mr. Weasley seemed to know everybody. He'd kept up a fairly constant stream of comments all the way to retrieve the water and back. ("That was Cuthbert Mockridge, Head of the Goblin Liaison Office... Here comes Gilbert Wimple; he's with the Committee on Experimental Charms; he's had those horns for a while now...")

  ...

  By the time they reached their camp again, Mr. Weasley had pointed out an obliviator, two unspeakables, an auror, a secretary for the improper use of magic department, a diplomat for the being division in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, and a member of the Floo Regulation Committee.

  Ron was apparently used to it, because he didn't seem all that captivated. But from what her friend had said, she'd gotten the impression that even though Mr. Weasley headed the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts office, he wasn't really that important.

  That wasn't what she was seeing now.

  Well, maybe he isn't important important, but he sure seems to know a lot of people.

  Though come to think of it, hadn't he sponsored a bill a year or two ago? The one that Lucius Malfoy had been so determined to foil that he'd placed the Diary in Ginny's hands. And before that, she'd heard from Harry that Mrs. Weasley had said something about Mr. Weasley deliberately writing loopholes into one of the laws so he could make his magical car...

  She stared at the man. He was kneeling by the fire, trying to light a match. The evidence of failed attempts lay all around him in splintered litter. Finally he managed to spark one into flame -- and promptly dropped it in surprise.

  She tilted her head.

  It's like looking at one of those illusion drawings.

  One way: friend's father, kind of silly about muggles, a good man. Another way: writes and sponsors his own laws with private loopholes, trades favors for favors, knows everyone in the Ministry by name.

  Both are true.

  Which meant seeing him only one way... would be false.

  "Dad's been having fun with matches," Fred sighed.

  At her side, Ron was rolling his eyes. "Want to help him, Hermione?"

  "Of course." She shook herself out of her thoughts but tucked them away carefully for later contemplation, then stepped closer to the fire. "Here Mr. Weasley, let me show you how it's done."

And for Ginny, obviously The Changeling by Annerb is the height of it's craft, as a character-focused piece centering around her.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

** Linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond by Council) has a well developed Ginny, and we see a lot more of her family from her point of view.

Linkffn(backwards with a purpose) has a lot of weasleyness, but harry gets on their bad side, which is both interesting and different.

*** I really like the portrayal of the Weasleys in Backwards with a Purpose. Deadwoodpecker's navigation of the difficulties inherent in changing circumstances without changing characters was well written. The Weasleys are quite similar in character to their canon counterparts despite the drastically different perception of Harry, the end result being actions that respect the same people in a different world.
