Could be a different character from BtVS too I guess. Seems like this would be interesting, since the worlds are sort of similar, but quite different.

*** Seem interesting, and well written thus far, but fairly different than what I meant. Was specifically looking for fics where the two universes are still separate, but a Buffy character is reborn into the HP world either as a main char or an OC, and then either has their memories immediately or they are unlocked at some point early on (thus enabling the skipping of most of the pre hogwarts time period). This looks good though so I will read it.

** You want a fic that is good && crossover && btvs && reincarnation? It's incredibly unlikely that you'll find such a combination.

*** Reincarnation fics aren't that rare(though weirdly they seem more prevalent in other fandoms than in HP), though they are usually people from our world instead of another fictional world. Which is shame as that concept sounds interesting to me. So yeah this might not actually exist :(. Maybe I should make another topic where I request fics where characters from any other fictional world are reincarnated into HP, or the reverse. That would hopefully have more matches.

** I can't think of any, but you should try twisting the hellmouth. It is a Buffy crossover website.

The flat next door is my favorite HP/Buffy crossover, it isn't what you were looking for, but you might enjoy it.

** I second "The Flat Next Door", even though it's not a reincarnation fic.

"Flowers, Hold the Funeral" by amusewithaview is a one shot that has Buffy reincarnating as Harry's twin sister. I really enjoyed it, although by the time I got to the end of the story I was very disappointed it was just a one shot and didn't cover any of their Hogwarts years.

*** Its too bad that fic is a oneshot as yeah that is basically exactly what I was looking for concept wise. Though that writing style, while it works for a one shot, is too flowery for a multi chapter fic imo.
