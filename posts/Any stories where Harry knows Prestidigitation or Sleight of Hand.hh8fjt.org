Something that starts with professors and upper years being gobsmacked that this little kid seemingly knows high tier silent and wandless vanishing/conjuration. And later on he starts using *magic* magic to buff his delight of hand with internally expanded sleeves full of tricks and whatnot. This later becomes combat effective with him being told do disarm himself and his pockets just start dropping daggers and swords like they're going out of style and suddenly, woops! Turns out they're all charmed to make a tornado of death to protect Harry and home in on anything that threatens him.


** linkffn(Trickshot by JustBored21) is a bit like that, tho it's still in first year.

  Dumbledore expected a weak Harry who lived with the Dursley's. He was not expecting a Harry who grew up on the streets and has no interest in playing a hero. After being abandoned in America by the Dursley's Harry learnt to survive using his brains and magic. Dumbledore, Hermione and select Weasley bashing. Dark/grey Harry.

** The Closer You Look: linkffn(12206178)

Sadly abandoned fic (last update 2017), Harry gets inspired by stage-magicians and essentially starts learning actual magic by using sleight-of-hand as a starting point. His spells are cast using a deck of cards, or a prop wand.

  Not a lot of things could affect Harry's mundane life in the house of his abusive relatives. But then, you don't need extraordinary things to obtain extraordinary results. A seemingly simple step pitched his life into a direction no one had ever expected. Harry Potter, the Jack of all trades and Master of Misdirection. Intelligent! Harry.
