I am looking for a good story about James and Lily somehow coming back. Pairing does not matter. I just want a decent length and hopefully some completed ones.


** I really love this one about Lily coming back. The interaction between her and Harry is the best. It's also an interesting take on post-HBP. But unfortunately it hasn't been updated in a long time.

Linkffn(2689413)

There is also this one linkffn(9674614), but it's only 9 chapters...it was updated recently though.

I haven't read this one linkffn(3208062) but it follows your premise I think.

  Harry knows now what he has to do. He's the only one who can. Everyone helps him out with the fulfilment of the prophecy, but he receives help from last person he would have ever expected, a relative long thought dead. AU DH

** linkffn(Together Again) Good news, James and Lily are back! Bad news, it's Harry's Fifth Year, where he is more high-strung than usual. More good news, Umbridge has evoked the wrath of the Marauders.

linkffn(Best Served Cold) Turns out, all you need to resurrect someone is the right paperwork filed properly.

  Wands are finicky things... What if that night in the graveyard actually did bring Harry's parents back to life? Life just got a bit more complicated and nothing will ever be the same.

** There was a fic that I remember reading waaaaaay back in roughly 2002 that had James randomly coming back to life, followed by Lily months later. The entire basis of the story had something to do with those that Voldemort had killed were slowly coming back to life because of the events in the Graveyard after the Third Task. The story was decently long, and complete.

I haven't been able to find it in /years/. Anybody know what I'm talking about? I would love to read this again to see how bad my nostalgia-googles are.
