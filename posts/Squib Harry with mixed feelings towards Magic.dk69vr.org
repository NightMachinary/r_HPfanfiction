Harry is squib and lives with his parents and siblings. He is jealous of his siblings, afraid of magic 'cause his siblings constantly pranks him which he cannot defend himself or retaliate. But loves enchanted items like brooms, Sirius bike, dicta quills, chocolate frogs, portkeys...etc. It will be even better if falls in love with a witch. No bashing.


** I always wanted to see one where Harry's a Squib and James and Lily Instead of rejecting him are overly supportive and Harry's thing is proving himself as a adult... Only for more shitty Wizard to get in his way and thus he must... Move them out of his way

  The day Harry Potter turned eleven was the day he would have re-entered the magical world. But the letter never came; Harry Potter was a Squib. Dismissed by the wizards, he makes a quiet life for himself and will not stand for them to ruin it.
