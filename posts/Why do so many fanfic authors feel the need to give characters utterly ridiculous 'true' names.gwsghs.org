Just read a fanfic that was decent up until it introduced a soul bond and 'real' parentage for Hermione right after each other where her 'real' name is "/Gwendolen Morgana Athena Slytherin Black"/ and I genuinely just couldn't stop laughing. It's not supposed to be funny, it's still a very serious fic', but daaaaaamn.

Like, why can't it just be 'Hermione Black', or even it really needs a first name change 'Bellatrix Black' or 'Athena Black', or 'Cassiopeia Black'. At least it keeps with the theme and doesn't sound totally ridiculous.

Yeah, I know some of the purebloods have (somewhat) ridiculous names, but Andromeda, Narcissa, Draco, Bellatrix, Lucius, Sirius etc aren't that bad really, I think it's a decent level, they're slightly unusual but most often actually names used in real life and often fit a theme, and when they have middle names it's usually just the one on a similar level. (i.e. Draco Lucius Malfoy, Sirius Orion Black etc)

I saw another the other day where it (for some reason) changes Draco's 'full' name to 'Draconis' and it was a bit weird but okay, but there are so many that everyone knows about Harry being Hadrian James Potter Black Slytherin etc etc and now this one and I'm sure there a tons and tons of others that are similar and it's just all so ridiculous.

So why? It can't be just for a 'magical' sounding name, because you can do that easily by just using a single slightly unusual name (like JK actually did with loads of characters as I mentioned). And they can't honestly think it sounds cool or good right? That ship sailed looooong ago with Ebony Darkness Dementia Raven Way, and I think at this point the general consensus was that My Immortal was SUPPOSED to be ridiculous as a (really bad) parody.

So thoughts? And what other ridiculous name changes have people seen?

Edit: She's also a 'Erinyes' (Greek Goddess? Magical Creature?) and heir to the lordship of Black, Gaunt, Peverell, Rosier, Ravenclaw, AND Slytherin.

just whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.


** I completely agree. It reminds me of when I was a kid, and downloaded a list of Japanese baby names to name my manga characters. ðŸ¤¦

Weird names definitely get in the way of my appreciation for a fic.

**** From the sound of their author notes and such, they seemed like an adult, though I do agree with the teen/tween bit, but you can usually tell within the first couple of paragraphs if that's the case, this one was perfectly acceptable (not brilliant, but completely fine) up until it went totally ham handed with Hermione's name and heritage/titles and her 'mate'

** I've read one fic with "True Names" that I didn't hate. It was actually a smut fic, but the names were generally only three part names, pullled from older non-modern-passing Latin, Welsh, Irish, English etc names. Chosen for their meaning. They worked well in their role, being something that wasn't generally shared with anyone, rather than being some Hadrian-Potter-Black-Peverell nonsense that you demand to be called by.

â€‹

I looked one of them up briefly. Ron's was Aedel Ruaidh Ri Weasley. Only used once, along with its meaning. Totally get why people don't like them at all though, as they are generally red flags for bad writing.

*** That's not as bad, 'true magical names' don't bother me as much, because they usually only used once or twice and don't really matter that much, but this, and what I'm focusing on, is more when they find out their 'real' name, either because it was shortened and they didn't know about it (usually Harry) or because they were adopted/kidnapped whatever.

Here this is now Hermione's actual birth/official name and after finding out she's like 'Am I Hermione or Gwendolen' now, so if someone was to continue reading the fic' Hermione will most likely literally cease to be Hermione and be 'Gwendolen Morgana Athena Slytherin Black'.

** I think most of the times it's ridiculous, but Harry sort of makes sense because it's often a nickname. Hadrian seems a bit...odd though since it's very "Malfoy-ish." Henry, Harrison, Harold, etc. all make more sense with what we know of the Potters and James and Lily.

** I think they believe that it makes it feel more Pureblood and high tier society if they are excessively long and complicated. It also makes the characters seem not normal, which some authors think is a good thing?

*** I agree that that is what they're probably going for, but....we know quite a few pureblood names from canon, and NONE of them are that long or overly complicated/fancy. So I'm just like, why take it further? Why make it so ridiculous?

** John Icarus, Alphard Marius and Ramsey Cygnus are my character's names. They are Tom Riddle's bastard son, Sirius Black's son and Bellatrix's son respectively.

I hope those don't get too wack.

Alphard Marius is Sirius saying FUCK YOU in names to his parents.

Ramsey fits the R theme of recent Lestranges, Cygnus is the name of his Black grandfather.

And John Icarus is a common boy's name and a sort of injoke warning to the character, given to him by his mom.

*** that's fine, first name - middle name - surname is established and fine (honestly for me having a middle name makes more sense then not) and their names for the most part fit with conventions.

Alphard, Marius, Cygnus are all reused from canon and fit the Blacks 'celestial object/concept' theme, while Ramsey is a fairly well used English name, John is religious and incredibly common, and Icarus is a slightly unusual name but fits as is well known Greek figure.

Honestly I'm just surprised you went for 'John' as Tom Riddle's sons name (it is a very common name) but I guess he didn't get a say in the name?

Considering people usually give Tom's sons a name as something like Mordred Marvolo Salazar Herpo Black Gaunt Slytherin I commend you. :D

**** John's mother named him, yes. Birth mother. He was not raised by her, mostly because she went to Azkaban soon after the First Wizarding War ended for various crimes, being a Pure-Blood Death Eater from a family deeply aligned with Voldemort. She had some advance warning however, and deposited him in a muggle orphanage, with every intent of reclaiming him when the Dark Lord returned. That took far longer than she expected.

Thus, John was adopted and raised by a muggle family. He goes by his father's last name as his mother, while not old enough to have been at Hogwarts when his father was, was old enough to know that Voldemort had once been Tom Riddle, as her parents had been. Tom Riddle's name, by the point John is born, is largely forgotten. To hide her son under it is a smart move.

Icarus was chosen because of the Greek Myth it represents and the life lesson ought to be taken from it. John must not forget what befell his namesake. But it is also a name I could see going around in his mother's family, so it could also be simply that.

Alphard Marius Black is named for a blood-traitor and a squib, respectively, (though the former a treasured uncle dead before his time for Sirius) so named solely to irk Walburga and Orion.

I hope that clarifies it further.

Cheers,

** Those regular names aren't cool. It's ridiculous to us, but to them (teens) it makes the character more special, I guess.

And I think the Erinyes are those 3 sisters. The vengeful ones and one of them is Alecto.
