  After GoF Harry is feeling depressed, seeing how the Dursley are treating him, Dumbledore decides to take him in. To which lengths will the headmaster go to insure their safety?

I have a lot more that focus more on the Harry/Snape relationship with Dumbledore strongly encouraging it, but Dumbledore honestly plays a relatively minimal role in those. I'll be honest and say that *Harry Potter and the Enemy Within* and its sequel is one of the better fanfictions I have ever read in terms of characterization and general writing ability. *Web of Lies* is a little more iffy in terms of both, but if you have a relatively higher ability to suspend your disbelief, I find it to be enjoyable as well. It also has sequels, which you can find from the author's page.

If you're curious for more recommendations, you can check out my page [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Epurplekyu][here]] which contains the majority of the fanfictions I've read and enjoyed. Sort by category and scroll down to find the Harry Potter ones in alphabetical order.

*** I think some people tend to view him as manipulative in the canon stories. Therefore, when then write their own, they exaggerate his "evil" qualities for the sake of the story/plotline.

*** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1624376/ARedHair][ARedHair's profile]] goes into a lot of detail of the failings of Dumbledore and also a lot of the plot holes that occur. It's a great read and breaks down a lot of Dumbledore's failings logically. The main problem tends to come down to the fact that what we're told about him doesn't really match up with how he acts. They say that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and it seems that Dumbledore is single handedly building an interstate strait there.

I like seeing 'Good Dumbledore' fics, but unless it's pretty massively AU it can be tough to pull off, some like [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4605681/1/The-Real-Us][The Real Us]] stay closer to canon by creating their own revisionist history.

**** ARedHair presents the most nuanced and balanced discussion on the issue I've seen. However, I've always felt that many of the points made by him (and, less eloquently, by others) can be explained away pretty easily.

"[Dumbledore exercised] considerable arrogance presuming those charms were sufficient [when leaving baby Harry on the Dursley doorstep]" - Dumbledore is THE living authority on all things magic (according to an interview with J.K. Rowling); it's not unreasonable to assume he knew what he was doing better than us Muggle readers do! We also don't KNOW he didn't stick around invisibly, keeping watch until morning, or had some magical way of keeping a close watch remotely.

"Dumbledore makes decisions without consulting others, and doesn't share information" (paraphrased). This is a wizard who has led two war efforts, and no doubt got burned by leaks of information many times. It is natural for him to try to keep information on a need-to-know basis. Maybe he overdoes it, but it is hardly a novel approach to information security during a war.

Will of Lily/James. Lot's of assumptions here; we simply don't know that they had a will. They were young and thought themselves secure behind a Fidelius; it is also quite possible all the guardians they listed were incapacitated or otherwise unsuitable at the time of their deaths (Sirius=Azkaban, Remus=Werewolf, Pettigrew=Believed Dead, Frank & Alice Longbottom=Insane). It's quite possible it was all down to the default Potter inheritance clause, with Harry being declared a magical orphan, or something like that. We know from Tom Riddle's childhood that there seems to be no support system for magical orphans.

"Abuse by the Dursleys was ignored" (paraphrased). This is something that fanon has greatly exaggerated IMO, there is no evidence of real abuse; Harry is certainly treated poorly, but wizards have a more cavalier attitude towards physical injuries because they are naturally more resilient due to their magic (see lack of constant fatalities in Quidditch). It's quite possible that Neville Longbottom was in more immediate physical danger, with his great uncle trying to elicit accidental magic, than Harry ever was from the Durselys' neglect and Dudley's schoolyard bullying.

"Harry's abuse is not unique", "Dumbledore ignores Harry's end-of-year mental traumas" - lot's of assumptions here that the Wizarding world would have paid any attention at all to recent developments as far as the rights and treatment of children in the Muggle world. All canon evidence is to the contrary, that they are closer to a Victorian era Muggle outlook where children had zero rights and physical punishment was ubiquitous. Doesn't Filch still polish manacles in the dungeon and reminisce about the days of corporal punishment at Hogwarts? This was actually a practice that Dumbledore ended when he became Headmaster, according to [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Caretaker][this]] page.

"Horrid teachers" - This is certainly true, but it is possible there is some kind of tenure-like system that prevents Professors from being fired, outside of specific violations. This is left ambiguous by canon, but we do know there is a Board of Governors, and that the Ministry exerts considerable influence at Hogwarts in OotP. It's reasonable to conclude that that hiring/firing decisions aren't entirely up to the Headmaster.

I could keep going point by point, but I won't. Anyway, the books are written from the perspective of Harry, who is completely clueless about 99% of what goes on in the Wizarding World of politics, as well as what A.D. is doing 99% of the time. We usually only see a couple glimpses of Dumbledore in a given book. There's very little reason to assume that just because Harry isn't aware of it, Dumbledore didn't do anything.

PS. I realize I'm pretty late with this comment, and few will see it; but I needed to get this off my chest (lol)

** The best Dumbledore that I remember was in the denarian trilogy. He wasn't the main focus, and he didn't show at the beginning of book one but he is one of the best Dumbledore to date. The series is awesome as well.

It's not a perfect Dumbledore, but definitely a good guy on Harry's side.

** Dumbledore from "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality" is good fit - keeps his character from canon (mysterious, manipulativy, slightly mad). Due to heavy AU he avoided screwing up life of Harry (lack of abusive family etc - so there is no repetition of cliches done to death), like most characters behaves now in way that makes some sort of sense and avoids being one sided character.

Moreover it is IMHO the best take on eccentric Dumbledore

#+begin_quote
  You see, Mr. Potter, everyone knows that Dumbledore's madness is a mask, that he is sane pretending to be insane. They pride themselves on that clever insight, and knowing the secret explanation, they stop looking. It does not occur to them that it is also possible to have a mask behind the mask, to be insane pretending to be sane pretending to be insane.
#+end_quote

(note that this is not the most layered interpetation of his character)

I think that it is rare example of Dumbledore that is better than in canon (most fics either mostly ignore him or turn really well done manipulative!Dumbledore from canon into evil!stupid!dumb!even_more_stupid!Dumbledore [why this type of stories is called manipulative!Dumbledore is quite mysterious]).
