If you could make any spells or potions in the wizarding world what would you make? I'd make something to permanently destroy a horcrux.


** Maybe an exercising spell that makes me fit, without any effort involved.

** A potion that would first optimize my body (height, weight, strength, endurance, stamina, etc) and then optimizes my ability to handle/use/store/etc magic

** More ways to find stuff out without resorting to in-person mind-control. Probably a lot of work in Divination. Anything that'd help me become the Urban Fantasy Black Market Information Dealer I was always destined to be. :D

** I tend to get shaky when I'm distressed, so it'd be nice to have a shotgun spell to make accuracy less important in self-defence. I tend to imagine it with the incantation "Beretta", since it rolls off the tongue easily, plus optional modifiers. "Beretta maxima" to double the number of pellets, "Beretta flagrans" to set them on fire. Also good for use against groups or flying targets!

** Magic space travel. Most of the things needed (air, water) already have spells for them, but propulsion would be interesting to invent.
