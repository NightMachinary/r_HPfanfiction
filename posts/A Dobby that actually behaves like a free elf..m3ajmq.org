I want a Dobby that isn't all: "Oh how wonderful! Harry potter wants me to be his slave. I know I'm finally free but as long as its harry, I don't want to be free!" Another thing that annoys me is when Dobby goes like "You want to pay me a reasonable amount? How terrible! Don't give me time off! I want to be treated like a slave!"

So just don't do any of that,


** It's funny because it's not just fanfics, it's his canon character to act like that, so far as I can recall.

*** He was always happy to help out Harry and negotiated his own salary down from what Dumbledore offered, but he also makes it very clear he's happy to be free and choosing to help Harry of his own free will.

relevant passage concerning salary:

#+begin_quote
  “And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby, sir, if Dobby wants paying! And so Dobby is a free elf, sir, and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month!”

  “That's not very much!” Hermione shouted indignantly from the floor, over Winky's continued screaming and fist-beating.

  “Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and weekends off,” said Dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as though the prospect of so much leisure and riches were frightening, “but Dobby beat him down, miss. ... Dobby likes freedom, miss, but he isn't wanting too much, miss, he likes work better.”

GoF: ‘The House-Elf Liberation Front'

I agree that the essence is there in canon but like many things fanfiction takes an inch and stretches it to the moon and back.

** From the main book series, was there any indication that House Elves would be happy to be freed or would desire a salary and benefits comparable to a human/wizard? It's been a long time since I read the actual books.

Also, maybe Dobby acts the way he does because he feels he owes Harry his life.

*** Aside from Dobby? No, I don't think so.

Some say, Dobby was an anomaly among House Elves. They're fantastical race that are different to us and think differently, perceive the world differently. What we would consider being essentially a slave, in fairly bad -possibly the worst- form of slavery is not considered as such by the House Elves. Or at least it's a necessary (for House Elves benefit) evil.

And some others say pretty much what Hermione said. In that, they're not so different or even if they're we should act as if they're not. Dobby might be the lone example of a House Elf we get to see that had a such a desire for freedom but that doesn't mean he was, necessarily the first or the last. All House Elves don't revolt for freedom mostly due to brainwashing. There's no benefit inherit for the House Elves -if there ever was one to begin with- in the current system that can't be granted by less slaver-ish better alternative system.

** "I'm so glad that after we got married that you insisted we keep Dobby on." She smiled, remembering the conversation. She hadn't wanted a house-elf, but when Harry told her what he was paying Dobby, she'd changed her mind. Harry was paying him the same as a Muggle housekeeper would be paid. It was almost half of Harry's salary and she wondered how he could afford it, but then Harry showed her his royalties from his grandfather's hair potion and she knew they would never worry about money.

*** You mean, Lord hAdRiaN James Potter Black Gryffindor... who owns 99% of wizarding Britain and is the richest person in the known universe, as it was explained to us in his Gringotts visit, can pay for a particularly freedom loving elf? An elf who he himself freed?

But what about subjugation? What about establishing his superiority to others by changing the very essence of another's character just by existing? How will he lecture Hermione now? Who will tend to the fields of crops in his many expended trunks?

** There was a fic I read a while back where the house elves were an engineered race that actually needed the contract to survive. (As a benefit, learning about this was met with appropriate horror, not "oh well, slavery is cool actually). Dobby decided that even if it meant a painful, drawn-out death in less than a decade, he would never be a slave again.

I wish I remembered that fic, I adored the way they treated the "they have to be slaves" BS. Bioengineering a sentient slave race isn't ethical, and the reaction from a diehard abolitionist isn't "oh well, slavery's cool now", it's "can we undo the modifications".
