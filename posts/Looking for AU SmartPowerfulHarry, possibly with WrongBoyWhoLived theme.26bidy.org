I have read Harry Potter and the Elemental Changes, and really liked it. Can anyone recommend others similar?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero][Unsung Hero]] is every one of those things.

Summary: There are two things to know about Harry Potter. One: He kicks ass. Two: No one cares. Why? Because Daniel Potter is the Boy Who Lived. Badass Horcruxes. A Year 7 fic with lots of twin fic elements. COMPLETED

** Knowledge is power ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power]] ) is one of the best fic's i have ever read.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Harry is two years older than canon and raised by Remus. Neville is BWL. Story of Harry's search for knowledge to cure his mother. Snarky characters, witty humor, Quidditch, deeply developed OCs. Harry/Fleur.

** Maybe check some of [[http://www.favoritestracker.org/publicList.php?list=3951][these]] or [[http://www.favoritestracker.org/publicList.php?list=11121][these]] out.

Also, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3953548/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-BoyWhoLived][Harry Potter and the BoyWhoLived]] by Seel'vor. I linked to ff.net but there are a few more chapters of that one available on DLP if you have an account there.

*** Pretty sure the Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived which has extra chapters available on DLP is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][this one]] by The Santi

**** Oh, sorry. Well, it's still a good read. The pairing isn't the center of the story and doesn't even come about till later books.

**** Me either, but I've taken up reading it, because the story is interesting and overall good. Wandless magic here and there but I'm dealing. The writing and descriptions have me hooked, started the 2nd book.
