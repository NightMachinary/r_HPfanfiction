Essentially, I'm looking for a fic where Sirius has a kid that he never knew about, has grown up in an orphanage, and is the daughter of Marlene McKinnon (deceased). I would also like the fanfiction to not start in first year and move up. I don't want her to be part of the Golden Trio but preferably a Gryffindor. This is the type of fanfiction I would really like to read. If no one knows of any, maybe I'll have to write one. Just let me know! Thanks.


** The flair you should be using is 'Request', not 'Recommendation. linkffn(Black's Daughter) is close enough to what you want.

  "It's weird how it all works, isn't it? I hadn't even known the man for most of my life, and there he was- just out of reach." Her chest fell as her breath became heavy- "I know exactly how you feel." What if Sirius Black had a daughter? Her story begins with her 5th year at Hogwarts, yet her life changes when she meets Harry Potter. Rated: M
