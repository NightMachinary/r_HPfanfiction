If he had a few years of memory of his parents, he's bound to have a lot more love and connection to them and I feel like this has the potential to really change Harry's character. For example, this could affect the way he reacts to the Dursley's treatment or maybe he's even old enough to protest against being placed there. It could also lead to Harry being more confident, revenge driven or even scarred with the trauma of clearly remembering his parent's murder etc.

#+begin_quote
  In a dark world, a haunted Harry Potter is not The Chosen One. After great loss, however, the heralded mind of his generation will surmount legends to avenge those he loved. Amidst a bloody Triwizard Tournament, infatuations of the heart, and things that truly go bump in the night, his path lies nebulous. Yet there are fates worse than death.. In fact he's counting on it. AU. Harem

*** You should warn folks its been abandoned- still totally worth the read imo but it's a rude awakening when it leaves off on a huge cliffhanger and multiple unresolved plot points. I do want to reiterate though- still worth the read nonetheless, best world building I have ever seen honestly

** I love this concept!! And while it doesn't tick all of your boxes, I've recently read a p spectacular AU called Dreams and Darkness Collide by Epic Solemnity (Dark_Cyan_Star). It's a Tomarry longfic and is sadly unfinished but honestly so great and I think you'd love the character development. Xx
