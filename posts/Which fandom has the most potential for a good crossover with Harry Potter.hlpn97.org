** Honestly speaking, that depends more on the fan base if the other part or parts. Harry Potter has a, quite frankly, RIDICULOUS potential for crossovers in general, and that's without ignoring Harry Potter canon and Memory Charms.

There's parts of almost every genre that can fit into HP, that show up everywhere else. And even taking someone from canon, the amount of times, locations and even situations that can be used before the crossover even starts is just as ridiculous. It doesn't even have to be Harry that leaves Britain.

That's ALSO before Cursed Child and Fantastic Beasts events are considered. I'm only counting the 7 books.

** Without moving either timeline, Harry Potter is 33 when Thor: The Dark World happens and the convergence brings Thor and co fighting Dark Elves through portals opening all over Greenwich in London.

I've never read a crossover that takes place during that movie, but that sounds like /exactly/ the type of thing that Auror Potter would be sent to go investigate. His team could even start their investigation earlier when Dr Selvig is arrested for running around Stonehenge, and somehow set it up so that he assists with the fight.

#+end_quote

When writing crossovers, I tend to rely on how little Harry knows about the Magical world.

Examples(albeit weird ones): Creepypasta-

DoM is researching beings like Slenderman or Zalgo but the ministry isn't telling the general public they exist and is wiping whoever encounters one's memories as to not panic the public. Or, alternatively, most slenderverse series, if not all, take place somewhere in America. Have whoever from HP travel to America and encounter a creepypasta, or you can send a bored creepypasta to Britain where they won't be recognized.

Fnaf-

It's a muggle restaurant run by muggles. Maybe Purple Guy is a wizard who used a dark curse to attach the souls to the animatronics, or maybe the children were magical and their magic tried to save them by transferring their souls. Magical influence doesn't need to go beyond that. Have whoever from hp become the nightguard, or one of the children, and you'll be fine. Just don't have magic fix everything..

Batim:

Joey uses dark magic. Need I say more? Maybe it's Harry instead of Henry, maybe a witch or wizard worked at the studio and became a toon, maybe whoever the main character is is related to Henry and is investigating their relative's disappearance.

BBIEAL:

Hermione wants her kids to get a muggle education and gets her hands on the game. Either she checks it out first and gets the experience, or she just trusts the ratings and lets her kids play it. Alternatively, Harry finds out about it and is confused and intrigued by the almost cryptic reviews and decides to see what it's about. Even if it is just a math game, his kids can play it, right? Or, if we're going book era, Dudley gets it and soon throws it out. Harry gets it and decides to play it bc why not.

Think for a bit and you can find a way for almost anything.

** If you want to fit the worlds together seamlessly without any problems:

Worst Witch. Just ignore anything mentioned outside of the original HP books and the two worlds could be merged very easily.

It also probably would be rather easy to slide Matilda into the Harry Potter world.

--------------

If you want to do more world building: I think the Percy Jackson books (and sequals and spin offs) would work. At this point the world they inhabit have a type of magic anyway (the Egyptian magic. The kids who wield this are special, but not Half-bloods.) - You probably could weave in the HP world magic without overly big problems. And the resulting work, if written well, may actually attract readers from both fandoms.

**** I think the fun thing is that the Doctor does /not/ know everything. Some things surprise the Doctor, sometimes (s)he forgets stuff that happened to an earlier incarnation, sometimes a future visited before seems to now have turned into a different future.

The Doctor knows a lot, and especially things we cannot even understand because we are missing the sense that literally feels time, but despite all of this the Doctor does not know everything.

I am unsure about the rules the time lords have overwritten in canon , but I know every show writer overwrites the canon of Doctor Who to a degree (sometimes a degree I disagree with... not Galifreyan? Screw this, now you went too far for my liking. ) - And then there are the auxiliary, expended universe things that are "kinda" canon (or can be used as canon stand in, straddling the line between canon and not), but also only tilll a something in the show proper disagrees with it... but at the same time, the world of Doctor Who is weird and strange enough you can, even then, imagine them being canon SOMEWHERE.

Anyway, if magic is not a thing in the universe, with Doctor Who things like that always have a "technically" (because things that behave like magic, or vampires, or ghosts... have been seen, they just get a very thin coat of techno babble applied to them), or a "for now" (because canon in that show seems somewhat malleable) attached to them.

Perfect setup for Harry to date an interesting muggle, have adventures outside the UK, AND be a curse breaker.

As for the Statute of Secrecy? Well maybe Lady Croft was a Witch and Lara is a Squib(or is she?).

-Percy Jackson, the Hallows were made by Hades, and whoever is MoD becomes his enforcer, cue Harry playing bodyguard to another black-haired, green-eyed kid and his smart best friend(along with his goofy redhead friend) as they go on adventures.

-Hellblazer, Harry is contacted by one John Constantine...and his whole worldview shifts /again/.

-The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina - Sabrina Spellman goes in a student exchange where she found out that what she practices was just one aspect of magic, and history is very different from what she had been taught. Could be Harry/Sabrina, cool culture shock.

-LOTR(has some good stories already), Harry is 'summoned' by the Valar to help stop Sauron who changed his goal from 'Get the Ring' to 'Release Morgoth from the Doors of The Night'.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7581967/1/King-of-Serpents][King of Serpents]]

He was left for a Squib as a child, too smart for his own good. Now everything comes tumbling back at him, and Artemis Fowl II is thrown into the world of magic, for better or for worse. And what's this about a stone that can turn any metal into gold

I'm not sure if I wanted to link this because younger me didn't care that much about the author making comments in the story. I remember liking it well enough to ignore them. There was just a couple. But still. I did like it a lot. I'll reread this too if I have the time.

Remember it's been a while.

** There are a lot of crossovers with KHR for such a small fandom. It deals with a hidden 'magical' mafia world. The KHR magic system is often classed as soul magic within Harry Potter in those fanfiction. People in KHR exist that could be easily connected to the magical world, like Viper who is an esper ( often seen as a squib/hedgewitch in crossovers with KHR). Harry is easily included into the world in most of the crossovers I read, because of the Arcobaleno Curse or through Skull who is said to be hated by death.

** The Charmed TV Show/graphic novels. Most of the stuff on that show can be chalked up to as "the old ways". Most of it is potions, rituals, magical gifts (think like parseltongue, telekinesis, empathy, seer, etc), poem-like intent-based spells.

I saw one crossover that mixed Charmed and the Practical Magic movie with Harry Potter. It worked pretty great for me. Those families were already disconnected from magical society, so they missed the forming of the statute. This makes them effectively a separate branch of magic. But one thing that was really neat was that Squibs weren't really squibs, they were more geared for the rituals and potions. Since they didn't require much in the way of power.

HP has the obliviators. Charmed? They have the Cleaners, a neutral group of beings who work to keep magic undiscovered.

Just throw in more demons, whitelighters, and whatnot and it will be fine.

** I don't know for sure but I'd love to see more Dark Souls crossovers. It'd be difficult because of different magic systems and the author would need to know the lore (which is more than many are willing to do).

It would be interesting to see how the concept of Voldemort's fractured soul and horcruxes interacts with the idea of going hollow.

Perhaps even more interesting would be the distinctions between light and dark in the two worlds. Especially, for "light" wizards when in a world where humanity is INHERENTLY dark.

And personally, I'd love to see how the trio grows in a world like Dark Souls. A world not only filled to the brim with horrors, but also where nearly every character has some form of personal philosophy regarding the world, the nature of life and death, or simply everyone's place in such a world. I'd love to see how they see the world and develop into adulthood.

** Marvel/MCU obviously works since it already has a shitton of magic systems inside and is kinda loosely connected while also being popular.

Sherlock Holmes works, if only because both original series are based in mystery, but also due to popularity of both fandoms and fanworks in it.

The Witcher, altough not necesarily in a very explicit way, definitely would work as a historical inclusion of witchers into worldbuilding (i mean, someone had to protect those poor muggles from all the magical beasts in times before SoS, right?).

Now, a few popular ones that might require more work/original tweaks to make it work or just as something that's fun but not really deep or serious:

Artemis Fowl. Both popular YA, has some different magic but would definitely work if only for humorous aspect.

Naruto. Duh, 2nd? most popular fandom on ffnet. Altough to pull it off well you'd need to up the powerscaling on the most powerful wizards to 11 - but who wouldn't like to see Dumbledore casually dropping the moon on someone?

Fairy tail, as a fun powerwank (obviously HP wizards are more powerful due to versatility). Or for porn.

Realistically the characters are too fast for HP characters to pose a reasonable threat in direct combat (though HP magic's versatility is still useful), but I like Naruto and One Piece crossovers. These are probably best when a character from one is simply reborn in the other with the others power set.

** I honestly consider HP a 'little black dress' fandom for most modern-setting fandoms. Because of the statute of secrecy, you can handwave (or explain, as you choose) different types of magic (or lack thereof) to account for differences in the two canons' perceptions of 'how the world works' and the setting. That the British magical world is so ignorant even of muggles they live along-side of makes it very easy to believe that another group in hiding could exist along-side them without them finding out until the protagonists do.

It does get harder to cross the streams (heh) for canons set exclusively far away from the UK, but far from insurmountable. (Challenging to get an original take that doesn't feel like a deus ex machina, but definitely doable for creative authors; and even some of the less-than-creative setups are a thing that can be moved past if the rest of the work is strong.)

Outside of modern-earth (or earthlike) settings, there's always portal fic; I think the hardest thing in those is frequently resisting the urge to make Harry too genre-savvy and remembering that scifi, fantasy, and nerd-dom was a bit more niche in the 80s and 90s when HP is set. Hermione might have read LOTR, but without the prominence of the movies, it wasn't the fandom or culture giant that it is right now as far as background jokes about trolls and orcs go; Harry had probably heard of D&D but it very likely would have fallen into the category of 'strangeness' or even 'that satanic game' given how it was perceived at the time. Even comics were pretty far off the mainstream!

I don't think there's any one fandom that is the 'perfect' crossover; it's really about the writer's ability to fit the two things together. I do think that it's very difficult to fit things which are extraordinarily different in tone together, but the very length of HP and the scope of tone that the books go through (from the absurdly silly bits like blowing up Aunt Marge to the grim tent-slog of book 7) really gives a lot of space for where you could set up the initial point of overlap for a tone match.

And that's just straight-up crossovers. Getting into fusions (X in the Y universe) is a different thing.

#+begin_quote
  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.
