Are there any fan fictions that have Harry going to live with Sirius after book 3? I always wondered how that would have turned out if Sirius was cleared of all charges and yet Pettigrew still got away.

*** I just finished reading all of what's been submitted and I am HOOKED! Do we know if it's going to be finished? Do you have anything else that is similar to it that is completed while I wait for this one to be updated?

** I think Stealing Harry counts, although the fic is dead (author posted his plan though)

** Try MarauderLover7's "Innocent": Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

It's a bit slow going (as in, it's nearly 500k words and Harry isn't at Hogwarts yet) but the character development is some of the best I've seen, and the author does keep the plot interesting. Definitely worth a read. And, the author's active; he/she posts weekly, and there's a sequel currently in progress.
