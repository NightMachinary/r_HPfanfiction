I just started getting into the fanfic trope where Harry replaces his self in another universe but the only good ones I've found so far has Harry tell everyone else who he is immediately. Any good fics where he actually keeps quiet for at least a little while?


** I wish I could be more helpful and remember which stories I am remembering, but I always remember being annoyed at how long Harry held on to his lies in HP replacement AUs. I would be sitting there the whole time like: "please, just tell someone, tell anyone! Tell a ghost. You holding in this secret is just a shifty way to develop more angst!".

So yeah, il wrack my brain for those stories, but please tell me which stories you are talking about it.

** There is one linkao3(15465966). He doesn't tell anyone about his past for long. It's both time and dimension travel. I enjoyed it.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12446118/1/]]

It's been a while since I've read it but from what I recall, Fleur and his alternate self are the only ones who know the truth, even at the very end.

Edit: Gave a quick reread where I skimmed through. He also tells Dumbledore.

** The one that immediately comes to mind is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1648439/chapters/3495167][My Name is Cameron Sage]], which ends up as a Harry/Snape fic. Harry takes on an entirely different identity, so no one knows who he is.

** There's a series on ao3, where Harry somehow gets to Supernatural's world: linkao3: New World by kirallie. And then he goes through several other worlds too.

There's another sorta series on ff.net, by dunuelos I believe, The Lone Traveller, I think it's called.

** I like the idea where he ends up in an AU and while he doesn't try to tell anyone, he doesn't care enough to hide it very well. Like, he fights Crouch Junior and goes all “Wait, weren't you Kissed? I could have... oh, yeah, never mind.” And everyone is wondering what the fuck he's on about.

** Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15930521]]) Step back in time. This one is very good, in which an older battle-worn Harry doesn't quite end up in an AU, but around the time his younger self was left on the Durleys doorstep. He basically adopts himself all the while navigating magical Britain, the people who want to meddle with Harry's life and the upcoming rise of the dark Lord. He doesn't take shit from Dumbledore either, young Harry is a sweet kid. Highly recommend. Endgame is Snape/Harry. There are multiple works to this series.

#+begin_quote
  When a bitter, dark, and battle worn Harry Potter steps through a rip in time. He didn't think he would find himself with a baby in his arms on his Aunt's front doorstep on the night his parents were killed but that was just the beginning.
