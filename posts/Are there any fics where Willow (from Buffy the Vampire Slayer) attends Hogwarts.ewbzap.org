I'm normally not into crossovers but I think this has a bunch of potential!


** There are some on [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/][Twisting the Hellmouth]]

I did a search on TTH for crossovers [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/browse.php?scy1127=on&kw=hogwarts&rmin=1&rmax=4&wmin=1&wmax=5000000&submit=Search][BtVS X HP Willow centered]]
