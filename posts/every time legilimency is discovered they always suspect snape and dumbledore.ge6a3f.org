everytime harry discovers that mind reading is a thing its always immidiately assumed snape and dumbledore use it and im wondering why is it always them that is suspected why not mcgonagall or flitwick. like i understand dumbledore if they add tells to legilimency like his eye twinkle but how come they never suspect everyone of using it


** Because Dumbledore and Snape are the only two characters in the entire book series outside of Voldemort that know it (though it is just a guess that Dumbledore knows it because the books never state he does, just him saying he should have taught Harry not Snape the mind arts)

And people love bashing Snape and Dumbledore

Edit: the books do state Dumbledore is practiced at legimency... End of the order of Phoenix so that ramble is incorrect but the gist is still correct

And Snape guesses that Bellatrix was the one teaching Malfoy occlemency in HBP though Malfoy does not agree it's the case, though that would suggest Bellatrix knows Legimency unless there's another way to teach occlumency

*** Considering that Bellatrix taught Draco Occlumency, she probably also knows legilimency.

Also Dumbeldore is confirmed in the books to use it, since that is how he acquired the memories of Morfin Gaunt.

**** It's been a while since I read the last book but I don't think it specifically says he uses legimens. It states he had difficulty extracting the memory, if I'm not mistaken... Which would make sense to me because I don't think legimency would be able to see that a memory has been tampered with but shrugs

Now I did forget about Bellatrix potentially teaching Malfoy though again we have one line from Snape saying she was teaching him occlumency that Malfoy didn't say was the truth... So she probably did know it but it's not 100% sure Though she should be listed with the other two, she's just normally not a major character in fanfictions

***** Dumbledore literally says I secured the memory and then says Morfin was a bad Occlumens, its extremely likely that he used Legilimency.

And Snape believing that Bellatrix taught Draco means he knows her to being able to use Legilimency.

*** Dumbledore himself states he is a sufficiently capable Legilimens when he tells Harry he interrogated Kreacher and coerced him to confess the truth.

But yeah, you're right.

  “And Kreacher told you all this . . . and laughed?” he croaked.

  “He did not wish to tell me,” said Dumbledore. “But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I --- persuaded him --- to tell me the full story, before I left for the Department of Mysteries.”

Yes, Sirius left instructions, that's true. But this is also a direct quote from the book.

I mean, Snape kinda deserves it imo, but yes generally this trope is used as an excuse for Indy!Harry to shout at how Dumbledore is “a manipulative old goat” or some such thing

** Mainly because of Harry's canon thoughts. He suspects Snape 'can mind read' at least once before he even learns what legimency is and I think authors have run away with the Dumbledore's x-ray like gaze.

There's also the fact that they're 2 of the best at legilimency and fans want to make them extra manipulative.
