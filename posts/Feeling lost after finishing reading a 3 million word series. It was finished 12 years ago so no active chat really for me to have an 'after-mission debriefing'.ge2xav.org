(Harry Potter - LightningOnTheWave)

I'm just sort of wandering around in a daze.


** Ha! I've described that feeling as riding a wild rollercoaster that suddenly dumps you off in your cubicle on a normal workday, surrounded by ringing phones and muffled conversations. So disorienting.

I loved that series and still consider a lot of it to be head canon, but I don't know if I could read it again for how dark it got with how the horcruxes had to be destroyed.

*** That's a great way of describing it.

It did get quite dark and gorny but the psychological analysis of some of the characters was brilliant, and in fact the web is the only thing that properly explains house elves.

**** I see this story being recommended a lot around here. I generally dislike slash a lot on the main characters. Do you think I should go for it? Or is the romance on the more down low and not really the main point with explicit scenes being described all the time? I am kind of a sucker for the wbwl trope and I would really like to read one new (new yo me at least).

***** It's explicit and the relationship is important to the story. It depends on what your reasons are for not liking slash.

Edit: it's explicit from like book five

****** Because I like to correlate with the mc and kind of "living the story in his place". As a straight male it a kind of hard to do that when I can't get in the same mindset as him. In regard of the explicit side I dislike the slash for the aforementioned reasons and a big plus that I don't really like explicit scenes of any kind in a story. I prefer stories where the romance/smut is a subplot. Thanks for your help though. If you look for some more wbwl I would rec linkffn(5353809)

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

******* The majority of slash readers are apparently straight women.

One of the reasons for that is because the interaction between the characters can happen without gender roles or stereotypes and a person gets to be themselves, rather than 'the girl' or whatever.

The focus of the story is the psychological motivations of the characters but as on real life, sexuality affects real life and isn't a specific segment.

In any case books 1-4 I think don't have slash, so you could read to that point.

***** The relationship is definitely present once you get into the later fics, and though there aren't all that many explicit scenes there are some. (Though by the standards of fanfiction I don't remember them being THAT explicit). Its a pretty plot-heavy series too, so you could skim over quite a bit of the romance scenes if you wanted.

** Oh I love and hate this story. The emotional and psychological turmoil was brutal.

It's definitely a favorite of mine, but one of those favorites that you read once and never again.

I don't think I could survive a 2nd read of it.

** This isn't going to help you with that daze, but it might be of some interest! Lightning On The Wave is also the author of like 300 essays about fiction writing. Most are really interesting reads, even if you don't necessarily agree with her: [[https://curiosityquills.com/limyaael/]]

Tat feeling of being inside a world is unlike any other, though :) A little disorienting once you're out of it, but one of the really wonderful things I love about books. I think I got it more when I was a kid, because reading took me so much longer, but absurdly long fan fictions are certainly another way to regain that sense of time spent somewhere!
