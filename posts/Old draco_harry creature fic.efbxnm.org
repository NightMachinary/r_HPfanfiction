Now. I may have some detailed wrong as it's been a few years. Like I forget if it was a series or just one long ass story.

But I'm the fic harry and draco are creatures with leather like wings. Harry's the sub. The fics other pairing I remember is hermione/snape.

Hermione and Voldemort surprisingly get along great and prank snape a few times by making him think their together.

That's all I remember, thanks for any help.


** Harry and Draco are gay lovers in my fic :)
