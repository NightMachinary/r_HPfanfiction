Other than Rise of the Wizards, I've never read a fic where Nicholas Flamel has played a big role in the story.

Any suggestions?

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding?

** First one that comes to mind is linkffn(4894268). Flamel plays a big role, but the problem is that the story doesn't actually go anywhere, and it takes like 200k words to get through year 1 because there's so much needless junk packed in.

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.
