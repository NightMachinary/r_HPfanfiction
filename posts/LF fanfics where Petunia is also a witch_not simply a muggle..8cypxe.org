  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

** linkffa(10676937) It's a one-shot about Petunia being the witch and Lily the muggle. It does not meet fully with the criterion but maybe you like it. This one-shot is part of a series of one-shots where the author try to find the answer to the question: 'what if?'

** Might not be what you're exactly looking for, but a good read never the less. (Petunia isn't the main focus of the story, but she is a very fleshed-out character and a witch and her relationship with Lily is excellent). [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9506432/1/Just-Stay-Here-Tonight]]

  (I am the one who says 'fuck you') - Benjamin GarciaPetunia Evans is plain, fretful, and unremarkable. Petunia Evans has always lived in her beautiful, vivacious older sister's shadow. In spite of this, it is Petunia who is the witch. The universe has made a grand mistake, and all she can do is attempt to make some sense of the sudden absurdity of her previously well-ordered, pristine world. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Marauders, and a war on the horizon all conspire to make this rather difficult.

  It's the day of the First Task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and the last people that Harry ever expected to be there to see him before he was to face the dragon was the Dursleys, or even the other revelations that would be revealed. H/Hr. Some Draco bashing.

** In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12892452/chapters/29452386][Shibboleths]] it's discovered that Petunia isn't a muggle, but it doesn't happen until much later on in the story and she is not the main focus. The fic is a Drarry one, so if you're cool with that it's well worth a read.
