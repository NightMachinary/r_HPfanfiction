Flitwick is an easily overlooked character, and short jokes aside, as far as I can see he's never the main character, and only rarely plays a bit role as a mentor in addition to teaching

linkffn(Angry-Harry-and-the-Seven) features him somewhat prominently but only rarely does Flitwick go above and beyond to help the wizard world

Why? Is he really part Goblin and takes some stance of neutrality in the war unless attacked or something? He's a dueling champion yet we almost never see the wizarding yoda in action, which I think is a mistake.

Is there any fic, perhaps off the beaten path of Fanfiction.net, where he's the main character or takes a huge part of the war, and is shown doing so?

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

  Fate was sealed that night. I was to live and fight, to breathe and conquer. The night I died and lived England celebrated the end of the nightmare that had yet to begin and praised the baby they would later fear and hate. I am Harry Potter. I am legend.

** Damned, that request made me think of Harry (who's quite sassy sometimes) saying something like:

"Bollocks it's Yoda!" when seeing Flitwick first levitating himself onto a stack of books (and later showing the charms-teacher Star Wars somehow...I'd guess that Flitwick would have a blast, especially with the fighting scenes in the Prequels - Wizard-Yoda indeed!)...damned, who will write this? ;)
