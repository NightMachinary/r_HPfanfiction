As someone who's only listened to the Audiobooks, is this actually a thing? Do Ron and Harry actually call Hermione “‘Mione”? Or is that just Fanon.


** In my brazilian-portuguese edition of POA, she is referred to as Mione the whole time. And Ron also became "Rony" for some reason.

*** "Rony" isn't too bad, but I'll never get used to the russian "Garry" and "Germiona". Why these people refuse to use the letter H at the start of a word is beyond me.

**** Russian here. Yeah, it's weird and I hate it, but in this particular case both names would sound almost as a swear word.

**** Because it is transliteration convention that was established when Russia had more cultural connections with Germany than Britain.

*** She was called Mione only rarely (though I only remember the one time, in the fifth book) and it wasn't on POA.

** I think its said once in the books, and it's ron talking while he's eating. Not an actual nickname, but jkr's propensity for phonetic spelling

**** Ron said “‘Mione” once due to the amount of food in his mouth at the time. Viktor Krum and Gwarp also mispronounced her name because it was difficult for them.

** In the English version which I personally would say is the closest thing you have to the REAL original story no its said like once while Ron is eating
