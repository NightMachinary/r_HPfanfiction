Looking for canon pairings set in a variety of different AU's as the title claims, the AU can be just about anything as long as it's canon pairings.

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed but if not then a bunch of chapters is fine.

The only non canon pairing I'd allow in would be Neville/Luna since I love that pairing a lot. But other then that would rather have canon pairings. (I also love Remus/Sirius a lot as well). But other then that canon pairings set in different AU's.


** linkao3(half awake and almost there by annerb) is a non magical AU Harry/Ginny fic that's really good! It definitely does both their characters justice.

  Wherein Harry never could help himself from trying to save the day, and Ginny was just trying to survive her shift without killing any of her customers.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** Well, my AU "The Dark Lord Never Died" should fit the bill. Harry and Ginny are a couple at the start. Ron and Hermione... are a tad more complicated.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
