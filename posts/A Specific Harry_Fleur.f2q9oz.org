**** Wow. I usually like Harry/Fleur, but I close boxed that one two chapters in. The premise of the plot simply doesn't work.

****** Everyone at Hogwarts died due to an ambush from the Death Eaters... who have no governmental support, no Voldemort, no allies. Just whatever Death Eaters who happened to be around managed to kill everyone.

I get that it's probably intentionally looking for a way to get Harry out of Hogwarts without bashing, but that doesn't sell for me.

******* If you skip to about chapter 3 or 5-ish, that's never really touched on too much beyond "Oh, isn't it sad that everyone isn't here anymore. I'm mourning and sad." for a couple chapters before it moves on to more action and character work later on. The European stuff is all pretty great.

********* Have fun. Or not, as you will. If you don't like the English stuff (whole lotta mourning), I recommend just flicking through until they reach France and just reading onward from there.

******* The grimdark and the fluffy slice of life bits are just a weird mix, tonally.

***** It is really good once you get into it. It changes a lot after about chapter seven. It still has his problems (I get it, he's a durmstang, can we move on now?) but overall it's really good
