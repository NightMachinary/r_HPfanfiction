One of things for me is that Harry isn't exactly the quiet kid in the back of the classroom. Despite being broody he's a snarky, an athlete/jock, has an explosive temper he's not really afraid to show despite dodging conflict when he can, and pretty steadfast in his decisions.

Ron is a people person and is not shy about sharing opinions, diving head first into verbal conflict without hesitation.

Ect..


** Harry's humor is more closely aligned with saying unexpected things in a deadpan way than like, the snarky sarcasm in most fics

** Agreed with the OP on all points.

To complete the trio, *Hermione is not nice*. Yes, she wants everyone to do well; she wants justice for all; she wants everyone to be better people; she generally tries to avoid pointless fights and danger; and she is generally polite and well-spoken. But she is not nice: she does not like people just the way they are; she does not spare people's feelings; she is not generally affable; and she does not hesitate to force others to do what she sees as the right thing.

People often quote JKR saying that Hermione was based on herself at that age, and they use it to argue that canon Hermione is a Mary Sue. They neglect that JKR does /not/ remember herself at that age fondly.

And, the unkindest cut of all is that most writers make her nicer without a lot of character development do it because they /like/ her, not noticing how they are flattening and degrading her character.

*** Even when she's trying to be nice she's blunt, remember her trying to help Ron with the levitation spell or trying to comfort Lavander over her bunny.

** Ron has a temper that is just as explosive as Harry's but unlike Harry he comes around fairly quickly once he's had the chance to calm down. Furthermore, Harry is not blameless in their fight in Book 4. When he and Harry aren't on speaking terms, Ron still worries enough to go looking for him when he notices him not in bed one night. He ends up accidentally interrupting Harry's firecall with Sirius, so when Ron's gearing up to an apology Harry yells at him, hits him in the face with a thrown "Potter Stinks" badge, and storms off.

The fight went on so long because Harry is stubborn and holds grudges, not because Ron is a terrible person.

*** Ron is probably quick to forgive after a fight because he comes from such a big family. Things get awkward real quick if you hold a grudge too long while you live in the same house, plus parents usually MAKE you forgive each other after a while.

** Remember each character's fatal flaw, and don't change it without due reason. For Harry, it's his "saving people thing", for Ron, his temper, etc.

** 1. Remember that people change as they grow older/grow up. Don't be stuck on the (also exagerrated) actions and mistakes of their first year as their defining traits.

2. Forget everything in HBP and DH with regards to characterisation.

** Two more for things that been bugging me:

1. Despite everything Dumbledore cares and he tries. He compartmentalizes, tells people only things he thinks they need or should know, but that's kinda what leaders do.

2. Fleur is not shy, she is a beautiful badass and she knows it. This makes her arrogant, haughty as JK described her, but she is no secret wallflower. Despite this she cares about those around her, look at Gabriella, Bill, and even Harry.

** That there are no absolutes. A character is never completely Evil or completely Good. Everyone has their good and their bad side. If you want to create a story that has substance, you have to remember this: /No one/ is ever the /villain/ in their own story.

Authors, many times, will dehumanize their villains, give them crappy motives and portray them as Evil. While this may be expected in children's tales, it will lower the quality of works meant for adults. It's when you can fully empathize with the villain, that you can understand the moral struggle the protagonist is going through.

It's not about the clash of good and evil, it's about two different but equal ideologies.

Unless you are dealing with a war scenario. There, things get even more complicated.

So 'purge the Muggle-born' and 'stop the Death Eaters from purging the Muggle-born' are somehow 'equal'?

**** "purge the Muggle-born" is one of those crappy motives i mentioned. Anyone with half a mind would realise that purging the muggleborns would cause problems and is, infact, not a realistic goal.

I was referring to something more akin to Dumbledore's and Grindelwald's dream, back when they worked together.
