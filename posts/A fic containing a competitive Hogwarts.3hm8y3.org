Hey guys, i'm looking for a fic that is similiar to linkffn(8379655) or linkffn(8616362) where Hogwarts has competition in it. Guess MoR can be considered one as well. Thanks in advance :)

P.S: In case i fuck up, the linked fics are "Hogwarts Battle School" and "Harry potter The Last Avatar"

Edit: Unlike my examples(sadly), i would love it to be complete and 100k> words.

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night.

** linkffn(Wit of the Raven) is sadly abandoned, but it does this nicely. I sadly can't think of any others - this is a type of fic I like as well.

** In linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19), Salazar defeated Godric and got to make Hogwarts and the British wizarding world in his own image. /Everyone/ has to become more cunning and ambitious.

Regrettably, it's not complete.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
