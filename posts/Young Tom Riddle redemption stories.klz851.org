Looking for stories about Tom Riddle as a teenager taking a different path. Either a fic where someone gives him a better childhood (like that Luna timetravel fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/Doubting-Thomas][Doubting Thomas]]) or just an AU where he's not cartoonishly evil.


** linkao3(in the bleak midwinter)

linkffn(flight of the stars by darkladyswan)

Both of these are time travel stories, where Hermione gets sent back 60-80 years.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  When Hermione is sent back in time with a spell, she decides to use this to her advantage and kill Tom Riddle before he becomes Lord Voldemort. What follows will challenge everything she knew about herself, and everything she thought she knew about him. Eventually dark. Postwar AU.

Lord Voldemort trying to cheat when the last battle with harry, attacks his mind and sees .. what happened to his soul and all the knowledge harry has. Lord Voldemort did die that day. Not because of anything except his choice.

Hiding his true living. a Tom Riddle seeking to Redeem himself for the sins of the past hides till he finds a way to the past. going to stop himself before he kills the potters and tries to save the pure bloods.

â€‹

Now he shows up at the time when Harry is 6 by a miscalcuation.. and decides to take in harry once he sees how fucked the Dursley's are.
