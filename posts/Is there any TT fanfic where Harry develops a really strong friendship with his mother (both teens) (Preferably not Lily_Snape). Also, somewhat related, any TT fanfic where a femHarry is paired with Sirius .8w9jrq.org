#+TITLE: Is there any TT fanfic where Harry develops a really strong friendship with his mother (both teens)? (Preferably not Lily/Snape). Also, somewhat related, any TT fanfic where a femHarry is paired with Sirius ?

*** Is this the one where a future Harry and Ginny (like 30~40yo) goes back to the 70's to send him back to the 90's ?

**** Nope, it's about 6th year Harry being accidentally sent to 1976 for a couple weeks and his interactions with his parents' year group. He interacts the most with his mother, so I suggested it.

******* Oh, I rather liked that one. But I'm not usually a big fan of TT where "bad things happen to those who mess with time". I like changes. And I also don't like paradoxes. Call me a critic, but the third book fucked every single possibility of TT being taken seriously.

Actually I think the HP way of dealing with timetravel to be remarkably good. You can change /EVERYTHING/ you don't know has happened, so for short length jumps it's basically the perfect amount of agency without being overpowered. It's often interpreted very badly in fanfiction, sure, but that's hardly JKR's fault for once.

Also yeah I agree that no change canon rehash time travel fics are fucking pointless, but they're hardly invalidated as a genre by time turners. There's plenty of fics that run with the infinite universes concept and make the time jump a splitting point.
