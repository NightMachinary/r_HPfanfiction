:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So the fic has harry as lord black/potter if i remember correctly at the start of the fic harry threatens to buy pansy from her father after she was being rude to him after which he made friends with daphne greengrass and tracy davis. Midway through the fic he and ginny hook up but he obliviates her due to her wanting to brag abt being in a relationship with him to her mother. Final few chapters has harry going to a pub where he uses sliver powder to kill greyback and all the werewolf in it plz help thx


** You'll have to be more specific then that. This sounds like a good 30% of independant!Harry fics.
