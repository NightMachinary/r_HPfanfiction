** So, this ship is huge. There's a LOT of it. Recommendations might be better if you could answer give us some details about what you like. Do you want romance, humor, hurt/comfort, kink, SuperDark!Snape? Are other pairings ok or any to avoid? Do you want new magic, improved minor characters, and/or exotic locations?

That said, because you specified "good" there are 2 whole archives that come to mind.

First, [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/][Ashwinder]]. Posting there requires beta moderation, so I find the quality of fics better than archives that do not require any moderation at all. If you have a favorite story/author on another archive, see if they are on Ashwinder and crawl their favorites. OR, try looking up the author [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewuser.php?uid=2560][southern_witch_69]] -- she either isn't on FFN or AO3, or doesn't go by that name on them. She's completed 17 of 18 stories and has excellent favorites lists to crawl.

Second, the now-defunct [[https://web.archive.org/web/20151209122636/http://www.witchfics.org/][WitchFics is still available thru the Wayback]]. Some of the authors transitioned to other archives, but many gems are still there. It was an exclusive club of Snapefans, and it's *mostly* our favorite ship but there's some other stuff too. I really enjoyed the world-building of [[https://web.archive.org/web/20160106231428/http://www.witchfics.org/anna/][Anna]]'s /Roman Holiday/ and it's sequels, but, fair warning, the third in the series /Last Tango in Paris/ is not complete. The notion of "summer" reading made me think of it, though, as the story opens during summer break, and I first read it during my own summer break from school :)

** linkffn(Post Tenebras Lux) Post-Hogwarts

linkffn(Chasing the Sun)

linkffn(Sin & Vice) The first half of this is excellent but I didn't like the end as much.

linkffn(An Unwritten Future) time travel and horcruz hunt combined

linkffn(Thirty-One Days)

linkffn(The Professor's Discretion) This one, I believe, was completed but left the ending vague to let you decide what happened.

  "After Darkness, Light." A chance meeting ten years after the war may not be just a coincidence, and may prove to have very far-reaching consequences. A story of many things, but primarily of healing. SS/HG; rated M for later chapters. Complete.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

** linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao) has Snamione as the secondary pair (and no, the primary one is not Drarry, although Draco is in the end a positive character). The only problem I have with this story that there is too much smut. It is somehow somewhere in between. This is too good story to be just pornography (and I guess for those who care only about the sexual excitement, it must be distracting), and the long human anatomy in action sections are interrupting it too much for the enjoyment of the story itself. So heavy skipping over explicit sexual scenes is recommended. Remainder is still a very nice story.
