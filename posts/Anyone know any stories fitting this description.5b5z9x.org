Hey there I just hopped on the HP bandwagon a little while ago and I've having a hard time finding stories that really suck me in. Im looking for a 300,000+ or at the minimum of 200,000 word story that's already complete. I don't really mind what type of story it is as long as it doesn't feature any Ocs or just has a few that aren't really relevant to the plot. I like the Snape/Sirius mentor stories, Dark Harry, Slytherin Harry, and really anything that sounds good. I'd also prefer the story to not feature romance and if it does just male content. Sorry for bad grammar and thanks!


** Your 200k words minimum is kind harsh because that's going to cut out some really great fics. I would settle for 100k+ words.

Snape/Sirius mentor:

*A Marauder's Plan*, linkffn(8045114)

*To Shape and Change*, linkffn(6413108)

*World in Pieces*, linkffn(6730432)

--------------

Dark or Slytherin Harry:

*Broken Chains* and its sequel *The Stars Alone*, linkffn(7718942;12040341)

*Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw*, linkffn(11574569)

*Emperor*, linkffn(5904185)

*Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin*, linkffn(11191235)

*Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106)

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price.

The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.
