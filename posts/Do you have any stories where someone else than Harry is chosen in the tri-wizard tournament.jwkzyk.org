  When Lavender Brown's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire as the fourth champion, no one quite knows what to make of it. Except for Harry, who firmly believes that it should have been his name coming out of the Goblet and thus vows to help her get through the tournament alive...at all costs. -- Cover Image credit to jenimal on Deviantart.

** Hmmm, there was one where Harry thought that his name might come out of the cup, so he was prepared: he did a quick switching spell on the piece of paper for one with (as I recall) Draco's name on it. He peeked at the original and saw it was Cedric, so at first he thought he'd been wrong. Then a fourth slip came out and he did a switching spell again to put Cedric's name back in.

Don't recall if the fic was finished. Think I have the name written down somewhere so I could credit the switching spell idea if I used it.

Edited to add: yup, found it. Break the Pattern: Tri-Wizard by Squirrel of Shadow, and it is complete. Fun details I'd forgotten that were in my notes: the "school" he entered Draco under was Cheaters Prosper. After the names were drawn he excuses himself to the loo and burns the slip of paper with his name on it. linkffn(11114679)

  Hermione couldn't believe she had been so stupid. What a foolish and perfectly prideful thing to do. The brightest witch of her generation, gifted and sensible Hermione Granger, gave into peer pressure. She wasn't going to. Not originally. Not until that bloody smirk. Now magically entangled in the Triwizard Tournament, Hermione must ensure her survival in the Wizarding World's most dangerous game. But as her dreams become haunted by an omnipotent, mysterious force, the young witch must come to terms with her own mortality and learn to appreciate both life and love.

  Harry and Hermione decide to help Fred and George to enter their names into the Goblet of Fire. Then, they enter some more names. Chaos ensues... A story that combines humour, logic, canon concepts, and some unique plot bunnies into a 4th-year tale that's hopefully different. COMPLETE
