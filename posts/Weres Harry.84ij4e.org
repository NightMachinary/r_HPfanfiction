I love this fic, and I feel sad it's dead. Do any of you know why did the author abandon it? Was anyone able to get the word from the source? Maybe someone took it up and continued writing it?

And as we're already here, does anyone knows any other story with good aligned werewolves that can control themselves like Harry here could?

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
