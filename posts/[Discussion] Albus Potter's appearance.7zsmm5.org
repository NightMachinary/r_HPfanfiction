On the wiki page about Albus Potter, it mentions he wore hand-me-down robes from James. Was that stated in the play? Or is it just another way to make him seem more pitiful that the actor/director chose? I don't think Harry would do that to his son when he had to wear old clothes from Dudley.

Also, how do we know he has black hair? The book described him as /resembling/ Harry, and CC says he has hair like Harry. However, the color was never explicitly stated. It seemed to me that it was just referencing how the Potter hair style is very distinctive. Personally, I like to think that he looks exactly like Harry, except he has auburn hair like Dumbledore, and that's why he was named Albus. (Also, I hate the idea of clones. It's so contrived.)

*** Going by that, then he could just as easily have light brown hair like in Part 2 of DH.

***** Also I don't count Wikia as a valid source of information. There's an essay on Snape's page excusing every single one of his actions, some of which JKR herself has denied. It's like using Wikipedia for a research paper, so you're actually citing an opinion rather than facts.

***** So basically there is no canonical proof of him having black hair. Thanks. I'll keep him with dark auburn hair then

** Just like to say that there is nothing wrong with hand-me-downs or used clothes. I don't think he problem with Dudley hand-me-downs were that they had been used before Harry, more that they were grossly oversized. Plus Ginny's family used them all the time, so that probably helped counter his bad memories.

*** Of course there isn't! Families do that all the time, my own included. But it has bad connotations for Harry (because of the Dursleys) and the Weasley family (remember how Harry insisted that the twins get Ron new robes with some of the prize money?)

Well, it's so that Albus doesn't get a big head and remains grounded. You don't want the fame of his family to make him arrogant. Harry just wanted him to have a normal childhood. It's for the greater good you see! That's also why he named him Albus Severus, after two of the +dumbest+ most down-to-earth people ever.
