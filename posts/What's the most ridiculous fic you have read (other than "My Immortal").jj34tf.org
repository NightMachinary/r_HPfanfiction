I am looking for something that pushes the limits of imagination, things that are so outrageous or ridiculous that they would seem unbelievable even in the Wizarding World. Also chaotic or non-existent plot is a plus.


** Lunaticus or something? Warning : Necrophilia.

Plot summary: Sirius catches harry having sex with his father's dead body. Sirius is horrified and tells harry to get home, now. Then proceeds to do the exact same thing.

Featuring:

- Characters becoming Faeries

- Probably the most incompetent evil!Dumbledore you'll see in any fanfic
- Muggle Dark Lord Colonel Sanders
- Space-exploring dryads
- Time travel shenanigans
- Russian Army invading Canada from the North Pole
- A character literally turning into a garden
- An author who has apparently never heard of "show, don't tell" (among other things)

And so much more!

The Northwest Passage opening up due to climate change does actually have significant military consequences, so this isn't /super/ strange without additional context. Granted, I think that's more about control over the passage than invasion through it.

** linkffn(4045539)

It's been years since I read it, but Crack'd Mirror was pretty off-the-wall from what I recall. Harry is swapped out with an evil mirror universe version of himself, and Mirror!Harry gets into a lot of crazy shit. It's this weird parody sex comedy that turned the phrase "big, hot, throbbing sausage" into a meme in my friend group for several years.

** Unpopular opinion: I think that My Immortal was alright, as it was obviously written as a parody, not in genuine ignorance.

The worst fic that comes to my mind right now is Hail Odysseus. The characters are overdone to the extreme and way out of character, the way Harry is made overpowered is done cheaply, and the ending is a massive shortcut, as if the author couldn't be bothered to finish it in a proper way and just chose the quickest way to get it done.

*** Thanks for that one. Even from the first chapter it seems like it's what I'm looking for. As for "My Immortal", it's been debated for fifteen years whether it was the work of a troll or someone actually thought that that was a good idea. I did not intend to discuss it's cultural relevance to this fandom but more to use it as a benchmark for ridiculousness but written by someone who thought that whatever they did was a good idea.

And then they mocked the Dursley's for being upset about there horrifically murder son. Now I hate the Dursley's as much as the next person but this was just to far.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
