So if I ordered a house self to be smarter than me in canon what would happen in a comedy fic the house elf would probably respond with I already an kr something like that but in canon considering the fact that somebody has to be smarter than the elf since it doesn't get proper schooling etc etc would they become smarter would they fail the order what would happen


** Fun question.

I imagine the elf could use obscure knowledge only they would know e.g what elves do during childhood and the like
