Just lookng for any story crossover, or not where whoever the MC is is OP to the max, and is OP from basically the start. Also would prefer little to no drama, or angst. Basically looking for a story where an OP MC is having an easy life. Also the less bashing the better, but i'm not adverse to it as long as it's not something like robst's levels of bashing.

TL;DR looking for an OP MC who doesn't really have many difficulties to overcome, or is angsty.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

  An old and dying Naruto throws his soul forward through time in order to prevent the Juubi's escape upon his death. His soul merges with that of 15 month old Harry Potter in the moment the Killing Curse is reflected. Super!Harry.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

The Black Phantom is pretty OP.

linkffn(So, how can we weaponize this?)

Ash builds lasers, has a secret underground base and has read the books. Voldie has no chance.

linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist)

What should you do when the other girls try to bully you? Summon demons to torture them, of course.

linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor)

OP Hermione.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

*** So, how can we weponize this? Does not have an OP MC. When I say OP I mean overpowered, not over knowledgeable. Knowledge can be a powerful tool if used right, but I was clear in saying how I wanted an overpowered MC. Thanks for the suggestions though, but at least one of them don't fit with my request, and from what i've read within the story, and reviews, Deus Ex Machina doesn't exactly fit in my request of a casual OP MC either. Haven't read the other two yet though, and I don't really plan too since it seems we both have different opinions on what constitutes a casual OP MC.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
