First of all I'm hesitant to name the works in question because I don't want to be like pointing the finger.

One is on FFN, the other on AO3. One appears abandoned and the other is complete, in that order. Both involve dropping a post-Voldemort Harry into the MCU, at some point pre-Thanos. Both have scenes of Harry evading spying efforts from Natasha, Clint and various others. Both have a scene where he is under Fury's own nose while Shield is desperately scrambling to find him.

If you know these two fics, first of all, is it the same author? Does the AO3 author have permission to partially copy the FFN work? Like basically is this a big deal?

Is it a common occurrence that one author will take a whole first part of an abandoned fic and use it to create his own?

I'm coming from a place of ignorance here, whence not explicitly naming either fic. I don't know how this came about and don't wish to assume the worst. Both stories were satisfying in their own way, although I would have liked to see the older one finished.

If you don't already know the titles here, pm me. As I said, don't want to stir up unnecessary drama.

Much appreciated.


** I don't know the fics you're talking about but if one of them has been finished I'd guess the author of the later one is still active on ao3? Why not contact them and ask. I feel like that would answer your question more quickly

** Yes, it is a common occurence. Many people take an abandonned fic to write a continuation, mainly because they loved what was already written. What is less common is that the second fic was complete.

There should be on the rewrite a note saying it's a "continuation of [story] from [author], with their permition". If not, then it's not really stealing since he finished the fic, but it's not really legal.
