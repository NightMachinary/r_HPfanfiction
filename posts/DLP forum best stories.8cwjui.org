What are some of the best stories that can be found exclusively on DLP forums.I have read Harry Potter and the boy who lived(I know its available on FF.net but later chaps are available only on DLP).In a similar vein,it works if there are other sites that are exclusive and not available on FF.net. Thanks in advance for your time.


** DLP exclusive is going to be a pretty short list. There's usually a reason a story doesn't end up on FFN. Like, I've probably posted 50 chapter 1's that never go anywhere and are just abandoned.

The only story I can even think of that has more than 5 chapters and hasn't been posted elsewhere (that I know of) is The Stalking Blood Sack.

*** This. DLP isn't a hosting forum, it's a workshop/writing forum (when it comes to fanfic). If someone posts something there that goes beyond a few first chapters, the author will probably post it to FFN.

** There's a snippet I once read on DLP in which Harry had been killed, and Dobby set about putting together the Bone of the Father etc. potion to bring him back. It was hilarious, but I haven't been able to find it since. Does anyone know what I'm talking about?
