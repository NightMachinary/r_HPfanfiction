** Definitely Dumbledore- or at least, I am open to a more negative interpretation. I don't see him as nearly as ruthless or manipulative as a lot of fics do, but I can definitely see support for it.

And my perception has NOT changed of Snape. In the sense that, when I read the books, he came across as a dick, but I never doubted he was Dumbledore's man. So "Dick, but on the right side to atone" is how I see him, and no fanfic portraying him as a monster or a saint will change it.

** I read almost exclusively canon, so I would have to say any of the "bad" characters...like Percy or Regulus or the Black sisters. In the books, we see them only from Harry's PoV, so they are just the strictly jerks...but with fanfiction, we get to explore their humanity.

**** In canon she's actually really weird, and socially awkward. Remember her cracking up madly over Ron's joke (whatever it was, it must've been bad since Ron made it) in the train compartment?

And in fact everything she says about heliopaths and nargles /is/ wrong. It's not her being capable of understanding mysteries of the arcane beyond the reach of any other; she's just loony.

So I don't actually think she's anything remotely approaching 'highly intelligent' - that's just another fanfiction trope.

***** I think Ron was doing an impersonation of Crabbe or Goyle, and they all laughed, but Luna laughed the loudest.

I completely agree with you...Luna is one of my favorite characters, but she does get portrayed as "quirky sex goddes" in fanfictions a lot. I know people who are just like her...and I wouldn't describe a single one of them as stereotypical good-looking. In fact, one of them declares herself as an asexual and thinks that love is just a concept forced upon us by the media. I would consider all of them to be good, loyal, amazing friends, but I think taking away Luna's craziness is taking away the essence of the character. She's crazy, she's strange, she's dotty (stringy hair, large eyes)...but at the heart of it, she's an amazingly loyal and wonderful friend to Harry.

Also, I don't think she's necessarily highly intelligent either. Diligent, extremely observant, divergent thinker...but maybe not highly intelligent. Ravenclaw just means that you value intelligence and wit, not necessarily that you by default possess good grades...which is why Hermione is top of all her classes.

But it's fanfiction, so whatever :)

** Definitely Ron. I remember being annoyed (a very small amount) by him in reading the original series, but nothing prepared me for the amount of vitriol he gets in fanon.

Some of the longer and more well thought out stories effectively cast Ron into the role of malcontented flake, but there are a lot of instances where he's suddenly a Death Eater and that makes no sense to me.

I'm not saying I like him (far from it), but my perception of him changed a lot due to fanfiction. It probably didn't help that 90%+ of what I read is on portkey where Ron is usually burned in effigy.

** Percy Weasley - portrayed as a dick in the books, realistically is probably more like the Only Sane Man growing up, before becoming either disillusioned with his family who treat him as a joke, or going over to the other side to be a spy. When you take away Harry's point of view, Percy is basically the only kid of a trailer trash family who actually seems to realise that education could be a route out of the poverty he's grew up within and yet all his family except his mother tease him for it.

Also, I've read some good sympathetic portrayals of minor Slytherin characters like Pansy and Millicent who JK (as Hermione) dismisses just because they're ugly or implies that their lack of looks is linked to their bad nature. Also as well, Cho's friend Marietta is put into context when you realise Umbridge was threatening to fire her mom.

I suppose as well on that point, fanfiction can really highlight how ruthless Hermione is too - for all her early respect for rules, she later very much makes up her own and never shows any remorse for her (sometimes quite extreme) actions.

****** The typical idea is, Dumbledore has decided Harry has to be sorted into Gryffindor no matter what. So he sets things up as follows:\\
* Harry is placed in an abusive household so he has no friends growing up (canon source for physical abuse: Petunia swings a skillet at his head; emotional abuse: Harry is essentially an unpaid servant; no friends: Dudley keeps friends away, and Privet Drive is told Harry is a hoodlum).\\
* The first magical Harry meets is not a professor, but Hagrid. Hagrid is blindly loyal to Dumbledore and openly dismissive of anything other than Gryffindor. Added bonus, Hagrid is not smart enough to figure out Harry may need instructions to the Hogwarts Express (or is specifically told by Dumbledore not to tell Harry).\\
* Harry ends up lost at King's Cross station, and Molly just "happens" to walk past loudly talking about "Muggles" as well as the platform number. This is on Dumbledore's instructions since he knows Harry will be unable to ask others.\\
* This not only introduces Harry to a family absolutely loyal to Dumbledore, it also provides them with an opening to set up Ron as a future friend for Harry.\\
* Ron arranges to end up in the same compartment as Harry and spends the trainride telling him about the Houses, so Harry will be sure to want to end up in Gryffindor.

Result: success. Harry ignores his Slytherin side, as well as the fact he spent the summer reading his books (canon, but never followed up on) which might've made him eligible for Ravenclaw. Ron is assured to be a Gryffindor and is the only child his age Harry has basically ever been friendly with, which reinforces this.\\
Harry is a Gryffindor and best friends with the son of a family loyal to Dumbledore, which allows him to further manipulate Harry.

This is when Harry overhears Molly say "muggles" when she walks by talking to her kids and so he gets nearer to hear their conversation better. Then she ask them which platform the kids are to take and Ginny answers. This has /oooooooooobviously/ been staged.

#+begin_quote
  And of course Molly's talk about love potions.
#+end_quote

Harry hears Molly talking to Hermione and Ginny about having brewed a love potion when she was younger. This will usually be pointed out as proof that she used one on Arthur and then Hermione and Harry are given some too so they would end up with Ron and Ginny, respectively.

Their family, their friends, their loved ones, are what they consider "me and mine", and they'll put that above the rest of the world even if they have to fight for it.

As for why other families didn't do the same, it seems to me that they were all either more fragmented (Blacks - fought on both sides, but not one was neutral) or not having the same kind of blind faith in Dumbledore / mistrust of the government.

As for why the Weasleys in specific, I've heard that people who have more materialistically stable lives are less likely to risk it all in war and battle, which is why places like Ukraine can collapse into infighting, but places like Scandinavia really don't seem likely to. Dunno if it applies, after all the families on the other side seem pretty wealthy - but then, the families on the other side were fighting to keep that wealth and power too, so they would have risked it either way.

** Ron is a double edged sword for me.

He's my favorite character to see bashed if I'm in a bashy reading mood.

But up until his, to me, character stopped growing as opposed to others he was my favorite character in canon.

So I suppose bashing fics did that for me.

****** I think the problem with fanfiction's perspective of Snape is that J.K. Rowling set him up to be this tortured soul who redeemed himself through sweat and toil and ultimately sacrificed his life for a cause, but fanfiction authors tend to prefer him to have this misunderstood person who was always good, but prejudiced against because of his looks and social status.

And then he uses a bottle of shampoo and is suddenly god's gift to pre-pubescent teenagers. That could be another problem.

******* Yeah that's largely my problem. JK's Snape is not a good person for the vast majority of his life and arguably never truly is. Nor is he attractive or charismatic (films definitely deserve some blame here). I get that he probably had a rough childhood and all that but I don't think that's a good enough excuse to cast him in a "poor-Snape" light.

They weren't exactly friends, why should they be more featured? Just because?

We also don't see Harry mentioning Draco in all chapters. Or Draco being featured everywhere. The only exception is on the Half-Blood Prince, where Harry is kinda of obsessed with him.

I wouldn't necessarily say it's completely biased or that everything is whitewashed, the story is supposed to fit with what is known from from canon. I even recall instances where Snape reflects on stupid and questionable decisions he made.

Snape is supposed to a grey character, it would be a mistake to take him as a black character when the only black character in the entire series is Voldemort.

Exactly! The Chronicles make him out to be this really good guy who accidentally stumbled into these awful situations. Like he apparently didn't know Voldemort was that bad? Never actually harmed anyone? It's absurd.

I have no problems with that. At least in canon he certainly seems to in same way reconnect with Lily, the note in his book is clearly intended for her, and that was after the event of Snape's memory at the Gryffindor portrait.

I don't see why it isn't possible, this sort of thing happens in real life all the time. Why not with Snape?

I always liked how subtle J. K. Rowling was with this passage in Chamber of Secrets (relevant part in bold):

#+begin_quote
  They hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds of people moving overhead, and the staff-room door banging open. From between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the teachers filtering into the room. Some of them were looking puzzled, others downright scared.

  Then Professor McGonagall arrived.

  "It has happened," she told the silent staff room. "A student has been taken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself." Professor Flitwick let out a squeal. Professor Sprout clapped her hands over her mouth. *Snape gripped the back of a chair very hard and said, "How can you be sure?*"

  "The heir of Slytherin," said Professor McGonagall, who was very white, "left another message. Right underneath the first one. Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber for ever."

  Professor Flitwick burst into tears.
#+end_quote

Yes, I know it's very subtle, but to me, that indicates he actually cares about the students, Whether it was always there or not, I can't be sure. But it certainly indicates he is reformed.

I would seriously contest that. Everyone Voldemort ever met in his entire life was a complete self-absorbed asshole and gave him absolutely 0 reason to empathise or care for them, or have their deaths and excruciating pain even twinge on his conscience.

Yeah, it's amazingly contentious. Snape /can/ be done well, but frankly it's probably really difficult to go through and show all the times when Snape was actually serving as Dumbledore's man.

GoF has a scene where Snape says he can't tell the difference in Hermione's face after she's hit by Malfoy's /Densaugeo/. Reallllly hard to be sympathetic to him in any capacity after that bit.
