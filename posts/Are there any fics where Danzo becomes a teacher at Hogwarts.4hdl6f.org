I was thinking about the nature of life, the universe, and that eight page paper due Wednesday when I realized how much I wanted this.

** I'm trying to imagine the potential fallout, especially if he becomes a head of house.

The slytherins would probably slowly become emotionless.

Students would randomly disappear and be discovered with their eyes removed.

DADA homework would be about calligraphy and nationalistic indoctrination.

...Yeah, it would be messy.

** You do realize that any chakra technique from Naruto is extremely OP and apocalyptic?

That and Dumbles wouldn't take him as a teacher 'cause he's not 'dumbledore-shifty'. He'll prolly try to make him as a pawn and end up in a genjutsu. Even with occlumency, that many copy wheel eyes would overpower any defence.

If you're still hankering for a decent crossover i would suggest linkffn(uchiha fukurou)

*** I was kinda hoping for something cracky, something similar to what [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby][Itachi, is that a Baby?]] is after chapter 2ish.
