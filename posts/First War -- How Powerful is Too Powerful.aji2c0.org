*Tl; Dr*-- as a reader, how skilled would you buy the Marauders, members of the Order of the Phoenix, and the First War Death Eaters before they seem OOC or OP in a canon-compliant fic? How do the various Order members and Death Eaters rank in terms of power?

As background, I'm brainstorming a fic set during the First War. It's not an action story per se, but for writing practice (and also just a desire to see my favorites act as badasses), I'm working on several battle scenes.

I find a lot of fics tend to go a pretty predictable route here: lots of stunners, shield charms and jets of light with vague results. When things escalate, maybe a Cruciatus or two. I'd like to play with this, mostly from a desire to see the Order look more capable than it is in canon. Though I do intend them to suffer casualties, so not skilled and lucky without limit. To what lengths can you stretch the talents of the various Order members before the begin to look OOC or OP?

As an example:

Pottermore lists James as a transfiguration specialist, his wand was known to be excellent in the discipline, and he was "exceptionally bright" per McGonagall.

Sirius, by contrast, excels at charms and non-verbal magic. He's also noted to be brilliant by Remus/the professors.

Based on their individual strengths, it would seem they'd have fairly different fighting styles. James might go the Dumbledore route and manipulate his surroundings, use objects as shields, animate reinforcements, etc.

Sirius would be better at traditional dueling--powerful or unique charms/hexes/jinks, plus the element of surprise from wordless spells. You see this a little in the Department of Mysteries fight in OOTP, when he holds his own with Voldemort's top lieutenant (before he gets cocky and distracted and therefore killed), and Harry notes that he's dueling so hard, sparks are flying involuntarily and his wand is a "blur" with movement. That's fourteen years out of practice.

In a fic set during the First War, when they might be young but otherwise top of their game, able to train with members like Dumbledore or Moody, or even practice together between missions, would you buy very inventive magic from these guys? Or should they stick to /stupefy/ because they are fresh outta Hogwarts? The fic is otherwise canon compliant and grounded, so I want to avoid taking the reader out of the story by playing this up in an unbelievable way.

On the enemy side, outside of Severus (who I'd like to avoid using because it's my reading that MWPP never knew he was a Death Eater during the First War) and Bellatrix, who are the most formidable Death Eaters?

Dolohov is an exceptional dueller. Fenrir seems to lack all morals, is willing to fight physically (non-magically) and can overpower. Lucius on the other hand seems completely reactionary and possibly unoriginal.

Interested to hear your thoughts...


** Being the Marauders, and therefore the guys who became Animagi in their teens and created the Marauder's Map, I would imagine they would be pretty creative in their dueling style --- though creative doesn't mean extraordinary /competent/; overconfidence/cockiness a well-documented character flaw for Sirius, James, and, for that matter, Snape, so you may want to have one of their more creative ideas backfire at one point.

The above, incidentally, should also apply to Peter whenever he actually works up the will to fight; but he should grow increasingly distraught and paranoid and selfish as the war goes on, his dueling becoming more and more jerky and unsteady until one day he mysteriously stops even aiming at the Death Eaters (which is blamed, not entirely inaccurately, on his fear of them), at which point he's retired to just guard duties on wherever the Headquarters were in the FIrst War.

Actually, as Lucius Malfoy is noted to have a collection of dark artifacts, I imagine him to prefer using such items to fighting with his wand, if he can avoid it. He will be the one throwing Peruvian Darkness Powder to blind his opponent, tossing Gemino-Cursed nails at them, etc.

As for other formidable Death Eaters... can't forget Barty Crouch Jr. (though he'd only be known in the First War as this mysterious, extremely skilled Death Eater of whom even the Order haven't the slightest inkling to the identity). We perceive Igor Karkaroff as a weakling due to the way he behaved around Voldemort, but can't have been that bad at magic if he got to be Headmaster of Durmstrang; and he had to be pretty high in favor with the Dark Lord to have all those names to name at the Trial.

Evan Rosier got a hit on Mad-Eye Moody (with a dark and powerful enough spell to leave a scar that magic can't fix) before Moody took him down, so he can't have been bad at dueling either.

...

Anyway, another bit of advice: use Aurors. The Order was instrumental in the War, yes, but Barty Crouch Sr.'s Aurors were very big players, and likely took down more Death Eaters than the Order did.

**** My head canon as well. In Barty's mind, he is no one. He's just whoever he needs to be. He has no sense of self, all the world's a stage to his act.

*** This is very interesting/helpful, thank you.

I have a similar read on Peter. I think he must have been fast on his feet and rather more powerful than he was given credit for, given that one spell of his /cracked a street/ down to the pipe. That was some fast thinking, too. But I see him as hesitatant when scared and those moments might be costly. Then, as he integrates into the Death Eaters, he finds it difficult to play both sides in battle (unlike a more accomplished wizard like Snape), so he increasingly leans on appearing incompetent, even if it's only an act.

Would you buy wandless magic, if say, someone were disarmed? Or is that too God Tier to be believable? (I might for the one off spell, but certainly not a whole battle fought in this way.)

Or the invention of spells? Meaning not the use of a spell that isn't specifically referenced in canon (which is... limiting), but rather the suggestion that someone in the Order actually invented a spell for X and Y reason. We know Snape invented spells. I do wonder if the Marauders Map was created with new magic, or just the creative use of existing spells...

*** As for notable Death Eaters, I think that Dolohov is supposed to have been one of the top Death Eaters and Rookwood was an Unspeakable, which is no small feat.

On the Auror's side, don't forged Rufus Scrimgeour. He is supposed to be a pretty impressive Auror and a hardass at that, so he would probably be in the thick of it and one of the guys not giving a shit about using more deadly spells against the Death Eaters.

On the order side I would say that it should go Albus > Moody > McGonnagal and then other members. It is sad that we don't know a lot about First War members, but Gideon and Fabian Prewett must have been impressive if the DE went out of their way to ambush them.

Honestly, I feel like people overstate the Marauders a lot at least in the first war. I mean, I am not saying they weren't talented, but they were mostly fresh out of Hogwarts in most of the war. I am sure they all had their area of expertise that contributed to the Order, but I don't think they were out there taking 5 DE at once, each.

Academical ability doesn't necessarily translate into war potention or combat ability.

**** That's fair. I intend this to be from Sirius's POV, so he was probably overstated in my posting. But I am curious about other members given that, unless ambushed, I think both sides generally fight with more than one at a time.

Interesting that you think Moody > McGonagall. She does seem to hold her own. Experience? Or what makes you think that?

There's also the Order member, can't recall her name now (was it Dorcas?) killed by Voldemort individually. Easy to paint her as a force to be reckoned with and hence the personal visit.

***** Personally because Moody, by rights of profession, should be a lot more experienced and well rounded. He is as old as her but dedicated his time to training and fighting, while she went on to take her mastery on Transfiguration, study and teach.

While I don't doubt her magical capacity, I don't think she is in the same level as Moody when it comes to fighting. Plus, Moody is a lot more well versed in dark magic and is surely a lot more brutal.

** btw, the pottermore profiles are written by the staff, not jkr. only things marked 'written by jkr' are. you'd think, also being an animagus, sirius would also be good at transfig. most adults can use non-verbal magic. they likely just threw that on there.

*** Fair point. Pottermore is a weird one because it's pick-and-choose canon. I personally treat the skills as "suggestions" if it fits in with my own beliefs. So for the examples I mentioned, I do imagine that James and Sirius were accomplished in most subjects, given they were top students, but might fallback on their favored areas in a fight or be more confident/creative in that one discipline. (I also like the idea that James led the charge with the animagus transformation and Sirius the map.)

But the same section lists Lupin for Defense Against the Dark Arts, which isn't really telling of much. Was he? Or was that just the post available? What does that even mean, since defense work is sort of a subset of charms in the end...

And it doesn't even list a skill for Peter. ouch.

** I think Canon is vague enough that you can do pretty much what you like as long as it's plausible in context. It's always about the execution. There's no harm in playing with some scenes to start with but what you really need to do is work out the framework of your plot. Know what character(s) you are going to focus on, what they want, what obstacles they face and how it all works out for them. (Just as you do for any story of course) But I really envy you doing this. The first war period has so much potential, you could do anything really. Exciting times!

** Honestly, spell selection is irrelevant. Vague lights are perfectly fine for action sequences. If you want to make the Order appear competent, they need to have victories while still losing the war. Think Germany in WWI. Won a lot of battles, was close to victory a few times, but was worn down over the years and was eventually overcome, with the overall defeat being very clear.

For example, the Order manages to capture a few Death Eaters each battle, until Voldemort breaks them out, so the DE are back at full strength while the order lost a bunch of members. Or give them Phyrric victories where they achieve their objectives but their losses are high.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** I think the Marauders are best utilized as guerrilla warfare type strategists. They understand movement, intention, and how to poke emotions out of their enemies. They create and execute schemes that give them insurmountable advantages; instrumental in ambushes, tracking charms on various objects that feed them magical signatures across London, listening devices all linked up on refuse bins that ping apparation points, creating and cracking ciphers, tracking unplottable places, impersonating Death Eaters to offer false information, capturing prisoners to interrogate them only to hand them back to their enemies to sew dissent in the ranks. Things like that.

With regards to actual combat, they are likely about as skilled as the average Auror or maybe a bit less so, but work better with a plan, and are good as a team. Aurors are good at small numbers, the Marauders excel when they ambush, trap, and blind their opponents, and are obviously skilled at creating magical artifacts to give them advantages.

I can see the Marauders being initially successful in the war, with their plans slowly eroding due to growing complexity and Wormtail's eventual betrayal, as well as Voldemort focusing on them more and more. I see the rest of the Marauders growing in skill and leaving Peter out of the important tasks as things progress, only for Peter to become jealous and chagrined at the lack of responsibility and respect.

*** That's the idea. Though outside one or two snippets of conversation, very much in the plot bunny stage. I tend to be dialogue/internal monologue heavy and I'm trying to polish my skills and work on something outside my comfort zone: multi-chapter, action, heavy plot (not just "slice of life"), etc.

** Well to respond to your first question I'm on the opinion that Order fighters from the first war were overall more skilled than the average death eaters. Hagrid depicted the Bones, the Prewetts and the McKinnons as some of the most powerful families in Britains, he might have spoken of them as politically powerful but I don't think so (at least not only that). That's why I consider Edgar Bones to be particularly powerful like his sister Amelia who "put a up a fight" against Voldemort himself. The same goes for the Prewetts brothers who were killed by several death eaters including Dolohov a particularly powerful dark wizard who bested Moody and Lupin in the second war.

The marauders for their part were extremely talented rookies when they joined the Orders, they weren't as experienced as the others like Moody, Frank Longbottom or Edgar Bones but I think that they learned really quickly as they had no others choices. In OOTP Lupin said to Molly that they used to be severely outnumbered (20 to 1) so the fact they managed to survived that long while openly defying Voldemort, and in spite of the numerous death eaters from their generations who would want to see them dead (Snape for example) is a testament to their skills.

There are about 3 years and a half between the moment Sirius left school and the moment he was was imprisoned. After escaping Azkaban Sirius barely used magic and the only time we saw him duelling was at the department of mystery where he defeated some death eater and fought evenly with Bellatrix the most skilled one until he laughed at her (a better performance than a highly rank auror). So the question is, when did he get that skilled ? Was he that good at the time he left Hogwarts or did he improve throughout those 3 years ? I think those are important question if you write fanficion portraying Sirius (and the others marauders) in that era.

About the deat eaters, I think you might add Evan Rosier among the skillful death eaters, he was killed in a tough duel against 'prime' Moody and managed to take his nose with him. Yaxley gave me a good impression too, I feel like he was some kind of a mix between Lucius and Bellatrix although not as politically important as Lucius used to be and not as skilled as Bellatrix (but still among the best).

PS: I didn't mean to imply that Order members could dozens of death eaters at once but some of them could defintely take several death eaters at once like Kingsley did during the second war. It would depend on which death eaters they were facing as obviously no one could take Bellatrix with another opponent, they'd be already be very good if they survived the dark witch.
