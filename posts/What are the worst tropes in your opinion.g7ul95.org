Give me your worst tropes, those things that are so over used in fics that it's laughable, things you cringe when you read, or even ones that have just become part of the canon of fanfiction (like wards and “my boy”). I've been considering attempting to write a “serious” novel length fic while trying to cram as many tropes into it as possible and having a big list would be awesome!

However many fics have then being bad-tempered to wizards and then comes Harry and win them over by being polite.

**** Yeah, you're not wrong about that. I have a master search bookmarked with all the things I abhor excluded, and then it's easy enough to search for a specific pairing or trope when I'm in the mood. If I'm not sure, then I just browse until something catches my fancy. Now I don't have to constantly enter all the details, which is great since I don't only read HP so I have one for each fandom.

Of course, not every fic is my cup of tea but my method still excludes thousands of fics that I'd definitely skip, regardless of how many other people like them.

- Elaborate shopping trips which involve buying custom made wands and very expensive trunks with special functions. It's so popular it's tiring.
- Learning pureblood culture from a book
- Pureblood kids titling themselves lords and ladies, or misters and misses. Cringeworthy.
- Slytherins being genuinely welcoming to Slytherin!Harry and very open-minded, as opposed to Gryffindors who hate him because he was sorted to Slytherin.
- Ron being obnoxious and an awful caricature of his character in the books, always screaming and eating like a pig

** A lot of popular tropes are going to be mentioned. Lord /insert 1500 last names here/, Love Potion trigger happy Molly, Ron and Ginny, Dumbledore! Bashing, but there's one I see all the time that is rarely mentioned.

Canon characters acting completely OOC just so they can be perfect life partners for each other, and worse still, all this happening abruptly in the first chapter, with no explanation. None whatsoever.

Numerous authors are guilty of this - RobSt, witowsmp and muggledad are the ones which come to mind right now. And it's always the H/Hr fans. Honestly, their representation of the two has ruined the pairing for me.

Zero conflict, zero character originality, made for each other loves always have the same thought, and are both too bloody perfect for the rest of the world. Gah...

It's seen frequently in other pairings too, H/G being the one I've read, or H/Fleur. I think it's the kind of stuff in stories with Malfoy and Snape as Harry's one true love too, but I stay away from that shit.

The other popular trope in relationships is Ice Queen Daphne who doesn't trust anybody but Harry, and typically within the first few minutes of meeting him, mostly because his "shining emerald orbs showed his sincerity and pain and..." fuck off dude! If you're gonna use a character that's basically OC, you can do better than write what has been written a few million times by now. If you want to know what to avoid writing, read Colt01's fics. Best way not to write Harry, Daphne and HP/DG.

If any of the aforementioned authors are offended, I'm not sorry. Really, I'm not. Atleast I didn't leave 500 word reviews on your stories telling you to kys.

tbh I don't really see the problem with Dan and Emma. although it probably helps that I've seen it used so much, so it's become normalised to me (at one point I thought dan and emma was actually canon)

when it comes to using different names though, I do like the idea of Hermione's Mum being Jean.

** Disregarding already pointed out lordships, Gringotts/Goblins' tests and such...

I hate it when every pureblood House is ‘Ancient and Noble' and every pureblood family has a ‘Manor'. It's so annoying. ‘Malfoy Manor' has its merit because of M-M and because Malfoys is one of the richest families so their house would be the grandest. But there's so much more words authors could use -- estate, hall, lodge, park, cottage or it could simply be a name without a mention of a family like Netherfield or Pemberley.

*** I have a headcanon that the older families look down on the Malfoys for "Malfoy Manor," as it's a clear sign of a "new money" family.

Old family homes have an actual name (like Longbourne, Netherfield, and Pemberley), because they've been around for so long (and probably through a few family names as they passed away from the original direct line).

Look at the current royal residences: Buckingham Palace, Sandringham Estate, Balmoral Castle, Kensington Palace, Clarence House, Frogmore House. Only Windsor Castle has the family's name, and that's because they took the name from the castle in 1917, not the other way around. (Fun fact, the royal family didn't HAVE a last name until then: they were only "So-and-so of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha." It was changed because of anti-German sentiment in the wake of World War I; they also repudiated all German titles.)

** bashing. yes, most characters have canon traits/actions that you can complain about, but there's no need to flanderize their flaws to be their only trait. my exception to that is where it's ridiculously over the top (e.g. Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion) because at that point it's just funny.

lordships, loads of inheritances and harems are obvious ones.

borderline murderous Dursley's. yes they're horrid people (I always like it when fics result in them getting their comeuppance, although that's also true of every unpleasant character) who emotionally abused harry and were physical with him at times, but it was the 80's, hitting a kid was still acceptable back then. the idea that harry was constantly on deaths door or covered in scars is ridiculous, and lets face it, if they were as bad as some people write, why the hell would harry have dared to be cocky and talk back to them?

stupidly quick advancements in relationships. I always roll my eyes when a fic has a conversation which starts with an admittance of 'I like you as more than a friend', and ends with them declaring their undying love for each other (bonus points if it includes a soul bond and a marriage).

twin speak, if done wrong, is annoying and difficult to follow. If you're gonna do it, at least read [[https://reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ctw66v/twinspeak_done_right/][uncommonality's post]] for some guidance.

custom wands. they're pointless, and only seem to be done to show how much of a special snowflake the character is. if the character doesn't originate from britain (and therefore wouldn't have gone to ollivanders) and has some unique trait (such as being a parselmouth or a veela like salazar and fleur respectively) then having something beyond the regular cores is okay, but it's completely ridiculous when characters have wands with multiple woods, multiple cores and has their blood in it too.

*** I fully agree with you on the fact that it makes no sense to have a Harry that is cocky and talks back to the Dursley's in a fic where the Dursley's regularly beat Harry to within an inch of his life.

However, I am going to make just /one/ defence for the fics that do manage to do hyperabusive!Dursleys right, because it's not just you, I think most people on this subreddit feel the same way about those fics. I have seen lots of people asking why would somebody even escalate the canon abuse to such levels, and why would anyone read them, implying that the author /and/ the reader must be twisted to be doing so. So I am going to offer the one defence that I have for these fics. Just remember that I am not speaking for the authors or their motivations for writing these fics, only my motivations as a one-time fervent reader of them.

That defence is this: For people facing certain kinds of situations, especially at home, they are very, very cathartic.

I haven't read a Hyperabusive!Dursley fic in years, and I have no particular intention of going back to them. But there was a point in my life where I devoured them and even today I am glad that those fics existed back then, and I am glad that I found them.

So. That is the only defence I have for that kind of fic.

(Again, if you like rape etc., please get help. That's an exception. There are other exceptions but all are about harming people/animals etc.)

I don't think gatekeeping something just because you don't like it is right, as long as it doesn't harm other people/creatures or doesn't show one's potential to start harming others.

What I absolutely despise is MPreg. I /never/ read MPreg, though I don't read Preg in general. /But,/ that doesn't mean it's a "bad trope," because people can enjoy whatever the hell they want in books.
