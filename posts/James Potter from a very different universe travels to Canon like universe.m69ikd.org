Basically a Flashpoint or Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse kind of story. Either Lily dies shortly after their marriage or maybe James survives Voldemort during that fateful Halloween night though both Harry and Lily die, causing him to become jaded. My original thought was that Harry wasn't the BWL in James's timeline and Voldemort was never defeated, causing his world to be darker as it has been going through war for longer. If someone wants to write this I'll happily beta read or Coauthor it and help with ideas and stuff along the way, I just don't have time to write it between YouTube editing, 3 day a week minimum Twitch streams, full-time job, D&D prep since I'm a DM, and spending time with my wife.
