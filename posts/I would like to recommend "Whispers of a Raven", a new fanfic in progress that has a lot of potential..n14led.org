Written by the author "TheBlack'sResurgence" who has, undoubtedly, improved their writing skills since linkffn(The Green in the Grey). Harry is sent back to 1975 to fight Voldemort before he gets too powerful. Eventual Harry/Narcissa

** I agree. I have read available chapters and this story is very promissing.

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF

  The world around him had crumbled as the Ministry fell. He had become the hunted, and with only his wits, resilience and an ominous raven, he'd had to learn to survive. But why was he so compelled to go to the one place he knew he should avoid? The whispers urged him as did the dreams that plagued his sleep. Perhaps Death truly was the beginning... Time-travel, Harry/Narcissa

** The dialogue was sooooooo bad in Honor Thy Blood. I can't even put my finger on why, it was just so awkward and every time I tried imagining the conversations it felt like robots trying to imitate human speech. Every character had an identical voice as well. Has it gotten any better at all?

*** Yeah, loads. Even the in-progress rewrite is a lot better than the original Honor Thy Blood. I was reading the rewrite, and once I was caught up, I went back to reread the original just so I would have a complete work to read, but I could barley stomach more than 3 chapters, the same issue I have with Green in the Grey. I really enjoyed A Flower for the Soul, TBR's recently finished Harry/Fleur fic and highly recommend it if you like the pairing. There's nothing ground-breakingly creative about it, but it has an interesting and engaging plot and is pretty well written and structured, which is more that one can say about a lot of fics in the fandom.

*** Yep. The rewrite is good and the most recent work is also awesome. It's pretty recent. But I also recommend it.

I don't know how he improved this much in so little time, but if he continues to do so he'll rival The Santi by the end of the year

  Loneliness was something that Harry Potter was accustomed to. He had learnt that there was none that cared for him, none that would rescue him from his misery and none that heard his pleas for help. Much to his surprise, however, Harry Potter had been wrong. Someone had been listening, had been there with him through it all. But, just who was 'Tom?

** A WOAR is his best written story so far. The dialogue is light years ahead of his earlier work, and feels like actual humans are speaking.

Also, it's the first time he's written an adult Harry that starts off somewhat behind the 8 ball both physically (he has a terrible long term leg injury and is malnourished) and politically. It's obvious that Harry is talented, but he's not yet overpowered, and I think the story is better for it.
