Hey!\\
I haven't read anything in a lifetime, and I suppose that there should be a bunch of cool fics written since 2000s.\\
Examples of what strikes my fancy:

- Harry growing up in 1920-30s or Tom Riddle time-traveling to 1990s or 1980s\\
  (I love both Harry and Tom and I'd love to read about their friendship or not-friendship while they are more or less the same age)
- Harry-centric fics about his adult life
- Young Dumbledore fics?\\
  I don't want sappy teenager porn with Gellert (wasn't it that in canon they only bonded over summer? that's a summer romance taken way too seriously). Maybe an au where they did spend several years or even more together and their ideals forming and changing, maybe a crack where Gellert is an ex Dumbledore hates (but the fucker is in every newspaper he opens), maybe a Gellert pov fic where the blood pact move was a well played manipulation?..)
- Some good stories about Newt, cause he's a sunshine.

I need to point out that I love gen fics the most, but I'm okay with a lot of het and slash pairings as well. However, please:

- no big age difference (for instance, 30+50 are fine, but 16+24? thanks no)
- no character bashing and hatred fics,
- no overpowerful charachters
- The Marodeurs, Lucius Malfoy and Severus Snape are the guys I'd like to avoid as main plot characters

Just wanna have some good relaxing time reading a maxi :)\\
Thanks!

P.S. Also any good competent Harry fics. I know there is a tag, but... Harry was, in fact, quite competent, clever and interesting both in the books and in the movies, and I'd love to read something that gives him enough credit. So it's more canon-compliant, I suppose.


** For competent-harry I'd suggest trying "Bungle in the Jungle" by Jbern

*** Thanks! Checked it out, but unfortunately the second person writing style is not something I can follow with ease. It's the very first time I saw something written that way, it's quite peculiar. Shame it's not for me!

** Northumbrian's a /fantastic/ writer of adult!Harry stories.

linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) is what people usually start with.
