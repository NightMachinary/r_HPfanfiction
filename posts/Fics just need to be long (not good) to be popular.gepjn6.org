** I think the reason is that since it updates, more people click on it. a oneshot that was written 5 years ago will only show up if you search for it, a lot of people search fics by update date. so the more often it gets updated, more people will see it.

** A lot of people seem to see how long a fic is as a mark of quality. It's frequently mentioned as a positive when recommending fics like the prince of Slytherin, a marauder's plan and the sacrifices arc.

I like a long fic, but honestly brevity is a virtue. When a fic takes a million words to get to third year it's just bloated in my opinion. There's probably a lot of unnecessary padding that an editor would cut.

***** I think it depends a bit on the style you're going for, TBH. Conciseness is good, but it's not universal.

Eg, I quite enjoy authors who will meander and go off on asides. Like some of the older French authors often do that - Jules Verne will spend a couple of pages detailing step by step how his protagonists create nitroglycerin from scratch, Victor Hugo will spend page after page on the history of the sewers of Paris, etc. Those asides - or meandering acts - are not strictly necessary to the plot, but adding them in still /adds/ to the work, for those who like that stylistic choice.

Fanfiction can definitely benefit from conciseness, or at the least a better outline of what would happen in future chapters - but I don't think that conciseness is that /only/ way to have good writing. Just depends on the style!

(Edit: for instance, one author I've enjoyed a number of fics by is AngelaStarCat. One of her fics, 'Ruthless', is very much concise compared to the others - and yet, that conciseness makes it less memorable, with fewer moments for the fic to 'breathe' and have character interactions in a way that sinks in a bit more, if that makes sense)

It's pretty well-written, it's just that Sirius is basically a Gary Stu at this point, Dumbledore is ridiculously dumbed down, Ron bashing is clearly on the horizon, and everything is going way too smoothly. And the author has been making amateur mistakes such as describing people's clothing in detail. That alone almost made me give up on the story, but I keep expecting it to get better.

If you're interested in a long Sirius-centric story that I do very much like, there's linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7). It's not about "Lord Black", it's about Padfoot. The premise is that he escapes from prison with accidental magic when Harry is eight, doesn't have any leads on Peter, so instead he checks on Harry and finds that he's unhappy. So Padfoot offers to take him - while still on the run, and now everyone including Remus and Dumbledore thinks that he's kidnapped Harry. Watching him do his flawed but sincere best to raise James' son, and watching young Harry blossom in the care of someone who actually wants him, is really sweet. And there's no one better to tell Harry stories about his parents.

*** To that I say that, for me at least, that depends more so on the quality of the fic. Don't get me wrong, brevity can definitely be a virtue. Part of the reason Sanitize hits so hard is that we only get, well, /snapshots/ into people's lives rather than full chapters centered on them.

 

On the other hand, if it's a fic I'm rather enjoying things like "bloated" or "too long" are terms that don't really exist. (Though there are definitely fics that could at least be separated into different "books" by year). For me, more great content is more great content. Give me 25k words on the history of the owner of the cafe that the main character frequents (presuming those 25k are as high quality as everything else) There are certain works of fiction, and rarer fanfiction, where I would all but kill for a history textbook of the world/setting. Or, to put it another way, if Lord of the Rings were my cup of tea I'd be the sort to dive into the Silmarillion.

 

I understand not everyone enjoys literature that way and more enjoys the plot or other things that extra exposition, flashbacks and sidetracking impedes. (And I will note that some longfics like Prince of Slytherin, /do/ separate things into books even if it's all one fic posted in one place)

 

As far as length being a "mark of quality" I think part of that is due to the nature of fanfic itself. Given how much of fic is abandoned and incomplete, seeing something that the author made a significant time/effort commitment to is heartening (and encourages the thought that it's less likely to end up abandoned and unfinished) Also, even more than "normal" literature, fanfic is escapist. And when looking for an escape, a fic being able to take you away for days/weeks at a time due to sheer size does have an attractive quality that smaller fics, even if more powerful in their impact, do not.

** One of the most important factors in a story's popularity is the frequency/regularity of posting. This is partly down to the sheer volume of fics Harry Potter has. If you're not in the first few pages of a given sorted view, you'll probably not be found by casual readers.

Regular updates helps by simple dint of bumping the story to the top of the most recent updates list. Once you have that following, it gets easier to grow it as the favourites and follows become a self fulfilling prophecy.

It's very hard for one shots to make it big in Harry Potter.

** I don't think this is necessarily the case. A lot of fanfic in other fandoms has a tradition of drabbles, short romance oneshots, etc. You can find that in HP, but there's also been a very long tradition of writing actual novels to match (or try to better) the books.

Obviously, the more updates someone posts, the more opportunities they get to earn reviews. There are plenty of oneshots like linkffn(Cauterize) that are very popular. It's hard to build a following around a oneshot though.

That said, you have a point that there are quite a few extremely long fics with a lot of reviews and favorites that really aren't very good, either for just bad writing or complete lack of structure.

**** Most fics are badly written - but I think the longer ones that are popular also hit some areas that a good chunk of people like reading (eg, super powerful Harry). It doesn't matter if it's poorly written - or at least, that /I/ don't like the writing - it still scratches that itch for some people.

The advantage of a longer work is that, if you enjoy it, there's a lot more behind it. And since in fanfiction, it's often about the characters - having a more stretched out period for more interactions is nice.

One-shots have the disadvantage, at least for me, of leaving me hanging a lot of the time. There are some great one-shots out there - but every time, they kind of leave me wanting some more, if the character interpretation are interesting enough.

** I remember the heyday of HP fanfic between GOF and OOTP. At the time you had to set the filter at ffnet to fics that were at least 10k words, otherwise you would be swamped with utter drivel. Fics that were nothing but authors notes riddled with grammar and spelling errors and writing that made your brain bleed. It was that bad. Yes, you missed out on a few good one-shots this way, but it was the only way to find fics that were actually worth reading.

Fictionalley was a saving grace bc the FA team insisted upon proper grammer, spellchecking and upon something resembling a plot or your fic would not get uploaded. Almost all the fics under 10k that I liked I found on FA at the time.

Nevertheless the damage was already done, the trend to sort ffnet by the length of fic and weed out anything under 10k or later 20k persisted.

Add in the fact that longer fics get more opportunities to be seen through updates and it is a perfect storm.

** I think, particularly the older ones, were read by younger people with (often!) lower standards of literature, or by people who were happy to overlook errors in favour of their favourite tropes/a long read. A couple of my friends specifically sought out badly written fics for a good laugh and since it met what they wanted, reviewed it well. Then, the more these fics got rec'd the higher up they became on most rated/reviewed lists and so on.

I'd say I was genuinely astounded by what passes for well written in the minds on some people, but I've had the misfortune of stumbling upon stuff I once loved. It drives the fear into my heart when recommending stuff to other people.

As for the stuff I wrote, well - suffice to say that I have entirely different accounts so that I need never be associated with it. (Not that my fic was ever popular, just bad.)

** Long form story telling is hard and a fic might genuinely be good if you only read it a chapter a week instead of binging it all at once. The dificulty also makes it to where even if youre fic is garbage if its long enough no one will really call you on it and if your ability improves with time/posts/chapters then you can be considered recomended and good with literal garbage begenings. A good example of this I believe is basilik born if Im remembering the fics name correctly, its a good fic eventually but the first dozen chapters are terrible and troupey.

** Yes and no.

Yes, because some longer fics are a complete retelling of the books with having either a butterfly effect, or a perspective change which alters how the story happens completely. At their core is the original books, and they're insanely long so covering them in under 200,000 words is an absolute achievement. Philosopher's Stone alone is 90,000 words, so widdling all 8 books down without feeling rushed is a feat in itself. Longfics can be brilliant and incredibly well written, so that's where the popularity stems from for a large portion.

No, because some stories are new concepts like marriage law fics, or stories that have less of a focus on fantasy and are more about the romantic pairing. Those really have no right to be so long, the average length of a romance novel is about 60,000-80,000 words.A lot of those stories WAY over 200,000 words, and very plot-light, so I can see your point of quantity vs. quality.

There's so many other factors to consider when talking about the popularity of a story, too. It really varies from story to story.

** I've always felt the same way as well. I haven't been able to enjoy /so many/ classic fics in the fandom because I felt they were always so long-drawn-out and repetitive. It really does feel like quantity over quality (which I do get to a degree, since fics that are updated more appear more often in readers' "feed"). There are some good fics and good authors that have relatively overlooked works because they don't write long fics.

Personally, even as a fast reader, I am hardly ever able to stomach fics with a word count 120k+.

** Yes and no. A fic can be shitty and long. However, a longer fic can also mean that an author spent more time on it, meaning taking the whole writing thing more seriously.

I think, in general, on average, longer fics are typically of higher quality. This is obviously not always true, but still. There is also the fact that many people want to read longer fics not strictly because they're of a higher quality, but because they want more story to go through than, say, a 5-chapter 20k-word fic would have.

Personally when I am looking for something specific, I typically filter out shorter fics. Not because I think longer fics are automatically better (even if I do think the average is better), but because I want a longer story to get invested in. However, if a fic is too long without anything happen, I get tired of it and stop reading partway through.

** I think this also depends on your definition of good quality. Does quality depend on grammatical aspects and the syntax? Does quality depend on how characters act compared to canon? Is quality dependent on which tropes, pairings, and general personal preferences?

For example, I have had a few really lengthy fics recommended to me (told they were very good) but I didn't like them because of the pairings. But, my subjective view of the story doesn't mean it wasn't well written.

** I prefer longer stories but I'm still choosy about which ones I read. Shorter stories are okay if it has...explored things properly? Idk I HATE short one shots. Like what is the point? All it does is make me want more and it will never come.

** well not necessarily i was scrolling through updated cuz im procrastinating for finals and theres tons that are long as shit and no one interacts with. like i saw one near 200k words with 40 fav/follows and 10 comments, ive no idea how that person keeps going tbh. that has got to be demoralizing as hell but i applaud them for their dedication and

However, in a general sense i agree which i why i tend not to use the search by favorites cuz as long as the writing is absolute dogshit a long running story will get more attention than something that is higher quality but posted in larger less frequent samples. it is also that fact that older stories that are quite out of date for current reading standards are up at the top because they've just had more time to acquire the likes.

This is mostly what lead me to stay on DLP after I read to WbA chapters of harry potter and the boy who lived. I'm pretty sure there has been some issues between this sub and it in the past but the community writing events, library, and wba are truly a treasure trove and a lot of the discussion is quite fun to check into every once in a while.

** I think it depends what you're after.

Back when I was first digging into fanfics, length was an important variable because I wanted something that would keep me occupied for a while.

When I see people asking for long fics, I feel like that's what's going on. They want to find something that they (a) like and (b) don't have to let go of quickly.

Now... I have things I should be doing and haven't done at all so short is good.
