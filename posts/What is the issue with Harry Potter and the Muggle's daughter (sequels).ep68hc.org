As I was browsing through the longer pieces of art on fanfiction.net I found a promising sounding fic called Harry Potter and the Muggle's daughter linkffn(12273541) by Sorcerer's Muse. Altough some of the usual tropes are present in the first fic, they are handled nicely and all characters have a unique feeling to them and are fleshed out. Right now I am 350K words in and the series doesn't let me off the hook. Imagine my surprise when I realized there are only arount 300 to 400 reviews per fic in the series and about the same number of favs?

I know there are hidden gems out there but usuall I know people and my self to be a sucker for well written fics where not everything just falls into the main characters's hands and there is work to be done to reach your goals. This fic/series does just that and altough it is declared as AU, it still stays close to canon and adjusts the world around it as necessary. So how had this fic been able to fly under the radar since 3 years? Did people just not find the premise interesting enough our did my taste get so out of touch with what is considered good these days?


** The entire first chapter is an author's note. So that's annoying.

*** I admit that the first chapters took some time to get through and could be handled better. Too bad if that puts everyone off already.

** 110k words of pre-Hogwarts. That right there explains the lack of interest.

**** Basically, all things which make Harry more special are considered bad because they are usually just tools to point out how "awesome" and "special" Harry is.

** Canon rehash, so boring and so repetitive

*** I find it original enough that it's worth the read, though looking at it now it could certainly use a culling sweep. It could certainly be shortened a great deal.

** The summary is super vague and generic. I'm sure I've read around 100 fics with similar summaries.

#+begin_quote
  A pre-Hogwarts tale that will be the first of eight books retelling the tale of Harry Potter. An exploration of the Many World's theory where changing one thing changes everything and at the same time changes nothing. HPMD sets the stage for a different Harry as he embarks on the journey of a lifetime. Rated M for language and later content.

** When I was reading it, I really liked the first one, but the second was tough to get through, and I'm not sure where I stopped reading but for all of the really good ideas it brought up it was SOO tedious. The quidditch scenes, and the exasperating "Romance" scenes and that whole gay rights scene. I'm bisexual myself, and I understand that scene was a consequence of the time period it was written in, but it was rather tedious and rehashed a bunch of tropes from other rather excellent pro-gay literature. Then, there was the whole "Let's sort Harry into slytherin" thing, and in my reading they didn't do much with Harry exemplifying being a slytherin, or using slytherin traits, they just played it for tension between the characters.

It has lot's of really good nuggets, oh my heart Kaa, but reading through the entirely pointless and extemperaneous filler scenes ruined it for me.
