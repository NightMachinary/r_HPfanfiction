For me it's "Hermione ignored her father and uncles as they discussed their plans. The first Saturday of the Summer they were preparing for their golf outing, psyching themselves up to try to explain the expense of going to and playing the Old Course to their wives who were in the sitting room, laughing at the antics of the two newest Granger babies."

Alongside "harry ignored his godfather and remus's chortling plans. The first week of a summer where he wasn't locked in his room after having mastered^{1} wandless summoning of his wand and they were gleefully planning out the upcoming trips but all Harry could think about was the picture of the bikini Sophie had sent him and the remark on how much she hated tan lines."

They're both chapters in the Darkness Ascendant but not until like fifth year and writing scenes wildly out of order bug me.

1. In Dakrness Ascendant, Potters are basically locked in their rooms for the first two weeks of the summer without their wands until they learn to summon them back to themselves.


** Mine was:

"Of course not, you silly boy. You're going to do it."

225,000 words later. I finally got to use it.

Also Umbridge offing herself with a blood quill was in my head for far longer than in healthy before I found the time to actually use it.

*** From limpienza del sangre? I LITERALLY just finished reading that and added it to my follow list.

Her death made me so happy.

**** Yep. I pretty much wrote an entire story because of one simple quip that wouldn't go away from my head.

** Constantly. I have one story I've been poking at for a couple of years now and I've got this appended to the current bottom of the page:

“Are you going home with her?”

“Probably. Are you going home with him?”

“Oh yes.”

Dunno if I'll ever use it, but it came to me in the shower and I had to get it down.

** A lot of the time that this happens to me, it's not quite a line or paragraph, but an action by a character or, strangely enough, a song that I feel like it could be the theme song almost for a chapter in the story.

However, one that I have had in my head is supposed to be set part way through Goblet of Fire and goes something along the lines of:

#+begin_quote
  Ron stood alone at the corner of the long hallway, listening to a group of voices coming from around the corner, none of which he could put a face too. Listening he heard them shouting at the current centre of everyones ire, Harry Potter, interrogating how he cheated his way into the tournament to top all tournaments. As he stood there, listening to them call Harry a liar, a cheater and a whole host of other unpleasent discriptors, he felt his anger rising. It was true, he didn't know how Harry had got himself into the tournement, and he was angry that he didn't share it with him. But these people were standing here talking bad about his best mate, the boy who had stood by him through everything Ron had needed him for. How dare they. How DARE they! With that, Ron stepped around the corner. Harry Potter may or may not be a cheating prick, but if he was, then he was Ron's cheating prick. Anybody who wanted to do anythng about it would now have to go through him!
#+end_quote

Or something like that at least. I've seen a lot of stories with a lot of Ron bashing, and while I can appreciate that style, I haven't seen a lot where he actually stands up to be counted on Harry's side after his initial mistake, so it's something I wanted to try.

** "She [Ginny] had always felt the pulsating energy around her. It felt warm, soothing, like stepping into a hot bath and relaxing your muscles after a long day. She always pulled it closer when times were rough, molding it to her body and wearing it like tailor made armor."

I don't even write HP fanfiction! So by all means, steal this!

** For me it was the idea of Harry and Hermione almost having sex, but at the last moment rolling apart and just continuing as good friends.

"She looked down their bodies then up into Harry's eyes, and bit nervously on her lower lip. Harry watched her eyes move then fixed her gaze with his own. He paused for one final moment... and then rolled away, turning onto his back to lie next to her."

That led to my story Going Muggle, which I really need to finish at some point.

** "Why did you take us here to talk? Not that I don't love this park, but why not just talk at home?"

"I feel watched everywhere I go. Eyes. Eyes on me everywhere. All the time. I feel watched. I hate it. I feel like they're listening. But not out here. I'm safe out here."

I'm in the middle of writing a sequel to one of my stories...26,000+ words in and I still haven't gotten to this part!

** "Loving you has been the best, worst thing in my life!" She shouted suddenly. It caught him off guard. How the hell was he supposed to respond to that? They had literally just been talking about Quidditch of all things.

"I'm sorry, what?" He asked with bated breath. He had other things that needed doing.

"Harry, are you completely blind? I love you. I have always loved you... And you have always ignored me." She had tears on her face now. When had she started crying? One moment she was in control, and the next she was losing her grasp of the situation. "It's almost as if I'm not worth your time."

"I... Ginny, I can't love you like you want me to." Harry responded, his voice a whisper.

"I hope Voldemort kills you!" She screeched in return. Harry flinched.

** Raggedly gasping for breath and body trembling, James raised the sword up one last time, his weakened grip finding renewed strength in this last desperate act of defiance. "Potters only bow their heads... to kiss their children good night."
