[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6jx3m2/lf_hilariously_ambitious_slytherins_before_each/][I've requested this kind of fic before,]], but I thought I'd do so again.

Does anyone know any fics where the Slytherins, instead of being all cloak-and-dagger and internal-politics and otherwise cliched-fanfic, are crackpot schemers with all kinds of wacky ideas? Whether it be unorthodox entrepreneurship, slapstick revenge plots, or sitting down every night to try to take over the world?


** Man, I wish.

Though now what I crave is an HP/Ed,Edd and Eddy crossover where the Eds are in Slytherin....

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance, HIATUS, but being worked on as of 2-1-16

** The most I could find was a oneshot in one of those archive style stories explaining the reason why all younger Slytherins have to act as Draco and pure bastards and why the older Slytherins will be the saints showing their younger house mates the way to redemption or some such dribble.

It was apparently all a plot to get more house points and continue winning the house cup while making themselves look great.

** Oh my god I got it:

Zenophilius Lovegood works perfectly as this. Trying to topple vast conspiracies, aiming to influence the populace through the use of the press. Insisting that evil planning must be done while wearing tophats and twirling mustaches. He would be great with the slapstick revenge/world domination plotlines. Could have so much fun with it. So much fun.
