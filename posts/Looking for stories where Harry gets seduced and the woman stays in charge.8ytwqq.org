It feels like every straight story where Harry gets some action he is the one in charge. But are there any fics where he actually gets seduced and/or the love interest is the one who drives the action and Harry just enjoys the ride. Because honestly, reading about Harry domineering witches twice his age doesn't seem that plausible to me.

Smut is fine, but I'd prefer some actual plot. Any pairing would do, no matter if it's Hermione, Romilda Vane, Marietta Edgecomb or Narcissa Malfoy.


** I remember of a fic where Ginny motivates Harry and basically runs the things even if not showing it. I think it was a fic where Ginny got some knowledge after Tom's possession but I don't remember the fic's name.

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!

this one is definitely not my cup of tea. It was the one quintessential trait of Hermione that she stuck with Harry. Also, the sequels go into Marauder wank territory IIRC.

** I feel like a lot of the /good/ Harry/Fleur fics fit this mold. The one that immediately comes to mind is linkffn(Harry Potter and A Flower) which, if I remember correctly, was finally getting to the romance when the author stopped updating. I don't know if this exactly what you're looking for but there was a definite power disparity between the two throughout the story.

Also, I'd say linkffn(Taking Umbridge) and linkffn(The Half-Blood Romantic) are both trending in that direction.

Others outside of this pairing that I think may fit your criteria:

linkffn(Harry Potter: Whiskey Accident) linkffn(Valeriana Natassa) maybe?

I hope you find some new stories that fit what you're looking for because it definitely gets repetitive and boring with Harry always being the one to put the moves on the girls and not vice versa.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged.

*** My problem with Harry Potter and A Flower isn't the power disparity in and of itself, it's that Fleur is this /prodigy/... so the gap will seemingly never close. I did stop reading real early though, would you say that remains true throughout the story?

Of course, it's not a problem for someone who wants their dynamic to stay that way.

**** Like I said, it's been a while since I've read the story. But, I just went back and did a quick skim and found that Fleur is still basically a prodigy her teaching has gotten Harry to a level where it doesn't seem to be large of a gap.

Also, I forgot about how funny some of the dialogue was between her and Harry, so I'd recommend reading it for that alone. The author has a unique sense of humor (or maybe its just the way he/she writes the characters' thoughts) that appeals to me for some reason.

*** There's a good Harry/Fleur fic around? That'd be news to me. Most are abandoned when things finally get interesting (and I really don't like the whole "infidelity" vibe from HBR).

Whisky accident was abandoned IIRC, and Amelia's appearance thing was really cringeworthy (of course Harry's wives HAVE to be HOT, so here's some bullshit explanation).

The Umbridge one doesn't seem that appealing to me since it has Ron in a prominent role and I find his character utterly boring, and more importantly, the description says that the two boys are "changed" and that really sounds like the ol' "gotta be model students to beat Voldemort" trope.

I remember that the Vampire one dragged on and the first "chapter" (30k words) were boring. Does it get better?
