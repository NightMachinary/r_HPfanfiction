Would rather it be that he was pardoned by the Ministry or was never put in Azkaban in the first place, but if not that's fine.

Would rather not have bad guy Dumbledore/Weasley bashing type of stories, if possible.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.


** A Second Chance by Breanie, still a WIP but she just posted chap 205. Yes, you read that right!! 205!

** Well, there's A Marauder's Plan by Catsarecool ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan]]). I've read it a couple times now and I still have no idea if I actually like it or not, so take that as you will. It fits your request, though, and it is indeed completed.

There are a few more around, but it's currently ten to eleven in the UK right now and I'm rather tired and not in the mindspace needed to go trawling for fics. I'll see what I can find you for tomorrow. I also have a few variants where Sirius and Remus and (I think) one where Sirius and Regulus raise Harry too, if those'd be of interest?

*** IIRC A Marauder's Plan starts out reasonably strong (I remember enjoying the politicking that went on behind the scenes) but struggles to maintain that strength through to the end.

One of the best Sirius raises Harry fics out there. Sirius was in Azkaban but breaks out early to rescue Harry from the Dursleys. And delves deep into animagus transformations and other branches of Harrys magic. Highly recommend.

ETA: Is complete and has sequels!!
