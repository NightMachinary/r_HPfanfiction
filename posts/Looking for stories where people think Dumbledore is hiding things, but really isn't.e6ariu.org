Thought it'd be a neat crack fic idea, though bonus if it's made into a serious story. It can be Dumbledore is just at wrong moments at the wrong time, but isn't actually hiding anything at all, and is honest or what have you.

Would rather have no pairings, but if it's set in the Golden Trio Era no Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione please. Can be set in the Marauders Era as well.
