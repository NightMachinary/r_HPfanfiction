I'm looking for a few good Full Metal Alchemist and Harry Potter crossovers if you guys know any.


** These two have been around for a while, update slowly, and are fairly well known.

The Scientist's Lament

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12232358/1/]]

The Colours of the World

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11949378/1/]]

This one is a 3 book series that updates pretty regularly and is on the last book.

Magic and Mind

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11052627/chapters/24641256]]

These ones are newer and update pretty regularly

He's A Killer Queen

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22365040/chapters/53430703]]

Sniper's Solve 99% Of All Problems

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20644262/chapters/49023794]]

I don't remember this one quite as clearly as all the above, but I think I like it. I know I like all of the above though.

Alchemist in the order

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23413075/chapters/56112547]]

I'm more iffy on this one, but maybe you'll like it.

Veritas et virtus

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23098498/chapters/55262182]]

Don't really remember this one

Are you sure this is a good idea

  Of all things Edward was prepared for as the day of reckoning grew near, being transported from one world on the edge of war to another was not one of them. AKA: Edward gets accidentally summoned by Death Eaters, and neither party is happy. (Pre-Promise Day, HP book 5)

  Ed had thought, after the whole Promised Day, homunculus, entire country harvested for alchemical batteries thing, the batshit quotient of his life would have settled down some. He really ought to have topped out the meter with that one. But no. The bullshit is just getting started. “Are you fucking kidding me,” Ed demands. “The wizards?” Podfic & Chinese translation available! See notes

  It's Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts, and Dark Forces seem to be getting stronger. In an effort to ready the students in the event of an all-out war Dumbledore opens up a new class, one that hadn't been taught in a long time. Alchemy.(AU where fma's Promised Day/eclipse is ten months later than the canon date, giving the good guys more time to prepare against Father. So right now, Edward knows of the Homunculus and Father and all that drama but has yet to fight them in Central. Easy enough to remember, right?)Edward Elric just wanted to stay with Alphonse and prepare for the Promised Day, but Ed's being reassigned-not just to any old place in Amestris, but to the other side of the world, a place called Hogwarts in London, England. So what happens when a grumpy Edward Elric comes to Hogwarts to teach Alchemy?Hogwarts is a new experience to Edward. What the hell is the Order of the Phoenix? Why is he yanked into it? What's so special about Harry Potter? A pissed professor, the Order of the Phoenix, Umbridge, and a worrying Molly Weasley.Canon pairings

  Alchemists and wizards collide when Colonel Edward Elric is called to aid Hogwarts as an extra security measure against the murderer Sirius Black. He leaves his growing family and heads for an unknown land to protect one of the most famous wizards, Harry Potter. And they expect him to do WHAT? Teach? Oh Truth...

  Following Al's restoration, the Truth sends the Elric Brothers to another universe with zero information. Neatly forged paperwork lands Ed a job teaching summer school remedial chemistry to children who are older than he is.

**** All plants seemingly have a ‘Scientific name'. The Sunflower is no different. They're called Helianthus. Helia meaning sun and Anthus meaning Flower. Contrary to popular belief, this doesn't refer to the look of the sunflower, but the solar tracking it displays every dayy during most of its growth period.

  For political reasons, Britain asks Amestris for a bodyguard. For political reasons, Amestris sends the Fullmetal Alchemist. Unfortunately for both sides, neither Harry nor Ed really like this idea. Unfortunately for both boys, they're stuck with it. Crossposted on AO3
