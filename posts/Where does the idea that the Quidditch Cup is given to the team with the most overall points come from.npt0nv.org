This idea had been brought up in a few recent threads about problems with Quidditch with the claim that it is canon. But I don't recall ever reading anything like that in the books. In fact, I recall Harry being generally told to catch the snitch as fast as possible. Is this a Pottermore thing or something?

Besides, this idea makes Quidditch even worse, since it means that the only teams that can win a season are the ones in the last game of the season, unless the players are idiots.


** This /is/ Canon, though. Oliver Wood had to remind Harry to /not/ catch the Snitch during the final game of PoA because then, in the overall yearly cup, they wouldn't have had enough points to win the cup. This wasn't a problem before because Gryffindor always won their matches in PS and CoS except for the final in PS because Harry was in the Hospital Wing following the Quirrellmort incident.

#+begin_quote
  Oliver took to constantly reminding Harry that he must not catch the Snitch unless they were ahead by at least sixty points, and ordering that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he went, to prevent anyone from harming him before the game, which numerous Slytherins made it clear was a clear and present danger.

*** Well, I guess it's good to know that it's at least a canon terrible idea.

But if that's the only reference to it in the books, I definitely don't feel bad about missing it.

** I feel that it's more like when things come down to goal differential in other sports.

A 3-0 Ravenclaw team wins the cup over a 2-1 Gryffindor team, even if the Gryffindor team scored a thousand more points.

A 2-1 Gryffindor Team that scored 1000 points wins the cup over a 2-1 Ravenclaw team that scored 850.

It's not as clean as goal differential but it at least makes some sense in a tiebreak. It's also less convluted than doing the math for what amounts to a throwaway scene.

Realistically they should play more than three matches during the course of the season. At a minimum you'd think they'd play each house twice during the year rather than once.

It's the story it's nothing more than a way to allow Harry to lose to get the added drama and broom loss while still allowing him to win the cup. And done so in a way without having to put in the scores of every match.

*** That makes more sense to me.

Though I feel like it would make more sense to break a tie by giving it to whoever won the game between the tied teams. Though I suppose you could justify it by saying that they took that rule from the professional leagues, where there are too many teams or games to decide ties that way. And I suppose it is possible for three teams to end the season with 2-1 records, or for two teams to have 2-0-1 records, which would make my method not work.

** You know that's one aspect of canon that I choose to ignore. You can only imagine the stupidity of having the matches against Hufflepuff go on for 60 hours because every team is trying to win a thousand points from them.

** I can only assume that everyone who is downvoting but not commenting is upset that I pointed out that Quidditch has dumb rules, but can't actually think of a way to defend those dumb rules.
