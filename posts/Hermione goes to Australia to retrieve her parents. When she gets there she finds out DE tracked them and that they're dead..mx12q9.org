What the title says.


** I always wondered how her parents went to Australia when she modified their memories AND their names, but the passports clearly had their real ones ?

**** On unrelated note, why JKR bothered to come up with middle names to everyone, but didn't thrown in first names for Hermione parents? Like, come on, who cares that Umbridge's middle name is Jane and that Scamander's second middle name is Fido!

***** She did. Only that their name as Mister and Missus, odd-sounding names for sure and can confuse anyone. Mr Mister Granger and Mrs Missus Granger.

***** JKR created a lot of interesting characters and never gave them more than 2 lines in her books. I would gladly read about Hermione's parents reaction to the wizarding world, or Black family drama, or get to know Andromeda and Ted tonks. But she'd rather write about Mrs Weasley and Ginny hating Fleur or give us details about Ron and Lavender. (Which lets be honest no one cares about.)

****** In fact, here books have a dissonance of message, as their perspective on importance of events is definitely wizard supremacist with muggles always being portrayed as passive objects manipulated by situation. I understand why wizarding point view is prevalent to narrative, but her dismissal of Hermione's parents is just staggering.

******* We only ever saw the war from Harry's perspective, I guess it was what the author wanted. But at the end of the day he was ignorant of pretty much everything about the wizarding world, of the people in charge and other important factors. As a child I didn't really dwell on it, I was more interested about the trio and their adventures.

Years later stuck in quarantine and reading fanfictions made me realise the endless characters and point of views I had 0 idea about. Important turning points that played a big role in the war. It never was just about Harry, everyone in the wizarding world was affected.

How were things before the war ? Was the reaction to muggleborns the same? What did people think of James marrying Lily ? How did Voldemort gather followers? What made them join him while they knew nothing about his family tree ? What was the political aspect ? How was the old order of the phoenix ? Hermione's parents reacting to McGonagall's visit ? What happened to the muggleborns during that last year ? How were things at Hogwarts?

And endless questions.

*** Magic? She either created new passport or modified their current ones. Both can't be that hard with a wand.

**** That would be awkward when they turn up at the airport and realise they don't exist in any database.

Plus they were dentists, I don't know if it was a private practice but you can't just stop showing up to work and go to another country. You also can't just immigrate for an indefinite period of time and settle in a new country just like that. What happens to their old identities that just vanished ? Im sure muggle authorities would find it weird. Their old bank accounts are under their old names. It sounds like boring adult paperwork, but it's not as simple as modifiying their memories.

***** Plot twist, Hermione didn't think of any of these things (she'd completely gone native to the Wizarding World by that point and has no idea how computers work anymore) so her parents spent the whole of DH in an Australian Detention Centre on charges of Illegal Immigration.

****** Plot twists further when immigration finds out who they really are and that they have a daughter whose records mostly stopped in the muggle world after she went to Hogwarts. Now they have two people who showed up under false names and denying that they have a daughter. Obvious conclusion is that they murdered Hermione and decided to flee from Britain.

** Hermione was insignificant enough that most of Voldemort's people had no clue how she looked like despite fighting her at the battle of DoM. I can totally imagine Lucius suggesting to Bellatrix, "Hey Bella! Remember that girl that was with Potter at the DoM? We could go after her parents and force Potter out of hiding in order to try and rescue them."

Bellatrix blinks confused, "Who?"
