If you saw my post from a few hours back you'll know that I'm pretty new in the Harry Potter fanfiction community. Since then I've been looking all over fanfic sites to find enjoyable stories and I've noticed in more than a few of them that the writers have given Harry a different name, the main two being Hadrian and Hardwin.

Is there a particular reason for this? With the amount of times I've seen this I feel like it can't possibly just be a coincidence. I could understand something like Harrison, but why these other names?

Oh yeah, I can't leave out my personal favourite: Hadrianus. I really don't like bashing other people's works but reading him introduce himself as that made me physically cringe . . . I'm sitting in a room by myself looking on my laptop and I physically cringed. =/


** Hadrian is a sign you are reading a most likely poorly wriiten fanfic where harry is a purebood lord amd the story likely has all the same tropes those kind of stories rely on. I do not read a story if I see the name Hadrian.

In this fandom whenever a story gets popular there is usually a gilion copy cat fics of it. That's where the Lord Hadrian Potter Black Every House comes from,

Welcome to the fandom tho

** I'm similar in that I can't handle name changes at all. The funny thing is that most Harry's in most fanfics are just OC named Harry..... and I'm absolutely ok with that. But the moment the name is changed it just breaks the immersion for me. Ironic right?

In general I usually associate Henry/Hadrian with bad quality stories. Similar to "I'm not your boy Dumbledore" trope.

Not sure why writers do this, but they probably think it adds prestige to Harry or something

*** Its not so much that the name changes bother me (unless he's called Hadrianus), its more that I just didn't understand why. I understand why his official name might be Harrison and he just goes by Harry to his friends, but I just don't understand the reasoning behind the others.

I do agree though that I am starting to see a pattern in that Hadrian fanfics seem to be overpowered as fuck Harry and somehow the heir to Houses Potter, Black, and Slytherin.

** I would get Hardwin because that's the name of his ancestor but not Hadrian. With the name Hadrian he'll probably be some op 11 year old who can already defeat Dumbles. I don't really mind his change of name, they usually just call him his nick name, Harry.

** Agree with all of these. Usually a sign of a specific type of fic where all purebloods/nobility have outrageously long names.

I've also seen it used in severitus fics or fics where Harry's identity is changed, i.e. if he gets adopted or finds out his dad isn't who he thought it was. Then the name change represents the change in his identity.

** I liked the idea of Hawthorne (in Deadly Nightshade) as a part of the idea of the "Evan's Families tradition" of flower/plant themed names given to their children.

** Pureblood wank. Usually teenagers writing wish fulfilment fics of what things they think are posh and sophisticated. Reversing the point of the books entirely, which is that blood doesn't matter, they instead choose to make Harry the person who has the bluest blood imaginable. Hadrian is apparently an appropriate name, though how it's abbreviated to Harry is anyone's guess

Harry is at least an actual nickname for Henry, which unlike Harrison is a normal British name, so that gets a pass from me. Very few fics choose Henry, though, because apparently it's not posh enough either - despite being the name of 8 kings of England and one of the current princes

** IF you asked why, I'd have said because every moron and/or child is free to write and post fanfics, but since you asked for a reason I'll have to say there are three that I've seen.

First one basically boils down to "the name Harry isn't cool enough."

Second one is "I've seen Harry was called abc in the fic xyz and I liked it so much I'm doing the same."

And the third one simply is "I'm the author and I can, so I did, for no reason other than I could."

** The only time changing the name of Male Harry makes sense to me is if A: It's a fic where he doesn't know his own name because the Dursleys left him at the Orphanage instead of taking him in or someone adopted him from the doorstep of Privet Drive. B: He's in hiding for insert reason here and doesn't want to be found by Britain, and C: He's the Reincarnation of someone and uses their name instead due to having no real attachment to the name Harry Potter in his formative years but having the memories of the Reincarnation character. Example: He's the reincarnation of Itachi, has Itachi's memories as a kid, and remembers a whole life as Itachi, he'd identify with the name Itachi before Harry.

Though if you name Harry after an Emperor, Nero Claudius Potter > Hadrianus Potter. Especially if Harry happens to secretly be a Saberface.

Female Harry is always a freaking flower name though. I prefer it when Female Harry gets named after a badass witch. Circe Potter, Medea Potter, Morgana Potter, a ridiculous badass from History or something.

** People like to preserve the H in his name - but sometimes want a more aristocratic sounding name (hence the Hadrian and other similar names). For me, it'd be hard to make a non-Harry name work - particularly if he just instantly flips his name with no problem.

Female versions of Harry tend to oscillate between Harriet and flower names

** It's to make him a rich aristocrat. Not a sexy one either but Lord Hadrian James Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Peverell-Emrys. Honestly, the only names that makes sense are Harold, Harrison, and Henry. Considering he's British, Henry seems like the most likely one.

** There's a lot of Hadrian haters out there. I see it as a case of somebody trying to go with JKR's "pretentious wizarding names" theme. But Aunt Petunia was quoted in canon referring to Harry as a "nasty, common name," thus implying that his name is actually just plain Harry.

Now, if we're going into the concept of Harry going into hiding and changing his name, then any derivative of Harry is a silly mistake. A false name should be nothing like your real name. Hermione may think wizards have no logic, but even they would be suspicious of James Evans when Harry Potter disappears.

** For most of us, Harry isn't fun to say. In any accent for the English language it doesn't really sound good to the ear. It's also not very magical-sounding when most other characters have names like Unctious, Cantakerous, Hermione, and Hepzibah.

Usually it's a diminutive of another name irl. So it can be a nickname for: Harold, Henry, Haraldr, Hadrian, Harrison, Horatio, Harriet, Henrietta, Hari, Harri, and many others which are all variations of Harry from different countries. Some people just have certain preferences.

A lot of fics just give a new name entirely, that isn't connected to "Harry" at all. It's a name of a fictional character. It's not enough to get snippy with people over. You wouldn't believe the amount of people who will attack you over having his birth name be something else even if his nickname is still Harry.

*** Hermione is Muggleborn. Then there are pureblood wizards called extremely normal names like Ronald, Fred, George, Charles, William, Arthur, Molly, Marcus, Gregory, Vincent, James, Ernie, Hannah, Frank, Alice... and those are just from the Sacred 28.

Harry doesn't sound bad at all in any accent, btw. That's just your opinion.

** some of them do it because 'Harry' is a) usually a nickname and b) seems kinda dull compared to other names in the wizarding world, if some of the more...creative attempts are anything to go by. Hell, I was reading through a particular authors work just last week and they use a different name every time, each a tad more ridiculous than the last.\\
Not a fan of Hadrian, myself. Henry or Harrison? Eh. fine. Hadrian? Ugh. It's not even that good of a name.

(maybe Hadrianus was the authors attempt to make it more latin sounding?)
