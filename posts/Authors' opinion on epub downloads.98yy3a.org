What do fanfiction authors think about their readers downloading their fics as an epub or PDF to read offline?

Does it bother them as their stats don't tick up?


** Personally, I don't think it bothers me very much aside from the fact that someone has a permanent (probably?) copy of something I'm sure I'll look back and cringe at myself for x.x But otherwise, I consider views to be a rather pointless set of statistics.

*** Thanks for the answer.

Don't you think a reader reading offline is less likely to come back with a review or two which lead to discussions that help you improve?

**** Not really. Meaningful reviews are rare anyway, and I guess I have this assumption (or maybe hope) that if an individual is invested enough in my story to be able to come up with and be willing to write a meaningful review, they'll make the effort to post it anyway.

*** Same here. If epub is more comfortable for you, go for it.

** I don't really care. Stats are fun to look at, but don't mean much in the end. Plenty people read fics without reviewing, favoriting, or even following. Not a big deal for me.

** I'd rather someone read my story and enjoy it than have someone not get to experience it. Views/favs/follows/reviews are all nice, but I write so others can read.

** I can't speak as a writer, but I hope some of the authors that request their fics not be downloaded are aware that there are many visually impaired and blind FF readers and others with reading disabilities. Being able to download fics and convert them to your preferred format or device can make a huge difference in how readable and enjoyable a story is, especially if you're pulling it off of a less accessible website.

** It doesn't worry me at all but I wish there was a way of seeing how many people download it. It does seem to imply that a reader likes it enough to want it on their own computer.

I do think it affects the number of reviews because I very much doubt that a reader would make the extra effort required to find the fic again just to leave a comment, no matter how much they liked it.

Does it actually affect the stats? I use the FanFictionDL plugin for Calibre, and I'm pretty sure it just scrapes the website. It's actually more likely to /inflate/ view stats, because it looks like I read the entire fic if I bailed at chapter 2.

*** Anything that encourages the author to keep writing is a good thing. Even if the story is shit.

** As someone who prefers to read on their kindle, I think it would be very hypocritical of me to not like others downloading my fanfictions as ebooks.
