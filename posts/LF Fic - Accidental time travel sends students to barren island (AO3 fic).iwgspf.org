Hey! I've been trying to find this fic for a while but for the life of me can't remember the name.

â€‹

A lot of hogwarts students end up in a barren island in the past and have to figure it out to survive. The island later becomes known as Atlantis, they have dragons and sink ships, and use magic in creative ways. Can anyone help me find this fic? thank you!


** Pretty sure it's the Island of Fire series by esama
