I'm like 90% sure this was a real fic and not a fever dream...Tom Riddle Sr.'s bones get replaced with sticks, so the ritual in Goblet of Fire to make a new body for Voldemort turns him into a tree.


** *Voldemort emerges from the cauldron.*

****** Oooohhhhh, do tell. I can't read HPMOR, I guess i'm just one of the one's that never really got into it, but if you're willing, what was the prominent snap?

******* [[/spoiler][HPMOR is one giant "super first year" fic that takes place mostly at Hogwarts. One recurring joke is that Harry can do anything he wants with a snap of his fingers. In Significant Digits, the setting is fleshed out a lot more, with chapters written in the distant past and near future. Among these chapters, we learn that Merlin has seen a bunch of threads into the future, and all threads except one terminate with the snap of someone's fingers. Eventually he is about to stop Harry from carrying out Harry's plan, when Harry threatens to snap his fingers (and lock the world in stasis). Merlin yields and all is well that ends well. So really, it's a /lack/ of a prominent snap.]]

** I've only ever seen two versions of "different ritual ingredients" for that scene in fanfics: Champions Champion has Ron replace Harry as the sacrifice, and it turns Voldemort lazy, fat, and obsessed with quidditch. The other one, I forgot the name of the fic, but I think Sirius replaced the father's bones with squirrel bones, turning the dark lord into a squirrely hybrid monster...

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.

*** In HPMOR, they lace the bones in Tom Riddle's grave with a mix of potions and hallucinogens, but they also expect that those ones are fakes anyway and that the real ones were removed long ago.

*** I have to add that there was a very cracky one that I regret reading in which the riddle bones were replace with sewage and the resultant form was that of a log of shit, well I was left wishing I was high on whatever the person who wrote it was on, high enough to produce that fic but still remain coherent to type

*** I don't remember which one it was, but there was a fic where Peter used his tail in rat form in the potion instead of his hand (maybe by accident), and Voldemort ended up half-rat instead of half-snake.

** I think it was a time travel story that uses yew sticks so the ritual turns voldie into a tree with his face and get's killed with basilisk poison or something like that. So far the weirder ones have been squirrelmort and spidermort.
