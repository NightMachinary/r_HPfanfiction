:END:
I believe I once read a fanfic that may or may not have been crack. The only thing I can remember is that, to imprison death eaters, Harrys has them transfigured into cans of spam...or was it individual spam??? I feel like a few might've been turned into ottomans. I feel like Harry also had one of the common trope elements of a magic trunk (at least one that was expanded enough ti have a living room for said ottomans/spam to reside in). If anyone know what this is, I'd appreciate knowing what it was called
