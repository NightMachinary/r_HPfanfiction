And I lost a bet with a beta.

In short he wanted to do a social experiment about community interactiveness (or something, I wasn't exactly sober when he explained it). He wants to see how people will respond to an open forum with a writer. I told him to find a real writer, but apparently I'm the closest thing he can get to guinea pig for him. Honestly I expect this to go over like a lead balloon, but he's helped me and I agreed to give it the old college try.

This also isn't going to really be time stamped. I'm going to pretty much respond as long as I keep getting notifications that someone posted something or until I'm told to stop.

So uh, ask me stuff?

** Hi! I've got a few questions. Really enjoyed 'Letters' by the way.

Without being self depreciating, why should we read what you have written?

Where do you draw inspiration?

Ever get the urge to build your own world?

*** In reverse order:

1. Not really, no. In my non fanfiction writing I tend to focus more on realism and the world as a whole. I love big cities and tend to focus original work in those settings. I'm fascinated by the 'modern world' and like to focus my efforts there. Oddly enough, this is something I don't really get to do in fanfiction.

2. I'm not sure it's particularly possible to answer that question. Inspiration can come from just about anywhere. If I get an idea, I usually write it down. Then I'll sit there and write points on what that idea could mean, or turn into. And somewhere along the line that turns into a story.

On the flip side, though, sometimes it's just a stray thought. I thought 'I want to see if I can write a story that is really multiple stories going on at once' and planned out The Quidditch World Cup. My wanting to see if I could do that came from Mary Shelley's excessive use of frame narratives in Frankenstein. So I suppose in a roundabout way, QWC was inspired by Frankenstein.

1. I'm a really passive writer when it comes to a question like that. I put forth pretty much no effort in self-promotion (one of the reasons why I suggested my beta get someone else for this). But here goes. I try to write entertaining, realistic stories. In the fanfiction I focus on realism in the context of a magical world. If that's something that intrigues you, then I think you'll like some of my stuff. If it doesn't, then you probably won't.\\

But I write largely to entertain. Yes, there are some stories where I'm trying to get at a larger point or make a commentary on something. But really my stories exist to be entertaining. My goal is to write something that will probably only take 6-8 hours to get through, and will be amusing and real.

I don't know if you'd consider that self-depreciating. But it's honest. I'm not trying to change the literary world. I'm not trying to have any sort of grand effect on 'the fanfiction community. My goal for me is to get feedback on my writing. Yes, in each story I'm working on something specific to take to original work, and posting it is a way for me to see if others think it's working or not. But really, I just hope people are amused by what amount to looks into what 'life' in a magical world at odds with modernity would mean. To accomplish my goals, I need people to read so I can receive feedback. To get people to read I have to present a polished, and entertaining product. So it exists, as a whole, to be entertaining for the reader.

I don't think that quite answers your first question. I'll think about it more and see if I come back to it.

*** Yes. I already am out of ideas of what to write about in the Harry Potter world. The three non-complete stories I have posted are at least planned out in their entirety, but I'm not sure if I'll have anything new after that. Of course, Vitam Paramus came mostly out of nowhere.

I honestly don't read a lot of fanfiction, so there may be plenty of things that deal with concepts I find under explored that I'm just not familiar with.

That being said; I think the 'Pureblood' agenda is too often glossed over as an inherently evil concept. Yes, in the novels it is pretty much presented that way, but I think it could make an interesting story if a writer came up with a realistic way to present how the Purebloods aren't necessarily evil. Give them human emotions and feelings and a cause for their opinions. Attempt to make the readers understand their logic, and emphasize, at least to a degree, with it, rather than writing them off as evil and wrong.

There's a very complicated story to be written deal with 'Muggle born' vs 'half blood' vs 'pure blood' and the societal implications with each. Make it about politics where everyone is a little bit right and a little bit wrong. Of course, you'd need an exceptionally well-crafted villain motivated by things other than a faux-believed superiority and killing all of the other segments. But I think there's a story in there somewhere.

As a whole I think the 'life of a witch or wizard' is under explored. In the canon it seems that most people go to Hogwarts, work for the government, get married at 21 and have a bunch of kids. I'm more intrigued by just what people are doing with their lives. There has to be more to a society than a couple of shops in London and a giant government entity. I also think the ramifications of the influx of muggle-born people is under explored. It usually comes off too much as 'magic for everything' when as a society we tend to focus on constant improvement. I think something where magic and technology are starting to weave into the wizards life could be entertaining. I mean, Television fascinated Albert Einstein, why do we assume Wizards wouldn't be interested to some degree?

Personally I really want to write another story that takes place at Hogwarts. But every time I try to think of an idea that I feel would make an interesting story I come up short.

** I absolutely love Letters! I still read it every once in a while. I really think it's one of the best Harry/Fleur fics, it's very real and believable.

Which story of yours are you most proud of?

Is there a story or concept you are really excited about writing about but can't seem to flesh it out properly?

What is the thing a lot, or even some, writers do that absolutely infuriates you?

For some reason every time I read the words, "X character's eyebrows shot up in surprise", or something to that effect. For some reason it just seems so over used to the point where it doesn't make sense for people to have that strong of a reaction to often times the simplest of things.

*** Thanks for reading.

The Pureblood Princess by far. There's a lot about Letters that I don't like and feel I could have done better. And I think I stylistically limited myself too much in QWC. I went in saying '6 chapters, 10,000 words a piece' and left out pretty much half of what should have been the story.

Princess was an exercise in something I'd never really done before, and I ended up really liking how it turned out. It was just a plus that I got PMs from teenage boys flirting with me because they thought I was both sixteen and female at the end! ...wait...that came out creepier than I thought.

As a whole I liked how I felt that it seemed more like actual school and more like life. I feel like I developed the relationship in it in a pretty good, realistic teenage way. I liked how Daphne's compartmentalization of her relationships came off, and I liked the running cyclical, duality, theme that went through the entire story.

There's parts of Vitam Paramus I'm really proud of to this point. But I'll reserve judgment on that until I've finished it because a lot there hinges on the ending.

I'm certainly not one to comment on repeated writing ticks. My characters smirk, smile, laugh, and shrug just about every other line of dialogue. I'm working on it, I promise! So that would be hypocritical of me.

The only thing that will really turn me off from reading something is if there's just a blatant disregard for presentation, IE lack of paragraphs, things not punctuated right, visual stuff mostly.

Concept wise I really wish the 'super!Harry' thing would just go away. Or at least for the author's that do it to realize that there's no point in a super-powerful main character unless the villain is equally powerful, or more powerful. Superman is really boring without Lex Luthor.

I honestly don't read a lot of fanfiction. I don't have a whole lot of free time and in what I do I prefer to write rather than read. So my 'favorites' come from a very select list and if there's something I exclude it's probably pretty much because I haven't read it. But I'd have to say pretty much anything by Jbern. Particularly Bungle in the Jungle.

I'm a pretty mellow reader though. I'll typically read anything and as long as the grammar is readable I'll enjoy it. I'm sure there's probably fanfics out there I should read. But when my options are write chapter 21 of VP or read something. I'm going to write every single time. Selfish of me, I guess.

As for a story concept I can't flesh out properly? Tenebrae Vincunt. I've written chapter two five times and it's never managed to be worthy of posting. There's a lot I want to do with T.V (some of which may even be in a previous response here >.>) that I can't seem to get down in a way that will make sense.

I mean we all know Harry's going to win in the end. But at least place that doubt for me. Make me think that maybe, just maybe, this villain can beat him. Really, have the villain win a couple of times throughout the story. Then, at the end, have Harry triumph. That makes a much better story than a superhero checklist. More fun to write in my humble opinion, too.

It's really well written and has good depth to the story. The question on my mind is if you ever plan to write a different take on early years of canon? Or maybe continue any of your current stories in different directions as sequel?

*** I struggle with writing believable children. Even Harry in Letters is rightly criticized as being too mature for his age. So it would be really hard for me to write something that took place in the earlier years. I feel like I can write 16+ fairly well, but I find under that to be odd.

I'd kind of like to write something in book 3, but I doubt I ever will. Really, I find four and six the most entertaining for fanfiction purposes. And since I've done things there already, it's hard for me to go back to those books and come up with ideas that are original. Tenebrae Vincunt will cover Harry's seventh year at Hogwarts in some detail.

I'm not really big on sequels. I plan things to be able to stand by themselves for the most part. Which means there's usually not enough plot room for a sequel that is anything more than fluffy scenes of characters moving on. DiP, I suppose, would have the most actual room for a sequel once it's done, as the sequel could simply be another case. But with something like Letters the whole main Harry Potter plot is wrapped up by the end of it, so I'm not really left with something to write about.

Oddly enough, Princess was originally planned with a sequel that shifted the focus from Daphne to Astoria and followed Harry on the Horcrux hunt. But when I re-planned the story after chapter 3 I made Astoria a great deal shallower and decided it didn't make sense.

Review counts are not the best indicator any more. Especially if you post regularly or irregularly. Most readers tend to read the whole thing and then "maybe" leave a (Post more please) review at the end; or a summary of their feelings on the story as a whole.

I try to pay attention to traffic stats on ffn instead, and remind myself that I'm writing FOR ME mostly. Because HPFF is dying and I've read most of the GOOD and COMPLETE stuff.

I'm pretty sure I've read your stuff before, but I never kept a log (wish I had). Next time I am not writing, I'll give your stuff a shot to remind myself.

Still, traffic stat wise, Letters received almost double the hits as Princess did when they were posted. And Princess was almost double what VP is now.

What do I gain from this? Write stories about Harry sleeping with a hot French girl while at Hogwarts if you're interested in reviews!

*** No. 'Next-Gen' to me is awkward. I have too hard of a time believing that everyone got married, stayed happily married, and had a bunch of kids. The closest thing I'll ever come to a next gen fic is what I've done with the main characters living in their twenties and exploring that transition from school-adulthood. And honestly I feel like I'd just lose track of some of the characters and ages and the entire thing would be some sort of mess. I tend to shy away from subjects I think I'd fail at.

The other two questions are fairly subjective and can be affected by a variety of outside influences.

In an hour I can write up to around a quarter of a chapter in good circumstances. That's about five pages of single-spaced word document. I'd say I probably average around 1-2 pages in an hour. Dialogue is easier for me than prose, so dialogue is typically quicker. But there's always points when in an hour, I'll write two sentences and want to hang myself. It happens, it's the nature of the beast.

I counteract that with very good planning, so when I get to the writing portion it's easier. But it's not always a foolproof plan.

A day? Depends on the day. Sometimes I'm at a point where I'm lucky if I can spend 45 minutes to an hour on a chapter. Sometimes I get to sit down and spend five-six hours writing. I'd say on average a chapter, planning, writing, editing, takes about 30 hours of work. Some take more, some take less, and sometimes it takes me three months to find those thirty hours.

That's great that you can write that much in a day. I think the most I can do is maybe three hours and that's completely non-continuous. Maybe an hour continuous writing is enough for me, and I feel done. How much do you plan a chapter?

***** At the start of the story I outline what I want the entire thing to be about. I then break that outline down into specific orders and parts and separate them by how I think they'll play out best when presented together.

I then write a one page summary of of each chapter, focusing on what will happen in the chapter and how characters will react to it. I revisit those summaries as I make my way through the story. But typically that one page frame stays pretty close. So the actual writing of the chapter becomes more the specific semantics of the themes I've already laid out.

He's just an original character that was needed to fit a few purposes in Letters that kind of grew on me. I both like the name Titus and the name Button. It fit in with the exceptionally poorly executed F1 theme in Letters. It amuses me that people have asked me where he appears in Canon when he does not.

I use a lot of the same characters in Fanfiction because they're little more than names and it's easier than constantly coming up with original names It's kind of cheating, and I won't do it in original works, but here it works. Eva (Eve) Larson, Sophie Sinclair, and Jason Williams all appear in at least three of my works as well.

Titus, in my more 'adult' works just winds up as a 'adult' friend to Harry. A sort of entity where he can be a twenty-something in peace and not worry about what happened in the past. He's a separation from the 'Hogwarts friends' where Harry doesn't have to meet those expectations anymore....if that makes sense.

** Hello! I just recently finished reading all of your stories and I've really enjoyed them a great deal. You did something I didn't think was possible and made me care about quidditch. the way you write is realistic and believable, but also very engaging.

I'm loving ever line of Vitam Paramus. I've never been the biggest fan of Harry/Gabrielle, but everyone in it is written so well and the relationships feel so natural, it really is incredibly well done.

That being said, I'd have to say that Pureblood Princess is probably my favorite, for many of the same reasons. Your plots unfold slowly, but in stead of dragging, they allow the characters and the narrative to grow in a measured, thoughtful way, and finding good Harry/Daphne stories is always a challenge. Any chance you'll do any more Harry/Daphne stories in the future?

*** I love quidditch! I just wish it was played without seekers and with time periods. Of course I feel that what I've done to make it engaging kind of ignores the rules of the game. But it's competition! So I'll just shut my mouth and hope no one calls me on it!

I'm glad you think so. VP exists largely as me proving a point to a friend that such a story can exist in realistic confines without something forcing the relationship along. It's been a bit odd to write, because I don't usually write female characters that start off, and stay, as weak as Gabrielle has up until this point. And I shirked part of the plan a bit because I felt it was hindering the story. But I think it's going to turn out how I want so that's always good.

I feel like I've kind of played Daphne to death. She appears in everything i've done, usually as some sort of love interest. And while I love the idea of a playful, unattached female that helps Harry out I feel like what I could do with it would likely become stale. She'll probably appear in whatever else I do and she has a few moments left in VP still upcoming. And a large portion of DiP as well.

That's really a question that, at this time, I feel like I probably won't approach again. But I wouldn't necessarily rule it out. I did say when I started out that I'd never write a story that featured Harry and Gabrielle, so things obviously change.

The closest thing I'd probably do, though, is something closer to an addition to Princess. There's a lot with Princess that got cut from the final product for a variety of reasons. And the story would look a lot different if it wasn't published within the constraints of ff.net. So I have a lot of half-done Harry/Daphne material in there. It's more likely I'd polish and post some of the extras there than anything new.

** I have a question to fan fiction writers, and you specifically, because this pains me a great deal as Sirius Black and Severus Snape are my favorite characters:

Why is it that in nearly all stories, either the Marauders or Snape get horrible treatment by the writers?

Snape is either a combination of pathetic and evil or the misunerstood superman, and on the flipside, the Marauders can do no wrong or are a bunch of violent thugs in every story I read. Lupin admitted that the Marauders went too far and he knew they did wrong yet never stopped him, James stopped hexing people for fun only in his seventh year, and Sirius was deeply troubled and vindictive... while Snape was the stereotypical story of the disenfranchised and bullied turning to racist ideology for a sense of empowerment and while became utterly loyal to the other side, yet bitterness and anger defined him until his death.

It hurts me that (nearly) the only time Sirius and Snape are treated well is in slash stories where they get involved (on a personal more note: eww).

Honestly neither of the characters particularly interest me as a writer. But that's just me. If I had to discuss it I'd say that James and Sirius probably were bullies and if I wrote about them in school they wouldn't be particularly nice people.

I don't think Snape became Snape because he was bullied though. I think that, and what little we get from Lily's commentary in a memory, he probably gave it back a good deal. And we certainly see the roots of 'pureblood bigotry' even when he's just talking with Lily before Hogwarts. I'd agree he's more complicated than that.

I don't; however, think that spying makes him 'the bravest man I've known' and Rowling's attempts at vindication came across too heavy handed. I think he's better left in a gray area of wasted opportunity and missed dreams. Deep down, I think he knows he could have had a happy life with Miss Evans had he been a bit of a better person growing up. It took him too long to realize that what he was being faulted for, were really his own faults, and by that point it was too late.

And I don't think Snape's 'hatred' of Harry comes from any from of hatred of James. In fact, he's perfectly passive on James's death. I think it comes more from Harry representing everything that Snape could have had (Loving wife, family) had he been better. Harry is a physical manifestation of his own failures as a human being and he does not know how to cope with that. I mean Snape desperately wants to see Harry as James, but Harry is not the boisterous, charismatic bully leading around a pack of students. He's the introvert with few friends. Harry is far closer to what we know of Snape than what we know of James. And I think that hurts all the more.

If I had to answer the question more bluntly I'd say it's likely because it's harder to write a three-dimensional character. It's easier to have 'good vs evil' and to make teenagers miniature clones of death eaters and then another side thwarting them. People want the characters they perceive as 'good' to be wholly good. So anyone associated with Harry must be a saint. And so the Marauders are saints. You'd then need a villain and Snape is the logical possibility.

It boils down to that writer probably doesn't want to believe any fault in Harry or Harry's family. I don't want to say that's bad writing, but at the very least it's inexperienced writing that makes everything more one dimensional than it should be. It's an easy way out that's typically more 'fun' for the writer doing it because they don't want to focus on the real world ramifications of character actions. There's nothing inherently wrong with that in Fanfiction. In fact, that's arguably the point of fanfiction, but it can leave some readers, as yourself, with a bad taste in their mouth.

I hate to think of the type of responses that people that 'bash' the marauders or 'praise' Snape get. I know I've been review yelled at for having characters do things that aren't as perfect as the audience would like and can only imagine how bad it could get. Of course, with the serial nature of fanfiction they can't simply turn the page and look for the motivation.

Kinda rambled there. Hope that sort of at least provided some insight.

**** Thank you for the quick reply. That was a nice insight into the mind of a writer. I would like to add (what I forgot) that I enjoy your stories :)

I agree with what you said, and would like to add that Snape, at least according to JKR, being a teacher was forced by Dumbledore (he needed Snape around... Snape obviously didn't enjoy it), and I think the source of a lot of Snape's bitterness and anger was that he never got a chance to do something for himself in his adult life.

***** That's such a terrible thing to do to kids though. I have a hard time believing it would fly for over a decade. I'll buy that he'd rather be teaching another class, but forcing him to be a teacher is just a poor situation all around.

He didn't need him around enough to lock him in the castle year round. I'd like to think Dumbledore is smart enough to know that someone that actually flat out hates teaching is a terrible teacher.

I'd rather view him as harsh, 'old-school' and a bit of a dick but still capable and competent than completely incompetent and uninterested.

****** JKR did say that the only reason Snape taught was because Dumbledore needed him there. Anti-social, vituperative and brilliant is just about the worst combination for teaching teens... think House teaching middle-school kids biology instead of working as a doctor. He could do it, very well, but everyone involved would absolutely hate it.

Ron and Harry got an E in potions when tested by outside officials, so Snape was obviously competent, but he also taught at least 24 hours a week, graded around 1000 essays a week, had duties as head of house, detentions to observe, and patrols at night; he would not have had free time unless you count summer and Christmas breaks.
