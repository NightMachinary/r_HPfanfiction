Give me two fics that you woukf combine to create a glorious, glorious crackfic.

"Harry is a dragon and that's ok", and "Like a red headed stepchild"

You get the combined hilarity of the combined efforts of the weaisly clan, along with the introduction of Magical beings into Hogwarts, including a set of rival pranksters, an combined Percy redemption arc. And an combination of hilarious Dumbledore and extremely stressed Mcgonnagol.


** “Make a Wish” and “Harry Potter and the Wasteland of Time”

I'm curious to see if Mr. Black or WaT Voldemort would win. Both are equally, stupendously OP.

** "A Second Chance" and "Prince of Slytherin".

Sirius get out of jail and raises Harry, only to have Harry end up in Slytherin and becomes a sort of super Slytherin.

Also, he pranks Draco everytime Draco wants to go running to Lucius.
