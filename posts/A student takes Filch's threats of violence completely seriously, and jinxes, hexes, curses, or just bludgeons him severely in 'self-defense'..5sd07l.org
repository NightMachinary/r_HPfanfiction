You know how occasionally in canon and in fanfic and whatever, Argus Filch has a tendency to threaten violence against students he catches doing wrong things? Flogging them with a horsewhip, hanging them up by their ankles, et-cetera?

What if a new student to Hogwarts took him completely literally (presumably not being very used to hyperbole), and panicked, and lashed out at him? Does anyone know any stories where that happens? Possibly ones where he ends up getting killed or turned into a slug (see Malfoy, OotP chapter #39)?


** I am not aware of any such stories. There is, however, a story where his threats are not entirely idle: linkffn(Palimpsest by Larry Huss).

  "Hang around here often?" Harry Potter asked Draco Malfoy, clanking his chains in a friendly way.

  "No, first time for me. Do Muggles do this a lot?"

*** Can you give an actual summary of that fic? The author's one is really vague.

**** It is a message-from-the-future-self story, with severe limitations on the size of the message. It is very well done, and the author's style is pretty unique. Unfortunately, the author is no longer with us, so it won't be finished, unless someone picks up the torch.

His other stories are also noteworthy.

  Five years of intense study and trying to survive has come to its inevitable conclusion and everything's gone to hell in a handcart. A smut fic that got a little too much plot for its own good. AU. - Discontinued -
