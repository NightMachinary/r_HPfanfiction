Hello Y'all I live for this subreddit so I thought I'd hop on over and ask because I am at my wits end looking for 2 different fanfics.

I read a fic earlier this year that I cannot find i believe on ao3. There was a marriage law but Draco wanted nothing to do with Hermione. Hermione bonded with Narcissa and would destroy the manor if Draco upset her. I remember a clear scene with Theo having to stand in for Draco at their wedding. It def got expicit at some point and it was either a one shot or a 5+1 type multi chapter. Draco and Hermione ended up together in the end and it took place over multiple years. It had a little angst and a little humor as well.

The second fic is much harder. It was pure crack. Like the crackiest type crack I have ever found on FF.Net. It was second gen and for some reason I think it was called 'The Best Laid Plans' but I could be wrong. I remember reading it like 6 or 7 years ago. It was 2nd gen with either Albus or James as the main character with Scorpious as a prominent character as well. It had comments that were similar to the not since the accident meme. LIke I know there was a comment about not being able to play a board game since the .... in 03. Harry was also a major player. It just been bugging me for years I never finished it but the device I was reading it on is long gone and so are all the bookmarks I had saved on it.
