Make a fic exploring a female Sirius. How would a female Sirius interact with James and the rest of the marauders? Would they be as close? How would Sirius' relationship with her parents and brother differ? Would she be similar or different to her three female cousins? Would she chase after Peter, still? Would she be kinder or meaner to Snape? Would she still be a Gryffindor? Etc.


** This is fascinating. I've seen Marauder gender swap before (nothing worth rec'ing) but it's always been a swap of everyone's gender.

I'm pretty firmly convinced that female Sirius and James would still be extremely close. Her personality would be somewhat different, but I don't think it would change enough to keep her from clicking with James right away. She's still Sirius, after all. But that gives rise to the issue of... does James still fall in love with Lily when he's unusually close to his unusually beautiful (still Sirius!) female best friend? I'm aware that there's such a thing as platonic male/female friendships, but as fixated on James as Sirius is, I keep coming back to a female Sirius having trouble with the idea of James fancying Lily.

*** Me as well! I think it's possible Sirius could perhaps have an unrequited crush on James, or the other way around, either way the Jily scenario would be somewhat altered.

*** Unless she's a lesbian, or more tomboy/bot Jame's type. James seemed to like Lily for years before they actually went out, and she seemed pretty damn different to the Marauders or didn't really like them. So, I don't think it'd change all that much.

** Fem!Sirius would be the baddest bitch at Hogwarts. Considering they were at the school in the 80's, I would love to see a Joan Jett like personality from her. Flirty and unapologetic and headstrong and talented. Some people have "fuck you" money, Sirius has "fuck you" magic. A true rebel.

She becomes a dog animagus, because "fuck you."

She fights Voldemort and his followers, because "fuck you."

She has the Black name and fortune and squanders it on dumb shit, because "fuck you."

She gets implicated in the Potter's death and finds it /fucking hilarious that they would even consider her/, and doesn't tell anyone anything, because "fuck you."

She doesn't end up with James despite them having a short fling: James and Sirius are just too much energy with no direction if in love. Lilly balances out James' chaotic side and gives him some ground to stand on. Conversely, Lilly and Remus briefly consider courtship, but decide they're both more attracted to their chaotic counterparts. Lilly loves "taming" James to be more practical and effective, while Remus' depression gets the better of him and requires that wild spark to keep him functional. James and Sirius obviously benefit from their more grounded partners.

Remus and Sirius, Lilly and James. The whole foursome would go down like a Led Zeppelin.

*** Yes, one could roll with that and explore society's attitude towards homosexuals in the days of yore (unless you go with the whole 'actually, the magical world is way more advanced and progressive compared to the muggles in some aspects'). Or, you could go with an amusing love triangle and explore the various ways it would have affected the relationship of the Marauders and other characters. Personally though, i would have more trust in a fic with the latter premise's quality than a fic with the former.
