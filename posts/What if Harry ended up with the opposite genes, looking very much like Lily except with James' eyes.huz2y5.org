I think Sirius & Remus would get a little more emotional looking Harry in the eye.

Snape would be even angrier, given that the spitting image of Lily is constantly at odds with him.

Harry would probably still have a boy's haircut, so he wouldn't be able to mistake himself as either parent from across the lake when he casts a Patronus. Wonder how that plays out.

Petunia might also be a little harder on him.

There would be at least a joke or a nod to how he looks a bit like a Weasley now.


** Snape's last words would be "Don't look at me."

** I always imagined how conflicted Snape would be if Harry was a girl who looked just like Lily.

As for a boy, well I think I once saw a post about Arthur counting the redheads at his table, getting one more and then the Twins making fun of him about forgetting his son, Harry.

I think Petunia would be conflicted. Snape too.

I'm not so sure that they /would/ be at odds. If Severus could look at Harry and remember Lily, instead of having to remember James, they might not have the same antagonism.

** There was a fic like this I read once, where Harry was feminine with long red hair. Personally, i think there are more than enough red heads in the series already ðŸ˜‚

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.
