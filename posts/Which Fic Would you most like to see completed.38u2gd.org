I would really just like it to be finished for the simple reason that no other story I've read gave me such a sense of fascination, and it's wholly unique. If someone were to pick it up and complete it, that would be amazing.

**** Because it's plagiarism? Taking someone's idea without their permission is not okay, neither morally nor legally. Silence is not consent; it's not enough to message and continue if you get no reply. Only explicit and publicly given permission will do.

There are three main reasons why it's morally wrong, where HP fanfiction is, in general, not:

1. JKR as given her explicit blanket permission for HP fanfic to be written, which these authors have not done.

2. JKR's version remains the authoritative version of Harry Potter, regardless of what fanfictions are written about it. Canon exists. This is not the case with fanfiction vs. fanfiction. By taking over someone else's fanfiction you rob them of creative control over their idea.

3. JKR's works were published in complete form, so you were never robbing her of the opportunity to publish her idea before the alternative versions got to be made. She didn't just have priority in terms of authority in the universe, she also had priority in time.

Essentially it comes down to whether or not you believe a person should retain creative control over their original ideas. And just because it's fanfiction, it doesn't mean it doesn't contain original ideas unique to that author. Fanfics are only partly derivative.

There have been painful examples of such plagiarism in the fandom in the past. The most glaring example is this:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2762511/1/A-Shattered-Prophecy][Original]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][Take-over]]

Original has 1000 reviews, the take-over has 7000. The take-over was published before the original was finished, while it was on hiatus and the author temporarily MIA, and robbed the original of its readership. Most people now have never even heard of A Shattered Prophecy, whereas The Darkness Within is one of the better known fics in the fandom. Project Dark Overlord completely lost any kind of control over his idea, and he lost the opportunity to create his authoritative version before others stole it.

****** Ugh. Heads up, this comment is a rant. It's not theft, it's /copyright infringement/. It's a very important distinction because theft is a /moral/ imperative, whereas copyright is just a /legal/ one - copyright was explicitly invented to incentivise the creation of works (via granting a temporary state-sanctioned monopoly to the author), for the sake of /the general public/, and not the authors themselves.

The whole "copyright infringement is theft" thing is based on the /artificial/ concept of "Intellectual Property", which pretends that Copyright, Patents, and Trademarks are all the same thing (and implicitly further asserts that they are like property, but "intellectual"). They're not.

Trademarks were created as a method of ensuring that customers knew /who/ they were buying (i.e. the manufacturer) and preventing impersonation/fraud (for the public good), and patents were a method of encouraging people to take their already-existing trade secrets and record them /in the public domain/ instead of letting the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret][trade secrets]] die with them or their business (for the public good).

Note that "intellectual property" was not meant to "reward one's intellectual labor". Not as an end-goal. When it did so, it was merely as a means to an end of /the public good/. The concept of "intellectual property" was /fabricated/ by businesses who benefited from it at the expense of /the public good/. Like how copyright is extended to the lifetime of an author plus 70 years, or how patents are what they are today (particularly software patents).

Making public, /freely publicly available/ pieces of fiction is something that /benefits/ the public, but at the expense of the author's "right" to limit the copying of the work they wrote. Copyright should therefore not apply here, because /doing so would contradict the primary purpose of copyright/!

******** You're quite right about the dictionary definition. However, there's a lot more to concepts than what a dictionary says. Plagiarism is a complex concept and by rational argument can be extended to novel situations. The situation of fanfiction is one such novel situation, and the definition of plagiarism which suits academia is not immediately the most appropriate form of the concept for the context of fanfiction.

Concepts are often extended in this way. The idea of canon, for example, started out as a religious doctrine, then extended to literature, and much more recently extended to other media such as film. Prior to works such as Star Wars, the idea of canon was entirely about a publish body of written word.

The right to creative control is one of the rights that comes with the idea of intellectual property. If you think a person can own an idea, creative control follows. If you don't think a person can own an idea, then I hope you have a new system of economy and commerce lined up to replace capitalism, because intellectual property forms the basis of our entire economic system.

  The right to creative control is one of the rights that comes with the idea of intellectual property. If you think a person can own an idea, creative control follows. If you don't think a person can own an idea, then I hope you have a new system of economy and commerce lined up to replace capitalism, because intellectual property forms the basis of our entire economic system.

EXCELLENT. This is the core of our problem: /Intellectual Property/, as a moral /and/ legal concept, is made up by copyright and patent holders. It was never the /basis/ of copyright and patents in the first place.

I hope you don't mind if I save myself some effort and link [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/38u2gd/which_fic_would_you_most_like_to_see_completed/crzast2][my previous comment on intellectual property]].

That said, capitalism is an economic structure and not a moral structure. So arguing "but Capitalism" isn't really a strong argument in the first place, unless you're claiming it's merely /illegal/ (and IIRC, an /actual/ lawyer shot that down when someone else wanted to keep "creative control" over their HP fanfic, so that's not the case either).

So, what is your /moral/ justification for why someone, inherently, should have "creative control"? What inherent right does anyone have to stop someone reciting their story with the main character's name replaced with "Hitler"?
