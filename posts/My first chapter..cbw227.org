** Don't get mad but this is honest feedback: This needs serious editing. There are a lot of spelling errors and I think you get the tense wrong once too. Not a native speaker tho. Also your story is inconsistent. Harry knows about the prophecy, yet at the start acts as if he didn't. This is set in 6th year right? Sirius is dead by than and the ministry fight happend- both Ron and Hermione where injured. Therefore the trio knows what's on the line. There is no way Ron would tell Harry to chill with him this year instead of getting stronger. Hell, Both Hermione and Ron probably would want to come with him to train. You portray all the characters really one dimensional - that's sad and their depicted behavior cringe worthy and ooc. Especially your take on Ron feels like bashing - and any kind of bashing kinda ruins a story for me. Also: your Harry is not likable because he seems to has no emotions or even an opinion whatsoever.

*** The spelling errors are probably because I am British and so there are minor differences between mine and the American spellings. I don't think I got the tense wrong but I will investigate. As for the plot issue, in HBP he never got the training I document in my fanfic so it isn't technically necessary, furthermore, I portray Ron as a little childish (not bashing in this case, just creative license) as he was in GoF. As for both of them joining Harry, that was never offered. I will admit that I need to develop Harry more as a character, this is my first fic after all, so look out for the new chapters! Thanks for your comments.
