As it says, looking for underrated or under talked about stories. It can be set in ANY Era, it can have any pairing or plot point or not even have pairings, be completed or not completed.

Just as long as it's a story that doesn't really get talked or recommended that much, compared to others.


** Are we talking about stuff that isn't recommended often nowadays? Because linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology) used to get recommended a lot here and I don't tend to see it often any more, but it's one of the best "Canon Gryffindor gets sorted into Slytherin" stories and does the best examination of Muggleborn prejudice that I've seen. Not to mention a far more interesting Lockhart and diary-Tom in year 2.

** For me "The Aurors" definitely fits the bill. It deserves so much more attention than it gets. I think it gets recced so rarely because it doesn't really fit any common request. But I gotta tell you, the quality of the writing, the plot, the characters. It's brilliant.

Linkao3(13215861)

Else I would say most of the classics apply. They don't get recced often because "they are too tropey"... Nevermind that those classics invented those tropes. So I guess a lot of stuff from fanficauthors.net would apply to this thread. Or Lori's trilogy. Or Shezza's Denarian series. And so on.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially not one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

**** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/e7waab/does_anyone_have_a_saved_copy_of_the_show_that/][Here]] is a thread about someone looking for them, it looks like they disappeared when Schnoogle/FictionAlley went down, same as a huge amount of other fics that weren't posted anywhere else.

All three parts of the series are in the thread though, you can even pick your favorite format as they are available in multiple formats.

** The Pureblood Pretense does get recommended from time to time, but I still think it needs to be more popular. Also, Lord Hermione is a fun read. (If someone dislikes fun or Hermione please save yourselves the trouble of leaving a review. I didn't write it, but I do enjoy reading it.)

  There was no troll in the girls bathroom in 1991. Hermione found no friends that night. Therefore the brightest witch of her age is on a perilous path. Because with magic it is so very true that knowledge is power. But is it also true that power corrupts? Will the only daughter of two dentists become the third Dark Lord that rises in Dumbledore's lifetime?

** So, going through my favs (those that didn't mysteriously disappeared form ffnet list, cause I'm quite sure I had much more in the recent past):

Linkffn(2581495) - Blackwand-Chronicles: Unfinished and likely dead at this point, but very interesting fic which gets overshadowed by the author tentpole HP and the Nightmares of Future Pasts.

Linkffn(5136938) - Innocence and Roses: I love this one and seldom see it rec'd here. A wacky and quite contrived mystery involving Luna. Very fun.

Linkffn(6344731) - Unwise Conspiracy: Where goblins get their just dessert.

Linkffn(7665164) - The Judgement of Harry: I see this one rec'd from time to time. Lesser known from the author. Transposition from a well known episode from the Illiad. Quite good in my opinion.

Linkffn(6947125) - A Study in Magic: x-over with Sherlock Holmes. Outstanding.

Linkffn(6919796) - A Request: I like this one, don't know why.

Linkffn(8827254) - Batman Doesn t Do Magic: Unfinished x-over (obviously). Works better than you think it would given the plot. Lauged a lot with this one.
