I'm looking for fics where Harry was raised by someone other than the Dursleys or where the Dursleys are nice. I know there's a number of them out there, but they all seem to have bashing or GaryStu!Harry.

Does anyone know of any stories where Harry was raised by a loving family, but:

1. No bashing of any kind. (i.e., Dumbledore/Ron/Ginny/Weasleys are all good people who genuinely care about Harry).
2. No overpowered or OOC Harry. None of that Harry solves all the problems of the wizarding world by his mere presence alone that seems so prevalent in these fics. I prefer Harry to be as close to his normal, humble, canon self as possible.
3. No politics. No Lord Hadrian Black or Heir Longbottom, etc. No Slytherin/pureblood politics of any kind.
4. No fem!Harry
5. Not raised by Sirius or Snape.
6. Hermione and Ron are still Harry's closest friends.

Does anyone have any recommendations?


** - /A Different Future/ - Sorry if there's bashing, it's been so long since I've read it I honestly can't remember if there is bashing. Harry left on the doorstep of a church by the Dursleys, is found by Romani(gypsies), and adopted by them. Unfortunately, it's incomplete and appears to be abandoned.

- /A Better Man/ by Valandar - A sort of "Peggy-Sue/For the Want of a Nail" fic centered around one thing. After the war, Vernon Dursley dies. In Hell, the full scope of his transgressions is revealed to him with the knowledge that what he did was wrong, but he's offered a chance at redemption when Harry utters the words, "I wish you were *a better man*." It's not your typical peggy sue fic, where people go back in time with full knowledge of the future. This is one where Vernon is sent back to live his life again, and at a crucial moment, is shifted onto a different path.

- /Blue Magic/ by Tellur - A crossover with the /Mass Effect/ universe, which has Harry rescued from Dudley during a game of "Harry Hunting" a few years before he was due to start at Hogwarts. There is a sort of bashing here, but it's of the wizarding world in general, and Dumbledore doing his best in a deeply flawed system. Again, this appears to be abandoned. it got an update last year, but before that it went 4 years without an update.

- /Harry McGonagall/ by witowsmp - After observing the Dursleys all day, and deciding that they're completely unsuitable as guardians for Harry Potter, She takes him to be raised by her relatives in America. I can't remember if there's any bashing in this one. It's been a while since I've read it.

  The Dursleys decide to not keep Harry Potter and leave him on the steps of a church. A wizarding Romani (Gypsy) couple adopts him, giving him the name of Alexander Romanov, and making him the twin brother to their daughter. Things change from there. Please r&r.

** Not quite a match, but my fic linkffn(We, Harry Potter by wille179) is starting on a Dursley partial-redemption sub-plot. It's been hinted at in previous chapters and I'm going all-in with the next chapter that's like 95% finished.

Spoilers for the next chapter, which will be out pretty soon: The Dursleys visit Hogwarts as part of a good-but-manipulative Dumbledore plot. Petunia gets a wakeup call; she's still a bitch, but she's a self-aware bitch that wants to change because Lily pulled a power-of-love move from the grave. Dudley is stupid still, but willingly took a step towards mending his relationship with Harry. And Vernon accidentally invoked Dobby's ire, which will give him a healthy respect for (read: fear of) magic. Also Dragon!Harry threatens to eat Vernon, so... yeah.

As for your other points:

1. Even with the Dursleys having been cruel (and not even that much crueler than canon), I'm not bashing them. I don't like bashfics and I'll never bash any character.
2. Harry /is/ strong for obvious reasons, but he's no more magically gifted than a slightly-above-average second year. And he doesn't solve problems, he makes them! Like the goblin rebellion he accidentally started. Or nearly driving Hogwarts to Bankruptcy.
3. Future Harry after one day in politics: "Which ministry wizard should I eat first?" And Harry after day two: "Ugh! Umbridge gave me indigestion...." So, yeah, politics!Harry is not happening.
4. Harry is /distinctly/ a young man. He is also a dragon, and that's OK (ha!).
5. Sirius has his own background plot going on. It doesn't involve Harry except accidentally.
6. Yes.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (some fluff, no bashing, not power wank.)

5-year-old Harry Potter overhears his aunt complaining to his uncle about the "freaks" camping nearby. Maybe if they are the same type of "freak" he is they will want him?

Harry is adopted by a gypsy family and travels the world but he still goes to Hogwarts at 11. There are a few warnings so pay attention to them but this is a truly awesome fic and worth reading.
