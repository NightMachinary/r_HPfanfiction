What if Bill, a curse breaker ends up finding the diary. What if Bill wakes up at night, when Fred, George and Ron decide to ride the car to get Harry?


** I need this. Bill doesn't get as much love as I'd like. He's a flipping curse breaker! I wanna see some of that action.

*** There's so much that can be done with him, but even in fanfiction, he's so under used. It's criminal, really.

You have someone who is related to the Weasley's, has a rather cool looking job, we didn't get much of him in the books, but seemed rather chill about things. He could be a great help.

Heck, even Charlie, is a pretty cool brother (works with dragons! How cool is that?), and could be used more.

Edit: Bill lived in Egypt but then moved back to the UK.

**** Bill lived in Egypt though, right? At the start of PoA, the Weasley family took a vacation to go visit him. I think he moved back to the UK in OotP.

** A Marauder's Plan has some of this. Starts at the end of POA and, later, Bill is in town for the Quidditch World Cup. He has a meeting with Sirius and gets involved in the horcrux hunt beginning of 4th year. It's a not insignificant role.

** Even if Bill decided to visit, I doubt he'd have discovered that the diary is a Horcrux. The Horcruxes didn't give off that dark artefact vibe right from the start as, say, the Hand of Glory or the cursed necklace. Remember that Lucius slipped the diary to Ginny right under Arthur's nose, who at the time was involved in a mass investigation of dark artefacts and in a +library+ bookstore full of wizards. No one noticed anything odd (other that it could not be opened) about the locket. Harry (and generations of other wizards) just passed by the diadem in the Room of Requirements without even giving it a second thought. And Bill seems the kind of guy who would not snoop into his sister's diary so he wouldn't know that it was contained a piece of someone's soul.

Also I doubt Bill would have done anything other than try to cover for his brothers when they went to rescue Harry. It's not like the punishment of degnoming the garden was significant to the plot anyway.

*** First it's just a prompt, that's the thing with fanfiction, it doesn't have to be canon.

Second, who knows maybe each Horcrux is a bit different. We also don't know how long Ginny was writing in the diary. She could have started writing in it before going to Hogwarts, Bill might have felt something was off with the diary, maybe not Horcrux, but maybe it was some kind of dark magic he felt. (Didn't he learn from Goblins? He could have picked up stuff from them there, with different types of magic).

While the Wizarding World is pretty crazy when it comes to relatives endangering kids in an effort to see if said kid has magic, if Bill decided to go with them and saw that Harry had the bars on the window, the cat flap as well as the locks on the outside of the door, I'm sure he'd be pretty upset by it and could do something.

**** That's what Fanfiction is, a divergence from canon. You could set it up as Bill just coming back from a tomb that left him especially paranoid, and decided to scan things at random for dark magic. He just happens by this book(the diary before it sinks it's claws into Ginny) on the coffee table next to some school books, and scans it. Boom, in universe way to greatly changing the plot. It works even better, because we don't actually really have much information on Bill's job, and how it works. There could certaintly be a mild paranoia curse that nobody picked up at the job site, because it might take a while to build up, and it was right at the end of the job. Who knows.

**** But your prompt only refers to the changes resulting from Bill's visit not about other canonical stuff. Assuming that everything else stays the same, I don't think that there would be any significant plot changes. And even if Bill joined the brothers for the joyride, I doubt he would do anything because he seems like the most sensible of the brothers (and other than Percy, the most well-versed into how the Magical Britain government works) so he'd know better than to cast any spells and get Harry in trouble. Sure he might bring that issue up (but so did Ron) and still nothing would happen because Dumbledore says that Harry has to stay with the Dursleys in order for his protection charms to work.

****** I get your point but if you simply say that Bill decides to visit unexpectedly, I can say that no significant changes would occur if all other things stay the same. The thing with fanfiction is that you are working on an already created world so if you don't explain all that, than the default assumption remains that all else is canon compliant (e.g. Goblin magic lies in their metalwork and don't know shit about human curses - otherwise why would they need to employ humans when they are so protective of Gringotts?).

Now, of course, you could go another route and say that Bill returns home because he has been struck by a curse while working in Egypt so he has to go to St Mungo. Turns out that that curse causes him an insatiable hunger for power and learning from his brothers what had transpired the year before at Hogwarts, he goes the Quirell route and searches for Voldemort, at first in the hopes that he will be the one to bring about the fall of the darkest wizard of their times, but Voldemort being as charming and seductive as always for people who crave power, Voldemort manages to convince Bill that he'll teach him his secrets if he spares him. Bill is smarter than Quirell and accepts his mentorship but does not allow Voldemort to posses him so he takes a snake possessed by Voldemort who can speak to him.

Voldemort, unable to get through the blood wards at Privet Drive, convinces Bill to join his brothers on the rescue mission and orders him to kill the Dursleys, under the pretense that he is being righteous, in order to terminate the blood wards (he will deal later with Harry's blood protection). When the Ministry detects that - despite their previous warning - magic has been used at Privet Drive once again, and on top of that Unforgivable Curse, it comes to take Harry away. Bill modifies Harry's and his brothers' memories Tom Riddle style and makes everyone think that Harry went bonkers and killed his relatives.

The Ministry takes Harry to Azkaban but having no more blood wards and Dumbledore unaware of the situation, Bill ambushes the group of Aurors taking him there. He abducts Harry and he helps Voldemort resurrect himself. Of course the whole Priori Incantatem happens again because Voldemort wants to be the one to kill Harry and when Bill snaps out of his curse (or maybe his conscience takes over) he helps Harry escape, sacrificing himself in the process.

The rest of the plot remains somewhat the same, except it takes Harry and Dumbledore longer to figure out the Horcruxes, Harry is a wanted murderer until the Ministry finally accepts that it was all Voldemort's plot. Ginny never falls in love with Harry and the Weasleys, as well as Hermione who has grown quite close to Ron, hate him for having lead to the death of Bill.

******* I wanted the prompt to be vague enough but still have something there, you could do various things with it if you wanted.

I don't think it'd be too crazy to think a son of Molly and Arthur visiting during Summer holidays, especially when Molly and Arthur is sending Ginny off to Hogwarts, maybe Bill is worried about how Molly will take Ginny being gone and all of her kids being gone or just something random like that.
