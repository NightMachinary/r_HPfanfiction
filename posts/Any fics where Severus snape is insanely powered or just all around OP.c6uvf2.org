I just want a longish or atleast decently sized (20k minimum) fic of Severus being over powered, like him being the strongest wizard alive, etc


** If there isn't, then this is a fun writing prompt so I hope one day there will be.

** I got one fic where he isn't necessarily overpowered but he's definitely in a very powerful position. It's time-travel related. Interested?

************* Dude you wrote exactly as I imagined him, the play on words at the end where he said he'd come next month not this one was exactly something I'd expect a dude like grindelwald to do, it's like he's an albus dumbledore but someone who can appreciate the dark arts but also knows their consequences without restraining and I dig that typa character lol, it's why I like Severus so fucking much in the first place ðŸ˜‚

************** Thanks mate :P

By the way, I recommend asking the same question for any Snape fics on the general fanfiction reddit. Here you'll just end up with people downvoting you because you're asking for something Snape related.

*************** I would hope that isn't true. Sure many people don't like Snape as a person here but many more always stumble out of the wood work to defend him. Wasn't the recent survey done showed its pretty split in this subreddit?

**************** I can tell by the 67% that this request has been downvoted pretty heavily, and I know it's because of Snape. Sad but true. I've given up on defending Snape on the fandom's behalf. For me, he'll always be the greatest character, but unfortunately there are a lot of people out there who don't see it that way.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

#+begin_quote
  ***Re-write of Death's Apprentice*** Severus Snape has always been in hell, whether dead or alive. Death values those who are not crushed by being handed an impossible hand in life, and Severus Snape was one such person. They only come once an age, and each is as valuable as the last. When Tom Riddle made horcruxes, he cheated death, and, if the three brothers are any indication, Death does not take kindly to being cheated. Severus awakes in his fifth year of Hogwarts with a new wand and old memories, not to mention the magical potential to match the most legendary of Wizards. His peace of mind is a small price to pay for such a gift, especially when Lily doesn't hate him, he has yet to loyally pledge to the death eaters, and Albus Dumbledore is willing to work with this enigmatic fifteen year old to end the war--not to mention that the Marauders might actually get punished for nearly taking his life, and come to regret their actions in the process.
