It can be any character, as long as they choose a profession different from the usual Auror, politician, Lord-Potter-Gryffindor-Slytherin, Dark Lord, etc. I'd rather not see a few of the rarer ones, too--like Healer, Unspeakables, freelance Cursebreaker or whatever. Basically, I'm looking for characters who have chosen a career that defies the usual expectations and cliches of fanfic. None of the 'cool' jobs, but more normal stuff. For example, I once read a fic where Harry was a carpenter who made beautiful furniture and sold them. Later, he started glass blowing, and created glass artwork instead. In another fic I read recently (which inspired this post), Draco confessed a desire to style people's hair.

There are also a whole bunch where Harry decides to be a cafe owner or start a bakery, or something. I don't mind these fics, but there are quite a number of them (especially in crossovers for some reason?) so I'd prefer something other than that. Though I'd still read them.


** Let's see, I've encountered Harrys with following professions:

**** Yes, I didn't read that fic until recently, and it's a truly amazing post-Hogwarts one-shot. I really wanted to read more about how things got sorted in the end, yet it was within the style of the story to make it brief. But yeah:

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  ...But all of my denials are blown away as he walks in, looking every bit right at home here... His eyes don't look around the club at all---no, they go straight for me and as my vision is stuck on blue, I'm left completely, utterly breathless... Or, in which Harry steps outside his comfort zone to write a thrilling romance with a cheesy title, Tom is an actor chosen to play in the upcoming film adaption, and it's a shame that they're not in love, otherwise it'd make a kind of sweet love story. A threeshot filled with misses, hits, but mostly misses--and the one time they score the same sweet spot.

  Voldemort was just supposed to be the bored necromancer who had a slightly creepy obsession with the undead. Scarred was just supposed to be a berserker--but things never quite work out that way.For one, he isn't a berserker. He's a bishop. For two, he isn't just anything--he's the renegade High Priest of Gryffindor. For three, well... let's just say Voldemort's slightly creepy obsession wasn't on the undead anymore. Glitches were so inconvenient.

  When Tom discovered he could chat with the scaly adders slithering around his manor home, his small heart swelled with excitement. Father, however, did not think so highly of his talents. He demanded that Tom never let another soul know what he could do.And so, he didn't. He went on in life, became an investment banker, and livened his boring existence with cocaine and alcohol and the London nightlife. If not for an unlikely meeting with a group of robed freaks -- as well as the persistence of a petulant green-eyed pretty boy -- he perhaps would have never learned that he was, in fact, a wizard.

  The first time they speak---as pre-assigned lab partners, as strangers, as presumed equals---the conversation ends in an overturned Erlenmeyer flask and a creatively weaponized Bunsen burner; his butter-soft, Italian-leather satchel is covered in scorch marks, and the collar of her lavender cashmere cardigan has been eaten through by a particularly virulent form of benzilic acid.

  It is an inauspicious beginning to their working relationship.

  It starts because Harry can't stop being a good person. To leave his adventuring past behind, Harry moves to Gryffindor District, Hogwarts in order to open up a new item shop. Somehow that leads to being held at sword point by a handsome-but-extremely-rude Tom Riddle. As far as business relationships go, Harry supposes there are worse starts.

**** Well, if you read the one shot about the narcotics emporium already, the entire fic is pretty much like that. Except more surreal and absurd.

There's a number of other Albanian vampire front oneshots for the series if you want that sort of thing, like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11162979/1/The-Eastern-Front][The Eastern Front,]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11291274/1/A-Conversation-with-a-King][A Conversation with a King]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11496663/1/An-Albanian-Interlude][An Albanian Interlude]], but I really like the Narcotics Emporium best, because vampiric revolutionaries are fine, but drugs and vampires are kinda better.

**** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/712080/chapters/1316823]] - Hermione/Snape with a ghost hunting business, one of my favorites

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8034566/1/Penfriends]] - Hermione/Lucius, she has a bookshop but it's not particularly important, it's more of a romance story

**** The first one (Snape) is romantic but there's also a lot going on that isn't, but the second one (Lucius) is 100% romantic with the library as a setting, so I think you may want to pass this one. It's very good if you like the pairing (very AU, cute and feel-good) so you can try it, but I understand if it's not your thing :)

****** From my experience, there's three kind of Hermione/Lucius :

- very AU, Lucius is reformed on his own (often comes with a backstory where he's a bit like Draco, doing things for Voldemort because of his family/to survive - but let go of the ideology a while back), and Hermione still thinks he's a bigot because she doesn't know this side of him. They're often fun, laid-back stories, or more detailed ones where Hermione comes to realize that he's changed

- Lucius isn't as evil as we thought he was (again the "doing it for the family survival" trope), but he's still a rich bigot - Hermione will make him see that he's actually a good man. Can be very cliché and not believable if not done well, but some are pretty good

- Bad, death eater Lucius - usually with a bad, sad ending. He and Hermione love each other but he's constantly tortured with the ingrained ideologies and Voldemort's doctrine, so yeah... Happy endings are rare. Interesting anyway, actually my first fic was one like that, extremely dark but well written, made me want to read more fics (not exclusively fics like that).

Of course there's also a lot of smut fest fics with little to no plot, they're fun too haha. But when there's plot, I think this sums up the type of fics you'll find. The one I linked is clearly in the first category - reformed, light hearted, funny and cute fic, and if you're not particularly interested in this pairing I think it's a good start !
