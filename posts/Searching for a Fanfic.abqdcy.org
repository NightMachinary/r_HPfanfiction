Hi! I'm looking for a fanfic where harry is hiding either his entire identity or parts of it with concealment charms/other magic. He also has some connection to Lestrange family, signified by some kind of family mark or tattoo. Things I remember: a mysterious potrait in Malfoy manor where harry is living/captive; harry has some king of fit and is found by one of the lestrange brothers; Voldemort has to break through Harry's concealment charms; Voldemort and Harry have a back and forth "power" struggle going on
