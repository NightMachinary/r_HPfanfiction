Think starting with 'fluffy slice of life' and ending with 'Dobby groinsaw' massive.

Gradual or sudden makes no difference, seeing as I think this won't yield many fics anyways.


** linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lords Diary) goes from crack to heartwarming, emotional fluffiness

*** If you like this story, please explain to me why. I am always beyond baffled when I see this recommended. I would honestly rate this into the top 10 worst fanfictions that I have ever read. I just do not get it. What about this is any good?

***** I didn't like this fic either. I couldn't get through it mainly because the dialogue just wasn't very good. The conversations between Luna and the diary Tom Riddle were just too silly, too simple and not very funny.

The format of fic being written in all dialogue style also really did not help. It's like it was incomplete and lacked substance due to a lack of description and inner dialogue of the characters.

I like stories that do a good job of capturing characters and character voices. Neither Luna or Tom Riddle in the fic matched my idea of how they would sound like or interact with one another. Tom Riddle is a master manipulator. He is charming, clever, very good with words and knowing exactly what to say. It's difficult to go from reading fics where he is written like a brilliant prodigy to ones where his words and actions seem kind of stupid in comparison.

I guess this fic was never meant to be taken seriously, but I just found it super frustrating to attempt reading and couldn't enjoy it at all.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasly loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

** Lets see here...

- The Lies That Bind linkffn(The Lies That Bind): a U-turn from fluffy H/D romance into dark torture into horrific revenge fic. Two rights don't make a wrong, but three lefts do make a right, apparently.
- Abraxas linkffn(Abraxas): super-Harry war fic thats only just above generic takes the right-heel turn from hell 2/3 of the way through.
- The Hero Trilogy: Harry starts off as a growing challenger to a terrifying villainous Voldemort (hes like Morgoth in here and Harry is sort of like Fingolfin). By the third book, Harry and Voldemort are basically gods, with Harry fighting demons in the sky and having weird centaur drug induced dreams involving a talking plant wielding a semi-automatic. Yeah.
- Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): the celtic paganism sort of feels like it comes out of nowhere in the second year, and then it goes and becomes the biggest part of the story. It really ramps up though at one point in the story which feels like something of sudden reversal: lets just say it involves Harry attending a Fairy wedding during the full moon with a family of German werewolves. I know what I wrote.

** I'd throw in my own "Dawn of Darkness", where a liberal amount of fluff is used as filler in between murder, bad cops, several international conspiracies and more death. While not a constant trend, the tone is moving towards dark as the frequency of the fluff decreases as the story goes on.
