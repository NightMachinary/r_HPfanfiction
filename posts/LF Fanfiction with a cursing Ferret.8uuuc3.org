I remember reading a oneshot a lifetime ago - about the mindarts (?) I think and there was a ferret cursing.\\
I cant seem to find it - anyone got any idea what fic that was?


** The term you're looking for is Jarvey, which is a canonical magical creature that resembles a large ferret and can speak human language, but only insults/swears.

** You want a [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Jarvey][Jarvey]], aka an oversized talking ferret that curses a lot. I can only remember one thing that used them and I have no clue what it was called, but I believe Harry got one as a pet and named it Voldemort in that.

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.

** I can think of two fics with jarveys:

[[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewuser.php?uid=2651][Fairy God Jarvey stories by dracontia]].

[[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=832][Overcome With Feeling by PlaidPooka]]

I think the second one is probably more what you're looking for; the jarvey is a familiar, and Hermione acquires a mental "gift".

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.
