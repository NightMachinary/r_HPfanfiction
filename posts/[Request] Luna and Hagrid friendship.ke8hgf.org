In canon, Luna was dismissive of Hagrid as a teacher. But I always thought that they could be friends, under the right circumstances.

I read a few small one shots, but that was years ago.

Anyone got any recommendations?

I'd prefer this to be the focus of the story, or at least a subplot.

Thank you!

Eh? Was she? When? I don't remember a scene where they interact or even one where she talks about him?

*** In OotP, when they first realized Grubbly-Plank is back, Luna remarks that she'd "be quite glad" if Grubbly-Plank's position is permanent as "Hagrid is not a very good teacher," to the point where "we think he's a bit of a joke in Ravenclaw."

While I'll grant that the Blast-Ended Skwerts were a horrific first impression for Luna--she's in Ginny's year, and so would have just started Care of Magical Creatures--it's particular jarring compared to her otherwise very compassionate nature.

(If nothing else, you'd figure Luna would have reasoned the Skwerts for made special for the Maze in the Triwizard).

**** I'd totally forgotten about that! In fairness though, that one line doesn't mean Luna couldn't be friends with Hagrid. I mean, there's definitely hints that /Hermione/ doesn't think Hagrid is a good teacher, and Hermione loves Hagrid as a person!

I really like the idea of a fic where Luna interacts with Hagrid, they're actually very similar.

***** Harry and Ron also think that Hagrid's a poor teacher, but Harry's able to recognize that a tremendous part of Hagrid's lack of teaching skill is due to having the deck stacked against him.

But I definitely agree. Luna and Hagrid share striking similarities.

****** Ron and Harry definitely think it, but they'd fight anyone who dared say it out loud!

******* And Ginny--literally the only time we see Ginny angry with Luna is when Luna insults Hagrid.
