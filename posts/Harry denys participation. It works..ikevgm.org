** “Ok”, said Dumbledore, a little taken aback. “Well here are your three Champions, Viktor Krum, Cedric Diggory, and Fleur Delacour!” he boomed.

As the three champions held hands, the entire hall applauded them. Ron turned to Harry and Hermione, and uttered “Finally, a normal bloody year.” The three immediately started laughing hard.

*** Later, fake-Moody shows off the killing curse on Harry, and then Harry gets even more famous for waking up /again/.

**** Yes and no. Either Lily's sacrificial protection works against BCJ, and the spell is reflected, or Harry dies, because Voldemort has not used his blood in his ritual.

***** Alternative scenario. Canonically the not-quite-Horcrux died when Harry was, in the words of Miracle Max, "only mostly dead" - so BCJ fires off some other nasty curse that gets Harry that close without actually killing him, which does kill the soul-fragment.

***** Maybe like Crouch fires it at Harry's chest while he's in a chair. He tries to duck but it still hits him, right on his scar. That's my only reasoning for how two souls in one body decide who gets to die.

****** That would work, as the wiki says, "However, when the curse struck Voldemort and succeeded in causing his biological death, he described the curse as having ripped his soul from his body." Thus, if it hit the curse-scar which held Voldie's soul fragment, THAT would be ripped from the body and not Harry's soul.
