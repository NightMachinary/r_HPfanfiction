Thanks for your help


** Honestly, there's not much more than what's on the list in this thread. There are a few more, if you want them, but that list is basically the 'greatest hits' of Harry/Fleur fics.

** linkao3(13855500) Hope and Healing is probably the fic that got me into the pairing, it's brilliant.

  I could speak for hours about my rotten luck, about how many times I've been close to death. But luck is relative and some would say I am, in fact, extremely lucky. I would have disrespectfully disagreed. That was before I met fair Miss Delacour though; well even for a bit after I met her if I am honest. Follow me trough a year of adventure and discovery, in more than one way.
