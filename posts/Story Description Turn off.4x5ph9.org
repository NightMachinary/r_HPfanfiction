Entirely possible this has been done before, but I think it might be amusing. As I'm sure all you wonderful(and probably some not so wonderful) people are aware a summary is the hook that pulls the reader to your story. Before the first chapter is read, this more than anything will be what either gives them a prickling of interest, or make them roll their eyes scroll past.

That being said. What are some of the absolute worst lines youve heard in story summaries. Alternatively are there any phrases that make you immediately go "Nope!" and move on.

For myself, any time I read the phrase "Master of death" or when is Fate described as a person I immediately ignore that story.

** I decided to cheat and went to HP on fanfiction.net and used the "updated in the past 24 hours" filter. Here's my findings:

- Author's note in the summary.

- Author's note IS the summary.

- Everything he knew was a lie, Privet Drive is Durskaban, Harry grows a spine, No more Mr. Nice Guy, Other grand statements exalting Harry or denouncing Dumbledore or Magical Britain.

- Stop! With! The! Damn! Exclamations! Are! You! On! Crack!

- Inane question that the answer to is clearly "yes" because otherwise you wouldn't have a story.

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztky50T3W2E&list=PLAbMhAYRuCUhawCEV2oXZGrienoKTN16X&index=12][Zero Punctuation!]]

- Lots of Dumbles and Weasley bashing except twins.

- Rated K+ because I'm paranoid.

- "Quote from the story," he uttered. "Because I'm too lazy to put the effort into crafting a summary that actually represents my story."

I'm sure there's more.

** Don't care much for master of death or Fate as a person, these don't necessarily make the fic bad.

I usually go "nope!" when I read "soul bond" or "Harem", because it's very difficult to make a good story out of it (though not impossible). You usually end up with too many characters that share their function, and/or wish fulfilment fics... There are exceptions though. Not to mention, in a soul bond, if the characters share everything they are, how are you going to create some conflict?

The other thing is slash/mpreg... Just the kind of story I don't care to read because it just doesn't appeal to me (Though I could make an exception more easily for slash than for mpreg...). I just can't care for the relationship between two men. It doesn't work with me. It's not disgusting or disturbing, it's just plain boring to me. I just can't see the appeal.

In a story at least. I'm not saying anything about real people.
