That way you have full and part Veelas like how we think Fleur, Gabrielle and Apolline Delacour are.


** I seem to recall a fic where Fleur lays an egg.

But yes - one of many ways to make the canon system of full and part Veela work.

** ...That brings to mind nightmare fuel scenarios about what happens to their paramours during the 'act' to produce a full veela. :S

Veela in their human guise are attractive: veela as fire-slinging hell-harpies are... boner-withering.

*** I think the pregnant state would be able to transfer from 'human' to harpy. I think it's more of a choice if you want your child to be fully or part Veela, and with anti-non-human views and just the modernisation of the Muggle world, I guess it's just seen as giving more chances to your children for them to not be fully-blooded Veelas.
