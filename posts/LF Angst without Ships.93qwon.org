I love reading dark, angsty fic, but I'm sick of relationship-driven angst. I want something more adult, less teenage problems.

It doesn't necessarily have to be gen fic, but I don't want the relationship to be the focus.


** I think most stuff by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheDivineComedian/pseuds/TheDivineComedian/works?fandom_id=136512][TheDivineComedian]] fits the bill. You should check out [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Pitry/pseuds/Pitry/works?fandom_id=136512][Pitry]]'s stuff too - in particular, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/288347][The Rewards of Perseverance]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/374837][The Mirror of Erised]] are both Voldemort wins AUs, so there's plenty of angst. And [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630][The Sum of Their Parts]] is great, if you haven't already read it.

** Are Regulus Black or Black Brothers fics okay? They are not in any way slash, it's more about broken family relationship. I actually have a really long list of them, but I'm not sure if I should recommend them without asking first.

Also, I got some Percy Weasley fics that you might be interested in.

**** Some of them may contain romances, but usually they are in the background.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12672741/1/renascentia][renascentia]] co-written by tonberrys-and-kuchikopi is a type of fic that really needs more attention. The fic's writing style is written in a way that I reminds me of a high level fictional read. Like the language is written by a extremely well verse writer, or in this case writers. A rare but delightful find in the fanfiction world. It's essentially a Regulus alive fic and what would he do if he was alive. The authors understood each character extremely well, especially on the background of the Black brothers.

The authors have written several stories in that universe that centered around the brothers' past which are also insightful reads as well. Those are not really needed to be read to understand the main story, but I do recommend reading those background stories as well which are all under there account on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/9795334/tonberrys-and-kuchikopi][FFN]].

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1037432/chapters/2069217][Dead Man Walking]] by cywscross. The summary for this one: "Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well."

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558][face death in the hope]] by LullabyKnell is slightly slash, but the story itself is well written enough that it isn't overbearing. This is a time travel fic where Harry saved Regulus before he was drowned.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12221773/1/Unlocking-Doors][Unlocking Doors]] by LaRadium. I absolutely love this story. The concept is just so original. Basically if Regulus is reborn as a Weasley. In fact he is Ron's twin brother in this story. Definitely worth the read.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4045677/1/Foreshadowing-Demise][Foreshadowing Demise]] by Shadowmistress13 is by far one of the most stressful read I had ever came across. Every scene adds another piece to the puzzle and every scene builds up the story. I especially love every character is not exactly black or white, just a whole rainbow full of colors. The story could make you feel amuse to downright tears and every other emotions in between. I just highly recommend this fic. The only downside to this fic is the fact updates are not frequent, however, in the way the story is written, I say it is worth the wait. Plus the author is very persistent when saying to they are not abandoning the story. It updated recently, and I'm content to say that this is one of my top favorite Regulus and Sirius Black fic.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12834182/1/The-Little-King-s-Road][The Little King's Road]] by Lily-lamaire. I want to say that this is one of the most original, but closely cannon story that I have ever came across. The fic takes a fresh perspective of Draco and /kept/ him in character in the form of his prat-ish view of the world. He does not even realize what he was getting into. Another bonus that got me hype was the fact Draco is learning about Regulus' story and that was when he begins to opens his eyes.

linkffn(12834182) Status: Incomplete

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/48618][Rewritten in Time]] series by ScotlandEvander. Draco travels back in time to his first year while Atlanta (an OC) travels to Marauders era and fell in love with Regulus (while another her is around Draco age). Fix it series.

*** Is it really dark and angsty though? It does have some dark and angsty moments, but I have always found the fic to be on the lighter side tone wise. It's more adventure, world building and character focused.

One reason I liked it so much is because it goes against the usual tropes of Voldemort winning. His society is not this super horrible messed up place, where everyone is constantly tortured, half the people are enslaved and everyone is oppressed and miserable 100% of the time. It does a great job of balancing seriousness with lighter moments and humour.

**** Did you read the fifth year? You know where Harry ends up on a shamanic-induced drug craze, hundreds of werewolves are slaughtered, and Harry has to deal with the god-possessions by Fenrir and the like that lead to him starting an open war.

***** Yes, I read the entire fic including those scenes. Like I said the fic does have angst, but I still can't think of the fic as being either dark or angsty.

There are a lot of fics (some that are commonly recommended on here) that are almost all angst, and/or despair and/or dark serious moments. I just can't consider POTDK to be one of those since there are many many scenes even among the more serious chapters that made me laugh and that I found light and entertaining.

While those particular chapters do feature angst, I never found angst in the fic to be that prominent. Harry doesn't spend his entire time drowning in despair where he becomes a shell of a character who can no longer stand up for his beliefs or speak his mind. There are no chapters after chapters dedicated to going over his broken mental state (like what is quite common in angst fics) and of others having to take care of him. Those things do happen, but so do other things so it never seems like the focus or a major part of fic.
