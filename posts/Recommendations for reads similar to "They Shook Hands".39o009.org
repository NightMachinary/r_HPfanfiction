They Shook Hands by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2560219/Dethryl][Dethryl]] was actually my first fan-fic that I ever read and while I wait for Year 6 to come out I'm interested in exploring other similar fan-fics or ones that has Harry in different houses. I prefer longer reads but if there is one similar to this one than I'm up for most anything.


** On the way to greatness is fantastic and doesnt suffer with the faults this fic does imo.
