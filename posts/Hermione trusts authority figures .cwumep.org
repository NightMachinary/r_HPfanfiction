There is this tendency for Hermione to trust /respect authority figures but at the same time also be the most engaged about breaking the rules/disobeying authority?

Like in Sorcerers stone she lights Snape on fire. In Chamber of Secrets she hessitates about making the polyjuice potion but it doesn't take much for her to be totally onboard with it. Book 5 shes the one who comes to Harry with the DA idea.

Every year they have a teacher that horribly dissapoints them, is a secret death eater , or is trying to kill Harry. Or some combination of the 3. Snape just goes around taking off points for the most flimsy of reasons.

And yet for at least the first 4 maybe 5 books theres some comment or sentiment of wow Hermione is breaking the rules as if its something new for her character. Did she actually develop over the series? Or did she develop in maybe 1 and a half books and then her arc got cycled repeatedly?


** I think one way to square this (other than noting that most people exhibit a certain degree of internal inconsistency in their thoughts/actions) is to say that /because/ Hermione takes positions of authority quite seriously, she feels justified in taking drastic actions if she feels an authority figure is using their power inappropriately.

Look at her reaction to Umbridge:

#+begin_quote
  “/How/ can Dumbledore have let this happen?” Hermione cried suddenly, making Harry and Ron jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, looking affronted. She pounded the arms of her chair in fury, so that bits of stuffing leaked out of the holes. “How can he let that terrible woman teach us? And in our O.W.L. year too!” (OotP, Chapter 13)
#+end_quote

It goes past just disliking or even hating Umbridge; she's righteously outraged that such an awful person has been allowed to hold such an important position.

It's a similar story when she set Snape on fire. She believed (wrongly, though understandably) that Snape had tried to kill one of his students; at that point his being a teacher goes from being in his favor to counting against him:

#+begin_quote
  “Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' of the sort.”

  “So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.

  The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.

  “I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them! You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw him!” (PS, Chapter 11)
#+end_quote

With the Polyjuice Potion, there's no specific authority figure she's against, but I think the subtext here is that she (as a Muggleborn student) doesn't feel that the staff is doing enough to protect the student body, and therefore breaking the rules is acceptable in pursuit of accomplishing that goal herself:

#+begin_quote
  “Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,” she said. There were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual. “/I/ don't want to break rules, you know. /I/ think threatening Muggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. But if you don't want to find out if it's Malfoy, I'll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in ---” (CoS, Chapter 10)
#+end_quote

Hermione fundamentally believes in, if not /the/ system, at least the idea of /a/ system. Allowing a corrupt or incompetent authority figure to continue unhindered is a greater threat to the goal of a beneficial system than breaking rules to hinder them, as far as Hermione is concerned.

** I think there's an assumption that she studies to please teachers. I think she studies to please herself. She values the opinions of good teachers because they're experts in their fields, not because they happen to be authority figures. She had no trouble defying blatantly lousy teachers.

I think Snape confused her because she respected him for his potioneering ability, but disrespected him for his lack of teaching ability.

After Lockhart, she stopped giving teachers the benefit of the doubt.

*** Oh yes for sure she has no issues being the one to break the rules and seems to know it. But usually theres a level of suprise like wow we wouldnt expect you of all people to be rebelious. Its not always blatant but it to me is seems like the later books want you to think its suprising or development that shes rebelling. Like she got less uptight about the rules. Except this was something that was already covered in the first book.

It was her idea actually. Ron and Harry had to be convinced to steal from Snape.

Hermione's love of authority figures and rules depends on how it affects her and/or how trivial she considers the matter, but also as the series goes on she trusts Dumbledore more than any other authority figure, which isn't much different from anyone else.

*** I mean thats true but I mean theres this sentiment ( and perhaps its stronger in the movies) that its a big moment when Hermione is being rebelious with authority. Which is odd since she fully embraced being rebellious in book 1.

** Hermione's trust in authority figures is very overrated by fandom. Who does she blindly trust after the first book? Lockhart in the second? But this was an obvious crush, not belief that adults know better.

She trusts Dumbledore, but not any more than Ron or Harry (who has more personal reasons to distrust him, but doesn't).

Hermione believes that rules are there for a reason, and follows those she considers rational and useful. These rules throughout the books are mostly about work ethics: do you homework, prepare for the exams, don't cheat with a strange potions textbook. That's pretty much the extent of it. She has no problem defying authority and breaking the rules if she thinks she's in the right.

** Another reason for everyone to be so surprised might be that Hermione comstantly admonishes others for breaking rules and so they sort of expect her to be against this. She actually had to believe Snape was trying to kill Harry to be ready to set him on fire. She thought Malfoy was petrifying students and so thought it was worse than brewing up a difficult potion. So I assume for Harry and Ron it seems incredible she breaks rules because she seems to have a serious reason for this. Of course in the fifth book they shouldn't be all that surprised because it's not the first time she only needs a good enough reason to disregard the authority.

** Does anyone else think this could be a function of her middle class upbringing? Her parents were both educated professionals and had time to indulge their only child. Perhaps snagging I discussions about the news, politics, labor, money. Her parents were authority figures, but by all accounts were beneficent parents (and mostly absentee due to boarding school). Maybe she was just raised to ask questions and receive answers. She seems pretty typical gen X to me.

** I think this is because it's a bit problematic when you include a character who is a lot like you and this is what Rowling did. To me it feels a bit like she didn't want Hermione to change because at least I personally think that it's difficult to admit a character who is like you actually needs to develop. But if you get others to exclaim over her willingness to break rules in nearly every book, you can sort of pretend it's development. I don't believe she has changed all that much throughout the books. She is the same know it all and rule breaker she was in the first book. And if the narrative states that,'oh even Hermione is ready to break rules', you sort of get the feeling it must be really bad.

I actually don't mind her breaking the rules. It's the dichotomy of her admonishing others' rule-breaking while justifying her own that bothers me.

*** I mean even that would be so bad on its own. But instead it seems every book she learns that not all authority figures are trusted and how important it can be to break the rules and does do just that without much hessitation. And yet both she and Ron and Harry and the narrative act like that chatacter growth never happened by the next book. And once again its oh wow Hermione is breaking the rules.
