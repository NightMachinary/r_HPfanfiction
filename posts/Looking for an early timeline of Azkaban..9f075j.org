I am wanting to write a short story about a character inside Azkaban during its earliest days through its transformation into a prison. I am wanting to stay true to the canon and the setting, but I know I am too ignorant right now. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

â€‹

Thank You.


** Roughly:

- Sometime in the 15th century, Azkaban was built in the North Sea. Dementors infest it most likely because of the outpouring of dank, cold, darkness and misery.
- Original creators are unknown, though it could have been Ekrizidis, the last person known to inhabit the island before the Ministry found it.
- Concealment charms fail, Ministry becomes aware of the island just after its inception (early 18th century). Exploration showed the place was infested with dementors.
- At the time, the Ministry had been looking to create a prison for wizards and witches in Britain, most likely in the Hebrides.
- Fearing the danger of unleashing the dementors on nearby Britain, sometime after 1718 Minister Damocles Rowle ordered the place be turned to a prison for the Ministry instead of being destroyed, using the dementors as guards.
- Minister Eldritch Diggory, probably in the 1730s, was appalled by the conditions and tried to get the place shut down. But like after the first wizarding war, the British magicals were too frightened of reprisals by the dementors to destroy it.
- When Diggory died, the next Minister Hesphaestus Gore (either a misspelling on Rowling's part or the man's parents) reversed their position and reinforced the prison, turning it from more of a fortress to the current prison form.

So bottom line? Azkaban was never really about a prison. It was about pacifying the dementors and having somewhere to stash prisoners was just a bonus from the move. Remember how few people can do the Patronus Charm.

*** Thank you. My idea started as one thing, and now has turned into a telling of the creator of the dementors, because through him I can tell a much more complete and personal story. I am excited about this story in ways I rarely get with my fiction. Thanks in no small part to JK Rowling's genius.

**** I recommend you read the fics linkffn(The Lesser Sadness; Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) for more ideas about Ekrizdis and Azkaban.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
