Something like linkffn(An Hour of Wolves)

Where it is not used just for some cheap angst. And no bashing please.


** Wow, where's the Rule 8 warning on this one?

  The summer after his godfather's death was the worst in Harry's life for many reasons. An event so horrifying takes place causing him to question if he should even go on, but in the end all it takes is Faith to pull through and find the good in the dark. Based on 'The Unknown Light' by Someryn with her permission. This is about rape and the aftermath. No slash. Ginny is not raped.

  Harry's doing just fine: being Quidditch Captain and 'the Chosen One' doesn't leave him with time to worry about much besides school and the growing threat of war. He's especially not worrying about the fact that Sirius is dead. Or about an embarrassing, uncomfortable night with a classmate he'd rather just forget. Really. He's fine. Features an eating disorder, other tags inside.

**** The terrifying thing is that this could've actually happened in canon. Seeing that Voldemort's mom had raped his dad for who knows how many years.

***** yes! Exactly. It's terrifying and romilda acting like it wasn't even an issue??? And Harry's reactions to love potions later... ahhh that fic had so many amazing layers to it and it just kept getting better. The realistic way Harry blended into normal life, yet completely thrown off inside and his friends repeated concern - - and when he told them. It was heartwrenchingly well written.
