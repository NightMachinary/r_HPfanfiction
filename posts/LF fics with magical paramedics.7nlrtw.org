I'm curious if there's any fics out there that are about magical EMTs/paramedics running calls, doing their best to treat patients on scene, and then transporting them back to St. Mungos for further treatment. (Or perhaps any firefighter fics?)

Gen, het, slash, any character, whatever - I'm not picky. Thanks!


** Harry does some quick response healing in linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) but outside of some battlefield healing in some fics I can't recall any para-healer fics...

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

** What's the one where Harry travels to a universe where his counterpart was kidnapped by Voldemort and tries to drown his sister at some point? I think James was a paramedic in that
