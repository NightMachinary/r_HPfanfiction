Hi all, This would be my first post on this subreddit but I've been reading fanfiction for a while now. I've kinda run out of decent HHr fanfics that aren't too boring, repetitive, or flat-out cliche. Could anyone recommend me a few? I have a couple of guidelines: -long in length (100k+ or so) -some smut -not too AU or with too many OCs

Thank you all, I hope you have a great day!


** Without knowing what you've read its hard to suggest here,

I've got so many suggestions but many of them are AU, You've probably read them, if you have i'll PM you a more complete list of my Harmione favorites.
