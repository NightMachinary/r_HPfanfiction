I cant believe people aren't hyped about this..


** You must have missed the two excited posts yesterday. One I think has been deleted because I only saw one of them today.

That said, while I haven't read the story so far, I followed the link to the new chapter (which is really just an author's note), and it said that it's being reworked as an original story, not that the fanfiction is being continued. Not sure how excited I'd be if my favorite unfinished fanfiction had a similar note.

*** The author said that "They are still planning on finishing this fic as a hp fanfiction while also starting a new original fiction based in this work."

(Someone sent me that after they talked with the Author sooo fingers crossed)
