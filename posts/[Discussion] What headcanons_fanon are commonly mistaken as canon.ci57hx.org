Though mythology has centaurs as rapists... and well Umbridge is kind of a bitch.

Also, Rowling heavily implied Dumbledore's brother fucked a goat. The Umbridge/Centaur fanon thing is arguably less disturbing, in that the Centaurs are humanoid.

** Notice-me-not charm

Warming charm (though there is a drying charm that shoots hot air at the target, this isn't the same thing as my-negligee-is-good-to-negative-ten-degrees)

'Point me' only points North, like a compass

Tracking charms

Wards that work like logic traps

Pepper-up potion doesn't act like an upper; it's a cure for the symptoms of the common cold. For magical ritalin/B complex/caffeine, see Wide-eye potion, though that was introduced in Pottermore for the online potion-making game. What's more, fanon assumes that wizards don't get sick, when they regularly do. They just have a bunch of cures they don't share with muggles.

** That Lily dropped Severus because he called her a mudblood. That should be justification enough, but I often see fans argue that "it's just word under duress" and that she should forgive him for it... forgetting that in the HP world it's a racial slur. But in the flashback and with JK's add ons, it's clear she dropped him because this wasn't the first time he used the word mudblood, that he was hanging around death eaters, and experimenting with dark magic.

TLDR: It wasn't just the mudblood, it was the final straw in Snape doing increasingly shitty things that made Lily drop him.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

The mistake Dumbledore was keeping all the information to himself. He assumed that Harry dying was the only way to defeat Voldemort. It might be true or maybe there was another way around it. Maybe if other people had the info, they could've found something.

Either way, Dumbledore, after a century witnessing 2 dark lords kill his friends and family, is clearly tired and mistake prone. I don't like Dumbledore very much, but I do understand his reasons.

The prophecy makes Voldemort feel threatened by Harry so for the rest of Harry's short life, he will be hunted by Voldemort. Dumbledore planned to manipulate Harry's death at the right moment, so it'll allow Voldemort to die, rather than dying in vain.

Yeah it's pretty messed up, but it's not like Dumbledore had a choice. It was either protect Harry until both of them eventually die by Voldemort's hand. Or use their deaths as a catalyst for Voldemort's mortality.

***** "Harry was going to die anyways..."

...unless someone tried to do something to specifically protect Harry from dying. Like, oh, I dunno, maybe not keep him in the exact same community where the "sadistic, insane Dark Lord" is guaranteed to come back and look for him? I mean, that's almost as bad as hiding a priceless artifact in a school full of kids, and then telling them to not go where said artifact is kept because it's dangerous. Who in the right mind would do something that dumb, right?

I find it impossible to believe that there was nothing that could at least be attempted - like send him abroad with a changed name and maybe some surgery to change his looks. It's not a guarantee, sure, but it's also not specifically grooming him to die. And if the prophecy is genuine, the eventual confrontation will happen regardless. And maybe Dumbledore is wrong that Harry has to die - he's not omniscient, is he?

The point is, Dumbledore leaned into the prophecy and accepted it in a way that led to grooming Harry to die, instead of actually trying hard to protect him, give him a good childhood, and find a way to help him avoid death. A bit like how Voldemort leaned into it and actually ended up marking someone. Had he ignored it, maybe he'd have been better off.

******* 1. Who said he'd be hiding? With a new name and face in a new country, he could live a relatively normal life. Most of those who go into the Witness Protection Program don't live in constant fear. They are "hiding" from their old friends, but they aren't hiding from the people around them. They have houses, go to school, get jobs and do the things everyone else does. Harry, being raised in that situation, wouldn't know anything else and thus wouldn't make the sorts of mistakes that tend to out such people.
2. Much of what you describe is already a factor in canon - worrying about the people he meets. Except that in canon, he has a lot more cause to worry because he's living in an area which has the highest concentration of Death Eaters and Voldemort Supporters in the entire world. Getting away from that can't possibly be /more/ risky. Thus there's no need to think that every day would be burdened with paranoia and fear - certainly no more than he needs for his situation in canon, and probably quite a bit less.
3. For most of the time that Harry was growing up, the threat was Death Eaters, not Voldemort himself - and when it was Voldemort, it was always in the context of Hogwarts. It seems to be that someplace other than Britain and Hogwarts would have produced a much lower degree of risk and far fewer deadly situations. For example, I doubt that Malfoy would have been able to release a Basilisk in a school in Bolivia. I don't even know if Malfoy would know where Bolivia is, much less have a way to learn that a white kid of the right age was going to school there.
4. There's nothing in canon that says that Voldemort wants to take over even all of Europe, much less the world. Sure, it's plausible - he's ambitious, after all, but it's not a certainty.
5. Although it's not certain, it seems plausible that someone other than Harry can "kill" Voldemort's new body just fine. That wouldn't end Voldemort entirely, but it would deprive him of a body and the means for effectively leading his Death Eaters for a while. It certainly wouldn't contradict the prophecy.
6. Just because Harry's the only one who can kill him doesn't mean that every one of Voldemort's plans will be a success. He can be prevented from conquering Europe /and/ not be killed. He can just, you know, not win. So long as he leaves the battlefield alive (without or without a body!), the prophecy hasn't been violated.

I never suggested that there are ways to keep Harry /perfectly/ safe. We can probably assume that that's not possible. Therefore, moving to another country and living under a different name will still come with some risks for him. The question is rather what's /more/ safe (and what's more conducive to a happy childhood). I suggested a means for accomplishing that - and one that wouldn't even require too much magic. I'm sure there are others.

Dumbledore didn't do anything like that. There's no indication that he even tried - and given his position with the ICW, he definitely had the means and contacts. Instead, he kept doing things that kept pushing Harry and Voldemort together. Snape was an irredeemable ass, but I think his conclusion about how Harry was raised was more accurate than not.

Note that Dumbledore didn't utter even a word of disagreement when Snape said that. In other situations, Dumbledore definitely did dispute Snape's comments, including where Harry was concerned.

Time Turners being able to change the past one's own past wouldn't be logical because of the usual paradox problem. If Harry lost his arms and went in the past to retrieve it he would maybe get it back but wouldn't have any reason to go back to save his arm thus losing it again so they may say so but that doesn't seem to work (Cursed Child notwithstanding but I consider it non-canon). With what Hermione says, if Harry killed himself in the past he wouldn't go back in the past to kill himself. She was more likely worried that he would kill his future self in the past.

#+begin_quote
  ‘All attempts to travel back further than a few hours have resulted in catastrophic harm to the witch or wizard involved. It was not realised for many years why time travellers over great distances never survived their journeys. All such experiments have been abandoned since 1899, when Eloise Mintumble became trapped, for a period of five days, in the year 1402. Now we understand that her body had aged five centuries in its return to the present and, irreparably damaged, she died in St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries shortly after we managed to retrieve her. What is more, her five days in the distant past caused great disturbance to the life paths of all those she met, changing the course of their lives so dramatically that no fewer than twenty-five of their descendants vanished in the present, having been “un-born”.

But so this means that if one kills his father in the past and is then "un-born" who kills his father? If the father is also "un-born" to balance it well the son is even less here to "un-born" himself and his father. But ok let's say the time stream corrects itself with a vengeance, how people in the present know that someone was "un-born"? If they disappear because their parents never made them, well no one would remember them because they never existed in the first place so you couldn't say they're "un-born". Even written thing about them or their achievement would disappear. It would more likely break the time itself and the existence. Or impose a parallel reality on the first time stream? Said time stream wouldn't exist anymore so yeah, reality extinguishing event. But with no proof.

Ugh that's why time travel is a tricky thing to introduce in a story. Except "do-over" (like saving a game shall we say), parallel timestream and my assumed version of JKR time travel all the other bring to impossibilities and brain damage.

*** I didn't read all of them, but this is not a perfect list. Unforgivables do require hate as said by Bellatrix 'You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain --- to enjoy it --- righteous anger won't hurt me for long --- I'll show you how it is done, shall I?' with Snape saying 'you haven't the ability or the nerve' to Harry when he attempted to use it again. It is actually fairly well established in cannon that the more sadistic and hateful, the more powerful the cruciatus.

In the case of the killing curse we have Barty Crouch Jr say 'The Killing Curse is a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it --- you could all get your wands out and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed.' and it is the killing curse so you must want to kill someone.

In the case of the Imperius curse, we have no evidence of needing to be really anything to use it properly.

Here is a list of the dubious ones I see on your list that I haven't bothered to grab citations for (I am editing in cites as I go along):

1)Susan Bones being an orphan. While there is no direct evidence in the books for this it does mention her entire family being killed by death-eaters with absolutely no mention of her parents anywhere in the books but a fleshed out character for her aunt. At the very least it is something we can infer.

2)The Marauders being pranksters.[mischief makers],([[https://www.pottermore.com/collection/who-were-the-marauders]]) while not explicitly pure pranksters they almost certainly did pull pranks, hell they had a secret map that tould them where everyone was and the password was "I solemnly swear I am up to no good."

3)The killing curse killing by removing the soul. While it is uncertain if it is an artifact of the horcruxes, Voldemort described the curse as ripping his soul from his body.

4)Transfiguration is temporary. JK Rowling has actually weighed in on this an said conjuration is temporary.

5)The creation of Horcruxes affecting Voldemorts sanity. Professor Slughorn states that "it will split your soul", and Voldemort says "I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was alive." Obviously this had an effect on his sanity.

6)The Black family having a library. They are an old powerful family with a history of dark arts practitioners as well as a Hogwarts headmaster in recent memory, if not a library they had a lot of books.

7)Vodlemort regularly tortures his followers. Well he crucio'ed peter for letting Crouch Sr excape in the goblet of fire and he crucio'ed another in the graveyard. He also commanded draco to crucio rowle. In Order of the Phoenix he is talking to a trembling rookwood, who acts like he was tortured. All in all he seems on board with using it on his followers as a disciplinary tool.

8)Magic breaking all technology. It is known to interfere with electricity to the point of them not working. It wasn't stated if magic was outright breaking them or just causing them to stop working.

#+begin_quote
  There were relatives of their victims among the Hogwarts students, who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors: Susan Bones, who had an uncle, aunt, and cousins who had all died at the hands of one of the ten, said miserably during Herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be Harry.

#+end_quote

Being a rule breaker doesn't mean youre a prankster, everything we know about them shows them breaking lots of rules like being of of bounds, becoming animagi, or cursing other students, none of what we know points at them pulling pranks. If no Prank was ever mentioned, then them being pranksters isn't canon.

  3)The killing curse killing by removing the soul. While it is uncertain if it is an artifact of the horcruxes, Voldemort described the curse as ripping his soul from his body.
#+end_quote

He described dying as ripping the soul from his body, we already know that your soul doesn't stay in your body when you die, and we already know that removing the soul doesn't kill, thats one of two things dementors do. The killing curse killing by removing the soul isn't canon.

#+begin_quote
  4)Transfiguration is temporary. JK Rowling has actually weighed in on this an said conjuration is temporary.
#+end_quote

She said conjuration specifically is temporary, there is no canon evidence that transfiguration is temporary, we even know that wizards believe that transfiguration isn't temporary because Quintapeds are belived to be transfigured wizards(umcomfirmed but people believing it shows its possible). Unless you have any instance of a transfigration wearing off, or Rowling saying something about it, then Transfiguration being temporary isn't canon.

having a couple of books on blood purity isn't the fanon associated library of hidden forbidden magic, and those few books on blood purity are all we saw in canon. Unless any library is mentioned, it isn't canon. in fact nothing in canon suggest that there are even lots of privately owned books on dark magic.

In Canon some technology doesn't work in environments with lots of magic, but it works fine with technology in general and as far as we know it doesn't break it. We know its even possible to use magic on technology without any problem, with Arthur Weasley even fixing an electric fire with magic. Unless you have any thing that suggest magic affects technology in general this isn't canon.

They're not just charms though. This is why I'm against the use of "wards" - not because the word isn't mentioned in canon, but because it results in people treating "property protection spells" as a unified body of magic.

But in the books property protection consists of a large variety of charms, curses, hexes, jinxes, creatures, and even transfiguration and potions. And more often than not, the way wizards protect property is not by preventing entry, but by allowing an intruder to enter but impeding them in some way after entry with e.g. magical traps.

The canon system is so much more interesting and varied than a magical bubble of protection with various "rules" coded into it like an algorithm, which is what most people mean when they say "wards".
