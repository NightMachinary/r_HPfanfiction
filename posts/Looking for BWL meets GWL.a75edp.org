Hey friends! Today I'm looking for all your favorite universe jumping fics where Harry goes to another world and meets his female counterpart(or vice versa!)

So far I've enjoyed: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/][I'm still here]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11128626/1/][A Twins Understanding]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4040192/1/][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/][0800 Rent a Hero]]

Any more people could add that isn't listed here? Thanks in advance!


** In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/][Lilly and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] the girl-who-lived, Lilly, meets her 'Master of Death' counterpart from a different universe in the first chapter. Also, there are a few short spinoff fics in which she meets different versions of Harry. For example, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11437172/1/The-Last-Harry-Potter][The Last Harry Potter]].

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** It's a small part of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/1/Core-Threads][Core Threads]]. You've really hit the highlights already though, of that specific sub genre.

Seeing as there's no GWL in 0800 Rent A Hero, I'll put up some other dimension fics where the Potter family is alive (some have the alternate Harry alive as the BWL, some have Neville as the BWL):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5757945/1/Too-Far-from-%0AHome][Too Far From Home]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668/chapters/7419224][C'est La Vie]] (this one is one of the earlier ones, probably the best you haven't read already)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7806627/1/Sacrificial-Second-Chance][Sacrificial Second Chance]] (Says Harem/pseudo Incest, but the story is abandoned long before that point iirc)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9649140/1/To-Call-A-Place-Home][To call a place home]] (This one has a deceased Harry in the dimension, but alive potters)

Linkffn(Delenda Est) and A Black Comedy are the other two big dimension travel fics, but they're a lot different (as in they're set in far different time periods - one involves Harry time traveling to Marauders Era hogwarts, the other involves a post Hogwarts Harry traveling to a world a decade after the books have ended, but where Sirius and Harry both died when Harry was an infant).

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight][The Red Knight]] , which is where canon Ron goes to a dimension with a GWL. It's a little weird.

Sure there is. Iris Potter is the Girl-Who-Lived, but the Order wasn't confident that she could fulfill her destiny, so they summoned Harry to pinch-hit.

** I doubt I can help, I'm afraid. I started Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived, got as far as him putting a rune on her to let them speak telepathically, and gave up. Maybe if they had to work to develop a telepathic skill, or it was a one-off artifact, I could have accepted it, but as it was, it just screamed "power fantasy" and I ran away.

  When Harry died he expected to meet his family not the Patron Saint of France. Thanks to a bit of meddling on her part the two are sent back to stop Voldemort's destruction of the world. Of course, this being Harry, something is bound to go wrong...like how his mother is suddenly alive or how friends are enemies and enemies are friends...
