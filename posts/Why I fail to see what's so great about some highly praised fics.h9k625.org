Well,I am really confused and frustrated about it. Every now and then, I question myself if other people and I are really reading the same fic when my opinions on that fic differ significantly from other people. I can't help wondering if something is terribly wrong with my judgement.

For example,what's so great about Antithesis?As another wrong-boy-who-lived story,the premise is terrible and cliched.The characterizations are cringeworthy. I facepalmed so many times trying to read through it until I just couldn't do it anymore. However,other people enjoyed and sang praises of it. They think it's a well-written story though being depressing and tragic.

** Personal taste will matter a lot person to person - for instance, a cliche story might make you dislike it, but others might enjoy it.

Sometimes that extends to writing quality - where certain tics or mistakes can strike one person as excessively bad/hard to read, whereas another person overlooks it and is fine with it.

Other times it's with the plot/story - I find that that's most often in power fantasies of sorts. Some people really enjoy reading power fantasies - whereas for others it's terrible/hard to read.

So I'd say that no one's judgment is 'wrong' when it comes to issues of personal preference/taste - it appears to me that you just read people who had different taste than you have.

*** It also depends a lot on what else you have read (recently) because you might want more of the same or anything but that.

For example, one of my favourite stories is Call Me, which is the antithesis of an IndyHarry fic. Harry gets to know one of his classmates (Lisa Turpin) rather intimately and spends the summer with her. And yet, it has no power wank, training montages, helpful goblins, evil Dumbledore, money-stealing Weasleys or whatever else you can dig up from the "trope bingo". It's little more than a summer romance with slightly too reasonable adults in the background, magic is marginal, and yet it was amazing to read after one too many "Lord Potter" fics because it was so simple rather than trying to cramp everything into itself.

** I've had that experience also. Stories that get recced a lot that I can't finish due to either plot elements, writing style, or just ideas I don't care for. I just chalk it up to YMMV and move on; there's plenty out there that I do like.

As for being overly cliched, remember that every cliche was once an original idea that people liked so much they copied it (either well or poorly). I don't mind cliches for that very reason.

This is so true. When I went back to reread my favourite fics on ffn.net, I found that some now read as very mediocre and others as downright bad. But it's been a decade since I've read some of them and of course my taste are different now from when I was in my early teens. It does make me sad when I reread a fic I remember finding amazing and now I can't even get past the first chapter. However, when a fic can stand the test of time I do find it quite the gem.

Why are you letting what other people think about fics influence what you read in any way? Even if something is "terribly wrong with your judgement" so what? If you read a fic and enjoy it, that's all that matters. You're not reading fics to make others happy, you're reading them for yourself.

It doesn't matter if everyone hates the fics you enjoy or whether somebody praises a fic you think is cringe worthy, not every fic is geared toward the same audience. Your taste is different. Different opinions exist among literature professors on pieces of literature as well, it doesn't detract from your experience in any way what someone else thinks.

** Just because fic is popular, doesn't mean it's any good.

It depends on personal taste, age of the reader, whether they read fanfiction before or they just started. But I'd say that age makes the biggest difference - a 14 y old won't enjoy the same things as an adult.

I often find well liked fanfictions bornig / full of cliches / badly written (sometimes all of the above). So, I'd say your experiences are completely normal.

*** Whether they read fanfic before is huge here. Importance of Intent gets thrown around here all the time as a great Haphne fic (it is), but it's good largely because so many fics make Harry become more Slytherin by dating her while it goes the other direction to make her more Griffyndor. That's not as impactful if you haven't read any Haphne before to realize why that stands out

** I adored Antithesis because I identified with the characters on such a deep level.

I never even noticed if it was well-written, well-plotted, in-character, etc, even though I usually care about those things. It just hit really hard all the right notes to leave me emotionally devastated in the best way, it helped me deal with problems I didn't even know I had, and (most important, maybe) at the exact moment I needed to feel all that.

Antithesis left me with that feeling of being understood when no one else understands, and being found when I felt lost. And that, to me, makes it a good story (to me and to a great deal of readers who are, you know, dramatic misunderstood teenagers), which, at the point I read it, was more valuable than if it had good grammar, no cliches, etc.

So there's nothing wrong with your judgement if you don't think a story is any good, it just means different people have different priorities on what makes a good story. No need to force yourself to read something /someone else/ thinks is quality, they're not you :)

*** Thank you for posting this! I didnt like Antithesis either, but I can relate to this. I don't think I'd finished even PS now if I tried reading Harry Potter. Reading it now I can't say it's especially well-written (the later books do get better), but I'll always love Harry Potter and turn to it for comfort now because of that emotional connection. Even though it's not on the level of Tolkien, it still feels "truer" than Rowling's other books, including CC and FB.

** A lot of fics (and art in general) that are high-quality elicit strong reactions. For example, Inverarity's fics do this for me; I love Alexandra Quick and don't really like Hogwarts Houses Divided, which is in fact the opposite of what I've heard a lot of people say.

I think among the 20 or so really highly praised fics on this sub I've only read two or three, and I've read a lot of good fanfiction. It's like pop music - you can enjoy high-quality stuff without having to like all the high-profile stuff. Sure, there are people who know and read all the really acclaimed stuff, but the vast majority of us stick to pretty specific areas of the fandom. The HPFF fandom is big enough that you don't have to like big-picture stories, or a certain ship, or a certain trope, to find a good story.

** Harry Potter and the moral of Rationality was this for me. Praised everywhere. Even have its own wikipedia pages, and a few professional (positive) reviews.

I couldn't finish it. Way too much of a iamverysmart vibe for me. It also felt irrealistic to me in some part, quite ironically giving the intent of the author and the theme of the fanfiction.

*** Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. I found it amazing on my first readthrough a few years ago. Decent length, interesting ideas, and it felt like the characters were acting somewhat logically. Going back and listening to the audiobook version (semicompetently voiced, no complaints), I found the first few chapters to be hilarious. Unfortunately the story just jumped the shark a few hours in.

I'm not sure what exactly I don't like. Partly it's the iamverysmart vibe, partly it's the lack of research by the author on the harry potter world. I mean, if the author takes pride in researching genetics and all the logical fallacies, surely he can research the setting for the world he's using. And the characters feel like they have the emotional depth of a 2d cutout.

Maybe it's the cycle of Harry getting caught or realizing he screwed up, crying extremely quickly, instantly saying “I'm sorry”, being forgiven with caveats, recovering extremely quickly, and then not learning from his mistakes. You'd think McGonagall would have caught on by the third time that's happened.

** Prince of Slytherin gets recommended so often that I think it's become overhyped. I really like Slytherin Harry fics but this one drags on for so long.

I do think it has good and interesting ideas to “subvert the stereotypes” but it goes on for so long and never seems to get anywhere. The world it builds is so big it can sometimes just feel unfocused to me.

That said I think it's a fine fic but don't get why everybody recommends it.

*** It's all a matter of personal taste, I think Prince of Slytherin gets good recs because so many other fics have set the bar so low with regards to worldbuilding. That's not to say it isn't pretty good and a good example of how to subvert expectations correctly.

However, it provides actual justifications for why the kids speak like adult edgelords, makes the adults competent, and generally tries to scale up the power level of everyone, not just Harry, which is something a lot of other fics lack.

** There's no accounting for taste. Everyone likes different things and that's perfectly normal. It's okay not to like something as long as you don't purposely attack the people who like it and call them names.

For example- Novocaine gets recommended often around here. So I decided to give it a shot and read it to chapter 9, but it just didn't click with me. There's nothing wrong it- the grammar is good, there aren't any gross pairings, etc. But all the chapters felt the same- Harry wakes up, goes to meet Daphne, has some business meetings and in the afternoon explores the gazillion castles and mansions he now has. And that's it. That's all that happened before I gave up. It wasn't bad or anything, it was just consistently... meh.

** One man's meat is another man's poison.

Consider the idea of suspension of disbelief; to enjoy a story, you need to be able to forget it's just a story and think of it as real. Now, one person may find that the suspension is easily broken by spelling and grammar errors, which trip up the flow of their reading. Another may instead take the view that if you're focusing on that sort of detail, you're doing it wrong. One person will see a car get shot and explode in a large fireball and will say, That's unrealistic; their suspension of disbelief has been damaged by the departure from physics. Another will hear it and complain that /caring/ about exact physics is the real suspension-breaking problem and being unrealistic is the point of a movie. Indeed, such a person would probably be quite bored by a hard-science story that sticks to what is truly feasible.

Different people need different things to maintain their suspension of disbelief, so they enjoy different stories.

** Like many other people have said, tastes vary among readers and popularity =/= quality. Don't feel bad if you don't enjoy the highly hyped fics. It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with your judgment. I see fics like Prince of Slytherin, A Black Comedy and Seventh Horcrux recommended alllllll the time and I have zero inclination to read them. Likewise, there are fics I love that I rarely see recommended or discussed but that doesn't mean they're not better written than the super popular ones. The term YMMV exists for a reason.

** I think that's development as a fanfiction reader. I first dwelled into fanfiction in 2016. And at first, I used to gush on about terrible, badly written Gary Stu or Mary Sue cringe-fests. But now, when I see my favourites list, I can't look at the earlier ones. I can't reread those. The only reason they are still in my favourites is that they are a sort of marking for my progress as a reader and writer. Now I can't stand such stories.

One thing why cringy stories are in the top favourites is because most readers are not among the mature age group. They search for the most popular fics and stumble upon those same stories which in turn makes them more popular. (It's what happened for me.)

And I think the first time readers read those stories, and as they don't have much to compare and rate the stories against (as they are still young readers), they go on how good that story was.

It's the very reason why well-written stories with good character and world development remain underappreciated.

And another thing is that many fanfiction writers are females, who in turn write Mary sues and slashes, many make the plot overly emotional and cringy.

And the boys just write overpowered boy who lived stuff.

** Antithesis originally wasn't intended to be as hype as it became. It was more of a personal attempt to rewrite something genuinely horrible from when I was 12. I totally agree, I genuinely don't understand the amount of popularity it's gained. The end...10(?) chapters I think are high quality because around that time I put in the actual effort.

Because personal taste is by far the foremost element in judging quality at the highest level of literary criticism, nevermind on a fucking internet forum.

Highly praised just means a lot of people like it, best case scenario. A few people liked it and advertised it enough to generate a lot of talk most common scenario. When criticism isn't encouraged, a few praises go a long way.
