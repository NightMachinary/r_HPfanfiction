** I notice that the tone of whatever I'm currently reading has some influence on my thoughts at times, minimal though it is, it is there. This is why I avoid fics with a depressed or whiny and moody main character and tone for a majority of the fic. I stick mostly to humor and upbeat adventurous fics.

** I started reading fanfiction summer 2005 (age 16), just after my GCSE examinations. I was definitely addicted then: I spent my entire summer holiday devouring fics 24/7, getting up ridiculously early and going to bed very late to get as much reading time as possible.

I'd definitely say my health suffered for it, due to the inactivity. When school started again I was floored as I'd got so used to reading all the time. I continued to read, getting up early in the morning to read fic before school and reading as soon as I got home. Homework basically stopped.

Eventually this slowed down, largely because I more or less ran out of fics to read and so became dependant on new works being released. That was the point at which I started getting interested in the writing side of things.

Fanfiction has definitely changed my life as it has taken up a large amount of my time and made me interested in writing. But more than that, being part of a fanfiction /community/ changed me. That is to say: DLP. I went into that community a pretty conservative Christian who believed in creationism and had no ambition or intellectual curiosity. I came out a liberal atheist who loved learning new things and wanted to do everything. (Part of that was probably all the fics where Harry becomes a savant over the space of a summer... I think, subconsciously, I started holding myself to that standard. Or at least I embraced it as an ideal: the enlightenment man.)

Not only that, but I have met up in real life with people from DLP, three times in London, once in Berlin and once in Buenos Aires. Most significantly, I had a girlfriend for over a year who I encountered via DLP.

So yes, fanfiction and the associated community has changed me. However, I would not say now that I am addicted. I can go weeks without reading a fic. But fanfic is and probably always will be part of my life, via my love of writing and the friends I have made.

Or when you google a certain trope or tag and see all the google links to fanfic lists colored so you have to search deeper to find other lists. (And you've usually read all those too. ;~; )

** I have noticed that I developed better vocabulary, am more picky of what I read, and pay more attention to plot holes and writing style. It's been a positive experience so far. :) Been reading since 2006 - so I guess I am addicted.

** Well.. one could say that. Whenever I read something I like I want to read it all in one go. I think my dad called my reading behaviour antisocial at one point in my childhood, long before I discovered fanfiction.

With books that's somewhat okay, because at some point you just reached the last page, even if it's a series, and there is nothing more for you to read about this world and it's just finished and you do other things until you find another book that catches your attention.

With fanficiton that's different. It's just never finished, and for somebody who always reads the whole series of books or watches the every episode of a tv show in as little time as possible, that's a bit problematic ;)

I know I like the HP world, I know that there will be another good story out there, if I just look long enough, I don't have to pay for it, can start as many new stories as I want. I mean with time I get tired of reading bad stories, but when I just found out about fanfiction I had reading material for a few months and read so much that at one point my friends started complaining that I'm never around anymore. I even preferred an evening reading fanfiction to going out with friends. Once they told me I realized how obsessed I had become with reading and forced myself to do other stuff too. Before tests (I'm a student at University) I expressively forbid myself to read fanficiton. It just wastes too much time - looking for stories etc. And it could always happen that I find a 200 000 word story I like and won't stop reading until I finished it. If I want to read something during this time, then I always try to read short stories (Alice Munro writes great ones).

I'm just not the kind of person who can read just one chapter a night of an intriguing book, I always have to read further. Knowing that I try to act accordingly, but fanfiction really makes it hard ;)

Well... I never wrote this down before, I sound like a crazy person.

** I think I am sort of addicted to fan fiction. I read a lot for comfort such as slice of life family stuff and Harry gets saved fics.

I also read OP harry fics to motivate myself to try hard with my studies and to re-remember how fascinating and useful it is to peruse academics and all the interesting things you can find and incorporate into your life.

When I started vaping weed I looked for fics about HP characters that were experimenting with similar things.

I probably read fan fiction at least every third day and when I do read it I usually binge a long fic. Also, my writing style when I write fiction has been heavily influenced by all the wolfstar I read age 12-15

** Fuck yes I'm addicted. Granted, I may have an addictive personality, as I was previously hooked on playing Civ 4 and Civ 5 every spare moment I had.

Has it affected me as a person? Probably. I was a fairly introverted person before I discovered fan fiction. I'm a bit more so now. I'm a bit of a tightwad as well. So an evening spent reading fan fiction (costing me only time, electricity, and Internet access) is usually more appealing than going out to a bar where I don't know anybody, I can't hear anything, and beers are $5 each.

** I used to love real books. Now I spend hours, consecutively, a day just reading fanfiction. Like I tried to go back and re-read Harry Potter. Couldn't. Lost steam at Chamber of Secrets. To much "Hey, I remember this part in X fic" and all that fannon conflicting with the cannon I'm reading.

As far as affecting me, I've finally found an outlet for the crazy ideas in my head, with people who can appreciate them. It's actually spurred me to improving my writing. Some of my early stuff was horse shit, so I got better, which translated over to things like school work.

** I"m a gamer. I'm a reader. Before i discovered fanfiction i was always reading a book or playing games. Now with discovering fanfiction and my dual monitors i can do both at the same time! HEAVEN! Can i do without fanfiction? Sure. Just go back to reading books(which i've drastically slowed down on) Would i miss it? YES! Eventually HP and Naruto(my 2 main reads) will die off and i'll sit down and have a good cry.

** Something reading fanfiction has taught me to do that reading only professional novels never did was to appreciate all the little things that make up a good story. Because when those little things are absent, it's noticeable.

I certainly am addicted to fanfic, to the point where I used to rgularly stay up until 4 O'clock in the morning just to keep reading!

** I first read fanfiction while knowing what it was called and the culture around it about ten years ago. Always been a very heavy reader but didn't really read a lot of fanfiction until about five years ago.

I'd never really written creatively before, but after a couple of years of reading fanfiction I thought to myself, "hey, I can do this."

So I did. I've got several published stories on fanfiction.net (under this name), including two novel length ones that I swear I'm still working on.

Then a couple of years ago, I looked at some work by published original fiction authors I liked and said, "hey, I can do this too."

So I am. Currently planning on self-publishing original fiction (sci-fi, classic fantasy, and modern fantasy) in digital serials format, and also looking into novel publishing.

Fanfiction made me an author. Soon, I hope, a /published/ author who gets paid to do it for a living.

Still addicted to fanfiction, obviously.

** I am very addicted. Fanfiction for me is a way of seeing a character in a different or new light. I can see what they would do in certain situations, encountering other characters and overall seeing what would happen to them if things twisted. I can compare myself too, judging how I'd like to be a better person depending on those reactions and circumstances.

** I wouldn't say I'm addicted. I read fanfiction in much the same style that I read books. I'll have a dry spell for a few months, and then pick something up and finish the whole thing in an entire night. I have trouble putting stories down if I'm really into it, so it's a bit of a problem if I have other things to do (for example, homework). It's kind of a hinderance. The last story I read was "Against the Moon", and that story is 105 chapters long. I couldn't finish it in one night. Also, I had work. So anytime I was not working or sleeping a few measly hours in between, I was reading. It was a bad three days for me. My husband was annoyed.

Fanfiction has impacted my life, just in that it gives me a hobby. I like writing more than I like reading, so it's fun to just write for an hour or two in between work and classes...and the stories stay with me throughout my day. I remember when I first stumbled upon Harry Potter fanfiction (oh, thirteen years ago), it pretty much blew my mind. I didn't know that you could just write stories about your favorite story...and I had soooo many plot bunnies that I just didn't stop for months. It was a great experience.

Other than that, I think fanfiction has just helped me be more open to ideas. Although I read strictly canon, I love hearing AU plot bunnies and "what if" prompts. Also, I was horrified by slash fiction as a young child and couldn't believe anyone would ever do such a thing, and Wolfstar is like my favorite thing ever now (this is also a symptom of a recovering Catholic, so I can't blame it on fanfiction strictly).

In general, I would say that the Harry Potter stories and community have shaped who I am today, and that fanfiction is just a small section of that awesomeness. I'm also LeakyCon/HP Alliance girl, so there's so much of this fandom that I owe in addition to loving fanfiction.

** I wouldn't say I'm addicted to fan fiction. I would say I'm addicted to Harry Potter and just hate that there are no more books coming out so I go to fan fiction for my fix ;) I love it though, and I've met some really awesome people because of it. Not to mention realized how much I love writing.
