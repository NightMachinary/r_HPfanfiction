No one could believe it. Even Voldemort was bewildered to say the least. They all expected from the Leader of the Light to design a plan to defeat the Dark Lord, but instead he manipulated each situation to make everyone believe that love was the most powerful thing in the world. He needed them to believe it... But not to sacrifice themselves or for some ‚ÄúGreater Good‚Äù. Nah, he needed them to buy it because he had the greatest idea of all times. He was creating a band called Love is powerful and he wanted to be followed by the whole Wizarding World. He needed to vanquish the Weird Sisters!!!
