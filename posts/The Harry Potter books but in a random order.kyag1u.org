I put the books into a random list and got an order of 7, 4, 5, 6, 2, 1, and 3.

I think it would be really interesting to try to make a coherent story but with the books out of order.

My thoughts are that Harry can't go to his first year of Hogwarts because Voldemort is on the loose. Then somehow Voldemort gets defeated? But then in second year he has to come to Hogwarts because of the goblet of fire, with Voldemort's followers trying to undo his defeat. Then third year comes around and the ministry denies Voldemort is back because he literally was just defeated. Fourth year he invades Hogwarts at the end of the year and transfers his soul into the diary. Then the diary gets defeated somehow and possesses a professor at the school. The only problem with this list is that PoA is so completely unrelated to Voldemort that it would be completely unrelated to the overall arc.

I was wondering what other people would make of how the story would play out with this order of books or a different order.


** 1. First year Harry Potter discovers the existence of the Deathly Hallows and has to foil an attempt by Quirrell to steal the Elder Wand

2. Prospective heir of Slytherin Harry Potter ends up competing in the TW tournament by accident after a Lockhart antic gone wrong ends up putting his name in the goblet of fire.

3. Third year Harry Potter discovers the history of the OotP and with that the past of his godfather, after a mystery in the Ministry finds information that doesn't seem to make sense, he has to embark on a journey to discover if his godfather was truly guilty or not.

4. Having learned about the prophecy, Harry embarks in a training with Dumbledore over the nature of Voldemort, Horcruxes and other stuff. Unfortunately for him, a disguised Barry Crouch Jr fixes a broken vanishing cabinet to transport him to a fateful encounter at a graveyard which he barely escapes thanks to Snape, who turned to be the Half-blood prince. Hermione and Ron get at odds after Lavender, amazed at Ron making the Quidditch team, starts dating Ron.

*** 5

As if the war and the fallout of Roger Davies death wasn't bad enough for Harry, he had to deal with the Ministry, which now propelled by Dolores Umbridge was going hard after Hagrid as the culprit of reopening the chamber of secrets. Now between monster from the chamber and the undersecretary, muggleborns are in for a tough year. It all comes down to stop Voldemort from entering Hogwarts in an attempt to recover his diary Horcrux.

**** 6

After Snape died in the chamber of secrets protecting Harry, Dumbledore is left blind to Voldemort's actions. The good thing is that Voldemort was discovered by the Minister and Umbridge when they came to arrest Dumbledore and the truth is known. Now Dumbledore destroyed the Slytherin locket and he and Harry are in full Horcrux hunt mode. Dumbledore asks old friend Flamel to take the DaDA post, who has some insightful opinions on Horcruxes, mastering death and immortality. Successfully luring Bellatrix into trying to retrieve the sorcerer's stone for her master gives mixed results when Harry and Dumbledore go looking for Slytherin ring and a part of the Deathly Hallows that same night. Bellatrix is caught, but only after successfully convincing Draco to kill Dumbledore. Hermione dates Seamus, causing a rift with Ron

***** 7

The Horcrux hunt is down to the trio trying to end it all. They soon manage to find the real Slytherin ring, for the one Dumbledore retrieved was a fake planted by Edgar Bones before his death. Still, the ring causes more than simple rift amoung the trio. The hunt seems lost as they are scarse in leads, when suddenly they find something. Bellatrix knows where an Horcrux is,and they have to team up with Sirius and a dementor to get the secret out of her, as she is heavily guarded in Azkaban by the international confederation of wizards. At the end, it all comes down to a battle in Diagon Alley trying to retrieve the cup. Hermione still kisses Ron in the final battle. Dobby still dies.

******* I like a lot of what you wrote, but why does Sirius have to return to Azkaban? (And still dies?) This always irks me with fanfiction, Sirius still dying. Surely there are other ways to get the information out of Bellatrix that doesn't include Sirius dying.

Sirius can become a spy of sorts, or even through polyjuice potion, or some other magical means, come up with an idea to trick Bellatrix (Perhaps having her "accidentally" escape), but instead of escaping, the Order Members kidnap her for questioning.

Or heck, having Tonks the Metamorphis, go into it with changing her appearance.

********* Though I think that Rowling just didn't know what to do with Sirius after the third book. He was always in hiding when I'm sure there were ways she could have proven his innocence, and have him be there for Harry. Harry could have still been the stubborn boy that he was, that plot stuff happened too, but Sirius could have been there for him. Helped him with the war/ministry, etc.

At Harry's 3rd year, Dumbledore was still pretty respected. He had Aurors like Kingsley and Tonks, and an retired Auror like Moody to help him out.

We don't see much of Amelia Bones, but from the little bit that we do get, it seemed like she was reasonable enough to listen.

I know that truth serums and pensive aren't a thing in Wizarding Court, but surely there are exceptions to the rule.

But yeah, it irks me so much when fanfics kill Sirius off. I can understand why, it's difficult to think of an idea for him, but being there for Harry is good enough.

********** The thing is, that for Harry to be who JKR needed him to be, he couldn't have Sirius after a certain point.

Same goes, generally, for the theme of the books. The point, as a whole, is that it's these kids against Voldemort. That's also why the OOTP loses out after book 5. They had to be shown for the world to make some sense, but keeping them in the limelight too long would take away from the focus on Harry doing things.

Sirius is a fine character, but having him alive (or worse, freed) does not fit the original HP story or fanfic retreading comparable paths.

*********** This is the right answer. It is not that JKR couldn't do cool things with Sirius, because she could totally do so. The story was about Harry, and she needed Harry isolated in some way. No parents. Sirius dies. Dumbledore dies. They're in the run. Ron leaves. Hermione is sulking about Ron leaving. The point is to take Harry to the inflexion point, which is achieved with the innocent death (dobby), he getting his understanding of death opposite to Voldemort, getting a hold of Occlumancy. All those pieces in order for Harry to take the decision she wanted him to take, in the way she wanted him to take it... About going alone to the forest to face Voldemort.

*********** But with fanfiction, there's so much more you can do with Sirius or other similar things. You don't need it to be similar to canon, you can allow it to be different.

Harry and co can still get in fights with Voldemort, Draco, Snape etc. But Sirius can be there to help him along.

************ Yes, but it would have to be significantly different from canon.

Harry, in canon, is alone in MANY ways by the end, and has always lacked certain connections. Throwing in Sirius in a parental role heavily impacts him. Or, if it doesn't, then it /should./ Otherwise, why would you have Sirius there?

Essentially: If Sirius is alive and free, then he should be used in such a way that respects his effects on the people around him. If he is alive, then you will have to include that in Harry's growth. Is Harry still sacrificing himself? Why? A lot of his mental degradation that leads to the action is /based/ on him not having a family, etc.

Just having him alive to 'be there for Harry' alone already changes /so much/, or at least should. That's why Rowling killed him: Even him just 'being there' was too much, but the effects of his death worked well for the story she wanted to tell.

He can be alive, or he can be dead, it depends on the story you want to tell. However, do realise that both of these things have their own set of effects on Harry (and the others), so you should handle them appropiately.

** Book 7: Lord Voldemort is dead, and magical Britain has enjoyed a decade of peace. But suddenly, out of the blue, the former Death Eaters, Voldemort's followers thought to be bewitched by him, launch a sudden coup to seize the Ministry of Magic.\\
After a harrowing strike on their home, the Dursleys are forced to flee the country, but their nephew Harry Potter is separated from them; rescued by a man named Remus Lupin, he learns of a strange and terrible world of magic, and is brought to a temporary shelter where he meets newfound friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.\\
Though Remus attempts to teach the kids magic and keep them safe, their supplies are running out, and they slowly realise that there's only one place where they can stay safe and properly learn magic. They have to find their way to Hogwarts.\\
 \\
Book 4: The coup has been reversed and the legitimate Ministry of Magic is back in power, and Harry and his friends are safely at Hogwarts. All's well that ends well?\\
Not quite; the mastermind of the coup was never identified, and Harry has been having terrible visions in his sleep, dreams that seem to foretell an attempt to resurrect Voldemort using the blood of his arch-enemy...\\
With the Omniwizard Open coming to Hogwarts grounds, an olympic-grade event attended by witches and wizards across the globe, the ancient castle doesn't seem as safe and secure as it once was.\\
 \\
Book 5: Somehow, impossibly...Voldemort has been resurrected, with Harry barely escaping with his life. But instead of rallying to deal with this renewed threat, magical Britain is in conflict with itself.\\
Minister Fudge believes that Harry and Dumbledore are lying, with Dumbledore plotting to use his unbelievable claims of a terror threat to bolster his own power and usurp the Ministry; Dumbledore fears that Fudge has been bewitched by one of the former Death Eaters in order to initiate a moreso silent coup.\\
As the only surviving and cooperative eyewitness of Voldemort's return, Harry wants to find a way to prove what he saw...but can he do that with an auditor sent to Hogwarts, one Dolores Umbridge, trying to discredit him at every opportunity?\\
 \\
Book 6: Voldemort has been exposed! Caught without a sufficient army to seize the country outright, he has resorted to war in the shadows, daggers in the night, to whittle away the Ministry and conquer the country through fear.\\
Together, using a strange link Harry has with his archnemesis, Harry and Dumbledore try to pin down Voldemort's plan, in order to ambush him where he strikes next, and discover the secret of how, impossibly, he returned from the dead.\\
 \\
Book 2: Voldemort is dead, at the cost of Albus Dumbledore's life. But the terrible truth has come out that Voldemort is a lich, and will return again and again as long as his soul anchors are intact.\\
Without his mentor, having only his friends now, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the rest of Hogwarts attempt to deduce where and what the dark lord's anchors are...but their investigation takes a twisted, monstrous turn when random students start being Petrified by an unseen attacker, and messages written in blood on the walls gloat about Voldemort's imminent return...\\
 \\
Book 1: One soul anchor destroyed, and a gargantuan basilisk under Hogwarts slain for good measure. But the shade of Voldemort is already making his move, seeking to steal the life-giving Philosopher's Stone from Nicolas Flamel in order to restore his body once more.\\
With no other choice, Flamel hides the Stone at Hogwarts, trusting in the old castle's magic to ward off the spectral Dark Lord.\\
Harry, though, is wary; though Hogwarts is still the safest place in Britain, Voldemort and his followers have infiltrated it many times before...\\
 \\
Book 3: Nicolas Flamel is dead, but his Stone is destroyed, and the Dark Lord's shade has been banished to the other side of Europe.\\
One soul anchor was in Lucius Malfoy's hands, another in Bellatrix Lestrange's. Sensing a pattern, Harry sets out to question Sirius Black, a notorious follower of Voldemort captured in the first war, only to discover that he has escaped Azkaban Prison.\\
Now, Harry is trying to track down Black and destroy what might be the last soul anchor...but the original architect of Voldemort's resurrection and the Death Eater coup remains unknown, and whoever it is might be even closer than Harry, Ron and Hermione ever could have imagined...\\
 \\
Spoiler: It's Peter Pettigrew; while in Percy's care at Hogwarts, he found and was possessed by the diadem horcrux. Having managed to twist Peter's animagus ability into full-on shapeshifting, he's been sneaking around and orchestrating events from the very beginning. Unable to assassinate Harry personally due to his mother's love protection, he's been spying on him in the innocent form of Scabbers and orchestrating deadly traps whenever he can.

** Maybe have him have been resurrected or maybe he never managed to get to Harry (Dumbledore arrived right after lily was killed maybe) and Harry has been moving around constantly to avoid being killed. Then he becomes the chosen one because the killing curse rebounded. Nobody understands how. The triwizard is in part celebration that Voldemort was beaten. Then he manages to come back. After that the ministry does deny his return (maybe trying to argue that Harry thinks his fame is waning at all and wants to have a big spotlight). Book 6 could happen with draco or an OC Slytherin upper year fixing the cabinet(or any other way of getting the death eaters on the grounds. Book 2 could be Voldemort trying to discredit Dumbledore and make him seem incompetent because he couldn't protect his students (maybe managing to kill Harry/Dumbledore in the process or at least separate them so he has a better target. Book one could be Voldemort possessing quirell like he tried with Harry to get the stone(maybe something went wrong with his resurrection and he's trying to fix it so he can't go straight into targeting Harry/accomplish any major moves personally. Sirius/any death eaters break out of Azkaban causing dementors to be placed on the hogwarts grounds (not knowing that they are Voldemort's agents) and they turn on the castle causing massive losses due to the sheer surprise of it.
