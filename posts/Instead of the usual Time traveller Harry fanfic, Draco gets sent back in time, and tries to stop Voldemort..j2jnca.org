Bonus points if it's set in the Mauraders era or Tom Riddles Era.

Or imagine Time Traveller Draco raising a young Harry Potter, like damn.

If there are any good completed fics like this, please suggest!

Edit: these are for the heading but not the bonus points you mentioned, frankly I don't think those have been done till now.

There's also another one that's recommended quite often where Harry as MoD sends draco back in time but as a female version of Draco, but I can't remember what it's called

** Linkffn(time to spare by emysabath) kind of fits your bill. Both draco and Harry are sent back to marauders era. And it's complete

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...

  All he wanted was a way out. A way to do it all over again, and to erase his mistakes. He stared at the crackling blue flames so hard they imprinted in his vision.   At age eleven, Draco receives a letter from the future, which will make him change the path he has set out upon and lead him into a life he'd never dared to imagine.

  With a sly smile he eyed the time turner. It gleamed like gold, just the way the Malfoys liked it. With this, he could save his son. He went for the door but came to a sudden halt when realization hit him: With the time turner, he could save more than just one person. (Draco-centric time travel fanfiction, 3rd year)
