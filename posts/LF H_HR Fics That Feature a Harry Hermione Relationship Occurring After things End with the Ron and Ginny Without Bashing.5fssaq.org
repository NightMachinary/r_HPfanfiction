** This one has a supportive Ron and a well meaning, if a little overbearing Ginny.

** linkffn(Local's Guide to Life in London by Significant Owl) is too short to really have any Ron or Ginny in it, but it's about Harry and Hermione getting together in the aftermath of failed relationships with each and doesn't have any bashing. linkffn(With Malice Aforethought by SPSmith) is an old and little-read post-OotP fic that I enjoy a lot.

** I think a lot of fics by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5594536/Potato19][Potato19]] fit that criterion. I can't remember bashing at least... but I'm quite apathetic about the Weaslys, so I sometimes don't notice.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3290886/1/Hermione-s-Plan][Hermione's Plan]] is pretty entertaining, it's one of the first fics I ever read. It was written pre-DH. Also, for some reason, Hermione and her family are nudists.

*** The whole nudist thing is just ridiculous to me. It fits in with the whole "Oh, we have to be naked to do this ritual to destroy this horcrux" crap. I haven't read that Fic yet but from the reviews, it seems like the nudist thing is shoe horned in to give Harry a chance to see Hermione naked.
