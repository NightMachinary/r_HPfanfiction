For me, it would have to be A Magical World by Miranda Flairgold. linkffn(5318075) The Third book in the epic Akren School of Magic series, it only got through the first 2 chapters before it was abandoned. Such a shame...


** linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom)

This is one of the best AUs out there and I really don't think it will be updated since its been a few years.

*** I totally agree. For what it's worth, Reign of the Serpent (linkffn(9783012)) scratches a lot of the same itches, and while the first few chapters seem to be exceptionally similar to PotDK, it quickly grows into it's own and is easily one of my favorite currently updating fics.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

It's probably not getting updated again either, since she has dozens of fics that are similarly abandoned. Also she appears to currently be mostly writing in some other fandom called Teen Wolf I've never heard of, so HP works probably aren't a priority.

It's the writing analogue of the wannabe guitarist who learns and improvises a bit on a few riffs of his favorite pieces but never actually learns a song.

My favorite trope (Hermione back in time), extremely witty and well written. The author passed away, may he rest in peace.

I think about this fic at least once a week.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom is great, as well, but it cuts off near enough to the end, IMHO.

****** The story behind FFA.net was that all the authors had to unanimously agree before admitting an additional author to post on the site. From my understanding, Bob/Alyx vetoed almost all the authors that applied, so as not to upstage their own stories, which were at the time generating most of the traffic for the site. This cause author applications to drop to nil overtime & this caused traffic to drop. Ironically, the drop in traffic caused a reduction in exposure for “Bobmin”, leading them to swallow their pride & go back to ff.net, leaving ffa.net to die with only a couple of authors still posting.

** These have already been mentioned, but The Boy Who Live by Santi and everything written by cywscross that I've read are probably my top ones.

After that *What You Leave Behind* by newcomb. linkffn(10758358)

And *Electric Heart*

[[http://silencia20.tumblr.com/post/164724376152/electric-heart-ch-1]]

In fact most of silencia20's work would qualify, since if you graph how many fics she has, plus how often she starts new fics times how many chapters I expect them to need to be to finish on average vs time, and her completed chapters plus her rate of producing new chapters vs time, and the two lines never converge.

Some other ones

*Multicolour Post Its*

*Rectifier* and *Empathetic*, these are basically the same idea, started then abandoned by two different authors

linkffn(5852062;2595818;10767751)

And *Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past*. It hasn't aged that gracefully, but I still think it deserves a mention, as its like the OG never will be completed fic.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

Just in case someone saw this and was interested. The author is still active on their Tumblr and says a new chapter will eventually be posted, but it has been some time so I am not sure if it will ever actually happen.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3meO7obwCb4X1NaSHNra3BjcUU][A Winter's Fairytale]] is among the best SS/HG stories written in my opinion, and very worth the read despite the fact that it's been abandoned.

The characters are so well-written with convincing personalities and realistic flaws that make them so relatable and sympathetic. I've also never laughed so hard while reading - the humor is smart and true to life.

The plot is absorbing and unique - it starts out as a version of The Hollow Man, and then hints at a murder mystery that we infuriatingly never get the conclusion to!

It was written well before the series was completed, so it's post-war AU. Give it a shot! It won't disappoint.

The Spiral path- Wordhammer's sequel to Holly Evans and the Spiral Path, has had a semi-sequel to it written, but the original story was never finished.

I would have loved to see the original finished- but as someone who has written unfinished stories myself, I know how it is.
