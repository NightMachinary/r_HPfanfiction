That people get wrong are just annoying. Like spelling names wrong. Or the one that really annoys me: JAMES WAS A CHASER. Not a seeker. A chaser. And if you're changing that around for the story than so be it, but I have found the majority of the time they are 100000% convinced that I am wrong, even when I direct them to the book.

I would love it if fanfic authors would check their facts so it at least looks like they care.

So now you heard my rant, what's yours?


** Harry having to pay medical bills, the Dursleys blaming Harry for medical bills, anything about medical bills. Medical bills are a huge issue for people in the USA but they haven't existed in the UK for 50+ years. As a native Brit this destroys any immersion I have in a fic even faster than Harry changing his 'dollars' for galleons.

  While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets.

Honestly it would be refreshing if a fanfic used Henry. Its the one name that would actually make sense considering the grandfather of James had the name Henry(but was called Harry). Instead Harry always gets names like Hadrian, Harrison, Harold or Hardwin. I mean the Dursleys even complained that he had a nasty common name.

**** Yes, and specifically the translation of "vol". In English, "flee" and "fly" are very similar and have the same noun form, "flight". But in French, they're two different words completely. «Vol» comes from «voler», "to fly" and exclusively means "flight" in the sense of flying. The word for an act of fleeing is «fuite». So while it's true that «vol» means "flight", «de» means "of, from" and «mort» means "death", it is incorrect to interpret the entire phrase as Voldemort sticking cowardice into his name.

** The wizarding world having Victorian values that oppress women and shun LGBT people. This is more of a trope or even an artistic choice, but seriously, if you read the books /or/ watch the movies, you can see that the wizarding world has women's equally, and we have multiple pronouncements from JKR about their tolerance for homosexuality.

(Plus no muggle-borns being in the Ministry. There's been a muggle-born Minister already.)

As for the LGBT, I'm not actually sure on this. JKR says that Lucius specifically wouldn't have minded I think, but she does say that she can't speak for every character and that their world mirrors ours. If that's true, (and remembering HP takes place in the 90´s) I don't think that they would be all that tolerant tbh. Not to mention that muggle-borns and half-bloods (and I think they would be less tolerant) outnumber the pure-bloods. Also JKR didn't mention much about the T in LGBT (I think; I don't much keep up with JKR), so that part is still up in the air canonically.

**** Honestly, I've always liked the interpretation that the WW has odd values that are both more and less tolerant in certain ways. For example, I can see the pressure to have children (and thus pass down ~magic~) as being far more socially enforced, but the prevalence of potions and shit making it so that being LGBT is fine as long as you do it the "right" way. Conversely, I can totally see wizards having a more conservative view of sex and divorce than the Muggle world, if only because of a culturally predisposed tendency towards valuing stability and family alliances.

** House elves needing wizard magic to survive. Not so much the trope itself but the rationale that most writers use really bothers me. Let me try and explain it.

I think most people are uncomfortable with how Sirius treated Kreacher, especially in hindsight. Dumbledore even draws attention to it. In fact, he draws attention to it just hours after Sirius' death when it might have been more polite to wait for a later time to discuss it.

#+begin_quote
  /‘I warned Sirius when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our Headquarters that Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect. I also told him that Kreacher could be dangerous to us. I do not think Sirius took me very seriously, or that he ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human's --'/
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  /'Sirius did not hate Kreacher,' said Dumbledore. ‘He regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice. Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike ... the fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping our reward.'/
#+end_quote

So we are *explicitly told* in canon that House Elves can feel the same emotions to the same extent as any human.

So then we come to Winky, which is where the whole trope starts. In a sadly ironic turn of events, most writers are just as guilty as Sirius is in disregarding the personhood of another sentient being.

Winky isn't emotionally devastated that she's been cast out of her family, no of course not. She's dying because: magic.

It's not because she feels a tremendous sense of shame and self-loathing because house elves have developed their own social mores about being 'clothed'. It's because she needs big strong noble Harry to come along and enslave her again.

It bothers me because this trope disdains the entire message of the series!

** Magical cores, or rather the type of magic it supposes. It didn't bother me much when I started reading fanfics, but I find it more and more anoying. Having your characters running out of fuel to cast their spell is one of the laziest ways one can think of to create tension. And the comparison with the subtle and mysterious canon magic makes it even worse. Moreover, it doesn't fit with the feeling you get from this magic system at all.

=t=(w×c)/(v×a)×Z=

Where

- a→ body weight
- v→ viciousness
- t→ intended transformation
- w→ wand power
- c→ concentration
- Z→ unknown

In other words, /Harry Potter magic has magical formulas that imply a measurable amount of magic going through the wand./ Even if you consider "concentration" and "wand power" as mental and physical stamina respectively, that's still a hard cap on a person's magical output. Maybe you don't run out of fuel, per se, but as you become increasingly physically and mentally exhausted, your spells deteriorate in terms of duration and performance; or, conversely, the harder the spell, the greater the toll it takes on your body, and advanced spells that you haven't trained enough for can kill/hurt you from over-exhaustion.

This doesn't imply magical cores; simple stamina is obviously enough to explain it. And it could fit with multiple explanations - channeling mystical energy from the gods, drawing energy from nature, converting biological energy into magic, screwing with quantum mechanics, tricking the universe into looking the other way, etc.

But it also implies that there are multiple ways of becoming more powerful, besides just "making your core bigger" or what-have-you. Maybe Dumbledore's really powerful because his multiple jobs have given him an iron-willpower, or maybe Voldemort's strong because he found a way to boost that mysterious Z variable in the equation. And maybe that Z variable holds the key to why magic is so odd in the HP universe.

My point, in short, is that for as weird and mystical as the HP magic system is, /magical people in-universe/ have tried to apply a scientific explanation to it and that just about any fanon explanation - even magic cores - could be valid.

Not necessarily. Only that the power of the wand is one of the variable that influence the final result. We also know about wand power from Ollivander who mentions it. Power implies a difference in strength, not necessarily in amount. Someone's magic could be simply stronger than someone else's. Perhaps, as you train and grow more knowledgeable, your magic becomes stronger, perhaps some wand cores or woods are inherently stronger than others magically. It doesn't strictly require energy.\\
Ultimately, it is up to interpretation. There are other interpretations which are more consistent and more interresting than wand cores.

Science is the process by which you're trying to understand how things work, so obviously they are using it. However, there are no indication than the science of magic looks like the science of physics, for instance. It will only be the case if the way magic works /looks like/ the way physics work. Again, there are better, more interresting (and less lazy) interpretations.\\
Now, in this case, the only thing we can say for sure is wizards have described magic using equations. That's all.

*** Actually, the word tall isn't used to describe Harry at all until HBP, where it's used as a comparison to Narcissa:

#+begin_quote
  “Really?” said Harry, taking a step forwards and gazing into the smoothly arrogant face that, for all its pallor, still resembled her sister's. He was as tall as she was now. “Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in, are you?”

Narcissa was described as tall in GoF, but to be honest, we can't take much from it. (a) She's may just be tall for a female, which could be average height for a male; and (b) JKR actually uses the world tall to describe a lot of people. Given that the books are limited third person focused on Harry, this could be reflective of him being shorter than a great deal of people.

He definitely seems to have been on the shorter side before his growth spurt the summer before sixth year; in POA he's said to be about the same height as Hermione. Even after, we know he's less than six feet (Runcorn is said to be more than that when Harry polyjuices as him) and he's slightly shorter than Draco and Bellatrix, and certainly shorter than Ron.
