** There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2196609/1/An-Aunt-s-Love][/An Aunt's Love/]] which starts out interesting but then the story takes a weird turn.

** I'm currently co-writing a longfic that does this. It explores the trauma of several other characters as well, but Harry primarily gets this treatment. And yes, it's adults who trying to deal with Harry's trauma, not his friends. It's eventual mentor/adoption Snape (he's currently still in asshole phase), but Remus and Dumbledore are actually featured in and influence Harry's life & wellbeing as well, and are not just background window dressing.

If that sounds anything like what you're looking for, you can check it out here: linkao3(A Lamb Before the Slaughter)

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?
