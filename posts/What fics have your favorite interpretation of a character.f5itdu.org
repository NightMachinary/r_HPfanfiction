  All stories have a beginning. This is one of them: the diary, the girl, the quill dipped in ink. Don't trust a magical object if you can't see where it keeps its brain, Arthur would admonish months later, but Ginny had grown up in a house crammed with unknown magic, had no memory of a life separate from talking mirrors and singing teapots and the tinny complaints of Great-Uncle Alfie's chess set. She was just turned eleven years old, and she wanted a friend. Was this to be her crime?

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** OP!Harry - The Lesser Sadness by newcomb. So much awesome in 20k words.

Hermione - In the Bleak Midwinter by TheLoud.

Ron - The Cost of Time Travel by the sharminator. I really wish this was complete.

Draco - Learning to Fly by renaissance. Draco trying to do whatever he can to get out of Hufflepuff is hilarious.

Padma - Harry & the Mysterious Curse of the Girl-Who-Lived; Funniest Padma in all of fanfiction. Serves as a great foil to Hermione.

Parvati - Harry Potter and the Scambled Sorting; Funniest Parvati in all of fanfiction. I love her efforts at forming her information gathering network.

SI - What's Her name in Hufflepuff by ashez2ashes

Voldemort - HPMOR Haters can hate on HPMOR's Harry all they want, but HPMOR's Voldemort is pretty awesome.

Daphne - Unatoned by SeriousScribble

I'll edit stuff in if I think of more.

  Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret locked away in her mind. She is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve, to be bred and monitored until it can be accessed. COMPLETE.

** Peter Pettigrew--Prince of Slytherin linkffn(11191235) By far the best Peter in fanfiction--so much more than the sniveling coward Peter is usually written as.

Voldemort--Pureblood Pretense & sequels linkffn(7613196) An AU where Tom Riddle becomes a politician instead of a dark lord. The fic does a great job of making Riddle sinister and dangerous without being an insane terrorist.

Ginny--The Changeling linkffn(6919395) One of my favorite fanfics, great exploration of Slytherin!Ginny

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

linkffn(Innocent by marauderlover7) does a really good job of fleshing out characters from the Marauders' era, even though it's set shortly before Harry starts Hogwarts. Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Gawain Robards, Marlene McKinnon.
