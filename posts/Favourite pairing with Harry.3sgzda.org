Title says it all.


** Rare pairings. I like seeing how the author gets Harry and X together, and all the conflicts that come with it. I don't really like clean-cut romances.

** Given how I've read so very many Harry/Ginny, Harry/Hermione, Harry/Fleur and Harry/Daphne stories I really appreciate a story that does something a little unusual. This is probably down to the fact that I'm getting pretty tired of canon-rehash-but-with-different-pairing stories.

If I see a story with a pairing like Harry/Padma or Harry/AlternateRealitySelf I will give it just a little more leeway than if it's the millionth Harry/Ginny story.

That's probably why I like crossovers, when I can find them. It makes me sad when I find a crossover that somehow still manages to be a canon rehash (An Elf from Middle earth goes to Hogwarts!). What a waste.

*** So much over-saturation, it's ridiculous. I checked on FFN, 31k+ stories of Hermione and 24k+ for Ginny. The search didn't specifically pair them, but it's likely the case for well over 2/3's.

Come on people, it's fanfiction! Do something /weird/!

*** Then you should like *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), a Harry/Bellatrix story.

I was very skeptical at start, but thought to give it a try based on 9000+ favorites. Now it has become one of my favorite HP fanfics. The story is creative, credible, funny, and contains tons of intrigues.

*** linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes) is a crossover with Firefy and has the beginnings of a pairing. You might enjoy it, but knowing Firefly universe will make the story a lot more enjoyable.

**** One of my favourite stories, hands down and I don't think that enjoyment is at all damaged by my complete lack of familiarity with Firefly.

Well, I didn't know Firefly when I read it, now I know Firefly purely through fanfiction. So, in other words, if Firefly is like the Harry Potter fandom, I still know nothing about Firefly.

*** Only in the fanfiction communities is that the case. If you go into the wider fandom, H/G shippers outnumber H/Hr by far. The only pairing actually giving H/G some competition is Drarry.

Of course, you can blame all of the fanfic!Hermione glorification for that.

** There's so much Harry/Hermione and Harry/Ginny over-saturation it's gotten dead boring. If you want to draw me into a story with that pairing, do it with the plot premise instead. I much prefer Harry/Luna or Harry/Pansy, much more entertaining.

Oddly enough, there are a scarce dozen or so fics of Harry/Katie. I would have thought that'd be a more popular pairing, even if she is practically a blank slate.
