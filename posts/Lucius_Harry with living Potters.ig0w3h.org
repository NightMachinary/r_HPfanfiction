:END:
I read this fic a couple years ago and now I'm trying to find it again. I don't remeber if it was on ao3 or ff.net. Any help is greatly appreciated!

Harry is living with Lily and James who don't listen to harry and enjoy the fame/party/society life they get from Harry. At a party he's drinking when Lucius comes across him and they end up starting a relationship.

I remember: 1) Harry is close with Sirius and Remus, Remus knows about Lucius. 2) James (when he finds out) is a class A jerk and hits harry when Harry says that he won't stop seeing Lucius.


** I wouldnt be very happy either if I found out my son was in a relationship with someone older than I was. Hitting's no no, though
