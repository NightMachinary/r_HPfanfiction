Hey,

Yeah, it's like this... ever since I started reading fanfictions I began to dislike 'Master Warden' Pomfrey and her bossy attitude. She is damn annoying most of the time - or just a mindless lacker of the GreaterGood!Dumbledore type.

Sometimes I just want to throw her out of a window into the Black Lake ^^


** No.

Fanfics will *never* affect my views of canon characters, although I may like or hate them based on particular settings.

*** Well The only character that has ever been affected by FanFiction for me, is Hermione. I disliked her in the books but god, do I hate it when she pops up in fics. I almost dropped prince of Slytherin when she began to feature more heavily.

** I can say that fic has made me love Pomfrey more. Most fics that involve her that I read show her to be a positive character, and a positive protector of Harry. Often she is shown as being more supportive of Harry than Dumbledore is.

** No, I always find Molly and Pomfrey hating/bashing to be immature

I remember fics where Lupin was always reminding Harry to not get in trouble... nobody cares

But replace it with Molly telling Harry to not get in trouble... all of a sudden there's tons of reviews talking about hating Molly and how annoying she is

*** Molly is so often portrayed as a love potioning maniac but the twins, who literally marketed and sold love potions to children, are generally considered the "good" Weasleys.

** That is the fault of poor writing or blatant character bashing, since few people characterize her as an actual person. In bad fanfiction, she is a caricature of a fussy woman who acts like a bitchy helicopter parent rather than the "medical professional who runs a tight ship" that she's supposed to be characterized as.

As you can see, the stereotyping & belittling of her character is a pet peeve of mine.

** I've seen a lot of mixed portrayals of her, and the most negative ones seem to be in bash fics which I try to avoid (though those often also contain mind-controlled/obliviated/blackmailed portrayals, so even then it's still mixed), so it hasn't affected my opinion too much.

In most cases she's just strict and a bit unfriendly, but outside of bash fics that's hardly a damning character trait.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

** I guess we have different tastes in fic, because I find her a lovely character in fic!

** She suffers from the same thing most of the "good" adults do. Their inaction in general in regard to Harry and deference to Dumbledore does not hold up to scrutiny.
