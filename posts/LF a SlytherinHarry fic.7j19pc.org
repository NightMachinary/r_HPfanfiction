The fic I'm looking for was a 10k+ oneshot. It was a wbwl fic, the whe parent surviving kind where Harry gets sorted into Slytherin and strikes up an odd friendship with Snape. I don't remember much on it. Anyone know a fic like this?

  Sequel to 'Mistaken Identity'. The Dunce Who Lived and his unfortunate brother have finally arrived at Hogwarts. Snape is both manipulative and placing bets. Not so oneshot.
