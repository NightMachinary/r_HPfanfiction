I just remember that for every new rule Umbridge made, the students (and teachers) would find a way to turn it around.

E.g. All detentions have to be approved by her - the teachers started giving detentions for everything.

Anyone know what it is?

Or something similar?


** I don't remember that exact one. I vaguely remember a good one where Umbridge made some rules about students having to know wizarding culture which effectively forced all the muggleborns out of Hogwarts, and one of them responded by brutally beating her to death with a bat transfigured from her blood quill.

***** No, it was one where Hermione was the leader of a guerilla. Divided and entwined I think.

****** Hmmm. I thought it was the one she got expelled during? I guess not being allowed to do newts is close enough and they're just flowing together at this point lol

Thank you, though :)
