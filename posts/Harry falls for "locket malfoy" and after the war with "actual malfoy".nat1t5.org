:END:
I read a fanfic a while ago that I can't find again. The things I remember are more or less: - Malfoy is the one that comes out of the locket - this happens before it opens and gets killed - locket malfoy can at some point "touch" harry - Harry falls in love with locket malfoy (even tho he's kind of an asshole) - Harry falls in love with the real malfoy post the war/during rebuilding of hogwarts

Hope that's enough to go by ðŸ˜Š
