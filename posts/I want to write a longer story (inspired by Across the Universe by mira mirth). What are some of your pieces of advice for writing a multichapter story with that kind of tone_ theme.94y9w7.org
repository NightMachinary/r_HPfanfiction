** write a shitty version that you can crank out quickly. no spell checking or small details.

then look at your shitty version across a few chapters. add some drama and other cool things then retcon them into the story somehow by adjusting previous chapters.

that's basically an outline. then use that outline to write the version you actually want people to read.

** Depending how inexperienced you are, you might be best writing a few one shots until you find your feet. If you are sure about writing something longer then if it's your first longer piece, I do suggest you plan it and write it before posting unless you don't mind joining the vast ranks of the unfinished and abandoned. A story doesn't need to be complicated but you do really need your character to have some aim and some conflict although fanfiction has lower expectations and gives you more leeway than original fiction.

As far as writing something with the same tone goes, overwrought angst in present tense without any injection of humour is amazingly easy to write and should hit the mark nicely.

Also, I'd never heard of that story before and was distinctly underwhelmed by it. Why is it so popular?

** Depending on your chapter size I'd say spread yourself out over a few days/weeks/months. Get all the relevant information you want in that chapter then spend time rewriting and edditing and adding. Like my chapters are around 3k-5k a chap now so i usually spend a week or two on a new chapter rewriting and expanding. Usually only between an hour or so a day writing. Also keeping a designated writing time helps loads. My writing time is kind of a therapeutic experience as well.

** Your biggest help would be "simple" plotting.

Write out the struggle you want and Harry's place in it. This seems like more of a character driven story, and I think by placing Harry in the position of a Healer and himself broken individual, you have a lot of space to move in.

Of course, in this first chapter you moved tremendously fast. You traverse months between his arrival in the new dimension and his first steps towards his family. If you keep this pace, you'll have a long plot on your hand.

In any case, writing out the chapters, what happens inthem, where the characters are (mentally, and physically) after them and what plotpoint they ought to deal with. Then revise until you're happy with it. Also a great help is to declare where characters start out from and where you want them to be at the end. Then think about what needs to happen for them to end up there.
