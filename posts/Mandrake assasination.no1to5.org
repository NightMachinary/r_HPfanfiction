So I was deleting old notes on my iCloud, when I came across one that just said:

“Adult mandrake scream in a howler”

And past me was brilliant, I think. Could this work? Is it the sound that mandrakes make that kills? Or do they have inherent magic that kills and just happen to scream too?

I'd love to see a fic where Harry rolls up to hogwarts with Voldemort's corpse and everyone is just like, “but he was so powerful, how did you out-duel him?” And Harry just kind of looks awkwardly around while scratching his cheek before saying, “well I, I just kinda mailed him a howler of an adult mandrakes scream.” Really awkwardly and that's it.

What other odd assassination methods could be used?

I remember one story where Harry just accioed Voldemort's wand, then his wand arm, then all of his limbs, before accioing the “dark torso” and then kept Voldemort in a trunk in the attic of grimmauld and let the twins test products on him, so anything is fair game really.


** A good solution would be cast some sort of stasis/sleep spell on the mandrake, stuff them into a soundproofed box then mail the box to the target and charm the box to wake up the mandrake when opened.

**** A good one from my DND days was wizards littering notes everywhere: "This note says Exploding Runes on it" and have it explode in the PC's face.

The downside is then you get one player who's super paranoid and starts casting detect magic on everyone. Ruins the fun.

I made the point of making an extremely dumb barbarian/druid who had an absolute mountain of hitpoints just /takes too long puny wizard me go/ charge through very obvious traps.

*** It's probably something similar to a Basilisk's gaze. Either the effect of a copy would be greatly reduced (only knocking people out rather than killing), or the Magic in the scream would prevent any copy to be created in the first place.

** The Mandrake scream is perhaps the thing that makes the least sense in the Harry Potter canon. A few issues:

1. They were used in the Battle of Hogwarts, but apparently had no effect whatsoever.

2. If Mandrakes are as dangerous as they are told to be, why aren't they ever used by terrorists as weapons of mass destruction? All it would take for a psychopathic serial killer to wipe out much of the population of wizarding Britain would be to throw Mandrakes on Diagon Alley during shopping hours.

3. If they are so dangerous, why are second-year students taught about them? Shouldn't they be killed to the brink of extinction and the only surviving ones be experimented in the Department of Mysteries?

The best thing to explain away these issues is that the danger of Mandrake scream is greatly exaggerated. One would have to scream right next to someone's ear for quite a long time to actually kill him. Covering one's ears with hands after the scream has already begun is enough to prevent the fatal effect. The danger is exaggerated because better safe than sorry.

*** Your 2nd point there was part of a fic where after Voldemort's defeat Umbridge went nuts and double down on the blood purist stuff and did exactly that.

Can't remember what fic it was though, I think it involved time travel but am not 100% on that.

** For assassination methods, I have a vague idea of Harry combining portkeys with knowledge gained from NOVA/PBS to send Voldemort to the grand staircase of the Titanic, the bottom of Challenger Deep or over the crater/lava of a Pacific Rim volcano.

**** Also Harry summoned turtles or some shit during an exam. Accio totally works on living things. No idea where fanon gets its ideas. Only reason it didn't work on Hagrid was probably because he was heavy as shit, and also half giant so he was resistant to the spell in the first place.

I'd like to cite here Basillisk v. Granger.

While the gaze of the Danger Noodle the Senior is supposed to deliver instant death to all who beheld it, it merely caused petrification to those who saw the eyes through something (camera, ghost), dealing some damage to the medium, or relfected (mirror, puddle) where no such damage occurs but the result is still petrification.

This would suggest that Mandrake Letters, if we assume them to be capable of storing and transmitting the death-bringing scream of a mandrake, would merely cause unconsciousness, as Prof. Sprout said was the case for young specimens.

I'd probably use the Floo, with aid of Polyjuice.

The fireplaces are registered, so it's possible to get someone's address with some snooping in the Ministry. Polyjuice Potion is just a precaution, in case the target returns as a ghost. Better safe than sorry. Just call the floo (as passwords and the like are fanon), and once someone is notified that they have a caller, withdraw your head and chuck in an AoE weapon of choice. As proved by Umbridge, while Ministry can monitor Floo, they have to set it up beforehand AND they have to actually catch someone manually once alerted. They do not have any records.

**** It would work, yes, though I prefer my ordinance a bit more disposable. Mandrakes are not commonly grown, after all, so it would be easier to indentify the cause of death and possible try to find me.

But Neville Longbottom brand potions, Fiendfyre-in-a-bottle, conjured plastic explosives, a frag grenade sprayed with bassilisk venom....

Anything that will not keep it's form after it goes off. If I'm lucky, there will be too much of a mess to conclude anything. If I'm really lucky, House Elves will clean up the mess before the Aurors arrive.

** I forget which fic it was, but I remember one where the DMLE were baffled at a series of killings, all of which left the body or bodies unmarked and with the only evidence being the remains of a Howler. Harry was killing off Death Eaters by sending them Howlers of a Mandrake's scream.

** I would use alohomora on them. Hopefully it would unlock any valves in them. I could choke them on scrougify, etc. I would personally go out of my way to only use household/basic spells. Like I wouldn't use the killing curse. I would use accio or wingardium leviosa to smack them with something heavy.

So when they check my wand they can't prove I wasn't just cleaning or cooking.
