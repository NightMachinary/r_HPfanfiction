*** The first chapter is fun in a cracky sort of way but it gets rough really quickly in the second chapter. Harry identifying as an american doesn't feel right either.

When Ilvermorny arrives at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore is shocked to see the long-thought-dead Harry and Lily Potter appear, as well as the missing Sirius Black and Remus Lupin.

** I'd prefer something set at Salem Academy, I don't care if Ilvermorny is canon, the name is too weird imo and a school in Salem just makes sense.

Or Charmbridge Academy. I'm assuming at least some AQ fanfiction exists, are there any known good ones?
