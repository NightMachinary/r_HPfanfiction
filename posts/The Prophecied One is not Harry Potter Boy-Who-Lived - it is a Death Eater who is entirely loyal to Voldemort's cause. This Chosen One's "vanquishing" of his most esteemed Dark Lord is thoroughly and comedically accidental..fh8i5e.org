Prophecies are supposed to be vague. I love the idea of Harry yes being the Boy-Who-Lived but no not being The Chosen One. Everyone assumes, from the wording, that The Chosen One will naturally be opposed to the Dark Lord and vice versa. But what if that simply isn't true? "Neither can live while the other survives" does not /have/ to mean that they will hate each other. (I mean... just look at the number of HP/TR slash fics that are out there....)

Dumbledore up and assuming that Harry is The Chosen One because he is The Boy-Who-Lived is understandable... but being 100% correct in that assumption? It's too easy. And easy is boring. Which is why I love (and prompt) twisting the prophecy's interpretation to be less obvious than it was canonically.

"As the Seventh Month Dies" not meaning the Gregorian Calendar ordering of months (July); The Prophecied Dark Lord NOT pertaining to Voldemort, but to another budding Dark Lord who is a Neutral in Voldy/Dumbly's extremely conspicuous war; or this: Voldemort being the Prophecied Dark Lord, but his Prophecied Vanquisher being someone who is a willing (if clumsy) servant because he truly, deeply believes in Voldemort and Voldy's destructive cause. A devout Death Eater who has parents who thrice defied and got Crucio'd for their sass, but are alive and kicking. No-one would ever suspect that two people aligned under one banner would be the Prophecied Ones. ...Which is precisely why I am suggesting it.


** I love it! "A power he knows not" can utilize the ambiguity of the pronoun to mean the chosen one doesn't know his power.

** Why would Lord Voldemort mark a Death Eater as his equal?

*** Equal at wizard chess? I mean, the Canon version plays a little fast and loose with the "marked as his equal" too.

**** No it doesn't. Voldemort marks Harry with a piece of his own soul. Literally his equal.

***** Like nagini?

EDIT: This could actually work as a very minor alteration to canon. Voldemort accidentally made Harry a Horcrux based on the murder of Lily. Instead of Harry getting the scarcrux, Death-Eater-chosen-one was around when he killed someone else and got some Horcrux ricochet.
