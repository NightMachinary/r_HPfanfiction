For if you are sick of slow-burns and want to start time travel with a bang:

- The first scene is a blinding light and an odd, weightless feeling before Harry slowly fades back into consciousness. He is in a bed, feeling slightly befuddled, so he concludes "Hospital Wing". He realises that he isn't alone in the bed as someone is on top of him, kissing him and, as his awareness grows, there are more realisations. Both Harry and the mysterious partner are naked and having sex. You can go into as much detail as you want to here, or keep things T rated.

- Harry concludes that this has to be just a dream, the side effects of some healing potion. However, this vivid dream is feeling bloody awesome, definitely the best experience he had so far, so he decides to enjoy it while it lasts. It's dark and his partner is just a shadow, so he can't tell who is on top of him.

- If you are writing M rated, feel free to go into more detail and have that "dream" last more than one round. Don't just write the anatomical details, include the other senses (especially hearing smell and taste). It's dark, so Harry wouldn't see every small detail. Just keep names out of it.

- The second scene/chapter begins with Harry waking up again, feeling worn out and yet extremely happy. He notices the scent from his dream and thinks back to that vivid memory. There's a radio playing in the background and the news come on. The Moderator mentions something that makes it clear that this isn't Harry's time (BBC 1 mentions the Soviet Union, the magical wireless talks about some long-gone Minister).

- Harry's eyes shoot open at that, taking in the room, which is illuminated by the morning sun. His sight fall on the naked woman draped over his side, slowly taking in her appearance before arriving at her heads, their eyes locking.

- Just as Harry recognises her, she says "You aren't James"

  :END:

- Harry tells his partner the truth to the best of his knowledge. They might choose to keep it a secret to anyone else, but there are no secrets between them. If you choose Lily, disclose their interdimensional family connection

- Harry does NOT replace James. They both exist in that timeline.

- Ditch the canon timeline. Harry being in the past renders it moot anyway.

- Harry should be shipped with the woman he woke up with. Throw in a Third if you really have to (include her in the first scene then). If you really want to write a triad, then make it an actual triad and not just two hot chicks and Harry. Easiest here would actually be dropping Harry into Andromeda/Edward, if that's your cup of tea.

- Harry shouldn't be too strong. He and the woman must work together to defeat Voldemort. They are both skilled on their own, but not "defeat Voldemort while slurping cocktails" strong.

- Don't drop him into a firmly established relationship as the replacement for one partner. Seriously that would lead to so many conflicts that you'd have to waste 200k words just to sort that mess out. Similarly, Harry shouldn't be in a relationship in the original timeline, otherwise you will have to deal with that.

This prompt can be used to pair Harry with any woman of your choosing, even if the obvious choice is Lily. Other options: Harry/Bellatrix, Harry/Narcissa, Harry/Lily's OC friend. Harry/Andromeda/Edward if you really want a triad (or Harry/Lily/Bellatrix if you want to go with Harry joining a forbidden relationship and add another layer of scandal). Of course, you can pick any background character you want, from Professor Sprout to Hestia Jones.


** Oh shit, I went way overboard with this. I just wanted to write a quick drabble, because I had an idea, but it kept going and going.

Anyway, here's what I have. Just a quick disclaimer: I'm playing fast and loose with the timeline. Narcissa is James' age here and I'm willing to change whatever else in canon I don't like (certainly not epilogue or Pottermore compliant). Also featuring a part-time "James Bond" Harry Potter.

I only used your prompt as a rough guideline, so apologies if it isn't exactly what you had in mind. It's very likely that I'm not going to continue this after Chapter 1.

Oh and don't hate me for my depiction of Luna.

***** Through the democratic process and populism? There are elections for Minister, so maybe turn the whole thing into a political intrigue. Between Narcissa and Andromeda, there should be enough political brains to come up with something. Fake some backstory about growing up on the continent after his parents were killed, have Harry stop a couple of Death Eater raids and begin a political campaign from there, never openly attacking Dumbledore to fly under his radar until it's too late.

****** I was certainly thinking to ursurp the Blacks with the help of Narcissa, Andromeda and Sirius.

I'm just not sure you can plausibly prevent Dumbledore from constantly sticking his nose into it. He's a bit too clever and much too stubborn to be easily distracted by some politicking (as some fanfics tend to do it). What to do about the prophecy? It might very well be different. It might very well be possible that fate conspires against our Heroes in so far as that Dumbledore+Snape are always supposed to be the recipient of a prophecy. And there's possibly a different boy/girl-who-lived involved ;) I've dropped some anvil sized hints for that, but wasn't sure yet about going that way.

Of course my disillusioned Harry doesn't give a shit about any prophecy, but Voldemort, Snape and Dumbledore might act upon it and gain information.

Harry's secret could probably just be hidden under a Fidelius. Relatively straight forward. That wasn't my biggest concern anyway. Time travelers are rare, but existed before in their world and Dumbledore has no idea that the name Harry Potter is somehow important.

******* You are making things unnecessarily complicated. Simply claim that Narcissa ran away with a random muggleborn like her sister. They get some faked credentials for Harry and there's not too much to look into for Dumbledore. Narcissa merely followed in her sister's footsteps. Harry gets into a bout with some Death Eaters and then uses that as a pretense to get into politics, to "make the world a better place for his daughter" or something like that. Since a lot of his policies align with Dumbledore's, there's no reason for concern about the new man on the fringe of his party.

I don't think he's going to accept being sidelined (and that's certainly what Harry would want to do).

He'd (Dumbledore) also be not so fond of Harry trying to shut down the Order of the Phoenix, which my Harry would want to do (whether openly or covertly). Harry's a war veteran and he's not looking too fondly at a completely ineffective debate club that occasionally gets its own people killed.

********* He could run as independent and build enough street cred to be elected and make a name for himself as independent politician, which would give him a convenient excuse to stay out of the Order. I'm thinking long con here. Harry arrives ~75, the child is born ~76 while Harry slowly earns his reputation. In late 79 there's a government crisis and Harry runs for Minister, reveals that he is Lord Peverell (or whatever you choose), suddenly making him an attractive option for the pureblood elite dissatisfied with the status quo on both sides. The guy who Dumbledore believed a well meaning nobody with the occasional radical stance suddenly is dangerously close to winning the vote for Minister and possibly creating a minority cabinet (is that the English term?). At that time it's too late for radical measures since the freshly revealed Lord Peverell is in the public spotlight and any random arrest would be a death sentence for the party behind it.

Harry wouldn't be Machiavelli, but "man of the people" works surprisingly well. And it wouldn't even be far fetched for him to put up with all that crap for his daughter. The mind behind him are Andromeda and Narcissa, Edward writes the speeches (and Bellatrix takes care of some opponents if you want her in). Maybe a couple of older purebloods he picked up at some point of his campaign as advisors.

********** Those are some great ideas. Though personally I wouldn't want to make it too much about politics. It wouldn't really fall in line what I had in mind with Harry's character: He kinda failed at politics (you wanted Harry and his partner to be equally strong, politics would be Narcissas forte) and became a James Bond type (as opposed to Snape-type) spy, less subterfuge, more action hero and milking high society people for information by getting them sloshed; just the broad strokes. Also the main themes would have been "Family" (something that Harry has been denied time and time again) and "building from scratch" instead of "fixing" (like, "the Aurors or the Order just need to start killing DEs and then they will succeed" style of fixing... it's boring and unoriginal, just changing the color of the spells from light to dark or whatever).

I wasn't even sure I'd have him involved with the Ministry at all. Him maybe seeing them more as a lost cause than even Dumbledore. Harry might want to create an actually effective resistance movement, but I'd have to do some more resource on how successful resistance cells actually operate (I don't think like Dumbledore's Order, more like a Hydra). The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor][Bus Factor]] for Dumbledore's Order is terrible.

But something that became apparent from your comment is the huge span of time that would need to be covered. I don't like rapid fire style listing of facts (in some kind of slideshow over the years), so there'd almost certainly be some kind of time skip involved, which IMHO are incredibly hard to pull off.

*********** That's why politics would be a good theme for that kind of outline. You focus on one or two events and sum the rest up with "Harry went places, gave speeches and kicked arse." Don't do huge time skips but have chapters which cover some important events and then the next one is another important thing a couple of months later, briefly outlining the consequences of event A.

But I really like your James Bond style suggestion, maybe combine it with the politics so that Harry has that High society cover (without revealing his Lordship, just a simple rising star) but then he excuses himself and pulls some Mafia stuff with Bellatrix as "Face" of the criminal side of things and he is pretending to be an unimportant underling/her bodyguard. Each chapter then ends with a family moment, like Harry and Bella returning from some "business", their clothes smelling of gasoline or covered in fresh concrete and they play with the kids, have a family night with board games or Harry and Narcissa go on a double date with Andromeda and Edward.

*** I guess it really depends on how that explanation went down and what backstory the author chooses. If she finally succumbed to James advances?

#+begin_quote
  Nope, shitshow waiting to happen.
#+end_quote

But if she still sees James as a git (6th year easter holidays for example), just had a bad fight with Petunia and then snuck away to some random bar/club with a fake ID (nothing a little transfiguration won't fix) with the intention to just forget everything? She met that mysterious stranger and they ended up having sex in a hotel room somewhere in London. Lily has absolutely no attachment to Harry at that point, besides maybe a slight dislike for his resemblance of James' looks, and is quite happy that her mystery man did not turn out to be her school "nemesis".

And then there are countless other ways this could go down, from mommy-kink up to getting payback at James for being an annoyance for years.

*** I see a couple of ways this would go down:

- Edward died and Andromeda is a single mother disgraced in the eyes of her family only for Harry to show up and cause mayhem from there on (That is actually the first time I would enjoy a Lord Peverell/Gryffindor plot-twist). Throw in little Nymphadora for extra cuteness

- Harry meets an Andromeda before the whole "marrying a Muggleborn business". Black family stuff follows, maybe stopping Bellatrix decent into madness.

- The aforementioned "Harry joins an existing relationship as a third member". Not really my cup of tea but considering the other guys you could ship Harry with, Edward is maybe even the best option.

- Harry takes over Edwards body while he and Andromeda weren't getting along yet (maybe he just learned that he had knocked up his hot one-night-stand and done a Lupin).

** This could probably just be condensed down to "When Harry arrives in the past where he is immediately mistaken for James, there are consequences."

That opens up some more options like:

- Harry is immediately attacked by someone James pranked.
- Harry's grandparents visit him in the hospital because the doctors mistook his identity when someone found him unconscious.
- James see's Harry and assumes he's Snape messing around with polyjuice.
- Harry gets runs into a teacher and is immediately hauled into detention for because something James did.
