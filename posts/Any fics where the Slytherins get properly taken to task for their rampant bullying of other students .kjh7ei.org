** I think that once you ask 'Why are Slytherins not being held to account' it is also inevitable to ask 'Why are all Slytherins evil' so the fanfics that would be most likely to take them to task for it, are also the ones that have a bit more nuance to the overall portrayal of Slytherins, who are no longer JUST bullies and not all of them engage in it to begin with.

That's not universally the case, of course, but I find that both of these things are addressed simultaneously, so it can be difficult to find the fanfics that do what you ask for.

*** Why? Calling others slurs irl /should/ be punished.

Or do you think Draco calling others mudblood is cool? Do you like people using the n word?
