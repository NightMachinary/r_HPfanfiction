"So this 'Concorde' is ten times faster than a firebolt, and we're supposed to believe that?"


** Hermione frowned and adjusted the radio. She made a habit of listening to the Muggle news, not just because of her parentage, but because the Ministry had been inexcusably ignorant of Muggle affairs for far too long. It wasn't that the non-magical world was catching up - Muggle technology had surpassed magic decades ago. Keeping a careful watch was the only way to maintain the Statute of Secrecy.

"Severe disruption continues at Gatwick airport," the newsreader continued. "With the authorities suggesting that a drone may be responsible..."

"MUUUUM!!!" screamed Hugo from the hall. "Albus and I want to go play Quidditch, but I can't find the Snitch!"

--------------

Moments later, an explosion of green fire lit up the fireplace of the British Prime Minister's office.

"Okay, it's like this, Mrs May!" Hermione began through gritted teeth.

** Ron looked around at this place that the professor calls an “airport”. People were hustling and bustling about, with weird boxes with wheels on them. Ron cocked his head to the side when he heard a weird nose outside this large window. He pressed his nose closely against the glass when he had heard this weird thing with wings leaving the ground.

He turned around and pointed,” Professor, what's that weird thingy in the sky?!”

**** Yes it was, very fun to read and extremely refreshing. It took the premise and fulfilled in a way that was so unique it might have even been, dare I say it, original.

  Just Suppose Harry hadn't heeded his godfather's advice, and actually lost his temper at his trial? Time travel fic and title is 'Back to the Future' joke.
