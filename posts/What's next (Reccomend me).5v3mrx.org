For someone who has watched all the movies out of order (was horrified about sirius's death), and only 3/7 books also out of order, I've read a /huge/ amount of fanfic.

 

My favourite fanfics are usually time travel, slytherin!harry/gryffindor!draco, draco harry being friends, golden trio fics, fics where sirius stays alive. I've read one dark Harry fic, don't particularly enjoy dark!harry. Absolutely dislike dumbledore bashing fics. Hate crossovers or vampire!harry that sort of stuff. I guess I'm quite a picky reader tbh. Not too keen on Drarry or Harmony but don't mind. I read a lot of "this story through this character's eyes" and don't particularly care for those either.

 

Any recommendations for fanfic? Something new? I feel like there's nothing left to read although I know it's not the case.


** Honestly I'd recommend reading the books you haven't read. Unless I misunderstood you have only read 3 of them and I'm sure many people would agree when I say the movies aren't a good substitute. While I often wish that I'd never touched book 7 and maybe 6 you really should read them all even if just to understand where certain things in fanfiction come from. They're not the greatest pieces of literature ever written by any means but the story telling and the world building is why we stick around. I can't help but feel you might be missing details that elevate certain aspects of some fanfics.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447/1/Amalgum-Lockhart-s-Folly][Amalgum -- Lockhart's Folly]], linkffn(11913447), has just been finished. It involves a time-traveling Harry who mistakenly merged with Lockhart. Pretty fun fic.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

*** Lockhart!Harry seems to have a deep seated hatred for Ron. I've read why, about him talking about Horcruxes in a restraunt, but I feel like Lockhart!Harry would have tried to make Ron better considering he travels several years back. Of course Harry could have become way more cold blooded and manipulative, and having amoral Lockhart in his head probably doesn't help.

Maybe what drives me wrong is the thing where if someone did it in the future that means they should be punished for it. Like should you kill Tom Riddle so he never goes to Hogwarts? Yes. Is there a better way? Definitely.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
