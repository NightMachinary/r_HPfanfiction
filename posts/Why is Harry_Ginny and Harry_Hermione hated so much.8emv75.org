** I hate Harry/Daphne. Just be honest and say Harry/Slytherin!OC.

Also Ginny is not at all described as plain looking.

** My takes:

1) Too many H/G and H/Hr fics are out there already

2) Fleur is an interesting character and under appreciated. But whenever she gets paired with Harry, she basically becomes a bland male sex fantasy object. I'm still waiting for the first H/Fleur fic that does her character justice.

3) People are already starting to get tired of Daphne, and her Ice Queen version is hated on this sub.

4) H/G and H/Hr shippers often hate each other, adding further to the impression that people actually hate both pairings.

*** I'll forwarn with saying it's been a bit since I read it and thus might be remembering it's quality wrong, but linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) has Harry/Fleur that I felt did it justice.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** There is /nothing/ universal about Harry Potter fanfiction, except perhaps that everyone hates Dolores Umbridge, and I bet there are even some exceptions to that.

** 1. Ginny is not developed in canon and most authors don't make her interesting. Punk or Rebel Ginny would be a joy to read, but let's make her the generic Quidditch girl instead. Also Ginny usually comes with the Happy Weasley family and Ron/Hermione. Which turns off a lot of people, myself included.

2. Hermione is usually very far from her canon description. The girl was downright vicious to the point where she led Umbridge in a gang rape, but let's make her a sucker for the rules instead. And also, let's make them both ridiculously hot and well "equipped", because that's what people are in porn... wait, weren't we supposed to write a story about average looking people?

3. Fleur is the second most attractive person in the entire series (nuff said)

4. Daphne is a pureblood blank page, so you can write +her any way you want+ subtle undertones that pureblood supremacy had a point and the Nazis weren't evil after all.

5. Harry/Hermione and Harry/Ginny stories usually are either canon rehashes or an edgy bash/wank fest, so the plots are rather boring as a result.

Really though. Ginny has all these overprotective family members and a domineering mother. You'd expect her to want some distance as she grows older and not be defined through being a Weasley all the time. Instead in H/G fics it's Weasleys everywhere and all the time. The Granger parents are already pretty bad in H/Hr fics and way too much, but the way the world revolves around the burrow in H/G is just... ugh.

**** Tonks. Given her abilities, she can become a carbon copy of Fleur, but she can also become so much more. And her personality seems more attractive (happy and mischievious vs Fleur's icy).

***** Her death is the true tragedy of DH (next to Hedwig's death maybe). Having another orphaned child that will never know his parents really makes one ask: "Maybe everyone could have done better for them?!"

** 1) H/G and H/H both can be successful but they are prolific in the community. There are a lot of stories written with those pairings in part because they are easy parings to put into any generic story where you want harry to be with someone. Because of this they are often tacked onto plots as an afterthought, and it creates lots of stories that involve these relationships and them poorly, or only using really common tropes, when they could have just eschewed the whole pairing and had a single harry story that was just as strong.

2) Daphne and Fleur offer what Ginny and Hermione don't, that is to say semi-developed characters that have canon plot relevance and can be realistically transformed and developed by the author without ever feeling out of place like Original Characters. They like Susan Bones, Hannah Abbot, Tracy Davis, Terry Boot, or any other named "background character" offer just enough of a connection to canon that a average author can take them and make them into almost whatever the author wants without it feeling bad or wrong. Hermione and Ginny don't offer the same level of room to play with.
