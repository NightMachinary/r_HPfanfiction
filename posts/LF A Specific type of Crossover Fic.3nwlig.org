Specifically, one where a powerful Harry visits another fandom after canon/near-canon. Ex: !linkffn(8177168,8148717,10951863)


** Pretty much everything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4019839/cywscross][cywscross]] is awesome, but the ones that meet your criteria are linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8518164/1/Raison-d-%C3%8Atre]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8654155/3/Find-Me-a-White-Knight-Cloaked-in-Black]]).

Also good are linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8310486/1/Crestfallen]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8410168/1/Steve-And-The-Barkeep]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8208936/1/Wanderer]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8145794/1/Chance-Encounters]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8212843/1/I-See-The-Moon]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7145519/1/Uchiha-Fukurou]])

Yes, I'm a fan of crossovers. Havoc Side of the Force requires immediate reading if not already read.

Fair warning, though, some of these are likely abandoned. Specifically, Uchiha Fukurou (a guilty pleasure of mine), Wanderer, I See the Moon, and possibly cywscross' stuff

EDIT: Wow, didn't notice how many of these were Avengers crosses.

#+begin_quote
  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

  A few weeks after Reborn arrives in Namimori and Tsuna's life is turned upside-down, a young man with ancient eyes and an easygoing smile wanders into town as well. And all of a sudden, everything changes, another path is laid out, and what little sense left in Tsuna's world promptly flies out the proverbial window.

  Life's a lot easier when no one knows you and your only worry is whether or not people in each world speak the same languages you do. Harry can attest to it; he's been jumping for years. He knows how to keep his head down and not get invested. On hindsight, with his track record, Harry supposed it was only a matter of time until he did exactly that.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  When the civilians need something made or fixed in a hurry, they all know to go to the green-eyed foreigner. So it stands to reason that, sooner or later, ninjas would come knocking as well. Insanity ensues -- they're messing with a Marauder after all. But mostly, Hiei just wishes they would all leave him alone. HIATUS.
