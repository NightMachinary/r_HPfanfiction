I started reading HP fics fairly recently, but Ive loved the series for years. So far I've read HPMOR and a good few time-travel fics.

I'm looking for canon-divergence, either before or during hogwarts, fics that are long; 100k+ but the longer the better.

I want to avoid shipping/romance. I don't mind background stuff, or side plots, but it shouldn't be the focus or a driving force in the plot.

I'm partial to Harry-centric fics, but I dont care that much. I also really like Tonks and Moody, so it's a bonus if theyre prominent characters but it's not necessary.


** Unfortunately, some of the best canon divergent fics are less than 100k words:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540013/1/Benefits-of-old-laws][Benefits of Old Laws]], linkffn(11540013), is 879k words long! Here, Voldemort regains his sanity after his resurrections and decides to have a fresh start.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), diverges from canon after Year 4 and has 643k words. It has some shipping, but it's mostly a dark war epic. The good guys are giving no quarter in this fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]], linkffn(12614436), takes on a different path well before Hogwarts. This Hermione is adorably dark. Not long, but no shipping at all.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978), UK military and allied wizards shot up Death Eaters, Umbridge Ministry, and Voldemort after Scrimgeour was murdered. The Trio only needs to pitch in with the Horcrux hunt.

Dumbledore takes the Basilisk more seriously in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467), and solves most canon plot with Amelia Bones. It's a short, but very entertaining fic.

After Dumbledore was murdered, Grindelwald breaks out to avenge him in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929). He and Harry join forces and international complications soon follow.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), diverges after Bill and Fleur's wedding. Things went very badly for them. In December 1999, very badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are throwing into a new dimension where things have gone very differently. No shipping, but I'm rooting for Harry and Hermione.

Gilderoy Lockhart found and raised Harry in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]], linkffn(6635363). As a result, Harry becomes a cunning memory charm specialist. He is sorted into Slytherin, and the first year already turns out very differently.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love.

True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

** Amicus Protectio Fortis - linkffn(11547735) - First fic that came to mind. A good canon divergent fic. Any shipping would be having to read between the lines so you won't have to worry about that in this story. Otherwise, it's a great story filled with interesting characters.

Crafting Magic - linkffn(13256217) - It's only about 70k words but this is a complete story. It's another good story with Harry being artsier. Again no shipping.

** Here's some more stuff you might like.

*Pureblood Pretense series:* AU where Tom Riddle became a leading conservative Wizarding politician instead of the Dark Lord. The worldbuilding and magic in this fic is incredible. Features a fem!Harry that's pretty much her own character.

*Victoria Potter:* A more tightly bound, refined Wizarding World, and a fem!Harry in Slytherin. My favorite in-progress fic.

*Forest of Valbone:* Twelve-year-old Harry steals the Sorting Hat and the Ford Anglia and goes on a rampage through Wizarding Albania. A magnificently written dreamscape followed by a violent revenge fantasy. Great completed fic.

*The Phoenix and the Serpent:* Written before OOTP was released, a really good AU featuring a mentor-figure Dumbledore, believably AU magic, and some great characterization. Incomplete but ends tolerably.

** This one is not Harry centric, but it's one of the better left of canon stories without too much shipping linkffn(The Arithmancer) it has the benefit of being completed.

This one is fits the bill, but the sequel will likely never be published linkffn(the lie I've lived by jbern) I haven't read it in a long time, so I don't remember how much shipping is in it, but I know it is mainly driven by the plot.

If you have just gotten into Harry Potter fanfiction I would recommend linkffn(Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord). It is old and was published before a lot of it's plot devices became tropes, but it still had many unique elements that help it stand the test of time. For the longest time this was my all time favorite.

**** Sequel will never be published? Not sure what you mean, the sequel (lady archimedes) and the third book (Annals of Arithmancy) are both on the author's stories page.
