Never have I ever seen a competent Gilderoy Lockhart. Imagine how totally BADASS he would be if all of his stories were real experiences that he had been a part of.

It's a long shot, but are there any good stories about a badass, legit-shit Lockhart?


** Like a Redheaded Stepchild linkffn(12382425) has a competent (and hilarious) Lockhart. The author also wrote another fic that focuses on the Lockhart from that story.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** I know of one, but can't remember the name!

Lockhart was a complete fraud, and accidentally(?) got obliviated before 2nd year. When he woke up and learned he was supposed to be the defense teacher that year, he studied and trained to make himself competent. Unfortunately I don't remember anything else about it off the top my head.

Hopefully someone here will remember the story and provide a title.

** linkffn(6473434) sort of fits. Gilderoy trains Harry, Ginny, and Luna. It is a decent read but doesn't focus a lot on Lockhart, more on Harry. Lockhart was an unspeakable.

** There's one that's pretty good. I think it's called magical me? Get's posted here occasional. There's also a few other stories that have him being like a former unspeakable and stuff like that, but I'm not sure that's quite what you're looking for.

I'll update with the proper link if the bot doesn't grab the right story - the title is pretty simple. I'm on mobile so I can't look for it right now.
