Why does this fic leave me irritated? I sort of read a few chapters a long time ago, years ago I think. But I left it and eventually ignored it because Harry seemed weak in character and the type to look for comfort and guidance wherever he could find it. Am I right? Or am I just imagining things? Is Harry powerful, and intelligent, or is he just another kid out of place and not a bit of wit in him to guide him in life? And more importantly, is this harem? Because in the summary it says Harry is shipped with Parvati, Bella and Ginny.

** Depends on which point you left the fic. Yes he seeks guidance in developing an ability he doesn't want and to go home. He also helps his Mirror out... they help each other. I've just finished the second last chapter before my epiloque, he's become more mature than canon Harry, but that's imo.

It's not harem at all. I just added the ships in the disclaimer in case ppl get offended midway through by AU Harry's past flings, crushes, girlfriends etc.

** I've only read the half that's on ao3 and from memory it's the other Harry who's in these pairings. Although I honestly don't remember Parvati being in it.
