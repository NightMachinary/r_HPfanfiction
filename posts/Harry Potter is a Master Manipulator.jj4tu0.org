Just an idea that popped into my head.

Harry is a master manipulator, the real dark lord in the shadows. He arranged the meeting with the Weasleys so he would have a guide to the wizarding world. He arranged Troll in the bathroom incident in order to befriend Hermione after Ron did not turn out to be a promising right hand man. Events of the fourth and fifth book were part of his plan to gain public support. He places the compulsion on the Gaunt ring so dumbledore would not get in his way. He planted the plan with Snape into Dumbledores head in order to inherit the elder wand so he would become the master of death. He manipulates everything so Hermione becomes the minister of magic and molds the wizarding britain in accordance with his ideals.

** *The Rise of a Dark Lord* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2240236/Little-Miss-Xanda][Little.Miss.Xanda]]

Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

** Harry! snarled in anger his plan to turn ronald weasley into his general had failed. He should have been more careful about ron's insecurities. he should have known entering the triwizard tournament would set them off.

Harry chuckled and smiled to himself. all was not yet lost he would just have to guide ron back to the right path. he will buy ronald a nice broom and a ton of muggle books on chess and act like he is apologetic for not helping ron enter the tournament.

*** He learns of Weasleys from his history books and arranges events to happen in a certain way through a henchman he hired from knockturn alley with gold from his vault so Weasleys are late to Hogwarts Express and have to come through the Muggle way.

He specifically targets Weasleys because they are the only wizarding family who would help a student solely through the good of their heart.

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years

** Ok I really like this idea...but the benefit of getting Dobby, Hedwig and Sirius killed? Plus the bad press of being a Horcrux/Parslemouth? How would you explain those? I love the idea, just getting into logistics here lol

*** Allow me to explain in detail, after meeting the Wealslys Harry antagonizes Malfoy because the Malfoys are viewed as a dark family. This also has the benefit of strengthening his camaraderie with Ron. The troll incident was instigated so Harry could gain a more suitable right hand. The fiasco with Quirrell was so that Harry could secretly gain the sorcerer's stone for him self, he left broken shards of red glass on the ground and stunned himself. Harry defeats Voldemort for the second time and kills off his competetors for immortality. In second year Harry is influencing Tom(Ginny) to do the attacks, he releases the fact that he is a parselmouth so that others think that he is the one attacking the students, this will make a greater impact when he 'captures the culprit'. He has Colin Creevey petrified because the foolish mudblood caught Harry while he was instructing Tom(read Ginny). Harry destroys Colin's camera and obliviates him of the incident. Harry then kills the basilisk with a fake sword made to look like Gryffindor's. In his third year Harry modifies Lumos in order to create a fake Patronus, it was the only magic beyond his wretched soul. Harry frees the 'innocent' Sirius so that Dumbledore, and by extension the Order, would believe that he is on the side of justice. In reality Sirius and Peter worked together to kill the Potters, theynthought that the family's fortune would be left to them, when Harry survived, Peter blamed everything on Sirius and faked his death. Fourth year was just for publicity, even aspirating dark lords need a little fame. In his fifth year Harry places Umbridge in the school so that his potential future enemies would not be properly trained. The DA was meant to be a secret militia but Harry grew bored with the idea and began teaching them fake spells, with the aid of the ROR he made the students believe that they were actually learning. It was that year he learned of Sirius' betrayal, along with having him killed Harry revealed the continued existence of his competitor. In Harry's sixth year Dumbledore(the old fool) finally outlived his usefullness, Harry planted his plan with Snape, and had the Headnaster killed. The Horcruxes were never a problem, Harry destroyed each of them in his fifth year when he stumbled upon the diadem in the ROR. The entire Horcrux hunt in his seventh year was simply a cover for Harry's secret search of the Lively Hallows, artifacts created by Life as a counter balance to the Deathly Hallows created by death. Ron leaving him was not a part of the plan, Harry always knew the boy was disloyal. Once Ron arrived back home he found a stash of candies left to him by Harry, shortly after eating one of the Loyalty potion laced confectionaries Ron returned to his rightful Lord and Master, Harry. Days later Dobby discovered Harry's secret army of house elves! Needles to say, Dobby was killed by Harry's enchanted knife. Once Harry collected all three Lively Hallows, he made his way to Hogwarts where Harry killed his rival and obtained a position of unbeatable political power, onwards Harry influeces Hermione i to becoming minister and slowly shape the British Wizarding world into his own image.

​

​

...

​

​

But wait, there's more!

Harry also collected the Deathly Hallows before the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry is the Master of Life and Death! While Hermoine reshapes Magical Britain, Harry and his sidekick Ron travel the the ICW where Harry reveals his mantles of power, after a breif duel to the death with the Sumpreme Mugwump and a few (read several) changes to the Global magical accords, Harry becomes the ruler of all magical societies in the world.

​

Just in case no one noticed I borrowed a few ideas from the creative redditors that posted before me.

**** Holy shit. I'm impressed and scared lol. How is he keeping Hermione in line? Is she actually as crazy as Bellatrix but way smarter? Is Harry seducing her to keep her in line? Was SPEW a front for recruitment for his House Elf Army? I actually like the idea that Dobby is as twisted as Harry. He got beat too many times in the head and is fanatically loyal to Harry. His death was upsetting because he was the General of the House Elf Army and was killed by Bellatrix which is why Harry arranged for her to be killed rather than converted.

***** I applaud you my friend. In regards to Hermione all three are true but he was also bribing her with the Library of Alexandria which her fully resorted and refurbished during his free period in first year. Your idea for Dobby is probably better lol.
