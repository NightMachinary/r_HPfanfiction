** I use [[http://calibre-ebook.com/][calibre]] to organize and tag mine, and it automatically organizes the files (though you can turn that option off if you like how you've got them organized already).

*** Seconding calibre. I use the plugin called FanFiction downloader ([[http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=163261][www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=163261]]) which can download all the tags and metadata when you download the fic. It then can update the fics when the story updates so you can keep your collection up to date on devices. It really makes the library so easy and has a great search feature, I love it.
