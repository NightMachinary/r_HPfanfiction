The students would learn about these dangerous creatures, and how to handle them, in a semi-controlled environment, and then be able to take that and use it in the field.

Or just be used as a short term consultant to handle dangerous field missions that he can handle as a half-giant.

NEWT doesn't mean much, it just means that you're ready to start getting specialized. For example, NEWT DADA students aren't full on aurors ready to deal with dark wizards.

If a student doesn't already have solid experience dealing with a creature, Hagrid should not be supervising them.

******* By the time they're in NEWT level classes, they should be able to handle themselves with low- and mid-tier creatures. He shouldn't be bringing in a dragon, for example, but less dangerous creatures should be fine. A similar situation for NEWT DADA wouldn't be fighting dark wizards, it would be being able to have more freedom in choosing what to learn and the ability for independent study guided by the professor as needed, less of a traditional classroom setting, and probably more freedom to supervised dueling.

Regardless of all of this, Hagrid still wouldn't make sense as a teacher. They'd still need someone to teach the younger years so they might as well just teach everyone. Hagrid could probably work as an assistant, though.

** Canon Tonks and Remus were in an abusive relationship. If you hit on a coworker “a million times,” and that coworker says no every time, and requests to be transferred to a different job to avoid spending time with you, you really need to stop hitting on that coworker.

Yes, Remus has issues, but that's no excuse for this sort of harassment. When Remus got the news that Dumbledore died, and was crying over it, even Harry had the sense to step back and let him grieve. What did Tonks do? Literally grab and shake him, and tell him it didn't matter how many times he said no, she'd keep after him. That's inappropriate as hell. She could have just offered him some chocolate or an optional hug or something, not attacked him when he was down.

*** And another thing: remember how freaked out Remus was by the pregnancy? My own experience colors my perception here, as a friend of mine suffered from a genetic disease. He thought his wife agreed that they shouldn't have kids. His wife said she was on birth control. She lied, since she actually did want kids, and she must have figured, hey, there's a 50% chance the kid will be healthy, so it might work out. She got pregnant, and their kid did have the genetic disease. My friend was understandably upset.

How do we know Tonks didn't do something like that? She may have lied and told Remus she'd cast a birth control spell when she hadn't. Considering how she bulldozed over his objections to their relationship in the first place, treating his objections to having kids the same way seems in character.

In every single fic I'v read she pushes and pushes him and Remus is portrayed as a terrible man for not seeing it her way. Women have a lot of understand for Tonks and I suppose that's understandable. But I sometimes really wonder how they would feel if they were in Remus's position and someone treated them that way. Even Rowling called Tonks's actions in the hospital wing ' a brave declaration of love'. So if you shout at someone that you love them in public, that's somehow very brave and noble. People hate the way Snape's love for Lily is romanticised, but this paring is fine. Free will is no longer fashionable perhaps. I sometimes think that the reaction would be different if Remus was a woman and Tonks was a man. How would everyone react to that grabbing and hshaking then?

I wonder why the reaction is different here. The Facebook groups are mostly women, and I can't tell gender here, but I have my suspicions based on the enthusiasm for stories about super-powerful Harry shooting massive loads of spells out of his mighty wand. I would have assumed that women, on average, would be more attuned to domestic violence, but can they recognize it only when the victim is a woman? That's sad.

So Hermione is a saint. I haven't seen many mentions of her attacking Ron with those birds, for example, while everyone remembers that Ron was nasty to her. Btw, what did those people say as a counterargument to your claim? Because it's interesting that when it comes to this paring, women seem to love Toks a lot and sympathise with her situation so I'm curious what they have to say about it. However, I've seen older women actually sympathising with Remus, and it maybe sometimes is a matter of age. But I'm not claiming it's true! I've noticed another interesting thing. A person who was in a relationship with an older man said the paring is fine because Remus needs to be beaten over the head with a brick. So I started wondering if denying that the paring is fine would somehow mean saying that their own relationship is not fine.

I know that at least I and various other commenters here fall into multiple of those groups.

As to directly why people sympathize with Tonks and with Hermione, I feel like the overarching issue is that they are two of the few female characters in the books with any real depth or independence, which appeals to female (and male!) readers and makes them easier to root for. If Tonks and Hermione were two women who acted questionably in relationships among an overwhelmingly female cast where the only male characters were so and so's husband and so and so's token male friend or colleague, then they would be easier to root against or view more objectively.

******** Fanon does do wrong by Ginny. But I think that's JK's fault more than anyone for not properly fleshing her out. And then pretty much forcing the relationship with Harry seemingly out of freakin' nowhere. It ruined a lot of people's expectations (honestly, even Cho Chang would've made more sense) and I think people wrongfully took it out on Ginny in fanfic.

Hermione is loved because she's clever, but not so clever that she's impossible to write(unless you're also a genius). She's kind of like... an ideal? Someone once described her as the “little black dress” of the HP Fandom and I completely agree, because she's a character fleshed out-but not too fleshed out that one can't work with her. As for tonks, I haven't read much of any fic of her, so I can't comment. But yeah her relationship with Remus is totally problematic if we just consider what we read from the books. That said, we should also consider that Harry is an unreliable narrator. We don't actually have all of the facts. We don't know the whole story between Remus and Tonks. I mean... he married her for fucks sake. While, yes we can't know for sure (and it is possible that it was abusive) I can understand why people aren't generally concerned. It's easier to believe that Remus is self-sacrificing and denies himself good things in his life, than it is to believe that he's brainwashed.

She is praised for this for some reason, and Remus is the evil one.I sort of imagined that love was about caring about somone else's needs more than your own. Fanfic authors proved I'm wrong. And Rowling gave some details about this relationship in Remus's biography, so I think we know enough. I don't think it's all about characters not being fleshed out. It's also about the kind of characters they are. People admire Hermione because she is clever and figured out secrets to help Harry in his adventures. So it might be that they thought Ron wasn't good enough for her and like with Tonks, she can do what she wants. And that her actions are not always so admirable doesn't matter.

She's not deserving of hate because the author did wrong by the characters(all because the author was trying to recreate a kind-of parallel that shouldn't even exist) I remember thinking Tonk's relationship with Lupin seemed very forced(at 12 years old) and I still think that at 24 years old.

************* Hatred is a strong word, I agree. But the problem for me is that JK showed Tonks's actions as positive and admirable, and you see that in fanfics where Tonks keeps chasing after him while Remus is in his own private hell in a werewolf camp. Many authors, in the attempt to make this relationship more developed, pair them up already in OOTP. Then Remus decides to break up and Tonks is unhappy.Then at the end of HBP they get back together because Remus, having spent time with the werewolves, decides it's fine. Then the story repeats itself because he leaves again. Such stories show Remus in a negative light while Tonks is the unhappy abandoned girlfriend and everything is Remus's fault. I've seen fanfic authors saying Remus is a bit of an idiot for reacting the way he does. But they ignore the fact that Tonks willingly entered that relationship they wanted them to have and she simply didn't seem to know who Remus was. If the relationship doesn't go the way you wanted it to, whose fault is it? And what does it say about her if she wants it anyway and keeps pushing? I think Rowling's decision caused quite a lot of harm because things that most probably wouldn't be considered admirable in reality are considered romantic in this case.I'm not sure that's a good thing, considering young girls read those fics too.

******* Well of course it's a generalization, but it's kind of true! Women usually defend their own group (meaning other women, especially since most mothers still teach their daughters that women have it worse in life than men, despite that being far from the truth! Sure, some gender-bias is left, but over all women - with all the support programms, affirmative action stuff, gender-quotas (for women, not for men!) and companies hiring more women (if they can get qualified ones at least) than men to virtue signal etc. etc. - are better of then men!), while men tend to be harder on other men than on women (who are too often treated with velvet gloves and coddled - I mean look at the statistics about criminal cases: Women get off way lighter in most cases than men, even if you take race, age, background etc. into account and compare only white women with white men for example etc. to discount other biases!

Department head, looking at big stack of resumes of people who've applied for a position. He sorts them into men and women, and sets aside the women. “We can discard these right away.”

The one woman in the department: “Why?”

****** Yikes. Beating someone over the head with a brick is not part of a healthy relationship. There are a lot of real-life dysfunctional relationships, so I like how Rowling portrays relationships accurately, abusive ones and all.

Yeah, both Ron and Hermione had their flaws, and kids can be very mean, but at least Ron never physically attacked Hermione like she did to him.

People on Facebook argued that Remus really loved Tonks, he only said no because of his issues, which he certainly had. Her insistence was justified because he kept saying no.

I think a happy ending for him would have involved him first seeing a mind-healer to sort out the various mental issues preventing him from being in a relationship, and then looking around to see who he might want a relationship with. There's no reason to assume that the first person who refused to take no for an answer just happened to be his true love.

Besides, Remus still said no, because he had objections. It reminds me quite a lot of the way Scarlett pursued Ashley and since her actions irritated me, this paring annoys me as well. No one ever shows that Tonks actually understands Remus the way,say, Ginny understands Harry. It's all about getting him to accept the relationship. That's why I'm saying that love becomes justification for everything. Even when authors pair them up already in OOTP and Remus decides to break up, they still get back together in HBP, and Tonks becomes that wonderful woman who is willing to be with him at any cost. It's like she obviously isn't happy and Remus is an idiot, but she loves him so all is well. This is why i've come to believe that with Remus, the only story that would work is hurt comfort because Tonks's youth and easy life don't help her here.

****** I think there are different reasons why woman sometimes shy away from looking honestly at those things.

​

One is, that it is difficult to criticize some of the few female characters you can identify with. Men don't like to look at some male icons either and admit that they sometimes or often act like shit. And it is not like we have lots of other characters to look up to.

​

Another thing is that we are still taught lots of contradicting ideas. And one of those ideas is that a confident and independent woman is measured at how much like a man she acts sometimes. So it is sometimes suggested that this overly macho and domineering behavior is something good and we should aim for that, instead of the society changing in a way that makes more female approaches just as badass. So sometime it feels like you are only taken seriously if you outman the men. You have to play their game and be better at them than they [[https://are.You][are. You]] have to be more aggressive than them, more forceful, more dementing.

​

Then there is still a stigma on women taking charge in a relationship. So it is often a fantasy for many to be able to do it without people and guys taking it the wrong way. We are told far too often that a girl expressing her wishes is offputting.

Neither of those things makes it ok, but it is really difficult sometimes to catch yourself before falling into the same old traps

From what happened it definitely sounds like Tonks has a very good reason to believe that Remus was into her. And he was.

Also whatever did happen made Tonks clinically depressed.

Later when Tonks is pregnant, Remus is so terrified that he comes to believe that it's better for his child to have no father than a werewolf father. The point was that Remus wasn't ready for a relationship. Of course it worked, since no one listened to what he had to say and Remus was also grieving for Dumbledore. I wonder if those who are grieving are really thinking straight. I don't understand why her actions are a good thing just because they worked.Remus collapses into a chair and covers his face with his hands, and for him it's a very strong emotional reaction. Honestly, bringing up their issues right then and there was the worst possible decision she could have made.

I don't think there's anything wrong with thinking she's a conspiracy theorist, because she probably is, but I think this is one of the weaker arguments for thinking so. At least in regards to magical creatures.

Before threstals were discovered, I'm sure there was zero evidence for them as well. Same with demiguises. The fact is, it could require very specific circumstances to see certain magical creatures and so there being zero evidence as of now isn't really a huge sign that she's a conspiracy theorist.

Not to mention, literally the only Quibbler animals Luna thinks she's encountered are nargles and wrackspurts.

Nargles infest mistletoe (though what they actually do in the books, I cannot remember).

Wrackspurts are said to be "tiny insects that burrow into your ears and make your brain grow fuzzy." In other words, they cause disorientation and absent-mindedness.

In a world with billywigs--electric blue wasps that make you float when they sting you--wrackspurts sound remarkably plausible.

***** I think that the grounds for trusting consensus authority are a lot worse within HP-verse than outside of it.

For example, Voldemort cast the Imperius on many high-ranking government officials. That makes centralized conspiracies much more plausible than in our world. Memory charms exist. That means testimony is less reliable.

Also, the fact that magic works at all, and yet is not scientifically obvious to muggles, really undermines a lot of the epistemological assumptions that are probably built-in to your dislike of conspiracy theorists. Magic is pretty weird. Knowing there's a bunch of bullshit built into the fabric of reality ought to make being skeptical of official explanations a lot more reasonable for wizards than it is for us. Dumbledore himself describes certain types of magic as being "deep" and "impenetrable" in the books. Expecting reality to fundamentally make sense, when you're actually a character inside a fictional universe, is probably on-net a mistake.

** A lot of fanfiction has long since surpassed the original material, and rereads hold little value.

Books 4 onwards are not as good as 2 and 3, the series would have been more fun for me if Voldemort had had only the one Horcrux and died in book 2 for good, because the setting of the series has always been more interesting than the canon plot.

Rowling is incredibly annoying on Twitter, and has been putting less and less effort into her writing, as evidenced by the fantastic beasts movies.

Self Inserts and OCs can be just as good as any other fics, and should be encouraged.

She writes the Cormoran Strike series. A detective series which is honestly quite good if you like the Agatha Christie novels. I don't believe she has any interest in writing about HP anymore but knows she'll continue to make £££ off of it so let's people do whatever to her series. The end of The Crimes of Grindelwald speaks to that. She enjoys writing and so she writes mysteries - which is essentially what Harry Potter was for each and every book until the last.

This is listed as them all being together, but the only time it's really brought up, it's only Ron and Hermione being together. Harry shares the mind link thing, but it's a RonxHermione pairing more than a Trio, when talking in the romantic sense.

** I loved the epilogue (aside from “Albus Severus”).

(Book) Harry and Ginny had good chemistry and worked well as a couple. Ditto Ron and Hermione. Movie Harry and Hermione would've been a good couple only because the directors gave Hermione all of Ron's good qualities as well as her own, so it was effectively the same as making the whole trio a ship.

I don't care about Draco at all, I don't find him the least bit interesting, and I think he and Narcissa should've done time in Azkaban.

Dudley should've gotten a redemption arc besides “I don't think you're a waste of space.”

Cho and Lavender deserve better.

Merope Gaunt was a rapist and Tom Sr. didn't owe her or the baby she conceived by raping him shit. I don't know if it's unpopular because it rarely comes up, but the books paint Tom Sr as some kind of deadbeat for leaving and Merope as a victim, and very few people seem to care enough to challenge it.

On a somewhat related note, Voldy wasn't unable to love because he was conceived under a love potion, the fact he was conceived under a love potion was SYMBOLIC of his inability to love. If all else was the same except making him the product of a consensual union he would still be a violent sociopath.

But he looks damn near nefarious when it comes to the Potters and their deaths. He keeps the Cloak, doesn't do much about a spy in the Order, doesn't tell them /how/ he came to learn about the Prophecy and instead turns around and hires the guy that put the wheels in motion, and ignores their wishes on where to put their child.

I would have liked her far better if in GoF she had said,' Potter, rules be damned, tell me if you need help'. She let Harry play Quidditch in his first year even if this was against the rules, so she could have done the same later in GoF. She should have offered Neville some encouragement earlier than in HBP when he was no longer her student. She is actually the sort of teacher whom I disliked at school. I actually am not fond of Rowling's women in general. Hermione irritates me often, Ginny and Tonks are simply the sort of characters I generally don't like. I think Rowling did Tonks a disservice by giving her those special powers because now it's all she is to the fandom- an auror with special powers. Everone is far too worried about her not being seen as competent that they don't focus on anything else. Andbeing tactless is not an attractive character trait. I like Tonks in fics when she is somewhat out of character. I never liked the idea of Harry being a teacher or rather, I was always surprised by people insisting he should have become a teacher and not an auror. Even when Rowling made him a teacher in canon, I was surprised because while he had experience fighting dark wizards,I nevr saw him as someone who would enjoy teaching. I don't hate Percy and dislike the twins.

Canon Hermione isn't a prodigy. She's booksmart and can rattle off facts, but she cannot compete with and shouldn't be compared to Dumbledore, Tom, Grindelwald, James, Sirius, Lily, Snape, or Bella. I mean, even Harry understood magic in ways that she /couldn't/. She also wasn't a nice person and didn't change much.

Regulus wasn't a good person. He was fine with blood supremacy and murdering muggles/muggleborns.

Most people don't actually remember what Harry's character was like because they haven't read the series in years. Harry Potter was sarcastic, analytical, and used Dark magic in anger a few times. No, he didn't know what Sectumsempra would do, but he did know it was for enemies. He also doesn't get nearly as much credit as he should.

He lucked out with 'blood protection' in the first book.

The sorting hat brought the sword to him in the second, but he did still manage to kill the beast. He lucked out and didn't die from the lucky hit because Fawks was there. But didn't bring Dumbledore for some reason.

He #rekts the dementors at the end of the third, and I'll always give him that.

He doesn't die at the end of the forth because he lucks out with his wand connecting to Voldemort's. And the cup was somehow able to take him back to Hogwarts.

He teaches in the fifth book, while letting Umbridge literally torture him all year. Then thinks it's a good idea to rely on SNAPE to help with Sirius. You know, the Snape that screamed like a raving madman when Sirius got away in the third book.

He lets the Slug Club meetings go by, while hating every second of them, even though they're amazing opportunities to help him later in life.

He camps in the woods, with barely any food for a year. (And don't try and say they couldn't shop at a remote Muggle shop, or a fucking Tescos. Death Eaters would have no idea.) Lucks out in every dangerous situation he was in, and then won the entire war through a fucking Deus Ex Machina.

e.g. Hermione assumes everyone is starting from a higher level of competence than they are because she is, and isn't particularly empathetic, Ron /also/ doesn't have study skills and resists picking them up because that would be like Percy and Percy is outcast in their family, the rest of the Weasleys don't have great attention to detail and focus on making Harry happy rather than actually helping him in practical terms.

Realistically I'm not sure how canon Harry /could/ get ahead. Students go between avoiding him out of suspicion and being star-struck including older students, he doesn't have the social skills to approach people and ask for help - or ask for help at all, possibly; although he's free at Hogwarts he never has ability to go anywhere else but Hogwarts and Privet Drive, access to his funds is perhaps limited etc.

I always read the fact that dumb luck gets him through tasks as proof that Harry /is not/ particularly a hero apart from in the sense of his sense of right and wrong. I always thought that was the point of the books. He'll muddle through and try to do the right thing, but the whole Chosen One crap and prophecies and all that were always just superstition and spin.

He doesn't die at the end of the 4th book because he overpowers Voldemort's wand.

Harry wasn't the only person Umbridge was torturing. And why would he trust adults who were negligent at best to help him with another person who was abusing him when they were silent with the previous three? Lastly, he obviously didn't rely on Snape as he continued on to the ministry.

Harry is Boy Who Lived. He had people bowing to him in the streets as a child, he had ministers introducing him to other ministers, ministry personnel shaking his hand, and ministers seeking him out. Scrimgeour all but told him "work with me and you'll be an auror when you're 18." He also had plenty of money and a house. What, exactly, could Slughorn do for him?

He won the war bc Voldemort was too arrogant to understand the wand chooses the wizard. He also found all of the remaining horcruxes. And why you guys thought a 17 year old who had his wand for 6 years would beat a 70 yr old without deus ex machina is beyond me.

Again, not enough credit.

***** Your points don't contradict anything I said.

The dragon egg ended up being nothing worthwhile, because they still thought it was Snape.

Hermione figured everything out in second year, and Harry had a very huge leap of engineered logic to figure out where the entrance was.

He spent his whole life fighting dark wizards, but guess what, normal people don't nearly die every year and then decide to be an Auror for the rest of their lives anyways. He became an Auror because, again, JKR did nothing for him outside of making him lucky.

A Deus Ex Machina is bullshit no matter what you want to whine about. And he didn't even use decent magic in the fight, he was trying to stun him and disarm him.

****** The dragon egg was important because that led to Hagrid telling them how to get through the trap door. It also led to him realizing Quirrell was going after the stone because Dumbledore was gone. And Harry believed it was Snape /or/ Voldemort who gave Hagrid the egg.

Hermione figured out it was a basilisk and that it was going through the pipes (Something Dumbledore could've done but plot) Harry and Ron went into the forest, Harry then figured out who Myrtle was based on the info Aragoh gave him, then learned where the chamber was by asking Myrtle questions.

He didn't have to use decent magic as he told Voldemort the wand wouldn't harm him.

And i like how you aren't giving Harry credit bc plot, but give Hermione all the credit despite JKR saying Hermione was a character bc plot reasons. That dues ex machina also kept Hermione alive in books 2, 3 5, 6, & 7.

And you still didn't tell me what Slughorn could've done for one of the most famous wizards, who was also pretty wealthy.

**** He's also, like, 17 at the end of the series, when literally an entire war is waged with his name on every combatant's lips.

#+begin_quote
  He lucked out with 'blood protection' in the first book.
#+end_quote

In a confrontation, sure. But he'd aggressively pursued the investigation until that point, and he knew that he had /some/ quality that let him survive a Dark curse. That's why Hermione lets him go on alone.

#+begin_quote
  The sorting hat brought the sword to him in the second, but he did still manage to kill the beast. He lucked out and didn't die from the lucky hit because Fawks was there. But didn't bring Dumbledore for some reason.
#+end_quote

It's been suggested that Fawkes was still in Hogwarts to watch over Harry specifically, and as such couldn't have found, retrieved, and brought Dumbledore back. We don't know the limits of phoenix transportation, as far as range and time. Also, again, he and his friends aggressively pursued the story of the Heir, interrogated Malfoy, etc.

#+begin_quote
  He #rekts the dementors at the end of the third, and I'll always give him that.
#+end_quote

Dude, this is the year he's most passive. This is the year things happen /to/ him. Lupin offers to teach him the Patronus. The Time Turner is Hermione and Dumbledore's plan. He just loiters around Hogsmeade and angsts.

#+begin_quote
  He doesn't die at the end of the forth because he lucks out with his wand connecting to Voldemort's. And the cup was somehow able to take him back to Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

That's fair, but he does train and research specifically for the tasks. In the final confrontation, he was fucked before he even got there. He got outplayed, but that's hardly his fault - Dumbledore practically gave Crouch a giant neon sign that said "You can totally trust me, Harry. I'd never screw you over and turn you over to Voldemort's servants." Also, the Priori thing would have worked on him just as much as Voldemort - he outwills Voldemort to have the effect target him.

#+begin_quote
  He teaches in the fifth book, while letting Umbridge literally torture him all year. Then thinks it's a good idea to rely on SNAPE to help with Sirius. You know, the Snape that screamed like a raving madman when Sirius got away in the third book.
#+end_quote

So organizing a resistance under her nose and then insist on rescuing Sirius instead of leaving it to others is being passive? Also, he only tells Snape once he's literally been captured - it was never a consideration before that.

#+begin_quote
  He lets the Slug Club meetings go by, while hating every second of them, even though they're amazing opportunities to help him later in life.
#+end_quote

He's aware of how much of a coward and hypocrite Slughorn is, and he doesn't like people who judge him based on his fame rather than their subjective judgement of his character. He's probably also reminded of Lockhart, with all the boasting. I certainly was.

  He camps in the woods, with barely any food for a year. (And don't try and say they couldn't shop at a remote Muggle shop, or a fucking Tescos. Death Eaters would have no idea.) Lucks out in every dangerous situation he was in, and then won the entire war through a fucking Deus Ex Machina.
#+end_quote

Eh. There's no saying for sure that there wouldn't be a Death Eater in that shop. Why risk it when you don't have to? Plus, the Ministry could have organized a manhunt for him just like they did for Sirius. The Deus Ex Machina was set up by Dumbledore, but Harry had to figure it all out first.

Both sides here showcase they haven't read the last book in at least a good while. They often did go to stores to get food.

And the "Barely any food" is such BS. Ron just didn't care for the food that was being made. Not the amount of it. As was mentioned in that sequence, food can be multiplied as long as you have some to start with. So they could buy one of everything, and just multiply it for as long as needed to get all the food they did need.

He did what he could with the resources that he had at his disposal. Fics that show him being Muscular, strong, handsome and charming at 11 really irks me. He is a child treat him like it.

Another thing that irks me is Dumbledore not training Harry as a negative. Imagine it from his point of view.

He was the master of a particular field. Over 100 years old to whom Harry looked like a new born Babe. If Harry had showed him some kind of potential in any field of magic or atleast been more inclined to learning if could be acceptable but he was neither.

If he had still not taught Harry after he had completed his Newts then I would accept it as being suspect. It's like expecting a Multiple PhD holder to teach 5 grade math. He was not only over qualified but probably did not have the patience to teach some one so young.

What he could have done is hired teachers. Encourage, motivate and provide for Harry. Being someone who would listen to him. Just like all kids want.

*** Year 1: Just for the final test for the Stone, but Harry describes the bottle with the correct potion as half-empty, so he probably could have figured it out.

Year 2: Discovering the basilisk - if they had told anyone about Harry's hearing voices after it came out that he was a Parselmouth, it would have been easy to come to the conclusion that it was a snake-like monster, which would have led them to the correct opinion. No Polyjuice means they'd probably suspect Malfoy until the end, though. I feel like if Riddle had really stopped trying to kill the Muggleborns in Hogwarts, he would eventually have killed a pureblood, which would have led to Lucius confessing.

Year 3: No Hermione = no Time Turner.

Year 4: Mostly the same. Harry could have asked anyone to help with the Summoning Charm.

Year 5: The DA would have relied on word of mouth. They probably wouldn't have found out Edgecombe betrayed them. They may or may not have realized what the Room of Requirement was.

Year 6: Mostly the same.

Year 7: I doubt the fight would have been the same without Hermione there to drive Ron's jealousy. No magic purse, though. It's a tossup to how they do - probably hide in the Muggle world rather than camp.

So I think Year 3 would have gone totally different at the end, with unforeseen side effects. Year 5 would have been much rougher. Year 7 might have been harder, or just about the same.

***** Year 1: Harry embarrasses himself when Malfoy challenges him to a duel, because he doesn't know what it means. Unlike the Potions puzzle, there's realistically no way to get past the chess set without Ron. On the other hand, it's only Harry's presence that allows Voldemort to get the Stone anyway, so it all works out in the wash. Dumbledore might hold off on telling Harry about the blood protection.

Year 2: Harry is presumably left caged by the Dursleys all summer. No flying car, but Harry just sends Hedwig to McGonagall. If Ron isn't friends with Harry, Ginny's crush might not be so overwhelming, so she might not tell Diary Tom about him - Hermione notes that she doesn't have the best idea of his personality since she's so shy, so it might have been triggered more by proximity than anything else. As a result, the basilisk might go after Muggleborns as normal. Hermione might have taken Harry with her to the library when she figures out the basilisk, so it could all end sooner (if it's at /exactly/ the same time as canon, then the basilisk fight plays out in the corridor). Even if they aren't friends, Ron and Harry may well end up working together, since Harry is believed to either be or have a connection to the Heir, and Ron's sister has gone missing. On the other hand, no Ford Anglia means no Forest rescue from Aragog. Harry probably dies as a result.

Year 3: No Ron might mean no Marauder's Map. That would mean no Lupin in the final confrontation (which still plays out with Ron, Hermione, and Harry, since Ron would still be there to comfort Hagrid - Hagrid and Charlie were friends - and he's the one who's holding Peter). Things go much smoother without Lupin, since even though he wouldn't be there to vouch for Sirius, seeing Peter Pettigrew appear, alive, would definitely give credence to his story. Ron is angrier at Hermione since Crookshanks would still be going after Scabbers without Ron and Hermione's canon friendship and history ameliorating their feud.

Year 4: No Ron means someone else is taken for the Second Task. It's probably Hermione (which means Krum has another person, too). No traumatized Ron means no galvanization for Harry to ask Pavarti out to the dance. He probably winds up going with Eloise Midgen, just to shut Hermione up (or a girl asks HIM, which... like, how didn't that happen in canon?). But yeah, Ron's absence doesn't really change much about the plot this year, except no Quidditch World Cup.

Year 5: Absence of the social friend means Harry takes the whole 'everyone hates me' thing much harder. I guess the twins probably didn't get Harry's Triwizard winnings, so no WWW? Still, the Weasleys are indebted to Harry for saving Arthur (or Voldemort intentionally waits until there's another Order member who Harry likes more guarding the Prophecy - Tonks?). I think, just based on this, the Chamber, and Quidditch, Harry/Ginny might still happen. Ron may or may not still be a member of the DA, and may or may not still be present at the Department of Mysteries battle. If he's not and they're a man down, they do /much/ worse, and there are likely non-Harry causalities. Still, none of the Death Eaters are willing to kill Harry, and Dumbledore knows the prophecy already. Smashing it was Harry's idea, so Voldemort probably still doesn't get it. Not having Ron in the last battle (he was still loopy from the brains, IIRC?) could change things in a thousand different ways, since we don't have the clearest picture of how the battle goes, but there's nothing overwhelming to suggest that it would be too different.

Year 6: Here comes the question of whether or not Hermione and Ron would get together if Ron wasn't Harry's friend. It's not all that important to the plot, but neither Hermione nor Ron were too important this year, so...

Year 7: Snape is forced to tip his hand to save Harry at the lake, or, possibly, cracks Hermione's wards and sends her after him. Ron opens the Chamber by mimicking Parseltongue, so they might not have a way to destroy the Cup until Neville gets the Sword.

Ron doesn't have as many deus ex machina moments as Hermione, but I haven't been counting his most important role in the plot - giving Harry and Hermione a friend with a confident, outgoing personality who acts as the grease for their respective friendship. When Ron is fighting with Harry, he's constantly and explicitly growing less and less tolerant of Hermione's nagging. Ron manages Harry and Hermione's flaws in a very smooth manner. It's tough to say when, but I feel like without Ron (and no, a substitute like Neville wouldn't do), Harry and Hermione's friendship would be less intimate and possibly break down entirely.

Yes! Canon Hermione never grew! I actually think without her in the trio, Ron and Harry would have mimicked Sirius and James to a degree, although Harry would have still been less arrogant.

I'd like a fic where Harry starts slowly but surely passing her in aptitude, not just in defense. He starts doing work on his own, and he starts hanging out outside the trio. Having her grow would be a bonus.

I've met her type in real life. They do somewhat well in school, but aren't particularly intelligent. There's a reason Harry and Ron disliked her at the beginning of the story.

Hermione us brilliant, but she isn't creative, she uses ideas already done and repurposes them. She doesn't look beyond what's already been written or told to her. And there's nothing wrong with that, she is absolutely one of the smartest people at Hogwarts, but being smart isn't the equivalent of doing and being capable of the things Voldemort/Grindelwald/Snape/Dumbledore are.

** I quite like canon Harry. He's heroic by choice, ethical, in a Doylist way, as much as in a Watsonian way he needs to be a blank slate.

I also don't so much mind stories that rehash canon as long as some thing is different or the perspective is different. To me, those just open up the world a bit and fill in some of JK's blanks.

For dislikes, the vast majority of non-canon (het) school-age pairings do nothing for me. Not because they aren't canon and I'm a purist, but because they have such a tendency to slip off into one or more of 1) obsession, 2) uncomfortable sexual or romantic overtones that aren't age-appropriate, 3) require shifts in character not related to the setting or AU to make work. e.g. Fleurs who are still regal and haughty and powerful yet attracted to a 14 year old instead of someone their own age, Pureblood and powerful Daphnes who decide to give a troublemaking halfblood a shot and risk the ire of the dangerous individuals they live with day in day out to do so, Hermiones who decide that actually despite their talent and desperation to be The Most Successful that actually for their man they will be content to play a supporting role, etc.

** People excuse Death Eaters and co to much and nitpick to much on the flaws of the good characters and make them much bigger than needed.

James Potter is objectivily the better person that Snape. Snape ends his 'redemption' and at his best is still morally worse than the point were we see James at his worst. A bully that enjoys picking on others (but one picks on an equalin age and power and one on children he is given authority over), who still fights on the right side.

The books would haveworked great without Slytherin or Slytherin as a lost house that was closed down bcause it breeds bigot dark wizards and witches. And all those that call themselves Slytherin do it to show support for those ideas and you would have give the other houses some realistic flaws instead of putting them all in Slytherin. Ravenclaw: thirst for knowledge leads to amoral research and behavior, Hufflepuff: loyal to the wrong person and morals, Gryffindor: ready to fight, even a bit battle- and bloodhungry

Snape is overrated as a realstic character. He is the most unrealist character from all, because he is just to many cliches mixed together and stitched togerher with edginess and laminated with a sop story. Every other character is more real in their behavior and the logic behind it.

Voldemort and most intelligent characters are written stupid.

JKR doesn't know how to write good romance and maybe even has a wry notion on love. Additional she is not that good of a writer once she is out of her comfort zone and not very good when it comes to research.

some characters only make sense in the first books because it was more fairy tale like, like the Dursleys. If the first books had been written in the same 'realist' tone as the later, their abuse would look different. they cared too much about their social standing to let Harry look so uncared for, with broken glasses and the cupboard as a room, there would hav been another room even if only for show.

Dumbledore was a war general not a headmaster and that leaded to an army of child soldiers in both wars.

This is one of my biggest issues with the fandom. I think a lot of people are just trying to be edgy and fake deep by disagreeing with everything the author says.

It's one thing to disagree with some of JKR's characterizations or like shitty people AS CHARACTERS (I certainly do both), but stuff like “Draco's a fanatic racist who joined the Wizard Nazis and Ron is sometimes insensitive like a normal teenage boy, but because JKR said Ron is a good guy and Draco is a bad guy, Ron is the real bad guy here and Draco would be been a better friend/ship for Harry and/or Hermione” is just fandom wank.

*** I would have liked to see more house diversity in the Death Eaters. Ravenclaws who could experiment with taboo or forbidden magics under Voldemort's reign, fanatically loyal Hufflepuffs who who are fighting for some reason or another (maybe they have Death Eater friends), and Gryffindors who just want to fight someone and don't care who.

Wanting to proactively achieve something isn't an evil trait, and using the House of Ambition as shorthand for "evil wizards" contributes heavily to the "passive Harry" trope and hurts the overall narrative of canon.

I don't care what kind of slytherin connections he's cultivated or how much dumbledore protects his position, if he treated actual students the way he treats non-slytherins in the books he'd be out on his ass by his 3rd year of teaching.

****** I will try and hope to get my point across.

​

He is this person that spit in rage when Sirius escaped, after he was informed that he is innocent, and Snape wouldn't get an Order of Merlin, enough that Fudge thought he was losing it and that there was something wrong with him, someone Snape had previously tried to impress. That is a man not in control of his emotions and even action. But at the same time we have to believe that he is this master occlument that can even control his thought, but can't control his actions?

​

He is this super spy, who is able to manipulate and fool anyone. Someone that plays those around him like a fiddle. Someone like that needs some great people skills and empathy. Things that he is never shown to process, not as a child when he watched Lily and Petunia out of the bushes, not as a teenager when he couldn't even understand that joining a group that was active for years trying to kill muggleborn would never impress Lily or would ever be toleratable for her in a friend nevermind boyfriend. And that was his best friend. Not later as the teacher we see in the books.

​

​

Then he is this poor abused child that became an abuser himself. Which is fine and normal and a fitting story. Even that such a kid would be bullied is a logical story. And that as a teenager he would already be victim and abuser at once makes sense (calling using dark magic on another student just a laugh, but losing his shit about what happens to him). All that makes sense. Even that he joins this racist terror group. Many young misguided men do. But the thing is either he believes in the ideology and then his turn around doesn't make much sense, because he had this disproving contact with a muggleborn long before he joined and that is the way such people understand and change their views. Or he was too stupid to understand what he was joining and then we are told he is anything but stupid. Or he does it despite all just as an opportunist, who doesn't care how many innocents he has to kill or support being killed for his own grain, like telling a murders cult leader about a prophecy that would set him up to kill babies, but that would show a level of sociopathy, that makes the whole deal with his selfless and endless love for Lily that made him turn (who was always in danger from his terror buddies because she was muggleborn) really unrealistic, because real sociopaths on that level are unable to feel like that.

​

So he is lots of peeople, but they don't make much sense all together.

************* Yeah, but first of all, these are still situations that have something to do with Lily and James, and secondly, I don't think you can count something he did when he was a child as evidence anyway. When he let the branch fall on Petunia he didn't even have a wand yet, it was accidental magic. Shouting at Lily and calling her Mudblood was when he was 15, a hormonal teenager basically. Harry too was shouty and angry when he was 15 in OotP.

Anyway, I do agree that he's an emotional man and has issues. He just blocks his emotions when he's doing his job. For example, in HBP when Harry started chasing him, he kept his face when Bellatrix and Draco were around. He only exploded after they left. I would actually argue that BECAUSE he was constantly blocking his emotions around DEs he was more prone to them rising to the surface when he was in a relatively comfortable environment (Hogwarts). That's actually realistic.

The only time we can see an enchantment on a quill is Rita's Quick Quotes Quill. Blood Quills don't really count, since you're going nutso over ink down in other comments. Harry manually dips his quills in ink, and so does everyone else around him.

Quills were only a thing because no one could figure out how to keep the ink inside during the time, and they weren't around long after that fact, outside of enthusiasts.

Why can't your assumed 'quill magic' work on a pencil or a pen? Hmm? Quills don't hold ink, so your assumed self inking quill would have to constantly have the ink ready to go on the tip. Why not do the same to a pen? You could used your assumed ink stain spell with a regular pen's ink, since it's the same. Your assumed production spell could work too.

Quills are nonsense, and denying students the use of a pen or pencil is more moronic than your post.

So very wrong. In additional to Rita Skeeta's Quick Quotes Quill (which alone is more advanced than any writing aid Muggles possess), we see:

- Anti-cheating quills.

- Auto-answer quills.

- Self-inking quills.

- Spell-checking quills.

- Sugar quills

This invokes an empirical question that can't be answered using suppositions. But if we could then what, precisely, makes quills worse?

- Issues with inking? Assume that there is a spell for that.
- Issues with ink staining? Assume that there is a spell for that.\\
- Issues with production? Assume that there is a spell for that.

It is easy to assume that quills are worse because they are worse in our world; that doesn't make it so.

Most of the magic used on quills appears to be either a one-time thing, e.g., some sort of self-inking charm, or a small, relatively infrequent requirement, e.g., Skeeter's sucking on her quick quotes quill.

There is also upkeep on pencils and either upkeep or replacement requirements for pens.

I'm not sure on your point of charmed versus enchanted; are you simply arguing that I used the wrong word to describe the effect of magic on quills? Great, just replace all the charms with enchantments and the original point remains: enchantments allow for quills that do things that they can not in our world; any comparison between quills and pens in our world is thus irrelevant.

Magic exists in the Wizarding World. Thus, in that world, it causes things to happen. That we don't know those causes doesn't mean that magic doesn't work; it means we can't answer how questions about magic because we can not answer do magic.

The point is, enchanting something isn't something that most people can do. Most people however can charm something. So, buying a quill does not equal charm it to draw ink from that inkwell to write with.

​

Point of that was, spells can be quite finicky. A charm as broad as ink-stain removal, where does the spell decide that something is no longer a stain? Any broadly designated spell, would by their very nature not have an easily defined effect. Thus that question.

******* I think they are worse because of the way they feel when writing. Sure you could use magic to remove every single bad thing that makes a quill a quill, but what youre left with is a ballpoint pen. Why? Pens already dont break, are easily stored, dont smudge, fit into pencilcases, write with consistent width no matter how bad your handwriting is...

I think pens are better because they are everything you could want from a writing implement you use already.

Self writing quills are a different thing. If you for some reason cant make a self writing pen obviously those would be very valuable.

There is also no way pens wouldnt be cheaper. Someone has to cast all those spells on quills. Pens are so cheap everyone gives them away by the thousands for marketing.

******** I've pointed out repeatedly that something being true in our world is not representative of a similar truth in the Wizarding World. That you prefer writing with pens has no bearing on the relative effectiveness in other settings. For example, a quill could be magicked to feel incredibly comfortable in your hand.

A magicked quill can go far beyond a standard pen, even beyond simple self-writing. A quill can detect and stop cheating, if you so desired. A quill can take dictation, if you so desired. A quill can, by itself, modify speech (see the Quick Quotes Quill), if you so desired.. A quill can switch, easily and effectively, between different inks, if you so desired.

A quill won't ever leak ink (something pens do regularly). A quill won't ever explode (something pens do regularly).

Moreover, pens aren't everything you could want from a writing implement in /our/ world. We've introduced digital styli to write directly onto computers. This technology eases the storage, reproduction, and modification of written material. All of which, I note, are particularly useful for note-taking.

We know so little about the methods of production in the Wizarding World, I'm not particularly sure why you think a comparison with production in our world would be easy.

** I have a long rant about Dumbledore that I've posted before, but it still applies here. Bit of the old C&P.

The issue I take, is that Dumbledore overstepped every single time. Tom Riddle is a terrorist who was strongly driven in that direction by Dumbledore, although his actions are his own, and he was clearly insane well before he tried to murder an infant. Dumbledore is a straight up Machiavellian Dark Lord, who attempts to 'guide' the world by molding it's youth, and holding key positions in it's legislature. Why we bash Dumbledore in a few easy to understand bullet points.

​

- Dumbledore placed Harry with his relatives, against the advice of McG, which should have been irrelevant as Dumbledore didn't have the authority to do so. Seriously. Based off the positions he held and their responsibilities, the man had absolutely no right to place Harry with anyone.\\
- He hid the Philosphers Stone in a school, behind traps. The level of irresponsibility inherent in that action is indescribable. There have been a myriad of discussions as to better spots to hide the stone.
- He allowed a detention that sent first year students into the forbidden forest with a non-qualified wizard. The man has three jobs, but really he has one fucking job as headmaster of a school, and that is to keep the students safe, healthy, and ensure a consistent, quality education.
- Which brings us to Snape, who Dumbledore keeps on staff for no academically justifiable reason. Snape bullies and belittles students in a fashion that would see any respectable educational institution firing him and quite possibly bringing him up on charges. Again, Dumbledore has one fucking job, and he utterly fails.
- At the end of the year, after Harry straight up kills a professor, He is sent back to the neglectful, borderline abusive relatives to whom he was delivered without due process in the first place. Where to even start. First, a professor died. There should be an Inquiry. Second, said professor apparently attempted to harm/kill a student. Again, Inquiry. An eleven year old boy killed someone. Where is the therapist? Finally, Harry is under the school nurses care, who apparently has never been trained to recognize abused children? Once more, Dumbledore has one fucking job, and all of the above actually falls under his purview, but he does nothing.\\
- Continuing on our theme of bullies, the unmitigated degree of bullying towards Harry during his second year should see Dumbledore, McG, Sprout, Flitwick, Snape, and Filch all under review for failing to act, if not outright dismissed. And again, Dumbledore has one fucking job, again, that of running the school, and he fails.
- Why weren't the authorities notified when students were being attacked and petrified? Where were the interviews, the investigation? My recurring theme of Dumbledore having one fucking job and failing persists. The aurors are one floo call away.
- McG and by association Dumbledore gave a goddamn time machine to a thirteen year old girl. A time machine. In a school.\\
- Sirius Black was a member of Dumbledore's super secret vigilante group. Dumbledore knew about the dark mark thanks to Snape turning coat. Dumbledore let an innocent man go to prison because he couldn't be stuffed to roll up his fucking sleeves? As Chief Warlock, he could have pushed for a trial but he failed.
- Third year. Soul sucking demons. A responsible administrator would have refused to open the school under those circumstances (that being the stationing of dementors around the school). Certainly after they invaded the train, and then the quidditch pitch.
- Dumbledore hired a werewolf. He hired a werewolf without making said werewolf take an unbreakable vow to take his wolfsbane potion every month. He endangered every student in the school, because he failed at his fucking job. To put this in perspective, he hired a convicted sex offender (to be fair, this offender just got drunk and whipped it out and pissed on the school in front of the cops one night), and didn't put any camera's in the classroom, or otherwise limit his exposure to the students.\\
- Dumbledore aids and abets a fugitive from being brought to justice, enlisting two children to do so, again using the fucking time machine given to the now fourteen year old girl. At this stage we are just compounding the interest on the man's utter and complete failure.
- The Triwizard Tournament. Any contest to be held in a secondary school that has a fucking death toll is an insanity best not considered. Not only does Dumbledore allow this nightmare, he once again fails to protect his students when an underage contestant is admitted. One job.
- A quick loop back to the bullying issue, fourth year is worse than second, and now we can add Trelwany and Hagrid to the list of teachers who should have noticed. Also, our resident asshole Snape tells a teenage girl, whose teeth are down to her chin due to a curse that he "Sees no difference"? Why hasn't this assclown been dismissed yet? Ah yes, because Dumbledore won't do his fucking job.
- Lets ignore the tasks and assume that Dumbledore somehow had safety precautions for ~everything~. When Harry returns from the graveyard, with a dead body, where are the Aurors? Shouldn't Dumbledore call them? Maybe once they get to the infirmary as Harry is clearly injured. Ah, but no, Dumbledore couldn't possibly be assed to do his job. Oh and how about a therapist for the kid who just watched another kid die? Nah.
- Fifth year, Umbridge. Blood quill. Dumbledore knows and McG's advice is to keep your head down. The man has one job, to run the school and protect the students and he utterly fails once again.\\
- End of fifth year. It's a boarding school. The dorms ought to be locked up tighter than a snare drum at night, with staff posted. But no, the kids run rampant, and leave the school. Dumbledore doesn't do his job, and chases after the kids into the Ministry, instead of calling the Aurors. After the debacle is over, instead of sending Harry to the hospital (as they are off school grounds), he sticks him in his office for a while, then comes back and tells the kid he has to save the world. He doesn't arrange for a therapist or even get him medical attention. Oh no, it's more important to tell him a prophey, because that couldn't fucking wait till tomorrow.

And from here it just gets worse as the books go on, as we discover Dumbledore knew about the abusive childhood, and put him there deliberately in order to groom him (and yes, he was grooming him) to become the magical equivalent of a jihadist suicide bomber.

I'll say it again for those who missed it - Dumbledore had one fucking job as Headmaster of a boarding school and he failed at every level. Even worse he ~maliciously~ groomed students to become suicide bombers and/or child soldiers.

So yeah. Fuck Dumbledore. I don't care what his intentions were, I don't care about his greater good, and I give zero fucks about the prophecy. He took what might be one of the most important jobs you can have, overseeing the education of our children, and he deliberately failed said children again and again.

*** I don't see how Dumbledore drove Tom Riddle anywhere. He wasn't his head of house nor his headmaster, both of whom clearly adored Tom Riddle.

James told Dumbledore Sirius was his Secret Keeper.

The board of governors knew about the attacks. As did Fudge.

Hogwarts was clearly subjected to the ministry. There's an entire board of governors that he had to answer to. I doubt /he/ had the authority to open and close Howarts. And you guys give unbreakable vows too much. I don't even like Remus and I think it would have been absurd for him to die bc he wanted to rescue Harry from a mass murderer.

At the end of the triwizard tournament the Minister for Magic is quite literally right there. That Minister also called dementors to the school.

Fantasy readers and watchers should learn to judge a world based on it's standards and not modern day/real world standards. Dumbledore didn't create those tasks. Bagman did. Wizard injuries last a minute. You mention unbreakable vows, but can't imagine that a contract with a powerful magical object would have severe consequences if it was breached?

Dumbledore 100% did not know about the quill and neither did McGonagall. How exactly would Dumbledore lock up the school if he was gone? And do /you/ think the Harry Potter who has asked "why did Voldemort come after me" almost every year would want to wait? He was in the throws of a tantrum. Imagine if Dumbledore said "no, we'll wait until tomorrow."

Fudge knew about Quirrell as well as he mentioned it at the trial. Umbridge even knew about Quirrell.

There's a lot to criticize Dumbledore over. You don't have to make things up.

Every time we see James, other than when he was dying for his family, he's being an arrogant bully, plain and simple. There could have been a scene when someone mentions his good deeds, but there isn't. He could have matured when he grew older. It's possible. And Snape could have volunteered at a homeless shelter. Nothing in the books suggests that, though.

I also don't see much in common between James and Fred and George. The twins could be carelessly cruel sometimes, but they didn't target or hex anyone for the hell of it. They put a lot of care in their joke products, and those were never malicious. And Marauders being pranksters is entirely fanon.

  Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing. Harry hurried to catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached them, he realized how much taller they both were: A few years seemed to have passed since their Sorting. “. . . thought we were supposed to be friends?” Snape was saying. “Best friends?”

  “We are, Sev, but I don't like some of the people you're hanging round with! I'm sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he's creepy! D'you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?” Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face.

  “That was nothing,” said Snape. “It was a laugh, that's all ---”

  “It was Dark Magic, and if you think that's funny ---”

  “What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?” demanded Snape. His color rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment.

  “What's Potter got to do with anything?” said Lily. “They sneak out at night. There's something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?”

Can't find the piece about Snape knowing more about the dark arts than the normal 7th year when he arrived at Hogwarts. The wiki really needs to upgrade their sourcing standards.

  Snape knowing more about the dark arts than the normal 7th year when he arrived at Hogwarts
#+end_quote

Sirius said that, sure. But we also know enough about Snape's upbringing to know that it's bullshit.

The second quote is about Lily's problems with Snape, not James's. And the first quote is hardly reliable, because Sirius and Remus were the ones who bullied Snape, and Sirius doesn't even think that there was anything wrong with the Shrieking Shack incident, he thinks it was just a prank.

As I said in another comment, I just knew it would devolve into Snape wank. My initial point was that nothing suggests that James matured and became a good person. I don't see how proving that Snape was a shit person does that. Only James himself doing something mature and good would prove that, and bullying anybody regardless of who it is doesn't.

********** Why is it bullshit that the Snape who introduced Lily to the magical world would know a bunch of Dark Magic? He knew A LOT of other stuff. And James befriending a werewolf and saving Snape shows he's a good person.

*********** Snape knew more than Lily, but he grew up in a Muggle household with a Muggle father and witch mother who was strongly implied to be abused by her husband and didn't seem to use much of magic, at least judging by Snape's clothes and the state of the house. She was the only source of knowledge about magic for Snape. Do you honestly think it's probable she would teach him any dark magic?

James saved Snape from a situation his own friend created, and if he let Snape be mauled by Remus, Remus would be sent to Azkaban at best, or maybe even executed. Also he as an animagus wasn't in danger himself going after Snape. So he wasn't a total sociopath, hooray.

Befriending a werewolf is not enough to be considered a good person. It just shows that James isn't prejudiced against them. It can be something he learned from his family. Or overcame after spending time with Remus. He didn't straight up befriended a werewolf, he befriended Remus and then learned about his condition. And in the end, they still suspected Lupin of being a spy for Voldemort, probably because of his status as a dark creature.

************ Yes, because you don't need a wand to teach magic. In fact, all you need to do is give someone a book. Are we really under the impression that Snape could make such changes to a potions book without a head start?

Being in a danger from turning into a werewolf. Do please recall how the werewolf attacked the dog in POA.

In the end, he was a still paying for Remus' life. And not being prejudiced absolutely makes you a good person. Sorry you don't know that.

************* First years start with turning matches into needles and levitating feathers. Do you really think an untrained first year would be capable of any advanced dark spell? With the exception of maybe Riddle, who had control of his magic already.

Marauders became animagi specifically so they can accompany Remus when he's transformed. There was no danger to James's life there. He was cleaning up the mess Sirius created. And how did James pay for Remus' life?

Not being prejudiced is an absolute minimum for being a good person. But you need more than that.

*************** It's complete speculation. Sirius, who claimed that about Snape, had a library full of Dark books at home and had much more opportunities to read about dark spells before going to Hogwarts.

Anyway, conversation about James once again derailed into conversation about Snape. Like, Snape and Sirius are some of my favourite HP characters, but I fully admit they aren't particularly good people as adults, and were pretty horrible as teens. Why can't people admit their faves have faults, I don't know.

It can't be that difficult to do, considering its widespread use in storefronts, world cups, that it's cast by Harry/Hermione, and so on. It's allowed the Leaky Cauldron to go completely unnoticed in the middle of London for literally hundreds of years. No one's put together surveys, utility installations, construction, and so on having presumably-contradictory values.

The general outcome of HP magic in the stproes is that it casually bodies anything it's up against except stronger HP magic. While it's true that most of the "peak" magic powers in HP are not representative of what the average wizard in it can do, I still think it's fair that people think the Potterverse is pretty high up there.

Known limits - having to clearly be able to see the place and a decent amount of concentration. Not bad limits mind you, but this isn't a huge feat. There are other fictional universes with comparable feats and it isn't really too unique to Harry Potter magic. Also instant transportation versus beyond speed of light speeds isn't a massive difference.

Memory charm isn't a huge feat also. It's great don't get me wrong, but its a pretty specialized skill and there are ways around it. e.g. video

Not sure who you are referencing here tbh other than the Ford Angelina, but is that really pseudo AI? Self-driving cars aren't out of the realm of possibility already, that would technically be pseudo AI.

Like muggle repelling charms and unplottable charms. Really think about the fact that these things stop muggles and satellites from discovering them.

Or the curse on the DADA position. That's a spell on a freaking abstract idea. A spell that literally bends fate and reality so that the outcome of every year is the absence of a DADA teacher. That's /insane./

#+end_quote

This is what makes it an unpopular opinion. I think there are stories that do nerf magic, not as hard as people think. People just tend to over fantasize canon magic and don't take in the context when utilizing HP magic in other universes.

#+begin_quote
  Like muggle repelling charms and unplottable charms.
#+end_quote

This only works if you get there first. As technology advances, people are going to realize something is wrong. Sure you make a building unplottable or muggle repelling but at some point, people are going to wonder what's up. A ton of people like to argue that isn't the case, and that it would just be a mugglewank, but that's not true. The muggle-repelling charm only prevents non-magical at a closeish radius, it doesn't prevent them from seeing it. At a far enough distance, you can see the area. It also doesn't prevent inadvertent access to the area like if someone got thrown through the doors.

Here's the quote about it from the book - ""Muggle-Repelling Charms on every inch of it. Every time Muggles have got anywhere near here all year, they've suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away again." Not that great as people like to make it out to be.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Sure, but that is very narrow and really specific with an abstract consequence. How many people can actually do something like that truly. And who's to say it wouldn't be broken if the position title hadn't been changed. Literally not enough is known about it.

#+begin_quote
  Or time travel.
#+end_quote

Not new, other fantasy universes have it too. In fact, HP is pretty restricted as it follows the thinking that time cannot be changed (barring Cursed Child cause I didn't read that).

#+begin_quote
  Or the shield charm with Rowling's idea that magic always beats the mundane. It becomes arguable that a shield charm could stop nukes.

I'm going to need a canon source on that cause I've never heard that. And even if it's true, that isn't that high of a power ranking on the power scale when dealing with other fictional universes.

#+begin_quote
  Or the killing curse. No reason to think it wouldn't kill the likes of Hulk or Thor.
#+end_quote

Again unpopular opinion, no reason to assume it would either. It's a one hit kill that is dodge-able. There are other one hit kills that aren't dodge-able in other fictional universes.

#+begin_quote
  Or the fidelius charm.
#+end_quote

It's fantastic don't get me wrong. One of the more powerful pieces of magic, but it doesn't appear to remove anything from reality per se. Flitwick " An immensely complex spell involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. . . . You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!"

I do think it's a powerful piece of magic, probably one of the most powerful in fiction, but one piece of magic doesn't make the whole universe powerful. Especially when it isn't the norm and there are ways around it.

#+begin_quote
  Or apparation and portkeys

So yea it doesn't actually prevent muggles from being forced into the area so if they have a general idea, they can definitey go.

Just read it, it says nothing about stopping a nuke.

#+begin_quote
  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override ‘mundane' nature, but not ‘magical' nature. Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula.
#+end_quote

If that's the passage you're talking about, it does not say that magic always beats mundane. That is saying that magic can cure mundane, but it doesn't say they prevent it. I don't think a wizard is stopping a nuke from killing him/her/it. Maybe the radiation, but the actual blast?

We don't even know if it kills all living things. You can believe that and I won't fault you, but there is no canon proof that it kills every living thing. Does it even kill dragons or Basilisks? Then the other limitation is not everyone one can cast it, we know that, especially from Moody's line in GoF. As such, it isn't implausible to believe it wouldn't kill the Hulk or Thor.

Look I'm not going to try to convince you of what the power of Potter universe is. It's just my opinion that the magic in the Potter universe is at best city-busting and not higher and I know that isn't the most popular opinion, hence this entire thread.

There's no reason the Statute wouldn't hold, the muggle governments appear to know about magic. That coupled with the fact that the wizard establishments tend to not be close to muggles and this is all pre 1900s I could see it lasting until 1900s. Then 1900s you just have bloodbaths and rebuilding so I could see them focusing on themselves plus the government keeping attention away to prevent a full on wizard/muggle war/hysteria.

Also, they can mess with memory, so having people stumble into a wizarding establishment only to lose his memory isn't too far fetched.

Dude, I don't care about if it's a pocket dimension or not. That's completely beside the point. The whole pocket dimension thing was just an example. Not sure why you're clinging on it.

The point is that there are clearly enchantments set in place to make sure muggles don't see the real thing. Your argument implies that all a muggle would have to do is look at something with protections from a distance, which is not logical. If magic could be fooled so easily then the Statute would have fallen loooong ago.

Wasn't clinging to it, wasn't sure what else to compare it to since that is how you brought it up. My point wasn't that it's a pocket dimension or not. My point is that the muggle repelling charm doesn't stop them from bypassing the charm and seeing the real thing which is shown by the Grangers in Diagon Alley.

My argument about looking at it from a distance dealt with the variation charm that was used during the World Cup which definitely makes sense as that is exactly how it is explained. You took it to mean I was talking about the actual non-variant muggle repelling charm when I already cleared that up a few replies ago with Hermione's quote on how it works. Muggle repelling charm will fool the muggles from seeing the real thing, but it absolutely does not prevent them from bypassing it and seeing the real thing which is what I'm pretty sure you're arguing when you said " And if they can go to it, they can't actually go into Hogwarts itself".

If you choose your explanation, go for it. I'm just saying how it was explained and works in canon to give a more accurate read on the power of the Potterverse.

** - Harry ended up with Ginny Weasley because they were attracted to each other. Harry was not attracted to Hermione, who was attracted to Ron and vice versa. This is why the relationships ended up as they did in canon. Unless this factor is given a good reason for not occurring in a fic, I always have trouble buying non-canon romances in stories. Not against any of these (with some notable exceptions), but skeptical to say the least. But I am not much of a shipper either, so...
- Cho Chang did not deserve how her time at Hogwarts, and relationship dilemmas, turned out. Perhaps she handled it poorly, but we know very little about her character and history in canon, so judging her seems pretty petty at best.
- The diary was not originally a horcrux when JKR wrote the story, and she later retconned it in part to deal with the issue of why Harry had "part of Voldemort in him" (I firmly believe that she wanted to have Harry sacrifice himself like his mother from the 1st book to get rid of this 'part'). This is why this Horcrux stands out like a sore thumb amongst the others.
- Fem!Harry probably would have ended up with Ron, assuming all other things being similar to canon. That, or one of the older Weasley brothers. Based on canon, everyone sort of implies his personality is nearly identical to his father and partly his mother, despite having never met them. Since the neglect had far less effect on him than it really should have in canon, seems like Fem!Harry would probably be more Lily with a smidgen of James (a guess though).
- Metamorphmagus are almost always overpowered in fics, and are seemingly far less useful in canon than you would expect.
- Magic is hard to master, really hard, and this is why wizards are not really conjuring houses or knowing many defensive/dark magics. Most people become narrowly specialized once they meet a few basic checkboxes during education, and can learn others as necessary for specific tasks later.

**** So if we look at all the other Horcruxes, they are items (or a gigantic snake/maledictus in Nagini's case) that serve to extoll Voldemort's ego. They are treasures, one-of-a-kind magical artifacts, and only treasures would be worthy of Voldemort's Horcruxes (remember his egotism is central to his personality). He really believes his own schtick, so to speak. And the diary is, by contrast, utterly unremarkable - an empty notebook, with nothing to suggest its rarity like the others. That alone is anomalous.

Moreover, you get to the issue of how the diary was "hidden." Seemingly, Voldemort gave it to Lucius and he kept it in his manor. He would not have wanted it to be in Gringotts as well for safety, but this is incredibly lax protection compared to all the others (ex. hidden cave on the coast, ancient bank vault guarded by dragon and goblins, ring is hidden in a supposedly random shack with a curse that nearly killed Dumbledore). Moreover, Dumbledore points out that Voldemort intended it to be used as a weapon (in HBP) rather than hidden, but that seems wildly pointless to be honest.

Another explanation is Voldemort wanted the diary to be hidden in the Chamber of Secrets in the end. Or that Voldemort had a contingency plan, and gave the Horcrux to Lucius guessing that he would give it away and trigger the reawakening of the soul fragment so it could try to locate the master soul and give him a new body.

But again, all this is trying to get around the fact that the Diary was originally just that - a diary preserved with a memory. And then a lot of bending over backwards was done later to try to explain why he Voldemort used five rare magical artifacts and his old diary for his precious soul jars.

**** 1. While in reality, of course not, people believe that. In Harry Potter? Examples include - Molly and Arthur, George and Angelina (hinted), Lucius and Narcissa, James and Lily (regardless of how short it was), Fleamont and Euphemia Potter, etc. There really aren't many instances of divorces or bad breakups after school. Hell even Bill met his future wife in his former "high school" the first time he was back there in half a decade.
2. They were paired that way because JKR wanted those pairings from the beginning. If she wanted different pairings, she would have written different characters to fill those roles.
3. First, I said Ron or one of the older brothers. This is partly because Harry is very drawn to having a sense of family and belonging, for good or ill. Thats why he loves the Weasleys. Moreover, they all have certain behaviors, i.e. many "Gryffindor traits," that Harry seems to value heavily. Plus, people tend to end up in relationships with people they have spent a lot of time around beforehand. Besides, Harry and Ron were closer as friends due to their interests than with Hermione, for good or ill. Unless fem!Harry has a significant change in personality due to some changes, they would probably end up to together at one point (same goes for the older Weasleys).

I feel like if she were put on trial, she'd have tons of off-screen anecdotes about how she tried to navigate an untenable situation.

/Slight/ issue with Hermione as black - there's minor canon evidence that she wasn't. If people want to see her that way or make her black in a fic, literally no problem here, though.

**** I have zero problem with anyone headcanoning Hermione as black, but I do get annoyed when people pretend Rowling deliberately wrote her that way or even as racially ambiguous. Whenever a character of color shows up in that series, she'll about slap a damn daishiki on them to make it /that/ obvious.

Also, I've read some really cringeworthy fics that pretty much portray her as African-American, not as the Black British girl she'd actually be--- with Black British experiences and perceptions of herself.

***** Yeah. Nobody's pretending, like, Daphne's black, even though that would be way easier to justify, because Rowling tells us who's black and who isn't. A Very Potter Musical famously pointed out that Cho isn't actually described as Asian anywhere, but if a character is black, she'll go out of her way to point it out.

That's ignoring the parts where Hermione's skin color is actually addressed, including once that outright states it's similar to Ron's.

Harry will be fine without her. She's convenient crutch an excuse to keep Harry a mushroom. A lazy plot device, a strong female character for diversity. I can remove Hermione and can see Harry being fine albeit a lot more darker more Riddle like.

Another character that I hate is Mrs. Weasley. She has her moment but I can't stand her. I think she's nice but seriously the order of the Phoenix had put a nail in the coffin for me. Then there's her attitude with fluer, honestly I swear I don't get why people find her as a saintly mother, she seems so fucking horrible to me. The type of mother that's only nice to outsiders but degrades a lot of people. What makes it worst is that no one calls her out of it nor does she realizes what she is actually doing. Which makes Ginny doublely horrible to me as the only daughter of that woman.

And Tonks... Her love story with remus is nice but I can't help but feel it is a dysfunctional relationship. It is fated to crash and burn eventually especially if they survived the war. I cant vision a happy ending for teddy.

I wouldn't say I hate her, but she's certainly my least favorite Weasley. She thinks she knows best, but is not nearly competent enough to make the right decisions. Lots of her actions are highly counterproductive in the Books:

- Not believing her children's account that Harry was abused
- Believing Rita Skeeter over Hermione, a girl she knew fairly well by that point
- Not supporting the Twins in their endeavor
- Not trusting Harry with information that was very relevant to him
- Sabotaging Trio's preparation for the Horcrux Hunt

Furthermore, (if it's not another of JKR's silly plot railroading) she must have insisted to hold the Wedding at the Burrow. This was an utter insanity considering the rapidly deteriorating security situation in Britain, and it needlessly put the bride's family at risk.

Of course, writing Molly this way is good literary practice, but I really don't like this type of people.

**** That is definitely his primary motivation, and if that were it it would be very clear that Snape is just totally selfish and just happens to be working for the good guys. However, it's made clear that Snape changed his views, and as a 30 something man he is no longer racist and in some way cares for the well being of others (regretting that he couldn't save other people, correcting Phineus Black's portrait, etc). His devotion to Lily is definitely front and centre, but it's clear that he has grown beyond that in terms of himself as a person. I think that's what makes him interesting - he went from a kid that you just feel terrible for, to a young man you dislike for his toxic views, to a man trying to do right. Is he nice? Hell no. Is he a saint? No. Is he reforming himself? Certainly. There is a certain beauty in someone who sees the error in their ways and tries to change for the better.

**** I agree snape isnt in the order because hes a good guy, but being in the order doesnt make someone good it simply makes them dumbledore's man. Rowling herself has expanded on this since the order was explained, though is most evident in the 6th and 7th book. We will never know for certian what his exact motivations are for staying/joining the order but we know exaxtly what they obviously are not.

I have thought about it and i find your question wanting. Its a loaded question, still its a valid one and it would depend a lot on how and why lily got to being there. Most of the ways/reasons I can think up wouod require huge changes to his characther or others characther to make work but in cases where he is portdayed like he is in the series its going to be either why wouod he have to, of course he would, he wouldn't, and he alread is. The thing about changing people/events is that it changes everything. Swap rosevelt and hitler at birth and history is going to look a bit different. Just because people followed a bad person doesnt make them inheritly bad just like how doing the oposite doesnt make one inheritly good. You are what you are for the reasons why you do things, we judge others based on their actions and when we know them, their reasons. Knowing snapes reasons and actions I find pepople who think him evil or not a good person to have either remembered him incorectly or are people who don't think beyound the he was kind of a jerk to harry for/while doing his job.

While the event did happen you are ignoring the why, and what snape would have already done by that point. look at events chronlogically, and just try to think about why like I mentioned, dont add hypotheticals onto the why just based on what happened why did he do x in the story what would be a human reason for doing so.

********* wow. i did not expect to be compared to nazis over snape but life never ceases to surprise.

after you said "he isn't racist" i thought my use of pronouns confused you and just decided to clarify who i meant by the number of "he"s i used.

about the chronological order of events

in early 1980 snape heard the first half of the prophecy and informed the racist terrorist he was working for (voldemort).

voldemort decided that between neville and harry, harry was the one that could oppose him so voldemort decided to kill the potters.

edit: snape would be fine with longbottom dying. he went to tell voldemort (a crazy murderous terrorist) about a baby who might kill him after all. he only changed his mind because lily was at risk.

snape begged voldemort to spare lily. voldemort agreed. but not trusting voldemort's word snape went to dumbledore. not because he thought voldemort was an evil bastard that should be stopped. not because he thought getting rid of voldemort was the /good/ thing to do. snape defected because he didnt trust voldemort to not kill the love of his life and thought dumbledore might somehow save her.

after lily died, snape stayed by dumbledore's side because he felt a responsibility to keep /lily's son/ alive. not harry potter. and partly because dumbledore thought the boy was necessary to defeat voldemort once he returned.

snape kept his promise to keep harry alive but did his best to make life harder for him. now, usually i'm not one to pull the 'snape is a bully' card but snape really was a bully. worse than james because snape was a bully who had authority over the people he bullied.

even in snape's redemption-flashback-pensieve-adventure we don't see how he didn't agree with voldemort. we don't see how he wanted a better world or something like that. we see how he loved lily and how everything he did was for her.

back to nazis for a second. since we're comparing people to national socialists. snape is like a nazi agent who loved a jewish girl and when hitler wanted to kill her, asked hitler to spare her life. but he didnt trust hitler so he made an agreement with churchill because he thought churchill could save jew-lily. when that didn't work out and churchill said 'this boy will kill hitler', he bullied the boy for looking like his father. then as he gave his last breath, he didnt say 'by the way hitler is a bad guy and i never liked national socialism anyway'. he said 'i love your mum'.

in conclusion, snape was a selfish person who thanks to his personal vendetta against wizard hitler ended up in the right side of history. not because he was morally a good person.

** Dumbledore was an utilitarian, not necessarily evil or a manipulative person! Here's a discussion I started on this topic!
