My only requirement is that OP actually means OP, not above average. I've seen people suggest supposedly OP Harry fics that have him struggling with beings of mid-tier power. That's not OP. Have him struggling with say Thanos (if Marvel) makes sense. Struggling with Bucky though doesn't make him OP. That's all i'm asking for, an OP Harry who is actually OP.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** This is fem Harry but it's great. It's not strictly Harry travels to another world but it's super AU they've done so much worldbuilding to incorporate the MCU that it's another world anyway. But I really really love this story linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17946929/chapters/42383930]])

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up. This Fic is now complete!

  Harry Potter, master of death, finds himself in another world. He attracts the attention of Nick Fury and shield. Harry can't help but think of this as an opportunity, after all, a weapon needs something to aim at.

In general, you can put linkffn/linkao3 then either the name and author, just name or link number in parentheses without spaces (like I did in the original comment) and the bot will grab the fic for you.

***** Bard is an all round nice guy.The author could fit in a minor romance with a peaceful parting before LOTR canon begins in earnest. Harry is not an Elf so she can actually be happy even after his death. I do wish that LOTR fics were not all romances. All those (SI/OC)/Legolas fics just make me cringe.

  It took Harry one slightly more successful assassination attempt to realise she was immortal.It took Luna one question to persuade Harry to help with an old research.It took the dwarves of Erebor one meeting with an Easterling thief to change the course of history. A competent fem!Harry travels to Middle-earth crossover, spanning from the reclamation of Erebor to the end of the Third Age.

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...
