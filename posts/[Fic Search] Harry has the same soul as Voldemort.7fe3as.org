There was this fic I read where it was found out that harry's soul was ripped out as a baby and the horcrux developed and replaced his soul. Is Harry/Voldemort. I think I remember there being a thing where Voldemort pretends to be younger and they say they met through a homosexual support penpal service. If anyone has a link to the fic I am thinking about it would be greatly appreciated
