It doesn't necessarily have to be a canon Death Eater, it can even be an OC character. Hell, I'll even give a Lucius/Bellatrix fic a shot; I'm just looking for something, anything, like this. Any time is fine as well, pre/during/post-Second Wizarding War. Recommendations? :3


** Try out linkffn(Wish Carefully by Ten Toes). It doesn't technically feature Lucius as a lead character, but he is the narrator and the story focuses on Death Eaters handling an AU post-war environment. It is Lucius reflecting and soul searching via a depressing monologue.
