An amusing fic with what is probably Harry Potter as a voice in a young Tom Riddle's head. linkffn(10972919)


** This chapter seemed much weirder than previous ones. The absence of buildup for the enemy if jarring, and having it wrap up this quick is weird. Also, should Jerry really have been mindwiped if Tom had his memory modified?

** I never notice that Jerry could be Harry

I always thought that he was a SI self-aware (like deadpoll)

*** Yeah, I always had the impression he was a Muggle, given his inability to actually help Tom with any spell incantations.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
