:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The primary thing I remember about this fic was the Triwizard Tournament took place at Beauxbatons instead of Hogwarts. But it's an old (early 00's) abandoned WIP where Harry has a much younger brother who's thought to be the chosen one. I think Sirius is raising them? The details are fuzzy but it suddenly popped into my head and I can't rest until I at least have a name! I think the word Prince was involved somehow either in the title or in the author's name.

Thanks!
