So maybe Peter's lawyer argues duress on the Secret Keeper thing, and unproven on the spying charges and deaths of 13 muggles. Maybe Peter gives testimony against the Death Eaters, or his living with the Weasleys without ever harming them is used as evidence of good character.

In any case, does anyone know any fics where Peter becomes a free man, before or after serving time in Azkaban? In time to be relevant to the story?
