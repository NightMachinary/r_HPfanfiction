I haven't written a fanfiction before and while I wanna write for other fandoms as well, Harry Potter is different since it's a book series with so many details and characters. I'm mainly interested in minor characters but I still wanna read the source material and it is a LOT to read. Do I have to read every book first? Is there anything general from the books/movies that I should really pay attention to and take in? Please leave suggestions!


** Ahem.

I've been reading HP fanics for a couple years (I think) and I have yet to read more than the 1st book--and that was when it first came out. My husband got me hooked by reading parts of a particularly amusing fic to me and I finally demanded he send me the link and stop interrupting me! And here we are; I'm plotting my own story (based on the books, not so much the movies).

I've watched bits and pieces of the movies. But mostly I look for text online, read the various wikis and the HP Lexicon. Pottermore used to be helpful (especially with all the articles written by Rowling herself), but since it became the Wizarding World website, I can't find anything on it! My husband is also pretty helpful that way as well.

Personally, I'd say go ahead. But do your research. Start reading the books for the fuller experience. Maybe check out other fics involving those characters but don't feel bound to those. But there are timelines and an awful lot of the books is available for free online if you look for them. (I spent the better part of a week looking for direct quotes about Death Eater masks; the white/silver mask is a movie invention, it seems.) And you know about the wikis. Look up the Harry Potter Lexicon if you haven't. And run it past a fan who knows the books if you know someone.

** I honestly think that the fanfic lore has become enough of its own beast that you don't necessarily have to have read them. I haven't gone back to read them for about a decade, tbh.

Especially when it comes to the minor characters. The fact is that Rowling didn't really have very in-depth characterisation of most of the minor characters, so a lot of what we now ‘know' about a lot of them comes front he fandom taking what Rowling wrote and coming to their own conclusions. Which means that while anyone reading might have their own picture of that character, you're able to bring your own take and you can't exactly be wrong.

Maybe reading some character sketches by people like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/3224972/HecateA][Hecate A]] who is particularly prolific (like actually breathtakingly prolific) with slice of life and character sketches will help you get a feel for the world and characters, but writing your own will also help

In the end though I think just starting to write is the best thing. If you can find a beta who is knowledgeable and can discuss characterisation with you, that might give you a bit more confidence? But most of us are just at the level that we're at, and that's ok. Fandoms thrive when there is fresh blood lmao

** The wiki is great for small details, though I'd read the books first so you know the breadth of what is possible in the HP verse.

** I don't think you need to read the books at all. Maybe people have only seen the movies and that's it. Any questions you have about minor characters you can look at google for answers.

*** Seems fair enough. I'll probably read them anyway for the extra details and just for fun, but thank you so much!

Hmm...I don't think I can decide between garlic and holy symbols...or maybe a pitchfork! Can't argue with the classics.

If you're making a movie, then sure, it just needs to be movie-compliant. But if you're writing a story, IMO, it's the movies that don't matter; you should be book-compliant.

** You are fine, do whatever you want. If you start reading the Rowling books and like them, then great. If you're not into them and reading them feels like work, you don't have any duty to keep going. To my tastes, the Rowling books were not very good and lots of fanfic is better, but it's completely a subjective thing. The HP universe as shown in fanfic is so much more detailed than Rowling's that it's fine if you don't read Rowling and just try to follow the general characterizations etc. that you see in other HP fic.

Are there any particular HP fics that you liked?

I guess reading the first 3 Rowling books could help you get settled in. They introduce the main characters and devices. They get worse after that as Rowling stopped allowing badly needed edits.

*** One fic I particularly liked (a character analysis fic and one of the first I read for HP) is called “The Fine Art of Poisoning” by Silver Sailor Ganymede on FF.net. Blaise is one of my favorite characters and it really introduced me to the world and especially the Voldemort and war conflict. I'll probably read the books gradually along with fanfiction (which I've been binging).

** It's really not that much so I recommend reading the books at least once.

If one is a type of person who finds reading difficult or bothersome then I don't think they can write. At the very least I don't want to see what they could write.

*** It's not that it's difficult, it can just be time consuming since it's several books. But you're right all the same.

** For what its worth, JK Rowling gives minor characters next to no characterization at all. So besides knowing their names, and maybe a little bit of information about them, they are essentially going to be original characters anyway. Its funny, whilst I think this is kind of shit writing, its one of the main reasons why I like Harry Potter fanfics so much. Using Daphne Greengrass as an example, due to us not knowing anything about her besides her name, different authors take different approaches to writing her, and I find it fascinating to see what people come up with.

*** It's funny cause I love Daphne Greengrass! I've created this version of her in my head. It's interesting when it's basically an OC with a place in canon.

** I think it really depends on the kind of story you want to write. Some people write MuggleAUs where nothing is canon and the only thing resembling Harry Potter in their stories is the name of the characters and their personalities

*** I've read about different characters through the wikia, articles, vids, and have watched movie clips. I can picture most of them in my head and the ones I'm most interested in I've looked more into, but since most of my current favs are minor in the book it might not be as important to read every book first for them.
