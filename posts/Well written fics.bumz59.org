I've recently read Shadow of Angmar after putting it off for months to read pure fluff to get me through finals and damn, it was amazing. My problem after reading a really well written fic is that anything I try to read afterwards doesnt measure up.

So I'm looking for fics where my only requirement is they are novel quality; good story flow, grammar spelling etc. Crossover or older characters are preferred but not required.

**** It was amazing! Its start caught my attention, as it gave an aura of mystery, and it kept that mystery going on most of the time. It expanded a lot on the world of Harry Potter by talking (But not information dumping) the history of the wizarding world. Then, while you are reading, suddenly there are many plot twists that left me shocked and with a strange feeling in my stomach. A feeling made of shock, horror, excitement, and wonder. I can't talk about it much here without spoiling it so I can't talk much, but you can PM me on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] . My username is ishaalimtiaz17 .

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/547431/chapters/974693]] - Far Beyond a Promise Kept by Oliversnape. Haven't read this one, but have read others by that author. Mentor Snape

The Definition of Home (+ sequels) - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/329404/chapters/531524]] - Mentor Snape

Digging for the Bones - Paganaidd -[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6782408/1/Digging-for-the-Bones]] - Warning for beyond-canonical child abuse

Better Be Slytherin - [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3736151/1/Better-Be-Slytherin]] - mentor Snape and Slyth!Harry

A Brother to Basilisks - I read this one a long time ago and can't remember if it holds up [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10748108/1/A-Brother-to-Basilisks]]

Cambiare series by JordanGrant - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/714361/chapters/1321936]]. Warning: this is very AU, explicit Snarry. Not underage as Harry has been aged up by the author, but Harry is eighteen, so be mindful of that.

Blackpool by TheDivineComedian - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663/chapters/34132413]] I normally hate Black fic, so it's saying something that I enjoyed this one.

** I just finished (well, caught up with) Shadow of Angmar too! It was nice to explore Middle Earth without the time constraints of the ring quest.

This may attract downvotes, but Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality /does/ match your request. Opinions of it are very mixed, especially regarding Harry's personality (many people find him insufferable), but the prose quality is solid, and as a whole, it's both funny and thought-provoking.

I recommend checking it out if you haven't already, just so you can form your own opinion about it either way. Also, I'd suggest starting with the alternate beginning, linkffn(Daystar's remix of HPMOR), which expands the first four chapters and aims to bring their quality more in line with the rest of the work.

** Definitely Basilisk-Born. It is a non-cliched time travel fic that I think that it might measure up to your standards. I love time travel and it's hard to find a good time travel story after watching Steins;Gate, but when I read Basilisk-Born by Ebenbild I found it amazing! You should read it for yourself to find out, as I really am not good at summaries.
