I read it a couple of months ago, I forgot what the title / who the author was..

It is a fic where Hermione wrote some letters where she thought she was in love with them but never bothered to send it anyway. TIA


** It's *Love, Hermione by UntoldHarmony* linkao3(17184209) inspired by Jenny Han's novel "To All The Boys I've Loved Before"

  Hermione wrote letters to all of the wizards she had ever loved. They were never meant to be owled, but alas. One-shot, pure fluff AU fic inspired by Jenny Han's novel.
