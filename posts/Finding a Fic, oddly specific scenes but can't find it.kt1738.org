:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm not too sure if what I've written counts as spoiler? but yeah

So I'm trying to find a fix that I read a while ago (I think of FFnet but could be AO3) and I remember certain details but I think it's almost too specific because Google hasn't helped at all or I've just mixed several different fics into one

So I remember certain scenes one where Harry makes what I think was wards for the Burrow as a gift to Molly and he ropes the Weasley Children to help. They have to use their own DNA (so saliva or etc.) to set up the wards around the house and then Harry and Dumbledore on the roof set up the wards to protect the house. Later on in the fic, because of those wards, Fred's soul is still around and kept inside so somehow Harry revives him and you know happily ever after

I THINk (no promises) in the same fic that Harry restarts the DA or some sort of duelling club and teaches the other houses and year groups to fight setting up a pretty efficient mode of teaching with Golden Trio, Neville and some others as leaders (Cedric I think ?) and either Snape or Flitwick (don't remember) in the room to oversee everything. They're obviously settled in the Room of Requirement which changes the terrain and everything sometimes. I think there was also a scene where they split into teams and played essentially 'tag' with three on three

This I'm not too sure was in the same fic but another scene I 'remember' reading was Harry sitting at the other tables during dinner causing a bit of an uproar and talking to the younger year groups (that he was teaching maybe?) and taking turns sitting at each table which kinda sends ripples - I think I remember this being quite early on in the fic but yeah.

If anyone can point me in the right direction I'd appreciate it! I'm half convinced I've made these up but I'm pretty sure I remember reading these scenes and it's been bugging me for a while


** Took me a minute to find it.

*** Thank you!! I've been trying to find it for a while, I'll admit I kinda glossed over the longer fanfics whilst I was reading and I must have missed it
