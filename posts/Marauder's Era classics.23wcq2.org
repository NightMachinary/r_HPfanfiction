Haven't read a well-written fanfic in a while now so please hook me up with some suggestions! Marauder's Era ofcourse.


** BajaB's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder][Dark Marauder]] is quite good. 13k words, complete.

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot. "Voldemort is gone, but the others are still out there. They took the sunshine from my life, Sirius. I want to return the favor. We kill them. We kill them all."

#+begin_quote
  In an alternate universe, one man still struggles with a moral decision made many years before. Warning: Themes of suicide; reference to major character death.

**** You're welcome! Her AU stuff is done brilliantly as well, although I do prefer her 'Where Dwell the Brave at Heart', 'Daring, Nerve and Chivalry' and 'The Gospel According to Lupin'.

** A lot of Marauder era classics has elements of R/S slash, in the foreground or background, so it'd be nice if you can specify that.

Anyway:

1. Shoebox Project - THE Marauder era fic. This is the fic that created the entire genre, and most of the fandom trope for it. Slight R/S in the end, but its gen for most of the fic.

2. Obsessive Lily Disorder - One of the premier L/J fic. I fell off my chair reading this, laughing my ass off. There is a sequel, but its incomplete though.

3. The Life and Times - The L/J fandom defining fic. Just as SBP created most of the fandom tropes for the era and the R/S ship, TLAT defined the L/J ship.

*** Well, I mostly prefer J/L really, but everything's okay as long as it is Marauder's Era.

Looked into first chapter of the Shoebox Project and it seems awesome so far, will definitely continue reading it.

OLD is also great and TLAT is my so far favourite J/L, Jewels' really got a great style of writing. Can't wait until she releases the next chapter.
