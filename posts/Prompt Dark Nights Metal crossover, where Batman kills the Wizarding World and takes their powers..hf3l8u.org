This would be in a version of the DC multiverse where Wizards live in the DC Universe. One of the Dark Knights is a version of Batman who stole the Wizarding World's powers, and goes to Diagon Alley and turns it into his own kingdom. This would be during the Second Wizarding War, which is interrupted by Dark Bruce's taking over of Diagon Alley.


** Why stop at Dark Bruce when you could throw The Batman Who Laughs in there for his really insane moments...

Now I'm seeing Robins with red hair.

**** Yikes, I just read the prompt and saw The Batman Who Laughs (Since he's the leader of the Dark Knights) wandering around with three Robins he affectionately calls "Roonil".

It's funny when certain words provoke certain images. Now I'm seeing Bryce Wayne being the Guardian of the Black Lake. I already feel sorry for the mermaids.

Beside, The Joker and The Batman Who Laughs aren't the same (Similar to a point, eh maybe). Joker loves to play games as twisted as they may be but TBWL smashes the game, the pieces, the board and the other players.

Wait a moment.... The Batman Who Laughs - TBWL - The Boy Who Lived.... HARRY IS THE BATMAN WHO LAUGHED CONFIRMED!
