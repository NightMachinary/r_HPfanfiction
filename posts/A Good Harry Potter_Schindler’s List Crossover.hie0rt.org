** I wouldn't touch this topic with a 10-foot-pole.

I think it's very difficult to place the Holocaust and reality-warping wizards next to each other and write a tactful story because you either have to answer the question "how could they let this happen", or you can make it not happen. This is very, very easy to do wrong. A prompt like this risks a fic on the same level as [[https://www.toplessrobot.com/2008/12/fan_ficition_friday_goku_and_anne_frank_in_until_t.php][Goku x Anne Frank]]

** That would be in bad taste. One is a children's fantasy series. Other is based on real events about the Holocaust. These two should never come near each other.

** You could play up the Death Eaters=Nazis thing, have a wizard save muggleborns from Voldemort's concentration camps.

*** Have a /death eater/ save muggleborns from Voldemort's camps.

Oskar Schindler was a member of the Nazi party who's biggest claim to fame was saving thousands of Jews from Hitler's camps.
