  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

** Well, I'm not sure about “best” there, but it's definitely decent if not good, it definitely is AU (in fact, the author could have changed the names and a few minor elements and released this as an original story), it definitely isn't recommended all that often (I think I'm the only person recommending it as of lately), and its name is “Hell Eyes” (linkffn(2686394)).

** Not sure exactly what type of AU you're looking for, but my go-to for lesser-known AUs is linkffn(Reign of the Serpent). Excellent world building, several fascinating concepts that are each probably worth their own fic, and a great look at Hermione's more ruthless tendencies, if you're a Hermione fan.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** If you don't mind something incomplete (in progress -- it updated a few days ago), I just read linkffn(Phoenix Corrupted) and found it enjoyable. There's a lot going on in there.

For a complete fic, I enjoyed linkffn(Secret Steps), though it does have a pairing I don't love.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea.
