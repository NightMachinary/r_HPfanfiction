I would like some with harry being adopted by Odin or another asgardian as a young child, him being raised by a magic based society would also be amazing if marvel has something like that


** Alright, so looking through my download list there are a few I have that kinda match this, I will start with the fics that still update. Some of these are pretty new though and dont have much. (and you have probably already read them)

Linkffn(Storm Princess) Linkffn(God of Magic and Master over Death) Linkffn(Emerald Jotun) Linkffn(The Triumph of These Tired Eyes)

**** Some of them are still quite short, and some are only BARELY anything like what you asked for, so fair warning.

Edit: I also have rather obvious leanings towards harry and Loki fics

  Thor and Loki were called to Surrey, England, to investigate a freak storm located over Privet Drive. When they arrive, they find a little girl with a lightning bolt scar living with abusive relatives. FULL SUMMARY INSIDE. I DO NOT OWN HARRY POTTER OF THE AVENGERS. FEM HARRY POTTER! SLOW UPDATES!

  The Allfather cannot place full trust in the tension filled Avengers team. Instead he sends his oldest son to assist in retrieving the Tesseract and return his two youngest sons back to Asgard. His oldest son who has not set foot on Midgard in over 2000 years. The one that carries a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and holds a certain mastery over death. [also on AO3]

  Loki was once someone people didn't know. He was once someone who had fallen head over heels in love with a man. He was once Lily Evans and if there was something he wanted more than that of the throne on Asgard it was children; his baby was on Earth and he would get him back one way or another. When he did not even Odin would take his boy from him again; he would not lose Haraldr.

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.
