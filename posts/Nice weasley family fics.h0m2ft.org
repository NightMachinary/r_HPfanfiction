Early weasley family like when ginnys still a toddler ect or something similar. It can be really fluffy and have literally no plot, actually I'd prefer that, I'm just looking for moments where they actually act like siblings and we get to see them interact and show their personalities. If you know of any lmk!

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?[ CURRENTLY ON HIATUS ]
