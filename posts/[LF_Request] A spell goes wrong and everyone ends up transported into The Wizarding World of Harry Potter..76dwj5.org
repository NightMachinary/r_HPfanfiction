** Id personally think of this as this is a ritual gone wrong when time and transportation magic is involved. Instead of putting you into a different dimension, it pulls everyone to your dimension. Then the governments world wide declare a state of emergency do to the world's population doubling in the matter of seconds.

Edit: Also thought of the consequence of the ritual is that the world's magic is damaged as the ritual looked for a new source of power when the caster wasn't enough
