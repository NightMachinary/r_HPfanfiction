Preferably ones where Scorpius is NOT like Draco as a student (i.e. not a bully).

Bonus points if 1. it's not romance 2. Scorpius has to deal with the Malfoy legacy/reputation in some way or 3. Harry and Draco are in the fic as well.

Interested to see what's out there, especially since CC came out!


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7882474][Put Your Curse In Reverse]] (275806 words) - Cursed Child compliant. It doesn't fit all your requirements - it's Scorpius/Albus and Harry/Ginny, and Potter family members play a big role - but it's told in alternating perspectives of Harry and Scorpius, Draco plays an active role, and a large part of the story deals with how Death Eater kids are treated and feel post-war.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8126590][After Godric's Hollow]] (3000 words) - Cursed Child compliant. Draco and Scorpius have a conversation after the Godric's Hollow scene. No romance in this one!

*** I'll second Put Your Curse in Reverse. You'll notice it's second in its series, but the first story is Albus/Scorpious-centric (though still very well written for the other characters) and not necessary to have read.

** linkffn(8255131) It's not post-Cursed Child but it fits your requirements. It's very well-written, Scorpius-centered (it does feature other POVs-but absolutetly Scorpius centered), deals with the Malfoy legacy and it also features Harry and Draco in minor roles. It also has two sequels and is technically preceded by linkffn(2233473) but it is not necessary to read, although I do recommend reading it.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.
