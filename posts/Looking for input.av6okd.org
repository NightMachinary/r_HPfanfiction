  Also I need inspiration for how he leaves the Magic world
#+end_quote

The Weasleys are a mess with Fred dead (maybe also kill off Arthur or Molly), Hermione goes off to restore her parents' memories (which takes months if not years), the Order is practically dead and Andromeda (who has Teddy) has given up on the magical world. There is simply nothing but suffering and misery for him there, the magical world has become what he had originally escaped from (at the Dursleys).

  Second I need some suggestions on how the Magic Wold changed while Harry was gone
#+end_quote

With both Dumbledore (with his Order) and Voldemort (and the Death Eaters) gone, the non-violent pureblood elitists (Greengrass, Parkinson, Odgen) take over by simply voting in their own favour. Instead of open repressions like Voldemort, they simply stack all laws in their favour. Less Final Solution and more Apartheid.

  pairing
#+end_quote

Maybe someone who also has nothing which keeps her in the magical world? Lavender or Hermione would be prime candidates, or maybe some background character like Demelza Robins or Padma Patil (Harry has a random run-in with them, they tell him how awful things became after he left).

*** Thanks first

I don't quite like that version of leaving. Right now I am trying to build it up in a way that has Harry feeling like he did what he needed to do and wants to life in peace and quiet but can't go into public places. I want his leaving to be a cunning sneak like move. Maybe involving some sort of lawyer etc

The second suggestion I love and the only thing about that is the wizard gammot and Minister relationship as I am not quite sure how much might one has in cannon

As for pairing I like Hermione Harry pairing and I will look into it but if it does not fit the plot it will go

It's Wizengamot and canon.

With that out of the way, there is very little in the books about how the magical government works. You can make up pretty much anything you want.

**** What about Ron and Hermione? Would Harry really leave his best friends? And would they let him vanish without looking for him?

Also, why would he want to enter the military if he feels he's done his part in the war already?

Also, why would he want to leave anyway, if he wants peace and quiet? He can visit all his friends without entering a public space thanks to apparition and floo travel. He can go to muggle London by merely stepping outside Grimmauld Place.

He can have his cake and eat it. If you want him to abandon everyone and vanish, you need a better reason than "he wants some peace" since he has that anytime he wants - no one forces him to visit Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade. So, him vanishing from Wizarding Britain wouldn't gain him anything he doesn't have already - but lose him his friends and family.

Also, would he really abandon Teddy? As an orphan himself, and Teddy's godfather? And if he doesn't, why would he abandon his best friends and the Weasleys?

#+end_quote

Abandoning Teddy and the magical world are two separate things, especially considering that Andromeda has lost her husband, her daughter and an (estranged) sister in the war and would have even more reason that Harry to leave.

#+end_quote

As pointed out above, you could make Hermione disappear in Australia for a few years. Maybe her parents decide to stay there, maybe they even had another child (since they have forgotten about her).

As for the Weasleys, you can go for anything from "lost in grief" up to "blaming Harry" if you kill more than just Fred. Maybe WWW got razed during the war. Maybe the Burrow or Shell's cottage (you can unleash Fiendfyre without knowing what exactly is hidden by the Fidelius after all). Maybe Molly's "not my daughter you bitch" fails spectacularly and Bellatrix smears the wall with her. Maybe Ron isn't coping well with Hermione's absence and takes it out on Harry.

There are countless possibilities. I think OP is refusing to acknowledge them for a trope-y outline though.

****** I'm pointing out that Harry doesn't have to abandon the Wizarding World.

I don't think that Hermione and Ron would disappear in canon Australia. They'd stay in touch. And, hey - if Harry wants to avoid the Weasleys and Andromeda while they are grieving, he can join the others in Australia. Get some distance, later get back when everything's settled some.

The whole "Harry abandons his family and friends" plot needs compelling reasons.
