Anyone else think that maybe JK Rowling went and read some fanfiction and decided to get in on the act?

I mean, come on - Nagini is a blood cursed witch? While I love it, it feels just like a few fanfiction stories I've read out there.

Yes well considering the sheer amount of fanfics, it would be considerably hard for her to come up with something new. Especially given how very little thought she has been shown to give to all her non book additions to the setting. You can find a fanfic pre-empting basically everything written on Pottermore.

  I also wonder, not for the first time, why a lot of people write Grindlewald and not Grindelwald.¯_(ツ)_/¯
#+end_quote

Because it's a German name and in English most words with that sound use /le/. Spind/le/, Cand/le/, Cast/le/, etc.

At least it's a more forgivable mistake than /Virgina/, /Hairy/, or /Dumbledoor/.

**** Incidentally, the /FB/ movies should get it in their thick skull that it's pronounces Grin-del-*V*ald, not Grin-dull-walled.

***** I can't stand the guy on the CBR YouTube channel's pronunciation of pretty much everything Harry Potter.

**** Grindelwald is actually a town in the swiss alps afaik.

It sounds very german, - Grindel - the grendel, and wald - the forest.

*** I didn't notice the spelling of Grindelwald, apparently I typed it incorrectly once and autocorrect took it from there. Thanks for pointing that out though!

** It provides more potential for lore, which is always nice. I do wonder how these blood curses ties into lycanthropy.
