**** The fact that Hogwarts is organised like a British public school of the early 20th century is the big clue that the story of the school being set up the way the Founders left it is complete bollocks. The school was founded in the 10th century, probably the late 10th century, or at least we're told as much and have to take that on trust. However, the features of the school are nearly /all/ from later periods.

- The premises. Hogwarts is a big stone castle with towers. When the school first opened those just straight up weren't invented yet. Keep-motte-and-bailey castles were the state of the art, and wouldn't spread to the British Isles until 1066 at the earliest. The first Hogwarts 'castle' would have been a hill-fort - a protected enclosure with otherwise normal buildings inside, possibly with some Roman influence on the design since it was being at least laid out by academics. The current premises are 13th century at the /earliest/, although it's quite possible that they incorporate older elements like an Iron-age Broch and, if the Founders did their Roman influence right, a basilica later repurposed as, say, the Entrance Hall.

- The Houses. These didn't start appearing in schools until the late 15th century, when the cost of schools dropped to the point where more people could afford to educate their kids. The schools could educate more boys than they could board, so boarding houses would set up nearby to allow out-of-town boys to attend the school as day-boys. The schools slowly took over the running of those houses, and an inevitable rivalry sprung up between the houses themselves and between the houses all together and the boys who lived in the school proper, because boys will use any excuse for a brawl and it was seen as a good thing back then. Hogwarts pre-dates this by half a millennium and whatever the reason for dividing the school, it wasn't pressure on their boarding accommodation.

- Merlin. The only canon source for Merlin having attended Hogwarts is Pottermore, so take that with a pinch of salt, but some of the /sources/ for the historical Merlin pre-date Hogwarts, never mind the man himself. One of the later ones, interestingly, have him changing his name to Lailoken, going mad, and living in what is now Scotland (and would then be either Alba or Strathclyde, Scotland wouldn't be unified until the 12th century) and meeting St. Mungo/Kentigern at Partick. So it's possible that Merlin /was/ on the site of what later became Hogwarts and the remains of his old dwelling are incorporated in the school somewhere.

- The whole Slytherin thing. It's not plausible that a man might help found a school whose admissions policy he didn't agree with, remain there long enough to make a significant contribution to its architecture, and then decide he can't abide the admissions policy and flounce out. What /is/ plausible is that a man with a Basque name and a clear connection with a major Basque mystery cult would have a major hate-on for the Franks - Roncevaux Pass, Roland's Last Stand, was Basque revenge for Charlemagne sacking and burning Pamplona - and he retired once the Franks took control of England in 1066 - the majority of Hogwarts' catchment - rather than educate Frankish kids. (The bit in Pottermore where JKR says the Malfoys came over with William makes the Malfoy association with Slytherin House particularly funny in this context.)

There's a lot more and at some point I should either write this shit down or at least sketch out a story that puts it across, but basically the Doylist interpretation is that JKR sucks at history as well as mathematics (her presentation of the Witch Panics is terrible, for one thing, and don't get me started on Nearly Headless Nick And His Obvious Lies) and the Watsonian interpretation is that the wizarding world is actually slightly /worse/ than the muggle world for rewriting history to suit modern political purposes.

****** The main one is what he was executed for: beheading was the penalty for /treason/, not well-intentioned incompetence in orthodontic spellcasting. And, at that, it was reserved for peers: as a mere knight, Sir Nicholas is a commoner, and should have been hanged, drawn and quartered for that offence, the beheading being posthumous.

More generally, Sir Nicholas is lying about at least one of:

- who he is, because a mere knight wouldn't be beheaded for /anything/ - he'd hang, or be hanged, drawn and quartered if his offence was serious enough.

- what he did, because beheading was reserved for treason, or, if he'd done it in the Liberty of Halifax, theft of goods valued at more than 13 pence ha'penny.

- When he died, because he's seen wearing a doublet and a ruff, articles which wouldn't come in to fashion for decades after the date he claims for his death.

Internal and external features can be added and removed at will, with access to the right magic. So the Room of Requirement could easily have been original, and just found new access points as the castle was changed around it. Or, like, the Hufflepuff dorms would have always stayed near the kitchens, even though those might have originally been in a different place.

Do they? What we see in the books is that Gringotts /isn't a bank/. It's a storage rental company, absent customer involvement they don't even check on the vaults more often than every ten years or so. Now, they /may/ be running actual banking services, but we don't see that in canon, still less the elaborate concierge service that fanon has them running.

They mint the coins (and almost certainly debase them if a golden galleon exchanges at five quid sterling), contract curse-breakers to 'defuse' ancient Egyptian tombs, and make artefacts for people apparently too stupid/ignorant to understand the concept of 'leasehold for life term' (a concept so old it turns up in the laws of the Roman Republic). None of these things grant control over an economy the way an actual banking monopoly would.

I doubt there's a ward in the world that could truly hold up to the wrath of an entire magical nation for any meaningful length, and without wards mere stone is little obstacle to a trained wizard (vanish it, transfigure it, blast it to bits, or just apparate through once you bring down anti apparition wards), to say nothing of subterfuge with spells like the Imperius.

With the exception of the Death Eaters and clear nasty witches like Umbridge, a few rough edges does not make someone an asshole or a horrible human being through and through. Every single character in this series, bar none, does something offensive, obnoxious or dumb at one point or another; that's what makes them realistic and compelling.

2. The fandom seems to have completely accepted that Snape was abused (from our image of him cowering as his father yells at Eileen) but is unsure about Sirius (who we see called worthless/an abomination, etc. /directly/). As an American reader, it strikes me as possibly a classist point that I don't have the cultural nuance to fully understand. But I disagree with it, nevertheless.

3. HBP is generally useless and the important elements could easily have been shifted to other books and the overarching story would remain the same

The indywanking phase (or as the Japanese call it, the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chuunibyou][Chuunibyou Phase]]) happens to most people at some point as they grow older. Symptoms of going through the phase include the discovery and veneration of Nietzsche, Marx, Dawkins, and Eliezer Yudkowsky.

******* Anyone with even a remote understanding of Nietzsche realizes that he wasn't some sort of macho teen edgelord philosopher (hit an "indywanking" teen with the concept of amor fati, and I'm sure that you'll find they don't like Nietzsche very much at all), but that's ignored by both fans and detractors in favor of easily digestible pop philosophy quotes about the abyss staring back at you. The fact that someone would include Nietzsche and Yudkowsky in the same sentence is honestly hilarious, but there are a lot of edgy kids out there who've read about 10 pages of Thus Spoke Zarathustra and canonise Nietzsche.

Also, even though Dawkins is kind of a prick and somewhat of a dinosaur nowadays, there was a time when he was a legitimately influential scientist. Without him we wouldn't even have the concept of the meme and memetics.

** Fanon “wards” are dumb.

I am not talking about the Canon “protections” that wizards can cast on a person or a building. I am talking about the idea of an over arching series of protective enchantments that render buildings impervious. I am also talking about the idea of “war wards” that are capable of offensive action.

If we take the fanon interpretation of wards, Death Eaters have no chance at ever being successful, anywhere, ever. People could just turn their ward systems on, and everyone would be safe in their own house/business. These wards, if they were so easily producible and maintainable, would be literally everywhere in the Harry Potter universe. There would be no way for the DEs to instigate a reign of terror the way they are heavily implied to have done so.

If you take protections as we see them in the books, they are more physical protections, such as the moving statues, or it took the combined efforts of multiple adult spellcasters working in concert to set up even a single temporary protective barrier. That barrier was also quickly and fairly easily broken by one wizard. Granted, that wizard was exceptional - Voldemort - but he blasted through it with one blast of magic.

If you eliminate the fanon concept of wards, the death eaters become a true threat. Their ability to hold people hostage is greatly increased. Knowing that no matter what you have set up in your house, they can come, find you, and kill your whole family in the night without much effort makes the DEs truly terrifying. It also makes the entire purpose of secrecy and the Fidelius charm that the Potters used much more believable and necessary.

This is most obvious whenever a fic introduces wards as a concept, then they almost immediately parent with the idea of a “ward breaker” or “warding specialist“ who can somehow negate the protections that these wards offer. Why introduce concepts like this, if you could just have someone negate the concepts altogether just by a few specialized magic spells?

If a bunch of skilled and powerful wizards attack your home, they're not going to last long. If Voldemort comes knocking, your wards may as well not exist.

Murderer after him. Leaves the supervision of adults and goes into town. Doesn't drop Divination which he is rubbish at and the teacher singles him out. Hurts his friendship with Hermione over a racing broom that might kill him.

Map that is known to be accurate against disguises thanks to Peter Pettigrew. So the plan for Moody being Barty Crouch is not run up to Dumbledore within 3 seconds?

Got his godfather killed. At least 1 teacher that isn't Snape could probably contact Dumbledore or check on Sirius directly. Or Dobby. Totally ignoring the fact here that Voldemort is known to 'kill the spare', goes into the trap and brings his friends.

Hurts his friendship with Hermione over a book for a class he wasn't going to take anyway. Pisses away time while knowing he is Voldemort's #1 target.

And the whole "supporting wheels" idea around fanfic is inaccurate, imho. Some people use fanfic to GIT GUD so when they start their original novel, they already know how to structure and pace a story with the right character and emotional beats. Some other people aren't interested in writing original novels at all. It's kind of like telling a musician to stop playing Mozart, stop singing covers of their favorite popstars, and start composing their own works. Not everyone is interested or motivated by the potential to monetize.

It would be comparable to asking, "Why doesn't everyone just become a stockbroker or hedgefund manager?"

** - Based on the OotP duel, Voldemort was better at magic than Dumbledore and would beat him in a fair fight.

- The "magic in the air" at Hogwarts is not a reference to some kind of atmospheric effect. Hogwarts is magical in the same way as music, love and Toys R Us.

- There is not (and can never be) any Muggle weapon which could overcome a Shield Charm.

- The relatively informal, semi-autocratic nature of the Ministry is a reasonable and appropriate form of governance for a small community where everyone knows everyone else, where the entire citizenry is armed to the teeth, and where the executive could easily be ejected from power by an angry mob. Introduction of separation of powers, codified constitutions etc. is excessive constitutional formality for the size of the community. It would be like setting up a supreme court for your book club.

- "Plot armour" is not an authorial oversight, it is a key part of the Harry Potter universe. Consider that the DADA curse manipulates events so that they work out "just so" to always eject the DADA Professor by the end of the year. Or consider the way in which Felix Felicis makes events work out so that your endeavours are successful. The idea that the universe has a "plot" (or, if you will, a fate) is part of the HP magic system. "Plot armour" is therefore not authorial interference, it's the characters playing the game. Dumbledore and Harry had a superior understanding of the poetic nature of fate than Voldemort did (who continually "tempted fate"), which was Voldemort's ultimate downfall.

- Further to the above, the nature of Hogwarts' most powerful defensive magic is not specific enchantments (sometimes called "wards") but rather that fate will almost always work out okay for its students. The school is sufficiently magical that it manipulates and bends fate. It would take an equally momentous power - like Voldemort himself - to displace that protection, and even then he would not attempt to do so lightly.

****** For the sake of comprehensiveness I'll just quote my whole blurb on the Shield Charm.

We shall start off by noting that the Shield Charm varies considerably in power. When Harry first learns it in GoF, his Shield Charm is extremely weak:

#+begin_quote
  He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx, and Harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counter-jinx. (GoF Chapter 31)
#+end_quote

Contrast this with the situation at the end of OotP:

#+begin_quote
  For a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy, but then he saw Moody's magical eye spinning away across the floor.

  Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his long pale face twisted with glee.

  “Tarantallegra!” he shouted, his wand pointing at Neville, whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap-dance, unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again. “Now, Potter -”

  He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, “Protego!”

  Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife; the force of it knocked him sideways and he fell over Neville's jerking legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell.(OotP Chapter 35)
#+end_quote

And then in HBP:

#+begin_quote
  “Pathetic, Weasley,” said Snape, after a while. “Here --- let me show you ---”

  He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, he yelled, “Protego!”

  His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had looked around and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling. (HBP Chapter 9)
#+end_quote

So Harry's Shield Charm goes from barely being able to stop a minor jinx to being able to block powerful spells from some of the most powerful wizards around. What does this tell us? It tells us that the wizarding world does not have many different Shield Charms of varying strength, but rather just the one Shield Charm that can be cast weakly or strongly, depending on the abilities of the caster.

We will next note that the Shield Charm can vary considerably in effect. It blocks spells as above, but we see its behaviour change in different situations. For example, it can also reflect spells:

#+begin_quote
  “Stupefy!” yelled Harry. He had edged right around to where the goblin stood beaming up at the now headless wizard and taken aim at her back as she peered around the fountain. She reacted so fast he barely had time to duck.

  “Protego!”

  The jet of red light, his own Stunning Spell, bounced back at him. Harry scrambled back behind the fountain and one of the goblin's ears went flying across the room. (OotP Chapter 36)
#+end_quote

Another change is that it can be used to block physical things:

#+begin_quote
  "You -- crawl -- back -- here -- after -- weeks -- and -- weeks -- oh, where's my wand?"

  She looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry's hands and he reacted instinctively.

  "Protego!"

  The invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione. The force of it knocked her backward onto the floor. Spitting hair out of her mouth, she leapt up again. (DH Chapter 19)
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  “Harry, I think I can hear people coming!” said Hermione, and she pointed Bellatrix's wand at the waterfall and cried, “Protego!” They saw the Shield Charm break the flow of enchanted water as it flew up the passageway. (DH Chapter 26)
#+end_quote

The above also indicates that you can "throw" a Shield Charm - this one cast by Hermione "flew up the passageway" away from the caster.

Further, the shape and size of the Shield Charm can change. We know from the GoF quote above that its “normal” behaviour is to form an “invisible wall around” the caster. But it can also be used as, for example, a wall:

#+begin_quote
  Harry felt as though he turned into slow motion: he saw McGonagall, Kingsley and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort's fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb. Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at Molly Weasley.

  "Protego!" roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the Hall, and Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last. (DH Chapter 36).
#+end_quote

Finally we will note that with changes to the incantation, the effect of the spell can be changed more substantially. For example, its use as a long term, large scale protection:

#+begin_quote
  “If we're staying, we should put some protective enchantments around the place,” she replied, and raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide circle around Harry and Ron, murmuring incantations as she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding air: It was as if Hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing. “Salvio Hexia . . . Protego Totalum . . . Repello Muggletum . . . Muffliato . . . You could get out the tent, Harry. . . .” (DH Chapter 14).
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  “I can act from here,” said Flitwick, and although he could barely see out of it, he pointed his wand through the smashed window and started muttering incantations of great complexity. Harry heard a weird rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the grounds.

  “Professor,” Harry said, approaching the little Charms master, “Professor, I'm sorry to interrupt, but this is important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?”

  “--- Protego Horribilis --- the diadem of Ravenclaw?” squeaked Flitwick. (DH Chapter 30)
#+end_quote

We don't know what “Protego Horribilis” does, but the incantation (and its use in battle) may suggest that it is a kind of “horrible protection” which harms those who attempt to breach it. Alternatively it may be a variation which makes the shield stronger than normal against Dark magic.

So we see that the Shield Charm varies considerably in behaviour. It is not the case that there exist many different Shield Charms, each protecting you from a different class of threats, or acting in different ways. Rather, there is just one Shield Charm, which is used to protect against all potentially harmful things, and which can be adjusted to perform different tasks depending on the ability and intention of the caster. We should also pay attention to the fact that the more extreme changes require a change in the incantation.

Note that the Shield Charm's ability to vary in effect does not mean it is always the most appropriate protective spell. For example, to prevent a large number of objects from touching you, the Impervius Charm is more appropriate:

#+begin_quote
  With screams of pain Ron, Hermione, and the two goblins were knocked aside into other objects, which also began to replicate. Half buried in a rising tide of red-hot treasure, they struggled and yelled as Harry thrust the sword through the handle of Hufflepuff's cup, hooking it onto the blade.

  “Impervius!” screeched Hermione in an attempt to protect herself, Ron, and the goblins from the burning metal.

  Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down: Ron and Hermione were waist-deep in treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out of sight and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view. (DH Chapter 26)
#+end_quote

This Charm allowed Ron and Hermione to stand waist-deep in objects hot enough to burn a hole in Ron's shoe, though it didn't prevent the Goblins from becoming submerged beneath them. The Shield Charm might have been able to achieve the same, but with the objects already pressing in on them, perhaps it was too late for that.

Another example of the Shield Charm being inappropriate is if you believe someone is about to kill you (i.e. use the Killing Curse). In that situation, you will want to conjure a physical defence:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore flicked his own wand: the force of the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his golden guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it. The spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gong-like note reverberated from it - an oddly chilling sound.

  “You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?” called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. (OotP Chapter 36)

********** Yes, but a shield charm is a defence against magical and, to some degree, physical attacks. It does not, for example, protect you from suffocating when there is no breathable air around. Or from high temperatures. There are other spells for that.

And that's not even talking about radiation poisoning. Maybe you could develop a spell which would protect you against it. But, it would require a deeper understanding of radiation, which the magical world seems to lack considering their general attitude to the scientific method. And a lot of people would have to die before they get that new spell right since radiation is dangerous to experiment with.

*********** Radiation causes... the degradation of cells, cancer, illness as your body does not understand what is happening? I don't think any of that can't be fixed by magic. I think the only question, at least down that front, that needs to be asked is what makes ‘dark' magic and curses so special that they cannot be cured. What makes it necessary for a venerated ‘hero' like Mad Eye to die with a thousand pockmarked scars and half his body missing? /And/ then, what exactly about electrical equipment causes it to break down around magicals, do they emit their own type of radiation that conflicts or supersedes the background hum of technology? Is magic another type of element? The manipulation of things so small we cannot comprehend them by a human-like body? No answers we could readily get from the base material and nothing I've found in the extended content, unfortunately.

I, of course, agree with your general statement. There is a spell for everything, or nearly so - at least from what we have seen.

********* The thing is, if you stand under a nuke when it detonates, you will be subjected to extreme temperatures which possibly even ignite the air, massive amounts of pressure and radiation as well as side effects like the lack of oxygen. And a shield charm does neither include a radiation shield nor an air supply or flame freezing abilities. So even if you miraculously survive the explosion, you'd need to drop the shield to cast other spells or you die. And once you drop the shield, you die.

Artillery barrage come with the same issue, just on a smaller scale. Toxic fumes, hell even just the noise from the shells exploding in your face would seriously mess you up. And a shield charm is not a silencing charm nor a bubblehead one.

********** Factual correction: Shield Charms are perfectly capable of persisting while you cast other magic, you don't have to actively maintain them. We see characters cast shields then cast other spells many times in canon (several of them are quoted above).

In any event, I think you're conflating two different issues here. The Shield Charm's ability to block whatever is harmful does not mean that it isn't /still a shield/. It prevents harmful effects from passing through the barrier. It does not transform the environment around you. Nor does it expel harmful effects that already exist in your environment.

If you're in a cold environment and you cast the shield charm, it's not going to warm you up because it's already cold within the area of protection. All it will do is stop further cold from penetrating the shield.

Similarly, if you're underwater and you cast the Shield Charm, you're already underwater. It's not going to do much re: air supply. If you vanish the water within the shield, the shield would prevent more water from entering, but it's not going to convert the water into air. With the exception of Hermione's "thrown" shield, all the shields we've seen have been fixed in place - they don't move with the caster. So that is one of the reasons why Harry couldn't use it for the second task, casting it above water then moving into the water (the other being he didn't know the Shield Charm yet, because it is advanced magic).

I take it as a given that if you cast the shield charm after a nuclear bomb's effects have reached you, it's already too late. But if you cast it before the effect hits you, then the harmful effects of the nuclear blast will be prevented from passing the barrier. It's not going to vanish the entire explosion. It's going to create a cocoon of protection (from which the wizard will likely disapparate promptly). The area around you will not be stripped of air because for that to happen the harmful effect of the blast would first have to pierce your protection.

As for the apparent redundancy: there are many ways to skin a cat. The existence of an advanced general protection does not mean that more specific protections cannot exist (much like the Locomotion Charm, which allows you to direct objects to go wherever you like, does not mean the rather more limited Levitation Charm does not exist). Here are some key differences between the Shield Charm and the Flame Freezing charm:

1. The Shield Charm is advanced magic which few wizards can properly cast, whereas it is expected that the Flame Freezing Charm is within the capabilities of most wizards (going by the commentary in Harry's book in PoA).

2. The Shield Charm acts as a barrier, whereas the Flame Freezing Charm acts as an immunity. The Shield Charm would block fire from reaching you, whereas the Flame Freezing Charm allows fire to reach you (you can still feel the fire) but redefines fire as harmless (it causes no damage or pain).

3. The Shield Charm blocks magical attacks as well as non-magical ones, whereas we don't know if the Flame Freezing Charm is capable of rendering magical flame harmless (I suspect not, or only a limited amount, given that it's supposed to be a simple charm).

4. The Flame Freezing Charm is cast upon a person (and perhaps objects), whereas the Shield Charm is cast on a space.

*********** But the bit about Hermione's shield sounds like it would be directional magic (eg a big, magical shield and not a cocoon). So it should not be effective against explosions because pressure equalises itself and would simply bend around the shield.

The other issue is a lack of a clear-cut definition what counts as a danger. To stay with the radiation example: Say you can shield the nuke itself. Now the land around you is irradiated, but it is not attacking you. Therefore you should still be dead. What if someone attacks a nuclear facility and causes another Tschernobyl? Would you be safe if you were there while the attack happened but not safe if you got there later? How much leeway do you get until it is too late? Why do you get X leeway and not amount Y? Would it count if you were underway.

Also, speed is another thing. You say

************ As stated in the original Shield Charm post above, the shape of the spell can be adapted. It was introduced in GoF as omni-directional, which therefore seems to be its "default" shape, but we've also seen it used as a kind of wall.

I think the definition of danger is simple enough:

A Shield Charm will attempt to block X if and only if X would cause harm to the caster, were it not for the Shield Charm blocking it.

Replace "caster" with whatever thing the Shield Charm has been cast to protect as appropriate.

The point about the shield still acting as a shield was not intended as a restriction on the class of things which the shield charm considers harmful, but rather a description of the way in which a shield manifests (i.e. as a barrier).

In the "irradiated land" section, the land around you would be irradiated, but the land within the shield would not be, since it was (and is) within the zone of protection. The irradiated land around you is harmful, so the shield would continue to block that radiation. You would only begin to receive radiation from outside your barrier if you dropped it.

A person who apparated into the immediate aftermath of a nuclear explosion, however, would already be standing on irradiated ground at the time of producing their barrier. So the ground within the barrier would continue to harm them.

(All of the above assuming that radiation is harmful to wizards, who don't seem to get cancer.)

Indeed. If you're anywhere near ground zero, do not have pre-existing magical protections in place, and do not see the attack coming in any way (e.g. through some form of danger detector) then yes, you're going to be dead before you can react.

If you're at a decent distance, the initial radiation will likely not be too harmful (especially to a wizard, given their more resilient natures) and you will probably have enough time to raise a defence before the other effects hit you.

BUT, and here is the question to those who claim that a shield charm would hold off a nuclear inferno, where do you draw the line and why? Nuclear facility attacked? Just randomly walking by one which is being blown up. Reactor accident? Sabotage leading to one? Because if you happen to walk into the Israeli sabotage of an Iranian nuclear facility, you are not being attacked. Yet still exposed to nuclear radiation.

This (complexity of the shield charm) could very well be why they say in canon that many wizards and witches (who I assume passed their OWLs at minimum) can't cast a shield charm. I would interpret that to mean that they can't cast a /useful/ shield charm that would protect against what they need it to protect them from. Most likely they cast the protego charm as if they're doing their OWL exam, and so it fails against whatever new threat is posed by their attacker.

It'd be much easier if you said that a shield charm is the equivalent to X inches of RHA or absorbs X Newton/Joule of impact energy while X depends on the caster and their proficiency with magic in general and the spell in particular.

Transfiguration is supposedly permanent. You can take that and extrapolate that to infinity. Transfigure nukes, or transfigure a house, transfigure literally anything. Nothing in canon contradicts it, so why not.

Shield charm shields. That's what it does. It'll protect you from travelling into the sun, because nothing in canon contradicts it, so why not.

With a single bread crumb, you can feed the world forever, since canon says if you have a bit of something, you can make it into more. So why not.

Quirrell snapped his fingers and conjured a rope, so therefore you can cast killing curses out of your hand. So why not.

Anyone can justify it all they want by arbitrarily setting the difficulty on these kind of things or whatever they want. But where's the line between sticking to canon, and suddenly being LessWong? You know the saying - you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. And this conversation thread is definitely giving me a whiff of the later.

But there's really two points here. First is that you can pretty much justify /anything/ with what appears in canon. There's always going to be far more support for an argument rather than evidence that refutes it. That's the nature of a story where you can explain anything “because magic.” Secondly, and this harkens back up the the original quote, and that is “concepts”. There's one very important scientific concept, and that is the concept of significant figures. Essentially, it means that something can only be as accurate as the least accurate component. JKR plays very fast and loose with how the HP world works. In fact, we know almost nothing about how it works. We have bits and pieces of things, and that's really it. We have a whole bunch of flavor, but very little of actual substance.

Now, a lot of what you have come up with is essentially just working backwards and extrapolating until something kinda sort makes sense within the framework of what we know. That's a headcanon. It doesn't matter how well you articulate it, or how many people you browbeat with ten-thousand word magical essays. This isn't politics - having a majority of people agreeing with your headcanon doesn't actually make it canon. It could be 100% of people agreeing with it and it still won't change the truth, and the truth is that we will likely never have an untainted concrete answer in regards to anything. Afterall, it's just recently where JKR said wizards would just shit in the streets and vanish it. Some people are completely fine with that. Some people will hid behind the world “canon”. But that's not me.

  Harm being a concept which forms the rules of which magic operates... is completely nonsensical. But I'm not going to argue that point. I've known you for 10 years, so I know it's completely pointless. I don't think I've ever seen you backtrack a single time, so it would literally just be wasted words. You've drawn your line long ago and nothing will change that, I understand that.
#+end_quote

You've not been paying attention, then. If you were to read the headcanon document in question, you would see that it directly references its previous iteration, which it modifies in various ways. And the previous headcanon document in turn referred to the "Canon+" document before that, which was also substantially revised. Through these three documents (and the various forum posts which preceded them and links them together), you will see many changes, most significantly in relation to the nature of magical power. The Canon+ document denied that such a thing exists at all, being simply shorthand for skill, whereas the latest document makes a positive argument in favour of the existence of magical power. Those two positions are basically completely opposite to each other. Not exactly a "line in the sand".

Just this week I substantially [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/auczgi/transfiguration_and_gamps_law_what_is_good_food/][reversed my position]] on a key aspect of the ongoing debate about the exceptions to Gamp's Law.

Honestly, I'm not seeing much in your post other than complaining about people using evidence and reasoning to present their ideas rather than making up whatever they like. Which, speaking of people set in their ways, is the same position you have advocated for years.

Incidentally, as a factual correction, JKR first published the thing about wizards vanishing their waste around 2011.

**** Dumbledore needed Fawkes to take a Killing Curse for him. Without that intervention from an ally, Voldemort would have killed Dumbledore in that fight. And that's /with/ Dumbledore using the Elder Wand.

Common counter-points:

"But Dumbledore had to protect Harry": not during the duel he didn't. Dumbledore provides Harry with a guardian before the duel started and did not have to intervene further to protect Harry during the duel.

"But Dumbledore wasn't fighting to kill": whether fighting to stun or to kill, the strategy is the same. To win a duel, you have to land a single incapacitating spell on your opponent. What effect that spell has - death or some other form of incapacitation - doesn't really affect your ability to land it in the first place.

"Dumbledore's use of an ally was legitimate strategy": of course it was, and I'm not faulting Dumbledore's strategy in this fight. I am saying that the fight shows us that in a fair fight (no allies, no special weapons, no special circumstances), Voldemort would beat Dumbledore more often than Dumbledore beat Voldemort.

DH is pretty bad on that, too. Harry needs to be the master of the Elder Wand to beat Voldemort, so he needs to get caught and brought to Malfoy Manor to overpower Draco in a fair fight. The Trio not knowing about the Taboo (even though we've told since Book 1 that saying Big V's name is a wizarding faux pas), in order to have the Snatchers summoned at the right time, is one of the biggest contrivances in the book.

DH is full of compounded contrivance, but yeah, OotP is definitely far from free of them either. Other than Sirius and the magic mirror, OotP's explanation of the Trace makes DH worse in hindsight, because it appears to contradict everything that came earlier, when OotP was before we knew that Tom Riddle killed the Riddle family by a Trace circumvention (HBP)

#+begin_quote

Actually, the Snatchers capturing them and taking them to Malfoy Manor is just another instance of Harry being plain retarded. Ron tells the other two about the Taboo placed on Voldemort's name, and how the Snatchers/Death Eaters cornered Kingsley that way.

Even after knowing that, Harry just barrels on at the moment like a complete moron. Ron even tries to stop him from speaking the name out loud.

  "You are quite right---they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: you will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by---"

  "Dobby," growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. "So if you're under age and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard's house, the Ministry won't know?"

  "They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic," said Dumbledore.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore confirms that Tom Riddle was underaged when he killed his family members. HBP doesn't say which year Tom killed the Riddles, but by Slughorn's memory, he was wearing the Gaunt/Peverell ring on his hand, and had created the Diary (which was contained his soul at 16 years old). The Diary in CoS already knew he had a "filthy Muggle father", which is why he abandoned his old identity for Lord V.

That said, the Trace is still weird and inconsistent, considering that adults around Harry had been using magic in and around the Dursley house for years. In OotP, Harry and Dudley got Dementor'd because Mundungus Fletcher, who had been on the protection detail, had apparated away (using magic) to fence stolen goods.

So my experience is based on certain conversations I had, real life and some online communities. In my opinion Rowling is hailed too high. She is by far not perfect, both as author and while constructing a story. The fist books weren't a masterpiece, although she got better in time.

Every addition she makes after the story is over is hilariously bad and often they plainly ignore Canon. People tend to see a "bigger plan" or refuse to believe that she made a mistake. In most people's mind (according to what I experienced) she is the perfect author when in fact some errors and inconsistencies can be found in the books as well.

Cursed Child was loved by almost everyone I directly spoke to both RL and online, while I have nothing but hatred for it. Same with the new movies, for their outrageous messing with the original canon. The movies are even worse since Rowling actually wrote them.

So that's why I don't really appreciate the Pottermore website, for that purpose. It's fine for fans who want an extended experience, it's fine for fans who want to dig deeper into things that aren't in the books! But I go to the HP lexicon if I want to find something factually accurate.

the actual unpopular opinion is that this is way way way exaggerated, and people go out of their way to interpret what she says in the worse light possible, or just ignore/make up things she's said

one of the few actual retcons- mcg's age, is negligible, and mostly done to her pottermore profile, which isn't book canon anyway

nagini being a person? not a retcon, and it's completely believable that it was an idea she always had

albus being gay? not a retcon

hermione could be black? technically still true, though she can't be dark skinned. yeah, jkr ignored/forgot the *one or two lines* of explicit canon about her skin colour. it's amazing people constantly bring that up, ignoring that it's one or two lines, and the context in which jkr made that tweet

draco is evil? she never said that. she says he's a moral coward, who ultimately rejects pureblood bigotry, but also doesn't go out of his way to actively do good either

snape is good? never said that either. she knows he abuses children. she wrote him that way. she also knows he rejected the DEs and opposes them because he thinks it's the right thing to do, and works to save lives, all of which is compatible with and evinced in canon.

**** Although most you said is true I was referring to some other things like maintaining her own timeline or canon. As far as I know we now have three different DOB for McGonagall due to Pottermore and the new movie. Her DOB was reconstructed by fans by using book informations (mainly fifth year and her mention of how long she was teacher in Hogwarts), stuff she said in the interviews of 2000 (where she answere she was in her seventies when Dumbleodre died at the age of 150) and at Leaky Couldron. Dumbledores age was altered in hindsight to fit the new movies as well.

The Pottermore additions include the new schools (addition to the movies as well) which all are a joke. North America having no school at all till some immigrant built one by copying Hogwarts is ridiculous. One school for all of Asia is just wrong.

What I had in mind were also the Twitter comments and answers she gave. I wish she would have never said that Hufflepuff is infamous for having orgies or for explaining how wizards never used any toilets and how instead they let their poo just vanish. All because there had to be an explanation why the entrance to the chamber was where it were.

Well and then there is Cursed Child which couldn't make anything right besides the fact that Hermione is Minister for Magic but even that is tainted by the OOCness and no I don't talk about her skin color. I couldn't care less about how any character looks like. What I care about is that Hermione should have recognized the ingredients for a Polyjuice Potions when she hears them, among other.

She yells at him in book four, because he didn't ask her out, and when he did he fucked it up. Between then and he ball they are friendly, and even snowball fight together. At the ball they actually fight, but they are on speaking terms the next day, and while short, they don't spend much time being unfriendly.

They fight in book six because Hermione doesn't show her affection outwardly enough for Ron to notice it, and Ron is too preoccupied with being sorry with himself to notice Hermione asking him to the slug club dinner. Then Ron decides to kiss someone who actually shows her affection, and Hermione snaps with a bout of physical assault.

This is by far their longest fight, based completely on mistaken feelings and misinterpreted meanings. When the chips are down, Hermione relents from her self righteousness, coming to Ron hospital bed, and understanding better how they both messed up.

In book seven, Ron is influenced and manipulated by the horcrux to leave them, and Hermione is heartbroken. She doesnt stay mad at him for long, and she seems to be angry out of principle than emotion.

​

They spend a great deal of the series arguing, but suggesting that they spend more time arguing than playing, studying and laughing together is categorically false. They spend little over a few months in the seven years they've known each other not on speaking terms, which is clearly not more than the times they are speaking.

Hermione arrives at the burrow earlier than Harry many times during the summer holidays, spending weeks with Ron that we don't see. They also go on patrol together, studies Buckbeak's case together, Brew the Polyjuice potion together, and generally spend at shit ton of time together without Harry.

You clearly have read to much bad fanfiction, and I would suggest you re-read the series rather than using poorly characterized fanfic to base your opinions about Ron and Hermione, and which ship is best.

But then I read a Bella/Hermione story and I can be a bit more forgiving, in fact I haven't read a one I've not finished and enjoyed. It's not that I completely disregard male slash, but when I already only skim the most suggested stories, it makes it hard to find stories I would like to read without working to find them. Plus, I have no interest in snarry or drarry or tomarry because, while I could see harry being gay, I could never truly suspend disbelief that he would fall for these three.

So for action fics it needs interesting action, world building stories need a world I would want to live in, bashing fics need the bashing to be cathartic and so on. So a romance has multiple hurdles from the get go, not only does it need a setting I want to settle in, and language to invest me, and a romance worth watching grow, but ultimately it needs partners that I want to see love each other.

***** On the Snape thing (also Draco and Lucius and some others). For me it comes down to if a character from canon is redeemable. For Bellatrix I think an author can redeem the character through the insanity/mind control route. For me canon leaves enough wiggle room to go that way without requiring mind gymnastics. But for the "sane" antagonists that route is far less obvious. I don't find Snape and his cohorts as redeemable since their actions are largely their own and as such don't like them as a romantic pairing for characters I like (Harry, Hermione, Fleur, hell even Draco/Daphne is a pairing I'd rather not see).

This is of course conflated by reading fics that cast these characters in a certain manner.

******* I very much disagree. Snape is not redeemed in my eyes. That he eventually fought on the right side of the war does not make up for his negative actions. The same goes for Draco. All I'm saying is that Bellatrixs actions and motivations are a little more ambiguous in canon. An author can choose to make her a completely evil character, but can also explain them in a different light. That room for ambiguity makes her a more redeemable character than Snape.

But again, I think that reading fanfics also leads to a mental image of a character that is hard to dissuade. If you read a ton of good Draco or Snape you are far more likely to have a positive image of them as redeemable antagonists. If you read a lot of Bella/Harry or Bellamione fics you are more likely to have a positive image (or at leadt open minded) of Bellatrix. And vice versa of course. For most readers it becomes very difficult to separate canon and fanon from each other because subconsciously they meld into one image.

That's why a truly good Snape or Draco requires a lot of mental gymnastics from me, but maybe less so from others.

That's without thinking about whatever you need to do to earn the Dark Mark (of anything since its never discussed in canon). Just because he didn't actually kill Dumbledore and his actions at Malfoy manor doesn't mean all that other stuff simply meant nothing.

It's not about being excused. Maybe I'm not explaining things properly.

I'm not saying that this is neccesarily the case but rather that in my opinion she is the easiest antagonist for which this case can be made.

For instance in a fic I recently read Bellatrix was a side character, and though there was no redemption arc for her and she was a full blown death eater, it provided the context for her turning out like she did. Which was the (severe) mistreatment she underwent from the hands of her parents and her trying to shield her sisters from the worst of it. That drove her insane and whens he came to Voldemort he stopped the abuse of her parents and husband which lead to her undying loyalty. That doesn't excuse any of her crimes, but does provide context. It's not for nothing that serious mental problems is a legitimate defence for crimes.

But the likes of Draco Malfoy have full control of their mental facilities and in the end are able to make a logical decision. So in that sense I'm saying that for someone like Malfoy to suddenly turn good would need an entire change to his belief system, while that isn't necessarily the case for Bellatrix.

For Voldemort, who as you point out is born with it, his base persona is not redeemable. He is the psychopath, there is nothing underneath. He is maybe the only character that can't be redeemed at all if he is inherently evil.

Again I understand that this is not canon Bella. But I do believe that her actions are easier to place in a context in fanfics where there is some sympathy possible than it is for Draco Malfoy, Lucius Malfoy, etc. (at least for me)

As to female gay relationships not getting as negative a response, I suppose I don't see enough of that one way or another to comment. Though having a female gay Harry is essentially just going to be paired up with the same cast as standard Harry, so that one in particular is going to have some inherent 'so what?' acceptance around it.

I dont like the whole "CURRENT YEAR" reasoning brought into argument, but I'll make an exception here, it is 2019, every first world country has given LGBT people equal rights and the only "homophobia" is small amounts of people, the vast majority of which arent remotely interested in fanfiction.

Homophobia isnt the reason for people's dislike of slash, it's a mix of disinterest and dislike of the pairings themselves, Drarry, Snarry, Harrymort, and Lucius x Harry being prominent examples.

I felt for Queenie when she was surrounded by people whose thoughts she didn't understand because I've travelled and I know what it's like to be in a crowd of people talking incredibly fast in a language I barely know and it makes sense to me that people think in their own first language.

/Because we know humanity/. We all know what makes us human, and while different cultures determine many things about you the base idea of 'what makes you human' is something that is just understood by /being/. That is something that is literally impossible to do with a fictional species. As humanity we know one single intelligent race: us. Any other intelligence is utterly foreign to us. Without delving into entire cultural histories, linguistic studies, bio-and-psychological understandings, of this new intelligence, understanding it to the way we understand each other inherently simply isn't going to happen.

Most all alien species and cultures are one note, because to delve into the nuances is simply to complex an issue and would derail a story. So either they're humans who just aren't, which is boring and pointless, or you have to wrap them up as tightly as you can into a bundle and give the SparkNotes. Hell, I'd argue Harry Potter actually does creatures better than most. Dobby and Firenze are both interesting individuals in respect to their species and their relationship with humanity.

I agree that Rowling does better than most, but that's more of a case of most being utter garbage than her writing being especially progressive. Tolkien himself eventually expressed regret over the influence of racism in his works, we should be past that.

Introducing genuinely non-human characters will of course mean that we can't understand them intuitively in the same way, but the way I see it that's the /point./ What's the point of having a major character be nonhuman if we can just think of them as a human with quirks without problems? Increased representation for a race that doesn't exist? I'm willing to admit that I'm likely biased as these sorts of stories are often my favorites, but I think that sort of conflict in both culture and way of thinking can lead to some of the most compelling character interactions and are one of the major benefits of fantasy.

That would leave Morfin clear and accurate memories of having gone up the hill and killed the stupid muggles, even though he had no motive to do so at that particular time.

** In my headcanon, magic is truely limitless and it's just easier depending on your ability to manipulate your Will and Intent. You can govern your Intent better through incantations and wand movements, which is why you learn that first, but it's not required at All. Anything can be used just as well wandlessly as wanded, silent as aloud. You just have to truly believe it, and Intend it to be so, which is pretty hard when all the authority figures in your life tell you it “can't be done”.

Will, on the other hand is cumulative, across all of humanity, so that the more people believe in something the easier it is, even if Everything is still possible.

It's funny how he never incites even fraction of knee-jerk reaction people have to Snape, even though he joined Death Eaters voluntarily, presumably because he agreed with Voldemort's ideology and thought it was a worthy cause to fight for. With his background, Regulus had infinitely more options than Snape, but he still joined, and even when he defected, nothing indicates that he ever changed his mind about pureblood superiority. But he is a rich, good-looking heir to an important pureblood family, so people are willing to give him a pass.

He then went on to bully 14-year-olds for the rest of his life.

As for Regulus's home life, given the widespread assumption in this fandom that Sirius was abused I'm surprised people think Regulus had a grand old time after Sirius left. He's also actually described as significantly less good-looking than Sirius, btw.

***** If Snape left because of Lily, then Regulus left because of Kreacher. I personally think that they both were unhappy being Death Eaters even before and these respective events were the final push, but it's a matter of interpretation. What's important is that they did leave. But afterwards Regulus got himself killed, and Snape made himself useful for the war effort.

And Snape sacrificed his life to strike a blow against the gang's leader in the end as well. He also wasn't a faithful Death Eater for much longer than Regulus, if he joined after Hogwarts and turned to Dumbledore shortly after Harry was born. So probably less than 2 years.

The fact that Snape is a bully to his students doesn't negate all the good he's done to defeat Voldemort. You can be a hero while being a massive jerk, and that's what makes Snape such a compelling character.

I don't mean that Regulus' home wasn't abusive, I mean that as a rich pureblood, he had all the doors open to him compared to dirt-poor halfblood Snape raised in the Muggle world, who probably viewed Death Eaters as an opportunity to gain standing in the society. And it's not like Snape's home life was any better.

Anyway, I'm not trying to justifying Snape's decision to join the Death Eaters here. What I mean is that if people see Regulus as redeemed after he left Voldemort, then the same should apply to Snape. Him being a bad teacher is, well, bad, but completely unrelated.

Also, from a general's perspective “getting yourself killed” might not be particularly useful, but it draws a lot of sympathy.

Abusive because he bullies Hermione when she wants to do well in school while he does little more than obsess about Quidditch, play chess, and eat like a pig. Then he has the nerve to ask her to help him with his homework. Rinse and repeat. A marriage would end badly.

Ironically he's just as bigoted as Draco Malfoy, and he feels just as entitled to do well in life without making an effort. He sees himself better than all his siblings in the Mirror of Erised, and then he pisses away his magical education. It's fitting that he supports a losing Quidditch team.

Bonus opinion: He's an idiot. He steals the car to fly to Hogwarts. How is he able to steal the car? It's because his parents parked it there and intended to drive home in it. He couldn't wait ten minutes for his parents to show up and ask them for help? No, he had to grab a little fame for himself because he's jealous of Harry, never mind that Harry hates his fame and would gladly give it away to have his parents back.

Hermione gives as good as she gets. If Ron's abusive about Hermione wanting to do well in school, she's largely the same to him: she's constantly accusing him of being lazy, unhygienic, implies he's an idiot, and she literally physically attacks him in HBP.

Nah, I think Rowling is just drawing from football support there. Supporting a losing team isn't necessarily a bad thing in football culture, and choosing a club based on its success (i.e. gloryhunting) is considered a huge faux pas, especially in the 90s. After moving from the UK to America, it took me by surprise how acceptable bandwagoning is in the States, because goddamn is that shit cringey.

**** I'm getting really frustrated at this point. I don't say dreaming of fantasy is bad, I'm saying /substituting reality for fantasy/ is. As in, living entirely in fantasy land. I clarified it already, so why does everyone insist on twisting my words?

** Movie Ron is better because his slightly stupid depiction makes his flaws more forgivable.

Most characters are overhyped

Death Eaters should be tried and executed immediately upon capture.

Magical interrogation methods might not be foolproof, but false positives are not canon. Therefore they are certainly viable to prove guilt, but not to prove innocence.

The defenders during the Battle of Hogwarts were morons who failed to utilise a truly astonishing tactical advantage in position.

For ambushes, firearms are vastly superior to magic as long as you cover yourself with magical defenses. Especially in a "Battle of Hogwarts" scenario, even badly trained fighters would be able to use them to a devastating effect.

The Horcrux Hunt might suck, but the alternatives make for a poor story.

Marietta deserved a lot worse than what she got.

Any member of the inquisitional squad ought to be thrown into prison.

*** I think a lot of people forget that a lot of the characters are just children. The people in the inquisitorial squad didn't grow up and decide to hate others based on little reason, rather they where raised that way by their parents. A lot of times you don't even know what you believe in until your face to face with problem and, when surrounded by dangerous like-minded individuals it doesn't really matter what you might have believed without their influence, does it? It matters what your willing to do then and there and nothing else.

Marietta Edgecombe was a girl who joined the DA on someone else's recommendation. Who ultimately turned against them when pressed by someone in a position of authority over her. I don't think we learn anything more about her during the books or the movies. We have nothing to base our hate for her off of, we see none of her motives or reasonings. Why, we don't even know if she regrets it or would do it all over again.

And the defenders during the Battle of Hogwarts? Most of them where children who hadn't even graduated school and didn't have the excuse of the internet or a proper History teacher to disseminate war time tactics.

I think I'm. Well. My reasoning is probably headed toward the idea that this is a story full of 2D characters and thinly veiled plots. Something with an overarching theme most people miss in their enjoyment of parts and hate for others. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, of course, it's just that /I/ believe a lot of the details in the main series aren't there for anything more than the development of the /main/ characters and the /main/ storyline.

Or, well, everything is overhyped.

The defenders had mandrakes, whose cry is lethal to anyone who hears it. That alone should be more than enough to stop the assault. They had the fortified high ground with superb killing fields on all sides. All they had to do was fling blasting curses down range and hurl the mandrakes over the battlements should that have proven to be ineffective.

***** Oh, don't get me wrong, I certainly /agree/ with the sentiment. I'm sure someone could spend days or weeks discussing the thousands of different ways that ridiculous battle could have gone differently. But I mean, really, the purpose of the fight wasn't to try and show who had the highest quantity of OP magical items, but rather a battle between Voldemort and Harry that would be sufficiently melodramatic.

They could have, I mean quite easily, had the upper years simply transfigured bits of metal, a sleep draft, or even some type of explosive into an animal, have them fly innocuously over the battle field - reverse the spell when they got close and poof, half the fight is over. Why, Rowling could likely come up with a thousand other ways to end the battle swiftly from either side of the equation. That just.. wasn't the point.

I'm just proposing that it is more likely that we just adopt popular opinions in areas we don't really care about all that much and then claim that these are opinions of our own.

Waw... you're a huge psycopath. You do realize that she is 16/17 and "betrayed" the group because of the threats her mother was having? If anyone was to blame here it'S Hermione because first the whole DA was her idea, and secondly the contract was stupid. Why punish someone AFTER they betrayed them? Why not writting a contract so that they couldn't betray them?
