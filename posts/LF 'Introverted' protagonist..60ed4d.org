I'm a bit tired of reading all these alpha super douche characters that are clearly just author wish fulfillment. Are there any good fics with introspective and less talkative protagonists? I would also appreciate at least /some/ moral intelligence (theft and murder should not be easily justifiable).

I don't really have a good example, but I found Harry's characterization in linkffn(Dead Man Walking by BloodRedDemon) to be in a similar vein of what I want. Where character development is mostly done through action and inner monologue rather than forced dialogue. No slash please.

  His fight finished, his enemies dead, Harry Potter expects to move on from a life of conflict and pain. Either to the peace of oblivion, or to the embrace of those already fallen to Riddle's army. But fate does not have such a happy ending in store for our protagonist, and he arrives in another world to be found, covered in blood, by a familiar face.

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

#+end_quote

Let's be clear on one thing - there are only two real kinds of fics. Wish fulfilment, and non wish fulfilment (or legit world exploration).\\
There are as many wish fulfilment alpha douche HP fics (which is what the writer wishes he were) as there are introvert! Harry wish fulfilment (where the author wishes his life were awesome, only he's not even willing to change).\\
Introverted and less talkative protagonist isn't going to be some Clint Eastwood/James Bond-esque laconic Mr.Awesome-panty-wetter either. He's going to be the lonely depressed kid who sits and sips his Carlsberg in a corner of the bar while other more sociable people who sit less on their tag of introvert have some actual fucking fun.

***** ? Let's be clear here, I have nothing against wish fulfillment in fiction. Half the reason many people write in /general/ is because they want to fulfill some fantasy, or right some wrong. I do, however, get tired of reading the perceived alpha super douche character archetype. It's contrived at best and -- I would guess -- founded in delusions of what the author believes is some sort of ideal. When a character has no humility and can't shut up I find it hard to sympathize. That was all I was saying.
