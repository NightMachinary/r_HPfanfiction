As the title says, I'm looking for F/F fics. I would prefer that they're decently long and completed. Bonus points if the pairing includes Luna Lovegood. Thank you in advance!

  "You know what they say about girls with short hair who play Quidditch."Ginny contemplates a Very Significant Haircut. Luckily for her, her girlfriend is kind of an amazing non-conformist. (Also, Ron can't catch a break, really.)

  "I'm in a time loop," Ginny admits. "It's all George's fault." Growing up with six older brothers taught her to throw them under a whomping willow at every possible opportunity. "I drank one of his ingredients by accident.""Oh," Luna says. "You are very glowy.""I still have no idea what you're talking about." Ginny pokes at her freckled arm, trying to find a hint of glow. She doesn't feel or look like she's glowing. Not like Luna, who's beautiful under the sunlight's shine.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

  Viktor was subtle but straight-forward. He had questions and he asked them and he got to know her that way. And Fleur?Fleur was a mess who aired her woes about her crush to her friends. In French. ...too bad Hermione speaks French. Sshhh!

  Pre-POA AU: In the summer of 1993, the Grangers vacation in France and meet the Delacours. When the Granger-Delacour parents elect to explore Wizarding France as a group, Hermione Granger is thrown together with a girl named Fleur Delacour due to some bizarre idea that they will somehow magically become friends. Even though they have nothing whatsoever in common and Hermione doesn't like Fleur at all!In which two of the brightest witches of their age become very good friends.
