You guys probably seen me spamming my fanfic and promoting it everywhere, and if that annoys you, then sorry, if it doesn't, thank you!

The story involves a more competent Harry who has Tom Riddle in his head, who can take over Harry's body during certain periods and is a much stronger version of Harry. Pretty much Harry has an alter ego who can replace him when the time is needed. A weirder version of Superman I guess, but the two personalities are different people.

Please give constructive criticism in the review section as the sole purpose of fanfiction(for me at least) is to improve my writing.

Chapter 3 is up now.

Thanks,

Atlanus
