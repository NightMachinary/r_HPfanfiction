#+TITLE: The First Task in Goblet of Fire has a dragon being forced to defend her eggs; the Second Task has the champions sent to rescue fellow students from underwater. Does the wizarding world just have an obsession with taking children/babies hostage and coercion or something?

** Those two tasks are based on classic hero stories. In the first task you have to retrieve a 'treasure' from a dragon, in the second you need to rescue a hostage from an unfamiliar hostile magical location. Not really sure what the point of this thread is. It's better suited for the HP reddit, unless you want fanfics where the tasks are changed, or maybe the wizarding world is obsessed with taking children hostages. It'd be a crack fic, but it could work.

** Maybe it does! Now Im wondering how Voldemort could achieve immortality by kidnapping someones kid.

Hrm... use the resurrection stone to summon Death's own child and trap them in a body. Death agrees not to drag Voldemorts soul to the afterlife in exchange for the childs continued wellbeing. This allows Voldemort to continue roaming the world as a shade in between deaths.

Bam, kidnapper mentality with immortality as the ransom.

*** I was going to suggest Voldemort kidnaps harry instead of trying to kill him. Cant figure out what the ransom would be though. Keeps harry alive so long as Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix stay out of the war, maybe?

**** dumbledore stumbles across ravenclaws diadem on his own and works with nicholas flamel to invent a device that locates other objects with voldemorts horcruxes. he successfully destroys every object based horcrux leaving harry as the only one.

voldemort kidnaps harry to secure his own immortality.

Or made harry 7 horcrux.

******* wouldn't that be a hell of a twist? harry's horcrux hunt is for own horcruxes because voldemort figured out how to make them for other people without their consent. since voldemort can't make anymore due to having made so many already (and being destroyed) he makes them for harry. as long as harry can't die neither can voldemort.

bonus points if dobby turns out to be one of the horcruxes and harry has to kill him personally.

also might be neat if neville's brain dead parents were murdered to make two of them.

*** Could be a crossover with Discworld where Voldemort kidnaps Susan Sto Helit. This can only end well...

**** Susan is perfectly able to walk through walls, to transport herself about anywhere she wants, and maybe to more or less stop time.\\
I don't really see this attempt at kidnapping to be successfull (except at angering her, which I personally would rather not do). Voldemort would probably be found impaled with a bent fire poker.

***** Yeah... I don't even like Susan Sto Helit, but I really don't think Voldemort has any chance against her. No way he'd be able to kidnap her; she is too good at cheating around the universe -- stopping time, walking around walls, moving around different dimensions. She's also too strong-willed for the Imperius to be very effective, I should think.

If he caught her unaware, knocked her out and kept her unconscious throughout, then MAYBE... but given how Susan is really good at noticing when something isn't how it should be, catching her unaware would be near-impossible in and of itself.

Nope, Voldemort would lose that confrontation. Granted, there could be an interesting story with Susan vs Voldemort, but I don't think kidnapping would work.

** Interestingly, in 2000, her ex was coming back into her life asking to see their child, maybe demanding custody? Not sure. GoF was released in 2000. The timing might be off (did her ex re-enter her life after the scene was written, or before? Or did she change it after he came back in the picture?), but it's a possibility nonetheless.
