tl; dr: Looking for fics where muggles find out about magic and are LIVID that the ability to solve world hunger, homelessness, cancer, overpopulation, or other major societal ills has been denied to them.

So, the whole statute of secrecy thing tends to come down to:

- Muggles are scared of what is different and try to kill wizards/witches. Even if they are ineffective (after all, there is the Flame-Freezing charm), it is annoying and sometimes a muggle will get lucky and
- Muggles want to exploit magic. You always have some desperate person who wants a love potion, or to cure a family members disease, or who wants to 'enhance' themselves. Constant muggle questing to find a wizard to solve their problems is a drag.

When fics show Muggles breaching the SoS, generally either

- Muggles get pissed at Wizarding Worlds backwardness and proceeds to try to wipe out the government and 'save' the backwards wizards or
- Muggles get scared at a whole society of people with mini atom bomb sticks and proceeds to try to exterminate/control them.

Of course, depending on the tint of the fic they could be successful or fail hard, but these still seem to be the reactions.

​

I'm looking for a fic that goes with a reaction more like that second one.

"What do you mean you have the ability to provide virtually unlimited free energy. Do you know how many people die each year due to a lack of heat? An unstable energy supply. How dare you keep this from us?"

They don't even have to necessarily get mad at the SoS. After all, it hasn't been that long since there was forced servitude, and the last of the former British Empire subjects to abolish racial segregation was only back in 1991-1994. But that doesn't mean that they are necessarily happy with the continued denial of access to these resources.

It isn't like forced servitude is practiced anymore. No-one is going to march Wizards at gunpoint and demand services. However, if there is one thing Capitalism does very well is reward labor for which there is high demand and a low supply. Those that chose to help would live as kings. It isn't those who are uninterested they want, but those who would take the work if it was offered but are blocked.

I mean think about it, all it takes is one Prime Minister who has a Wife or Husband who died of Cancer who gets to hear there is a secret society that has the ability to banish that scourge from the face of the earth, but chose not to because it is more comfortable for them to not step up. How would that end?

As stated, I've yet to read a fic that takes this angle, muggle motivation is always "Fear (of magic or the unknown)" or "Muggle Savior" types.


** It's not that simple. It never is.

If the nations of the world worked together, they could banish many of the world problems you mentioned, no magic needed. Why don't they? And why aren't people mad that they aren't?

The reason why there hasn't been a world war in the last 80 years is because the nations stand in a delicate balance. They /can't/ wage open warfare against each other. The potential losses far outweigh the potential gains. So, they try to outplay each other in economics and other, less expensive pursuits.

What do you think happens to said balance if the extremely overpowered wizards, /sovereign nations/, suddenly pop up out of nowhere? Suddenly, the "currency" of power changes. The nation that controls the most wizards, /is/ the most powerful.

All the nations will attempt to /somehow/ sway more wizards to join them. There is no morality here, only power.

I'm not sure if I'm being clear. The nations in the abstract don't /care/ about world peace or ending world hunger or what have you. Unless, of course, supporting those things will net them more power.

** I feel you, man, but I've been searching for those kinds of fics for a long time and the results are... well. It seems that just like even the most morally upright characters in-universe patronize and ignore the Muggles, so do the people out-of-universe (readers, authors, fans) take a strongly wizard-centric view. Even in stories where science and technology and whatever is wanked, the main characters /still/ seem to favor the segregation and secrecy for some strange reason.

I think HPMOR comes the closest to the spirit of the request, but ultimately doesn't really do much with the Muggle-Wizard relations and the Statute of Secrecy /specifically/, even if the main character passionately argues exactly among the lines of what you're thinking. In Forging the Sword, Hermione /does seem/ to vaguely start thinking about some effective altruism/uplifting/anti-SoS stuff, but is kinda looked down upon by Ron because of it, who argues that she doesn't respect the wizarding culture or whatever---and the story was abandoned before it went anywhere with it, anyway, so yeah. Emperor had the Statue of Secrecy falling apart, if I remember correctly, with some stuff among those lines explored in there, but it gets heavily AU and doesn't really satisfy the itch. Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue and Harry Potter and The Iron Lady are also roughly in that direction, but I dropped them early on, so I don't know if they're any good.

Searching for muggle wank fics is probably your best option, even if they don't exactly match the prompt.

*** I mean, Justice, Justice Shall you Pursue and Iron Lady both fall under the "Muggle Savior" thing.

The Prime Minister isn't intervening because he needs to make his citizens lives better by incorporating magic, he is intervening because he sees abuses/problems that need to be solved (Duty or something). Those fics are fun, but I'm explicitly looking for more of a:

"So there is a secret sect of British that stay in hiding and can use magic"\\
"Magic? Like what? A light show?"\\
"No, like conjuring wind or water"\\
"Why are they hidden?"\\
"They are worried if their powers were known we'd try to burn them at the stake"\\
"Are you telling me you have a solution for near-free energy? If we had that we wouldn't have been involved in like three conflicts in the last ten years. Do you know how many British died in those conflicts? All because they are avoiding something that hasn't happened in several hundred years?"

**** Seeing as it's kinda a rare theme in hp fanfiction, I'm pretty much throwing the closest things that match the prompt at the figurative wall and seeing what sticks ¯_(ツ)_/¯

I guess Ghost of the Privet Drive and In the Mind of a Scientist (former more than the latter!) might also /roughly/ answer your request if you care more about the pragmatic exploitation of Magic than about social commentary, but again, they aren't about Muggles and SoS specifically.

It's in NSFW subforum, so you'd have to have an account, but doesn't contain any NSFW stuff in it (because it was abandoned before it got to any lmao)

Excerpt:

  "Professor?" I asked, as we rode the tram. "Why is magic hidden?"

  "Muggles have bad history with it, I'm afraid," she said, "Besides, if magic were known to muggles, they'd want it to solve all their problems."

  She scoffed at the thought, and I nodded. As I remembered, the same explanation Hagrid gave.

  "That sounds..." I searched for a sensible way to put it, remembered I was ten years old, and settled for bluntness, "... incredibly selfish."

  "I beg your pardon?"

  "I mean, could magic do something like... cure cancer?"

  "Well, yes, cancer hasn't been a problem for-"

  "Or maybe protect the enviroment? Or give clean water to nations without it? Or things like that?" She frowned at my interruption, but I was going for broke. "Why on earth would it be a bad thing for muggles to want their problems to be magically solved?"

  "Well, do they have anything to offer in return?" she asked.

  "Is it a requirement for performing magic to be mind-bendingly selfish?" I asked in return.

***** I guess I just felt it was a hole. I've read some good (and a lot of bad) fics with Muggles who either go "we gotta save the backwards ass wizards with outdated norms" or muggles/wizards descending to all out war. I've read a couple of fics where people take /personal/ offence on being excluded from magic (ie jealous petunia), but none where muggles in general go "you have been hiding this while people died around you? You jackasses". But this particular angle seems unexplored.

I do enjoy a good magic exploitation fic, but they are almost all "muggleborns Mark Warner's the hell out of magic". Those are rarer that I would have expected, but not unheard of (particularly because of MoR).

Thanks for the QQ link, too bad it went nowhere... :(

****** I dunno, is it selfish to not want to solve all of the worlds problems?

******* It's not about /forcing/ people to save other people, it's about /allowing/ people to save other people. The Statue of Secrecy is immoral because it /explicitly forbids/ any wizard from using magic to help muggles on a large scale. It's a bit like having your own government make donating to foreign charities illegal, because if countries with lower Quality of Life index found out that yours can help them, they would force everyone into saving them. That's not how the world really works.

I also find it really annoying that the same people who argue that wizards are more powerful than any muggle could ever be, and would win any war against muggles, /also/ tend to be against shattering the SoS because, somehow, the muggles would """force""" the wizards to solve their own problems.

Of course there would still be heavy political, economic, and cultural consequences to shattering SoS, but is it really worth letting billions of people live in pain and misery just to avoid some stupid diplomatic shit?

******* But that wasn't what I asked for? There is a huge difference between the wider wizarding world *blocking* the muggle world and a few interested Wizards from working on solving those problems and the muggle world demanding the wizarding world solves those problems.

So yea, if you imagine the muggles bribing Author Weasley to do a few hours of magic for them in exchange for being tutored by the best and brightest in the country on all the amazing things in the Muggle world, and the Wizarding Government blocking that simply because "If he did it, then we'll have to deal with muggles bugging us" is pretty selfish.

​

Or put it this way:

For the more individualistic (/capitalistic) approach, they would not object to people choosing not to help, but would strongly object to blocking others from doing so.

For the more communal (/socailistic) approach, they would totally object (and consider it extremely selfish) to horde such amazing things to a select few.

​

Now you might convince one group (ie, the more individualist) that the trade off is worth it because once you reveal the secret, it would ultimately end up in the other group and the harms of that are more than the harms of keeping the secret. But right there you have an interesting concept to be explored in a fic if you like :P

******** Yeah but I think you are underestimating how utterly fucking selfish the average person is. If they could have a problem magicked away they absolutely will do their damndest to get someone to do so. Think of a karen and how bad they normally are, but for the majority of a country. If I were a wizard, id hide under a fidelous (fuck that word) just so I wasnt bothered by selfish assholes who expect all their problems to be solved by me.

But yeah, it would be interesting.

Edit: You also have to take into account that I was more talking about todays climate and how everyone expects the rich to solve all the worlds problems just because they are rich.

********* See, but I wasn't asking for wizards to say this, I was saying Muggles.

​

Most fics that have muggles figure out about magic tend to either go for "KILL IT WITH FIRE" or "what a bunch of rednecks" (or whatever the appropriate term would be for someone stuck a few hundred years in the past). But as you say, people are pretty selfish. So I'd expect at least a few of those to be about muggles being *pissed* at being denied access to magic. And magic plants. And dragons and unicorns. etc etc.

(And even the altruistic ones would be pissed that they had so many easy solutions to problems that they were hiding).

This wouldn't necessarily end well for the muggle involved. I'm just saying it seems to be a natural reaction that is missing, and I was curious if anyone had written it.

There's also an alternative sequel linkffn(Squiring the Phoenix) that takes things in a bit of a different (darker and grittier) direction, but I didn't like it as much.

Of course, one could make the argument for keeping the Statute just to maintain the status quo as removal of the Statute would drastically change both muggle and magical societies, but the idea that an individual witch or wizard is prohibited from helping muggles because it would break the Statute seems especially cruel.

Further, in addition to the notion of 'helping vs blocking other help', the wizarding world is also blocking muggle access to herbs and plants, magical creatures, and artifacts.

** I'd like to see something like this too, but most fics get too wizard or Muggle-wanky for my taste with one side being super condescending towards the other.

The main problem with wizards helping Muggles is that wizards are a tiny portion of the worldwide population, let's say no more than two or three million. The magical ingredients and supplies are even more sparse, so even if they wanted to help, there's only so much they could do. Prices/services would skew towards the super wealthy and ordinary people like you and me would see nothing. That's not even considering that wizards, who are entitled to having magic and magical things by birth, wouldn't be too thrilled with the situation, something that's brought up quite rationally in chapter 30 of this HPMOR spinoff (yeah yeah I know). linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/30/Following-the-Phoenix]])

  "However. There are not many of us. Thousands to your millions, and the number of qualified Healers, Potioneers and Aurors is but a fraction of that. We cannot solve all the problems in the Muggle world, not even a small part, no matter how much we would like to. ...

  "If we allow capitalism to take its natural course, it would soon cause wealth to flow to a select elite of magic users, wrecking your economy and creating enormous friction between those who so happen to be born with the talent and those who are not.

#+end_quote

Certainly if you took it as a moral absolute, a fic based on this as the primary premise would be pretty muggle-wanky and preachy.

But you don't need it to be the central point to have a character explore it, and you could possibly have it be that, on the whole it does make sense.

​

​

Still, The logic on why that doesn't work due to small population I don't think holds up.

First, things like this would massively benefit society even if quantity was severely restricted. That is because of two things.

​

First, the value-benefit would not be static. Some uses would provide many times the benefit of others, and it would naturally end up that the scarce resources are spent on that use-case. If you look at say, a simple use-case and imagine that maybe it takes a healer an hour to cure someone of cancer, and so the scarcity makes it unable to be deployed widely. However, there are going to be cases where even at very high cost, it is worth exploring as a society. Imagine a study that was trying to figure out how the body reacted after cancer was cleared (thus being able to differentiate between treatment symptoms and baseline 'cancer is gone body reacts' symptoms).

Or imagine a disease like AIDS and wanting to know if you do manage to completely eliminate the virus, does it confer any lasting immunity. Knowing that would easily turn the entire course of study in one direction or another.

Thus, the list of use-cases will range from 'super valuable' to more pedestrian. This can almost be exponential: The value of being able to do something even once might be thousands of times more valuable than being able to do it twice, which is much better than 10 times. It isn't a linear growth.

Second, even items that are limited to being a luxury, if they come through increasing productivity of society as a whole, benefit all of society. Even if only the super-rich could afford to have their homes magically extended, it means they are buying less land, which trickles down into the entire system.

** Closest to this theme I've seen are a couple of fics in which the heroes start up one or more clinics that secretly use magic to cure Muggle children of terrible diseases like cancer. Their logic is a combination of "We want to help people" and "If/when the SoS falls, we'd rather the Muggles find out we've been secretly helping them all along".

There's also a crossover with a Super!Harry and mostly fix-it vibe that has Harry and others using magic to provide clean drinking water to impoverished communities in Africa and Harry planning to make all of humanity magical. Harry also gets in semi-trouble for healing a young Muggle girl that'd been mortally injured in a car crash.
