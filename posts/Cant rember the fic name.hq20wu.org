:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Trying to remember a fic. The little I remeber is it was definitely a M rated fic harry and myrtle figure out that under an invisibility clean shes solid and end up having some level of relations in the gryffindor common room. One bit that sticks out is that someone i think hermione finds Myrtles ghostly bra when she comes down to investigate the odd noises in the common room. That's all I remeber but its gonna bug me if I cant remember the name


** I think this is - If Wishes Were Hippogriffs by PerfesserN it violates rule 8 but can be found on ficwad and hpfanfictionarchive (I think)
