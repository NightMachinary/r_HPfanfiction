Id really love to see some more 'traditional' witchcraft in a fanfic, it could be super interesting! ðŸ’–


** The Black Queen series by Silently Watches uses a lot of voodoo stuff. It's tough to read though. Deals with a lot of terrible and depraving things. The depravity is all alluded to if I remember, it's not written graphically. There are two complete fics in the series with a third that was unfinished when I read them years ago.

**** Remember, that information is based on two year old memories and a quick rereading of the disclaimer on chapter 1.

On further inspection, part 3 is complete and part four is started and being updated as of last month. I may need to start these over again.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete - updates with a new chapter every Tuesday.

** Well hello!!! sorry i didn't see your post sooner.

I'm not sure if this is what your looking for, but I HIGHLY recommend "something wicked this way comes" by the mad mad reviewer Linkffn(5501817)

It features Harry and Co summing a demon to help fight voldemort. It is probably my favorite HP fanfic of all time. Incredibly well written, with witty dialogue and the most bad-ass horcrux I have ever seen.

Now it is a crossover with the disgea series, but you don't need to know anything about that series, as it doesn't really feature until a small section in the epilogue. I certainly had no idea about the Disgea when I first read the fic.
