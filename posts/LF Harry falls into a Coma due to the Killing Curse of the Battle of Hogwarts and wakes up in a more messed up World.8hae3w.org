So, when Harry goes to face Voldemort and killing the Horcrux inside him, he falls into a Coma and wakes up after Years. But the (Magical) World has changed and might be ruled by a Person even worse than Voldemort. Harry is in a hidden Hideout and Ron and Hermione gets messaged to pick him up.

Well, this is inspired by the beginning of Metal Gear Solid 5 the Phantom Pain. I wonder, if something like that exist. Can include H/Hr or not, i accept both.


** It's not nearly the same thing, but I had this idea once where Harry didn't successfully kill the basilisk, Ron was left petrified in the chamber, and Hogwarts was ultimately evacuated.

Said Ron is later unearthed several centuries later, by muggles with sufficiently advanced technology to undo the petrification, and is left dealing with a highly futuristic world, and gets to see what happens when...hmm, was the idea for magic to fade due to a parasitic universe, or for Voldemort to conquer the world, or...?

Eh, something like that.

*** Wouldn't Ron be 12 years old then? How is he going to have any agency in this new world?

BTW That's a really cool idea!!

**** Well, yes, he is 12 years old, but he's a 12-year-old who's a living person from hundreds of years ago, from a culture that they have little-to-no firsthand experience of. He can help them put together more than a few pieces of whatever puzzle the muggles find themselves stuck with.

He could tell them all about how a very small percentage of humans (like him) had the ability to do magic, about how there were other magical creatures, the ruined castle he was found in was called Hogwarts and was actually a school for wizards and witches, the Ministry of Magic was concealed underneath Whitehall in London...

That, perhaps, might be interesting; whether London's a now futuristic city or a place in ruins after war, an excavation expedition down there could turn up the hidden underground ruins of the Ministry of Magic, with who-knows-what inside...

***** Ah, I suppose that makes sense. Do you plan to write this anytime soon? If so, what is your fanfiction username so that I can follow you?

I update almost never, though. Putting together full-fledged snippets is hard work for me.

** There's one, but it isn't exactly that, its called linkffn(Brown Coat, Green eyes) Where Harry goes into a magical stasis to "help civilization if it needs him in the future" after he's over 150yo and his wife is dead. He shows up in the Firefly universe, and he's trying to find the wizards that disappeared.

** The closest fic I know to that is linkffn(6471922), where Harry goes into hiding for about a decade. I vaguely recall hearing that a beta-reader of the original author has continued the fic, but I don't remember the details.

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?
