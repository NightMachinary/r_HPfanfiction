Few pieces of info; this was one of the first fanfictions i ever remember reading so I'd say its no less than 6 years old (just a safe estimate). It is most likely on Hpfanficarchive, as that was the first site I read fanfiction on.

I really only remember one specific scene, harry states that he dislikes blood pops, and prefers fresh. Pansy offers to let her drink hers. Dumbledor finds out and pulls him aside and strongly suggests that he not spread his curse. Harry states that he wouldnt have turned her, she would've had to have drank his blood to turn.

It'd be nice to find it, if it still exists, and read it to see how much my tastes have grown.


** By any chance was there a Dracula castle? Was harry technically considered the new Dracula?

*** Yep, that was it. It actually wasn't as bad as I was expecting. Wasn't amazing, but it was readable, and had a few good moments.

**** I only knew it because I search op, powerfull, godlike, etc on a lot of the fandoms I read and vaguely remembered reading that one while I worked through all of those types of fiction I had.
