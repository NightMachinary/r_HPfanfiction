:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I have no clue how to find this. I've spent a good chunk of the night searching for it and no luck.

What I remember is that Sirius either takes Harry from Hagrid or gets there and snatches him before Hagrid can on the night of Voldemort's death. Sirius flees to America trying hide. Sirius sets up a home with explosive wards in the mountainous countryside. Death Eaters (Or order members) catch up. There's an explosion. Sirius dies. Harry is taken into foster care.

Cut to years later, Harry has grown up in a suburb with a nice family who loves music. I think the father is in a band or something. Harry has stayed well hidden and somehow hadn't got an owl on his 11th? He's trying to plan out his life after high school IIRC and magic finally catches up to him.

They agree to a visit with Dumbledore I think. He brings the Weasleys to help ease Harry into magic while showing him a normal magic family. I remember Percy being enamored when Harry shows him how to play his gameboy.

Anyways Harry decides to go to Hogwarts. When he gets there, he is upset that Hogwarts lacks music. So as he enters the Great Hall, he does some embarrassing High School Musical routine where he slowly gets everyone to start making beats out of the things around them.

That's where I stopped reading because the author just flipflopped so hard in fic type.

So any help at all? It would be appreciated.


** The Revelation of Harry Forrester. If in doubt, do a subsearch here. I just typed 'Music America' and got two results - your post and the one I found this in. :)

  Sirius escapes with Harry after the Potters die. He makes it all the way into the US before Death Eaters catch up to them and he has to abandon Harry. Now Harry is alone. With no name, no history, and no trace. Then, after 13 years, Harry returns to Britain as a very different person. With a completely different view of Magic. A view that breaks everything. H/Hr.

*** Thank you!

I didn't even think to do a search here. Wouldn't think the search would really give anything due to how bad it usually is.

**** You're welcome. And I find it works pretty well, personally. Usually takes a couple tries to find the right search terms, but if you speak its language, it tends to put up relevant stuff, even if it's not what you originally went looking for. :)

** Sounds quite horrible to me, except for the music. There is so little music in the canon (and in the fanfiction world).
