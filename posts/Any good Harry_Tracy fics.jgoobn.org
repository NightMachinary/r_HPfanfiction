Any rating, preferably complete and long, but any length is fine


** I have no idea if they're good but I have these saved:

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Modest_too/Modest_too/?bypass=1]] [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Famous_Last_Words/Famous_Last_Words/?bypass=1]]

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7530624/1/Harry-and-His-New-Life]], [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11658183/1/Deadly-Love]], [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4508835/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Chance-Meeting]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7101025]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24029269/chapters/57815578]])

Some of these will be distinctly better than others but eh, they're all harry/Tracey at least. I'm pretty sure my favourite would be Modest, too and its unfortunate that its only a one shot.

*** I didn't realize Jeconais wrote a Harry/Tracey, so that just moved to the top of my reading list. Thanks!

And now I really wish it was more than a one shot, that had potential

  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller
