** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/][DLP 5 Starred and Featured Authors]] is the best of the popular communities. It contains stories either published by DLP authors or rated 5 star by DLP. Some of the earlier stories in this C2 don't hold up by today's standards due to having being rated many years ago but any of the recently added stuff is guaranteed to be good and the older stuff still has a good chance of being good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Excellent-Harry-Potter-Fanfiction/24898/][Excellent Harry Potter Fanfiction]] also looks reasonably good although I may be wrong as I've only just followed it.

This is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/My-List-of-4-and-5-Star-Fics/120084/][my C2]]. Contains fics that I rate at least 4/5. Need to remember to update it more.

I also have alerts for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Miss-Potter/19146/][Miss Potter]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Fem-Harry/93136/][Fem/Harry]] but they just list all Fem!Harry fics and the vast majority are crap. Maybe someday I'll find an unknown gem in there.

**** Yeah, Poison Pen is a known crap-fic that somehow got popular. From what I've seen in that C2 about a third of the fics there are 4/5 or above. That's about as good as you can get from a popular C2 that isn't the DLP one.
