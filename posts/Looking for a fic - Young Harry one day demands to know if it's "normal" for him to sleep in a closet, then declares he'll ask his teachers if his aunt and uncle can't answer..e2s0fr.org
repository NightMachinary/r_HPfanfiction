It works so well he uses that line again and again, and, +iirc, ultimately doesn't end up at Hogwarts. The wizarding world just has to cope without him.+

Edit: Found, thanks all.


** Are you sure he ultimately doesn't go to Hogwarts? That sounds a lot like linkffn(11591125), except that he is forced to go to Hogwarts at the end, even though he tries to convince Dumbledore he'd rather go to a 'normal' school.

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Harry, canonical level child neglect/abuse. Complete. Part 1 of the "Perfectly Normal" series.
