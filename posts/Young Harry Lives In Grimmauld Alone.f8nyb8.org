:END:
I distinctly remember a story where Harry, prior to going to Hogwarts, ran away from the Dursley's and in doing so stumbled across an empty Grimmauld Place. I believe he got inside by speaking parseltongue to a snake shaped door knocker. Sirius Black's mother's portrait was quite taken with Harry and allowed him to stay there even going as far to tutor him.

There may or may not have been a subplot about Harry utilising a camera but I may be confusing two different works.


** Shit, I am almost positive I've read the start of this fic, or at the very least seen it recommended here before.

*** I feel much the same way. This story is right on the tip on my tongue and it is driving me mental not knowing.

** Ok, so this sounds like such an interesting story that I've been hunting for it for like an hour and I haven't had any luck yet. Do you have any other details you remember about it? I really want to read this if it's still out there!

*** How frustrating! I don't know how much help this extra information will be but I've tried to remember as much as possible.

Harry (through a competition at school?) won a muggle digital camera which he used to capture the Dursley's wrongdoings as a child. He then used the images to blackmail them into feeding him, general acceptable treatment, and eventually allowing him to leave. When Harry recounted this story to Walburga Black's portrait, she was taken with his Slytherin aspects. By no means was she 'warm' to Harry or filled a parental role but seemed to think Harry could go far in the wizarding world and wanted him to fill his potential. I'm not 100% sure about this but he may or may not have gotten involved with some street rats first doing pickpocketing etc. before making his way to Grimmauld.

Hope you can find it! I am beginning to suspect the author may have removed all traces of it. I think I found it on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] if that helps

**** I found something that seems like it may be at least the starting premise of what you're describing. It doesn't go anywhere near grimmauld though, so I question if this is just really similar but a different story maybe. I've already started down this rabbit hole, so I think I'll just keep going! This story is both on ff.net and AO3, but has been on hiatus forever.

***** I agree that it is a notably similar and overall different story. Harry definitely went to Grimmauld prior to Hogwarts so perhaps I am confusing the start of this story with the plot of the one we are actually trying to find?
