** It started with an ad... "Personality Pens! Trick a Muggle, and watch the changes happen once they write one word! 16 Sickles apiece." Ginny was the one who ordered it, and she replaced Percy's quill with it while he was in the middle of a report.

"What the?" He cried, looking at the pen in his hand. "Where's my- I don't have time to grab another one!" With an eye roll, he touched the pen to parchment, and began furiously scribbling. Ginny watched, as her older brother suddenly through down the pen. She ducked under the table, expecting him to blow up about having to use a Muggle device. However, he merely yelled, "Hey friends and family, come see this!"

The other Weasley's, who'd been hiding behind the doorframe, warily crept into the room. Percy pointed his wand at the paper, making the words fly off. He then pointed his wand at each family member in turn, a grin on his face. The room went dark, and then the family looked at each other. They all had words on their forehead in Percy's awful handwriting. Even Percy had one, spelling "Balloon". Mrs. Weasley began to whimper, and started rubbing her forehead.

"No need, Mother! They'll come off in, oh... four days. See, no harm done! I even gave myself one, to make it fair." Fred and George walked up to him in sync, and poked his cheeks.

"What the..." George started.

"Heck happened?" Fred tapped his older brother on the head.

"Come on, guys. We don't have time for questions! I have so many other ideas..." With that, Percy took the stairs two at a time, leaving the rest of his family to stare after him.

"I... gave him a silly pen, to change his personality... I think it took on whoever's he's the most opposite of." She gestured to the twins, who looked at each other. "I'm really s-"

"YES!" The twins cried. "This is brilliant." They each gave Ginny a huge and bounded up the stairs.

*** *hug

Over the next three days, Percy's pranks knew no limits. He made Ginny's broom turn into bats while she was flying it, leaving her to tumble through the air, before turning the bats into a net. He made his father's shoes squeak like rubber ducks every time he took a step, causing him to have to leave the Ministry early. He also turned Ron's nose into a clown's, declaring it "fit to a T".

The twins were delighted with all of this, egging him on and celebrating the "newest member of the Weasley clan". On the fourth day, however, Percy finally crossed a line. He decided to prank the Prank Gods themselves. He turned the twins' freckles blue. They merely laughed and went to charm them off. However, the second George uttered the spell, each freckle began to glow, until both twins looked like walking light shows.

"How're we supposed to go into town looking like this? It's bad enough that we have these wretched words plastered on our heads." Fred said, alarmed.

"We were going to buy more card packs from that Muggle convenience store..." George bemoaned. "Now look at us, it'd be a witchhunt."

"I think it'd be a wizard-hunt, in this case." Percy supplied cheerfully.

"While we can appreciate a fine joke, we'd appreciate it if you stopped now. We need to get going."

"Mmm..." Percy pushed his glasses higher, before declaring, "nope!" He laughed and left the room.

"Something has to be done." George said. The rest of the Weasley family held a meeting, after telling Percy they'd seen Luna out for a walk. They hoped for her sanity that she wasn't... Then again, Luna would probably be delighted if he charmed a perpetual storm, or whatever it was that he had planned.

"I've torn the box apart! There's no instructions for how to fix it, none!" Ginny exclaimed. "I've owled the Prophet to find out who ran the ad, but..."

Her father pinched the bridge of his nose, just under where the words "Wires" was in messy handwriting on his forehead. "Maybe..." he started hesitantly. Just then, however, Percy ran in the room, slamming a box down on the table. The family froze as the plain box stood out like a sore thumb, monochrome except for the green print spelling "Personality Pen".

Everyone started talking at once, as Percy grew more and more red by the second. Then he burst out laughing, causing them all to cease and glance fearfully at him.

**** "I... it was me!" He cried through fits of giggles, clutching his side.

"Uh... Perce? I ordered it, from an ad... I'm really so-" Ginny tried, but Percy held up both hands, his face screwed up with silent laughter.

"Okay. Okay. Okay. So... I placed the ad." Everyone stared at him in turn. "I placed the ad," he repeated, "because I figured one of you would order it."

"You... wanted to have your personality changed? And is it... fixed?" Ron questioned.

"No... I-" Percy sighed, before straightening up, suddenly becoming the usual Percy. "I made the ad, bought the pen from the Muggle convenience store, and packaged it differently. I just..." Percy looked almost sad now, and he slumped a little. "I just wanted you to see that I can have fun too."

"You... that was all... you, Perce?" George asked wonderingly.

"The bats, the shoes, Ronniekins' nose?" Fred pointed at himself. "These lights?"

Percy sighed. "Yes, I just thought-" He was interrupted by a giant hug from his brothers. Percy wiggled out of it and waved his wand, undoing the changes he had made to his family's appearances. "I'm sorry to you all. I'll just go back too... studying, I guess." He turned to leave, but was stopped by a hand on his shoulder.

Fred spun him around, and placed both of his hands on Percy's shoulder. "It doesn't have to be... one or the other. You can mess around and still focus on school." Fred said, as serious as anyone had heard him be.

"Yeah!" George piped in. "We might be goofballs, but we do have plans and practical uses. Once school starts up again, maybe you can help us, and we can help you!" The twins beamed at Percy, who's eyes looked rather watery. "I'd... yeah, that'd be..." He was spared the awkwardness by their mother bearing down upon them, swooping them up in a hug, crying.

"Oh, I'm so proud of you..." She kept on muttering while Ginny and Ron slowly crept away, and Mr. Weasley looked on with a slight smile.
