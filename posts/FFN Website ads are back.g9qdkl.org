Yep, when reading a story in between the paragraphs there is an ad.

Last time this happened was 2019 March, and that was fixed in a week. Let's see this time how long it will last.

And to those who are gonna say "UsE ThE ApP" I prefer the website, idk but the app just feels weird.

Edit: Only on mobile, I tested it on my laptop and it seemed to be fine.

** Yeah I had to switch to Safari on my phone just so I could use it's adblocker, and it's a right PITA.

Whoever thought it would be a good idea to have like seven middle-of-the-chapter ads?!

*** It's not supposed to happen, but apparently some people get the source code and inject inside or some shit.

Usually I have no problems, but when it does start to happen I'm pissed.

** Get brave browser, it's based on Chrome, and has great adblocking.

***** I tried it but idk.

It's pretty much a Google substitute but I have all my things here on chrome and its gonna be a pain to try and guess passwords for all my accounts.

****** You can use it only for fanfic. That's what I do.

It's usually creepy for me when my browsing history becomes an ad on ffn. So I use brave only for that.

****** If you use chrome, you could try ublock origin (chrome extension). Can't remember if it works on fanfiction.net or not, but it only takes about 30 seconds to install it.

******** Yeah, but Brave has an app and the Adblock works fine.

The last time I checked (six months ago or so), moving passwords from chrome to Brave was a pain, so I just use it for sites in which I remember the password.

** Isn't that illegal? Presumably, the advertisers are making money from the fanfic, and since JK Rowling and her publisher will never see a dime of that, it's copyright infringement. Right or wrong?

** I installed Blokada on my phone just for that reason. I did not want to change a browser and no matter what the people say the app sucks in my opinion. Blokada's a adblocker but you have to jnstall it from their website, google play does not have any advlockers, it's agains their policy
