So, what I mean is Either Draco Malfoy DOESN'T get away with his bullying actions and is properly reprimanded by a teacher - (I've seen fics where he calls people Mudblood and prefects and teachers are just blasé about it??) or even Lucius going to jail early because his hand in unleashing the Basilisk in the school was discovered.

I see so many “Good Malfoy” fics that completely rose-wash their past actions as childish things that children do, as per “pureblood culture.” It's kind of sickening how easily people want to have the Malfoy family and Weasley family switch places in Harry's regard. If it's because the Malfoy family has ‘class' and money, that's just-

Anyway! Please, really just looking for fic recs along those vein. Please nothing violent where Harry is using Draco's bone fragments as a wand holder or something. Thank you!


** I'd love to read a fic like this. I'm fed up seeing fics where canon stays the same but somehow Hermione is willing to date Draco after all the shit he pulled. He nearly killed Ron and he began casting the cruciatus curse at Harry!

***** To be fair, it's not like most of those arguably should be unforgivable, short of extreme circumstances. I might as well make a list of times that the Unforgivables were used in canon, off the top of my head.

1. Snape killed Dumbledore with the Killing Curse, presumably. Assuming that the Killing Curse simply requires you to "mean it", then there are at least two different ways he could have meant it, specifically to "put Dumbledore down painlessly" as well as to "Kill Dumbledore in a gambit", which both turned out to be the case.

2. Harry Potter used the Imperius Curse on a Goblin to get access to one of Voldemort's Horcruxes. While you can say this was for a good cause, it is still unethical due to the fact that Harry could have simply convinced him. That, and he probably died due to that.

3. Aurors were allowed to use the Killing Curse against the Death Eaters in the second Wizarding War.

Still, while the Imperius Curse should have a greater effect on society, enough to easily make it unforgivable, and the Killing Curse has practical application, the Cruciatus Curse has no practical application, so it is definitely unforgivable.

****** Harry used a cruciatus curse on one of the Carrows for spitting at MacGonagall. There's really no justification for this one. There's a big difference between Bellatrix killing Sirius, and MacGongall getting spit on.

The same scene has MacGonagall using an Imperius on Amycus Carrow making him safely disarm himself and Alecto before she binds them.

******** She kinda zig-zags quite a bit on this, what with Snape killing Dumbledore with the Killing Curse, "for a good cause", Moody disagreeing with the Aurors being allowed to use the Killing Curse against Death Eaters, and Harry using Expelliarmus against Voldemort in the final battle, instead of the Killing Curse, after using the literal torture curse on a random death eater, and using the Imperius curse on an innocent person.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.
