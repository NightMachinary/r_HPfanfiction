For example, there aren't really any members of the order that we know much about other than their relation to a hogwarts student. Either show more of Kingsley character development, or completely build a new member from the ground up. As well as that there are only so many magical locations that we visit in the books, and even these we don't really learn much about other than hogwarts. Basically I'm looking for something that shows the last few books as a real guerilla war with big battles interspersed between good character development and world building. It might be a lot to ask for considering it would probably have to be quite a long fic to accomplish most of this so preferably something either completed or in progress and already quite far into the story. Thanks for any suggestions you have:)

Uh, I don't know is this is specifically what you're looking for but I can't see the word guerrilla mentioned in the same vicinity as Harry Potter and not mention this.

  Smarter Voldemort launches his conquest of Britain immediately after his resurrection. Smarter Harry, Sirius, and co. are the only ones who can stop him. Unconventional tactics. Begins after Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts.

** Not Harry, but Hermione is leading an all out guerrilla war against the Death Eaters in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), and she's coordinating closely with some Order members. She's not particularly powerful, but she makes for a very effective killer. Harry will shine later.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
