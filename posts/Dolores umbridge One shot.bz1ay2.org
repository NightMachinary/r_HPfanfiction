What was the Dolores Umbridge one-shot where everything was from her point of view and she actually meant good? Thanks.

** I have another story, but I couldn't remember the name. It was not one shot, and Dolores Umbridge lost her fianc√©e/husband to Death Eaters during the First War, so she is so afraid of return of Voldemort that she is in a heavy denial of it. In the end she dies heroic death saving Harry's life and helping final defeat of Voldemort. But that's probably the only story where she was at least mildly positive character (she still tortured children etc.).
