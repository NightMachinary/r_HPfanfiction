** I would recommend reading "protection". It is a very good story and definitely has a dark Harry. However, it starts fairly innocent and does not have horcruxes. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127470]]

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Here you go!]]

It's called Prince of the Dark Kingdom. Long story short, Voldemort won and has taken over England, but he's more an Evil Overlord a la Vader (interested in preserving the peace at any cost, ruthless to threats, but trying to do what's best for England the way he sees it) than a sociopathic mass murderer. He essentially takes Harry under his tutelage, and you certainly will see some "dark" trends and such as it goes on. Lovely story, nearing completion.
