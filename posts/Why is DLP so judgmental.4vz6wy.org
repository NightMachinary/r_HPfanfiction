** Has DLP devolved that much? I have never read a "kill yourself" comment on there, but I haven't visited for a long time now.

I know they are harsh critics and from time to time overstep the line between criticism and blatant insults, but that was always the case.

** You could just as well ask why [[/r/HPfanfiction]] is so judgmental. If you rec a fic most people here don't like, you'll collect downvotes, even if it was exactly what OP asked for. Similarly for people who defend HPMOR. The secret is: they're just different communities. Find the one that contains the type of people you see eye to eye with, and spend your time there. So long as nobody's brigading, that other community can't hurt you. Just let them do their thing, and you do yours.

**** I doubt the OP actually wants a genuine answer, they just want drama.

I mean, I sometimes lurk and occasionally post on DLP. I don't think it's the right community for me, to be honest. I wouldn't regard myself as a DLPer or whatever you would call them. But the trolls coming here and trying to stir up this sort of nonsense is ridiculous.

But that is irrelevant because you are answering to a troll post.

** "blind hatred of everything that the fandom generally loves." - I'm not even sure what this means. DLP is full of individuals with differing opinions just like this place is. Unless you're talking about concepts like friendly!goblins, magical cores, and Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Emrys-Gryffindor-Evans, which all because it may seem like a popular thing "that the fandom generally loves", doesn't mean it isn't shit the vast majority of the time. DLP is good about weeding through the nonsense to find the gems, and sometimes contributing their own.
