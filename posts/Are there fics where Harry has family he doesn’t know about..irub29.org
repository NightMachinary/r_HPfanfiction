I'm looking for fics where Harry other family on either the Evans side or the Potter side. Hell,I'll take fics where his grandma is Dorea Black. I rarely find any fics where my favorite son has other family to turn to.


** Linkao3(the reclamation of black magic) has Dorea Black (Harry's granother) waking up from a coma when Harry is five years old. I remember enjoying it. This author is pretty lemon-y, but I don't remember whether this fic was or not.

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Update: May 2020 --- This story has been getting a lot of new readers lately, so I wanted to let you know that, yes, this story is currently on hiatus. As with many writers, I struggle with mental health issues, but I am working on them AND working on getting back to this story as soon as I possibly can. I sincerely thank you for your sweet comments and patience*

  Complete! With a Light Lord interfering in Potter Family matters and a Dark Lord hell-bent on killing off the Potters, a cadet branch of the Potter family has to act. Armed with knowledge, Family Magik, and supported by many cousins, Harry takes Magical England by storm. Realistic characters and some bashing, HHR with less focus on pairings.

  ( “Why're you studying with Padma---” “---It's Parvati, Ronald---” “---Parvati, sure. Why're you studying with her?”“He looked tired and there weren't any other open tables at the time,” Parvati spoke up, sounding rather absent from the conversation. “He's been good company, until recently.”Harry winced. She sounded unimpressed.“I just thought you were related,” Ron said blandly and Harry had to physically restrain himself from bringing his head down against the table. For fucks sake, Ron. Hermione's very obvious pre-rant intake of breath sounded like a fucking gunshot, what with how loud it was.“---Ronald! Just because they're both Indian doesn't mean---”“---We are. We're first cousins---”You could hear a pin drop. Harry's surprised gaze snapped over to Parvati, who saw his confusion and looked at him like she'd never quite seen him in person before.“Beg pardon?” )In which Harry realizes that not even he's exempt from how interconnected magical families are.
