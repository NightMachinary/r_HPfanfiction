:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember a fic from MANY years ago, at least 5 but perhaps closer to 10, where Harry took inter-house unity really seriously. He was basically the big brother to the whole school and they had their own secret inter-house common room. There was also some kind of new magical sport that they (the author) came up with and they had their own championships? It just had a really nice vibe of friendship, and I've been unable to find it again for months now. Any ideas as to what it could have been or fics with a similar theme?


** I don't think that this is the story but Motivations by Jeconais has harry join an interhouse club that over time he becomes the head of. They slso have their own common room but I don't think they came up with a new sport.

For some reason if I'm remembering a story I read before I think the story your looking for has Mcgonagall reinstitute a crosshouse position that she gives to harry that has similar responsibilities and capabilities as the headboy position and allows him access to all common rooms. Problem is I'm not coming up with the correct search terms to find the fic.

** Is it the accidental animagus and it's sequel, animagus at war. I think of this mainly due to the broom game they dedicated a non insignificant tune to "Ricochet" which is basicly tennis with brooms.
