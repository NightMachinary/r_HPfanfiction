:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So the fic I'm looking for is a WBWL fic. Harry and his twin brother (can't remember his name) get attacked by Voldy while Lily and James are out, Harry ”dies” and so Albus goes to ”burry” him but he's actually alive so he gives him to the Dursleys. Harry gets beaten up so at some point he runs away into the forest behind the Dursleys house. This beautiful glowing woman finds him and takes him to her house to heal him. He wakes up and there 3 young girls around his bed. They are the daughters of the lady who helped him. They are homeschooled. The entire family have some sort of creature inheritance (pretty sure they have wings but don't quote me on that). Harry gets homeschooled too (wizarding style though so with magic) but eventually says he wants to go to Hogwarts and the girls who are old enough want to too. They go to diagonally and they see Lily, James and a boy who looks a lot like Harry. All this time Harry's brother has been called The-Boy-Who-Lived. Albus happens to be at diagonally too so James yells at him or something along those lines. I can't remember the rest though, I'm sorry. Please help me find it!!


** What's WBWL mean? I'm assuming it's W___ Boy Who Lived, but I have no idea what the W stands for.

*** It stands for Wrong Boy Who Lived. It's a story trope where Harry has a sibling or twin who is the Child Who Lived while he generally gets neglected or sent away.

#+begin_quote
  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF

** I also have a vague recollection of this fic. I have a think that I remember seeing that the author deleted if from ffn but I won't guarantee that that memory is correct.
