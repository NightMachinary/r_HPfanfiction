It's been a while since I've last read a Rose/Scorpius fic and I would really like to rekindle the butterflies I feel when I read their fics. Please help me find worth-the-read Rose Scorpius fics. Thanks!


** Yikes. I just saw R, O and Weasley and my mind just read Ron. For a moment I was like- WTF? Why would Ron do such a thing? Revenge on Malfoy?

Anyway, usually I don't bother with reading fics about the main cast's kids due to the silly names, but my post would be spam without a recommendation so here's one. I haven't read it and have no idea if it's any good.

  *COMPLETE* There was never a hatred so profound as that of Rose Weasley and Scorpius Malfoy, but when a challenge is issued the pair embark on a roller-coaster ride of emotions and confusing, passionate meetings. Enemies with Benefits never tasted this good, and Rose is going to learn there is a whole lot more to Scorpius than a lifelong rivalry and a wicked smirk. RW/SM.

Rose Weasley as a bounty hunter, with a Rose/Scorpius ship. A super fun read by one of my favorite authors. She also did a sequel and some other fics in the series. Fair warning, it's been a while since I've read it so I forget exactly how prominent the ship is in the narrative, but it was a good read for sure.

  “Malicious lingering, no violent priors. Got a wife. Should be just another midnight run. Read for yourself.” I decided he didn't need to know the bit about the Dark objects. We really needed the money. Besides, I was starting to like the idea of taking this guy down. I'd finally be like a real bounty hunter. How cool am I? I'd say. I took down a Dark wizard. Sort of.

** The Stygian series is Rose/Scorpius, I was more interested in the story than their relationship. But their relationship is also interesting and has quite a bit of screen time.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.
