:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A fic where Harry, Daphne Greengrass and Dylan Lestrange (OC) fight against Voldemort and other forces and gradually build up a society. There is also something about a space station? Or a galactic society or something along those lines.

It's a long and completed fic and one of the scenes toward the end is when the society is built and these three have died due to old age, there are statues built of each of them with inscriptions on it. Wisdom from each of them is inscribed on a plaque, and this is used as guidelines to live by in the society.

EDIT: Found it!!

** Is that really the fic you were describing? I was curious about your description but this doesnt seem to have a trio focus.

*** The Voldemort-Arc (upto Ch 40) has a focus primarily on Harry, with the trio focus coming up towards the latter part. After that, it becomes much more apparent.

***** Like I said in the edit, the trio is not Harry, Hermione and Ron. It's Harry Potter, Daphne Greengrass, and Dylan Lestrange (OC).

Gonna change the main one itself now.

*** It sounds crappy when I say it like this. But the story itself is actually pretty good. The way it's written at least.
