I'm in the process of writing my longest Harry Potter story, and as I've considered how to go about it, one of the things that has occurred to me is that Gringotts, in a lot of fanfics, seems to do almost everything under the sun (wards, healing, financial related things, lawyers, and so on). Do we have any evidence that this is the way it was in canon or is this pure fandom?

To me, it doesn't make much sense. The bank should do bank things (investments, loans, and financial advice). Wards are tricky, as I suspect that the goblins would be great at wards. But would they really have a service to put those wards on places outside of their bank? It would seem to me that they'd want those wards to be as secret as possible so as to not create a security flaw in their own system. Healing and other services seem like, to me, creations of the fandom to explain away the fact that JKR didn't build a very complete world (after all, a lot of the details about the wizarding world only came to us after the books were published). Thoughts?


** They are the bank by virtue of monopoly.

They have tomb-raider - read curse-breakers

They are the extent of the goblin nation as we see it.

That said, I hate the friendly goblins trope. The historical friendship with House - whatever 100 or so Harry is inheriting. The one wizard was finally kind to us.

I like it when they are detached, curt, polite in the most basic way to hide disdain or disgust. A "I am showing you the basic courtesy, hurry up so I don't have to deal with you stench anymore" kind of way.

Healing and lawyers should be straight out. Same for dealing with inheritance, except as it relates to the transfer of wealth within the bank. Not to say they can't have means to verify identity by blood, just that it won't bring with it seats in the Wizgamot unless you work it through the Ministry and just because you are related to some other family unless you bring the proof, ie Will, with you then you don't get the monies/goodies in the vault. Likewise, there should probably be a point of forfeit if a vault goes unclaimed for X amount of time.

The wards/cursebreaking make sense as it applies to the bank. The have cursebreakers go, break into ancient tombs for the wealth, which they use to mint money or earn money at auction, and also to learn new methods to improve the defense of Gringotts.

Also, consider no interest earned, but fees charged to use the bank. Again, so far as we see they are the only bank open to the incredibly isolationist Magical Britain. The only way I can imagine that happening is because the Goblin Rebellions did not end well for the wizard, but not it a total victory for the goblins. Yeah, have fun figuring that one out.

There are my thoughts on it, and what I have tried to keep in mind when I have to deal with them in my writing.

*** Wills are too muggle for the setting, I personally like to think that everyone with a vault is in some kind of magical signature or blood registry which they can use to track a person's heritage. Basically the magical equivalent of a DNA vault doing family trees.

** I greatly dislike the trope, almost to the point of it being a complete no-go.

I personally write Gringotts as a bank mainly. And even then, not as a modern bank, but as a bank doing what the first banks did. Store wealth and loan money. Thats it. I also include a trust or escrow service within the "store wealth" part, since wealth isn't just existent in the form of gold, but I only use it for internal logic, not for actual text, since an inheritance hearing (or whatever) is never interesting to read about.

But for everything else I tend to use wizard-led shops. Wards, Healing and so on and so forth can be found on Diagon Alley, or on one of the smaller alleys. I find the notion that Rowling hasn't built a complete world, in this context, to be a bit silly. She gave us an entire alley with shops and vendors. To put everything into one institution isn't her fail, but only speaks of the lack of creativity by the fanfic author. If you need another shop or service for your story, just /make/ another shop on Diagon Alley.

*** So at first, I was kinda disappointed in Rowling, then I realized that everything is told from Harry's perspective, with a very few notable exceptions. The question then becomes, how trustworthy is Harry as a narrator?

Personally, I don't find him the most trustworthy when it comes to the make-up of the economy or the inner workings of the wizarding world. Which is great because it lets us as fan writers take and build on what we are given.

** Honestly, if you're interested in world building, make GG exactly what it is, and only what it is - a bank, and nothing more. An all-service-provider is boring AF. The legal, medical, and other shit that we see are just evidence of ff writers having little to no imagination. I mean, it was okay the first few times, but these days, every Tom, Dick and Harry uses those tropes.

** Gringotts offering many services kind of makes sense if you make it a proxy between wizards and goblins in general, so all the exchanges go through it. But making it the go-to place for services in general? Nah. Goblins are considered untrustworthy little shitstains by wizards (even by their own human employees like Bill), so the main wizarding service providers should be wizarding businesses by sheer virtue of bad reputation. Banking is a guaranteed monopoly by peace treaty (I think; it happens in literally every fic so it might be fanon), but aside from that they should only really do stuff not offered by wizards or where you might reasonably justify the goblins being very much better, like metalworking.

Cursebreaking in the Bill sense of the job is fucking weird tho. I mean he's literally a criminal by any reasonable definition, only there apparently are no social or legal penalties for graverobbing and looting archeological sites in the magical world. I don't think Rowling realized the implications of cursebreaking: Bill is literally a corporate Ren√© Belloq.

** We know they handle high-security storage units and have old-school banking services -- hold on to your cash, and likely manage loans. We know that goblins run gambling books, though that may or may not be a service of Gringotts. We know they employ cursebreakers to go and break into ancient magical tombs, so they're probably in the ... wealth acquisition market.

And that's pretty much the extent of what we know from the books.

It's what we can infer that's fascinating. Obviously the bank is just the public face of the goblins as a people. The employees don't seem to live anywhere else, so there's likely a whole society down there, maybe even an underdark (D&D) equivalent.

But the most interesting thing... wizards distrust goblins, think little of goblins.... and hand all their money over to goblins. Why is that? Best theory I've read: Because the goblins won. We know that there's an endless parade of goblin rebellions, and the wizards don't seem to actually have that much control over goblins, except maybe as it relates to the statute of secrecy.

Losers don't get handed control over the economy. Loser's don't get to live their lives largely unrestricted by the winners.

The wizards certainly think they won, but the facts say they didn't. So what's up with that?

** I mean, the goblins do live under the bank, don't they? So they're gonna have to have some sort of society - with their own healers and whatnot, at least. There are elements of the usual "Goblins fix everything" plot that ring a little true. Even if it's medic support for cursebreakers or something. Doesn't mean any wizard off the street will go to the bank instead of the hospital, but if a kid passes out in a meeting room, I'll bet there's someone in the building who could check him out.

Wards are a mixed bag - they ward the shit out of their bank, of course, so they know what they're doing, but they probably wouldn't go ward your house or whatever. But I'll bet they know a good subcontractor who could handle it. (Of course, if you don't set up your own damn wards, how can you trust them?)

If I have a business advisor on my payroll, as most of these ancient houses probably do if that's the fic you're writing, then yeah he's going to know attorneys and warders and other contacts. Because it's bad for business if he doesn't - my usual mental image, and the one I'm using in my current WIP, is that the "account manager" is just that. Simply a goblin who has worked with a family for a long time. Not some "I declare you emancipated and also here are eleventy-trillion galleons from Merlin, along with seven rings and a betrothal contract" deus ex machina. More of a "we invested your funds reasonably, and I worked with your father and he was a good man, and based on your situation you might want to consider doing X...." He shouldn't have all the answers - but having a few and pointing HP in the right direction usually will make for a better story.

I agree that the whole "Wow, kid was polite so let's let him visit our King" nonsense is just that. But it's a useful moment to separate angry/douchebag Harry from polite Harry, even if nothing comes of it. Sorry Harry, remembering people's names is basic - you're not going to get the keys to the Gryffindor vault by recognizing Griphook.

*** This can work, though I would say based on how the goblins are presented they would just throw a passed out wizard out on the street. Not their problem.

The account manager role makes sense, particularly if the goblin profits from the accounts profiting. To the point, knowing of services outside Gringotts and pointing the account holder that way is different from providing them himself. Afterall, maybe they aren't the best, but he gets a kickback from the account holder of the attorney office for sending business that way so he remembers Bratt, Brandon, and Brad instead of OMFG perfect lawyers.

**** Depends very much on the wizard, as much as on the goblins.

But a manager who had worked with Harry's parents, maybe grandparents? Who had a personal relationship with them over time? He might go a bit above and beyond, if Harry gets overwhelmed and passes out in his office. If done properly, it's a character moment for the manager, making them more than a plot dump.

There's two kinds of people - the ones who tell you why you can't have something and the ones who figure out a way to let you have it anyway. I usually think of the goblins as the second type - do what they can, and then charge all the traffic will bear. Might be that that attorney doesn't kick back part of their fee - but sends other business right back to the manager. Again, it all depends on the characters.

***** Fair point. I suppose it depends on how much complexity you are willing to devote to the story and how much any of those conditions will affect the story. The rabbit hole goes far Alice, be careful you do not get lost in the warrens before you find the end.

****** Agreed. Of course, when asked how deep a dive I plan into goblin culture, the answer should be "only as deep as necessary". I have several tropes I plan to tear down, and will really enjoy doing so when I get to that point.
