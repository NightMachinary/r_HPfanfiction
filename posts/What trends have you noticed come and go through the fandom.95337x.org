** Trends I Noticed When I was Active in the HP Fandom (2013-2015):

- Harems - it was literally everywhere, a big boom of harems, even in the other fandoms I followed.
- Fem!Harry - most if not all of them unfinished (Tsume Yuki comes to mind)

I currently just got back to reading again, and I noticed a lot of Tomarry fics in AO3 involving Time Travel. I know that Tom/Harry is one of the most popular slash pairings, but its story count is kind of gaining on the Drarry ones I think.

** Fem!Harry is surely the most dramatic change. Until around 2011 there was basically one fem!Harry fic in the fandom and it was little more than a canon copy&paste with the pronouns changed. Now they're everywhere.

Incidentally, the amount of Harry/Malfoy slash seems to have reduced - or at least, there doesn't seem to be nearly as much of it when you browse FF.Net by "recently updated". Back in the day it was like 50% of all fics. I wonder if the people who used to write it are now writing fem!Harry.

** Everything is the same... it's just a different same than it was 10 years ago. Every other fic used to be an indy!Harry fic. There's still plenty of them being made, but it's died down quite a bit and it seems to be mostly holdouts, or people only discovering fanfiction recently and writing fics similar to what they first read.

Now, there's some very obvious trends. It feels like the biggest one to me is fem!Harry. It's always been a thing, but I've never seen so many new fem!Harry fics. In the past, it was mostly just a hundred different "responses" to the SilverAegis one.

Overall, I'd say there's not really as many outliers before. Everythings just so... condensed. There's not as many crazy AU epics. Everything is just... safe. Things like dodging prison and stealing witches wouldn't even have been remarkable 10 years ago (it would have got shat on horribly), but in the absence of a million similar fics, it's like people forgot that that is what the general fandom used to be like.

This one features an OC but it's so well done I honestly don't care (and I usually can't stand OC fics):

And this one claims to have a weird ship (which I didn't notice until halfway through the fic, when I looked at the tags) but we're nearing 40 chapters in and the story is still gen (so I don't know what's up with that), and it also features possibly my favorite characterization of Harry Potter ever:

** I'm curious how many are actual trends and how many are more so personal trends. I know someone else mentioned time travel as a recent trend, but I remember reading a lot of them 6~ years ago. That said, I remember a trend (whether personal or in the community) of read-throughs, where the characters gathered in, usually, the room of requirements, and read the entire series. I haven't read any new ones with that trope in years

**** Like I said, I don't really like Dark!Harry as a trope---it's kind of depressing---so I don't read many Dark!Harry stories, and I appear to not favorite (or otherwise save) any at all. However, here are a few stories that I do like that fit the bill well enough:

And this is one I'm currently working on reading through, that I am /really/ liking and would definitely rec:

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

***** That's my mistake, I mis-remembered what the exclamation point does. "Dark Harry" in the search box will find all the stories that have the word's "dark" and "harry" in the title, summary, and I think the four main characters spot. "Dark!harry" will find all the stories that have "dark!harry" or "dark harry" in the summary or title. The exclamation points makes it so that the words have to be next to each other and in that order. Though punctuation points can be between the words, so some irrelevant stories will still slip through. Basically its a way to narrow your search.

** The Weasleys-are-bigoted-blood-purists-and-perhaps-Death-Eaters trope is my guilty pleasure. Okay, calling it a trope might've been a bit of a stretch, but I've seen a few. Not to be mistaken with Weasley bashing.

I mean, c'mon! They have so many fucking family members and they're all competent. Imagine how damn terrifying it would be if they're in Voldermort's side!

Bill: such a good curse breaker even stingy anti-human goblins are hiring him\\
Charlie: could've been a Quidditch professional but also heavily implied to be super good with dragons and who knows what else\\
Percy: has the brains and the persistence to pull off perfect OWLs and NEWTs /and/ rise pretty high in politics\\
Fred and George: brilliant and creative inventors and businessmen\\
Ron: managed to juggle Being Harry Potter's Best Mate and Not Dying at the same time, learn the Patronus Charm, and survived several battles\\
Ginny: good fighter, has what it takes to be a good Quidditch chaser / seeker, survived the Weasley household

There's a lot of stuff I haven't mentioned but you get the gist
