:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I didn't even read past the first chapter or so, but I was looking for some new stories to read and I came across this one, and for some reason I closed the tab it was on, or safari glitched, and I can't find it again!

It's probably because it was abandoned and I don't usually like reading abandoned stories because I get sad that it's not finished, but still, it's bugging me that I can't find it anymore.

I really only skimmed it to see if the writing and concept were good, but I remember some stuff.

It's a Marauders Era time travel fic, sometime in the 70s.

From what I remember, Hermione breaks into Dumbledore's house (or /maybe/ office; I can't remember,) but he mentions that she dismantled his wards to get in. (Which obviously shows that Hermione is quite adept with ward work; so maybe she goes back sometime after her and the boys were on the Horcrux hunt?

I don't think we're even told that Hermione is talking to Dumbledore until the last few lines of the chapter. /She/ knows it's him, of course.

If I remember correctly, this scene might take place in an unlit room, or with very little light, as I believe Dumbledore is mentioned as being a silhouette or hidden in a shadow. I think there's a mention of his silver hair.

Now, Dumbledore has no clue who she is until she says something, so he's wary at first.

I remember the author mentioned that the man (Dumbledore) wandlessley and nonverbally stirs his tea/coffee/drink, and Hermione realises its a subtle show of power that would intimidate an intruder (which Hermione technically is.)

I also remember Hermione outright saying something along the lines of “Tom Riddle will go after the Potters and try to kill their son, Harry.” I don't remember if she says it's on Halloween 1981 or not, but I know Harry wasn't born yet in the time she's telling him this, since it's the 70s, and the Marauders + Lily are all still in school.

Hermione seemed pretty prepared for all of this, so I think her time travelling might have been intentional. (Like I said, I skimmed.)

I think the pairing was with either Sirius or Remus, /maybe/ Severus, but more likely Remus or Sirius.

It should have been above 60k words, but sometimes I search with the 40k+ filter too, so it could be around that length as well.

It seemed very well planned and written.

Whether this happens as chapter 1 after* a prologue, I cannot remember, but it was a fairly long chapter, nothing short.

I'm sorry that this is all the info I can gather! Thank you for any help!

#+begin_quote
  After Harry dies on a mission to capture the last few rogue death eaters, Hermione does the only thing she can with her grief -- channels it into research. On the eve of the sixth anniversary of Voldemort's death, Hermione finally finishes her research -- a timeturner with an unlimited span. It will be a one-time trip, but if she times it right, one time will be all she needs. Now stuck in the past with nothing but a story and a righteous sense of justice, Hermione finds more than she ever expected to.

*** You're totally right!! Thank you!

I suppose I was going through the chapters quickly until she time travelled so I could see when it started to happen!

(I had this story open in my tabs the whole time too haha)
