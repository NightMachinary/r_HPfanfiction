/Harry and Hermione are child musical prodigies and discover their talents before starting school. A close friendship develops before Hogwarts and the magical world will not be the same. A/U for the most part, with very little canon content. Friendships will be different but no character bashing. Well maybe Draco, but nothing untoward./ Rated: Fiction K+ - English - Friendship/Romance - Harry P. - Chapters: 8 - Words: 30,965 - Reviews: 185 - Favs: 252 - Follows: 376 - Updated: Jul 8 - Published: Aug 30, 2013 - id: 9644106

After six years of self imposed exile in the Muggle World, Harry returns to Hogwarts under the request of Albus Dumbledore. AU book5 some angst, some slash, some action, some music. [COMPLETED]

In this fic, Harry is a drummer and in a band. This is an older fic and it is also slash, predominantly Harry/Snape. That's not normally a pairing I like, but Harry is an adult who has been away from Hogwarts for years, so I find it much less creepy than most HP/SS.

** I read one where for some reason he goes to see Madam Pomfrey and she heals him, he finds out he can actually sing, at one point in the stoey he sings dancing on the Ceiling while doing just that. It's a powerful Harry story but for the life of me I have never been able to find it again.
