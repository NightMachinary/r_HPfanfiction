  Harry must have been lonely while living at the Dursley's. What if he wished a friend and it worked? "Inquisitive, unconventional Harry. Lots of humour" like someone said. Writing gets better later on, said another. In the end H/Hr, some N/L.

** I'm currently re-reading Methods of Rationality, that Harry is supernaturally smart (for a reason that is explained later on towards the end), he's morally good and his ultimate goal is to save everyone.

  "You are not fooling me, Harry," said the old wizard; his face looked ancient now, and lined by more than years. "I know why you are truly asking that question. No, I do not read your mind, I do not have to, your hesitation gives you away! You seek the secret of the Dark Lord's immortality in order to use it for yourself!"

  "Wrong! I want the secret of the Dark Lord's immortality in order to use it for /everyone!/ "

***** Overpopulation? And if to combat overpopulation they stop having children it would lead to social stagnation. Other countries? The fact everyone regardless of who they are is immortal? If people aren't made immortal at birth who is given the power to chose who receives immortality?

Why do you assume that "social stagnation", whatever that is, would necessarily bad? And of course magical immortality wouldn't be the immortality of senescence, but of youth; nobody's goal is to remain alive whilst being increasingly, but never completely, moribund.

On the plus side, long-term consequences would suddenly matter. If the dead Koch brother had had to live through the coming resource wars, would he have ruined the earth still?

Is everyone immortal or just some? But if course everyone who wants it gets immortality.

None that are prohibitive, and then the question becomes if our resistance to immortality is more than a coping mechanism for its erstwhile impossibility.
