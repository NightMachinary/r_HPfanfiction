** Northumbrian on ffn has some really good fics. I haven't read them all but I glanced at most. My favorite is "Strangers at Drakeshaugh" which tells the story of the Potter's moving into a Muggle town through the eyes of their neighbors. I really like that it explores the strangeness that Muggles must sense when they encounter magic.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  [Development Hell] Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi

  "Will you wield greatness gently?" Harry was told the truth of the strange events around him by Petunia at an early age. However, the result of him exploring his magic led to Dudley's tenth birthday ending rather differently. A near death experience leads to an encounter with a far more sinister Truth. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. Innocence is no exception.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

I started reading it and the sun and moon shifted around me for hours until I stopped and realized like two days had passed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688609/1/A-Little-More-Time][A Little More Time]] <--- Pretty neat, I liked it, good take on Teddy Lupin, good take on time travel, funny jokes, weirdly heavy sometimes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] <--- Fucking /fascinating/. Very well done.

*Weird Snape shit that isn't everyone's cup of tea but also I didn't expect to be my cup of tea and it ended up being pretty great:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6329597/1/Snape-s-Memories][Snape's Memories]] <--- Solid take on child abuse, which I didn't actually expect, putting aside a minor faux-pas wrt autism in the last few chapters. Weird, but interesting.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4400517/1/Ananke][Ananke]] <--- To be honest, this is just the only thing that's made "Snape/Lily" not creepy in my eyes and I think that's a fucking /feat/ of writing. I mean, that's basically the one ship I find myself most instinctively repelled by that doesn't involve anything actually illegal (which I think is reasonable because Snape is an incel who emotionally abuses children in his care, but for people who /like/ Snape/Lily, I think this fic does it incredibly well).

*Honourable Mentions:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] <--- Badass math Hermione being badass and math and Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4380964/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Dungeon-of-Merlin-s-Mist][Albus Potter Series]] <--- It kind of goes off the rails after a while but for the first two books or so it's pretty great. I haven't read past the third one, though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10847788/1/Goldstein][Goldstein]] <-- /Orthodox Judaism/. Ravenclaws. Everything. It's amazing in its handling of religion, which... I never expect from fanfic (and I didn't think I cared, not being religious myself, /but still/).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7779108/1/The-Master-of-Death][The Master of Death]] <--- This one goes weird places but I'm here for it. Only crossover in the list.

** I shit you not I have a list for just this occasion. Just saying that these are all Drarry fics, some are slash but others the relationship in minimal or a background story.

Firstly, my all-time favourite fic Evitative ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461]]) this is slytherin!dark!Harry but not evil!harry by any means. He's resorted in his 5th year, so you get to see the Harry we know well rather than a completely new person which often happens with slytherin!harry fics. It's written really well, paced amazing, 200K words and an AU of OotP, they explore dark magic amazingly, I think it's based on the author's pagan religion but I'm not sure. Anyway, big time suggest.

Okay this is a very close second, and it's probably been mentioned already but, Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022]]) This also has a well done podfic if that's your thing. Harry for some reason doesn't end up at Hogwarts and Hermione and the squad are on a mission to track him down and teach him magic in the hope he can help with the war. About 100k words and the characterisation, 90s feel, British references and amazing humor this fic deserves an award honestly. Draco and Ginny are done amazingly also Desi!harry and Black!Hermione which was a really nice touch. It's a story of spice girls, underage drinking, queer youth protection, uni life, floral rice cookers and so much more, it's one of those really special fics.

Another of my favourites, but if you're not into slash might not be for you also is heavy on the angst in Temptation on the War Front ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4373594/chapters/9926705]]) Written amazingly, like not a fault with that at all, they keep characters close to canon well and makes sense to the plot. It's a DH AU where Malfoy has defected and is dumped on the golden trio while at Grimmauld Place. As I said heavy on the angst, physical violence, not a 'happy' fic, especially in the beginning, but the relationships between the characters and how they all interact feel so genuine, with 180K and so it's one of my favourites.

Okay next is Running on Air, I really sweet fic, kinda sad but nice ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378]]) Harry's assigned to Draco's missing person case and discovers a lot about Draco and himself. Beautiful descriptions and scenes that make you want to get in your car and drive everywhere they've been. I really nice fic 75k and worth the read.

Lastly Hidden in Plain Sight is another great fic ( [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/984156]] ) worth reading for the setting alone, makes me want to visit Ilfracombe very badly, I love the south of England. A really sweet fic, quite slashy but worth the read at 56K.

** Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay, by Saphroneth. The title sort of tells you everything but it's really well written and addresses quite a lot of plot holes, gives Dean, Seamus and Neville, and Blair for that matter, much bigger roles in the narrative (making the Golden Trio more of a Golden Class) and also introduces a couple of really fun OCs (I wish Tyler and Anna were canon they're wonderful).

** Unfortunately, I've long lost my old accounts with favourite fics but here's some decent ones, ones that stuck out - perhaps because they are different to my usual tropes.

A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles:

It says what it is on the tin, really. The author keeps Snape's character in line with canon versions, but with added background. I think it's quite a balanced take on him.

linkffn(7937889)

Text Talk:

This one is superb. I gave it a chance following a rec, as a dip out of my genre. So, it's a non-magical AU with characterisation that fits canon (fanon?). I know slash is not so popular on this forum so I should warn for that.

ao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1651109/chapters/3501239]])

Azoth:

In all, I would say that the premise of the fic is slightly mad and I feel it shouldn't work, except that it really does.>! Harry decides to become a potion master, tutored by the dead Snape's portrait and assisted by a bargaining Malfoy.!<

My core recommendation for this fic is the way the writer creates emotional tension by allowing post-war young adults to work through the transition from war to peace time. It focuses primarily on Harry's difficulties adapting to a world in which he can make choices out of preference rather than necessity. Yet the author also manages to develop other characters in the back. The transition to Harry/Draco is done with sufficient character development that it feels natural, rather than forcing the reader to dive right in.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1049966]])

The Second String:

If you're into LONG fics, then this one is for you. It's a different take on time travel, slightly weird. I have to admit I didn't have the stamina to get through the whole thing. It's one of those fics that feels like it could have been separated into a series, so I felt I had come to a natural conclusion.

link ao3[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966]])

A New Kind of Normal:

I like this one because I think really shows perspective taking. It's clear to the reader where misunderstandings arise, but the author carries through with the information each character has so you can see how characters come to their own conclusions - to their own detriment. If I remember correctly, it's told from Harry's perspective for the entire or almost the entire fic.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

  It's been eleven years since Harry Potter brought an end to Voldemort; eleven years of peace, eleven years of recovery.But not every wound can be healed. Teddy Lupin is loved and wanted by his family, adored by his grandfather, welcomed in the extended Weasley clan, and happy that he's about to start at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but he still feels the loss of his parents and the last lingering traces of the war.As he begins his Hogwarts life, he finds connections to his past that he never suspected... and manages a bit of mischief as well!

*** As for why I love these stories: 1. It was nearly a year ago that I read AP, but the characters and the plot twists stay with me even now. The characters are amazing, their motives are believable, everyone is so deep and relatable. I can't divulge any specific reasons I like it without spoiling things, but... just trust me. It's a masterpiece. 2. AQ is another one. It's set in the US, and builds the world of Magical America amazingly. It feels alive, and dare I say the worldbuilding is better than the original books. It also really makes you wonder which side is the good side, and which side is the bad side. The characters are from a variety of different backgrounds, and each one feels so real. The best part is that the main character, Alexandra, is very flawed. In the first books, she's very childish and rambunctious, and sometimes even annoying. That is what I live for: imperfect protagonists.

** The fact that no-one's yet mentioned [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][The Very Secret Diary]] is criminal.

It's Chamber of Secrets but told through the writings of Ginny and Tom in the diary. Starts off mundane, slowly goes horribly wrong, and then gets rather sad and dark by the end. It's a foregone conclusion, really.

(It's very old though, so it calls Ginny ‚ÄòVirginia' instead of ‚ÄòGinevra', which threw me at first. But it's well worth it.)

Another one I commonly recommend is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance Of Sally-Anne Perks]] as it's a great mystery.

Harry remembers a mysterious child from the sorting who disappeared. Now in his third year, Hermione and him search for the fate of the missing girl, and discover at the end of the tale, a saddening but also important moral to not dwell on the past.

(Well worth a read, go into it knowing literally nothing as it's better that way.)

Finally, on the slightly more... weird end of the scale, I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13132217/1/Pranking-The-Tournament][Pranking The Tournament]] as it's a fun read.

It's a story in which Harry decides that his entry into the Triwizard Tournament is an opportunity worthy of some antics, and so decides for a bit of a... change-up. There are some unforeseen consequences and opportunities for a laugh or too along the way.

(Note: if a feminine Harry isn't your thing, avoid it, although read it anyway because it's funny and him (her?) taking down Snape is glorious.)

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** It's gotten me through many dark days with multiple readings. The Resonance Trilogy by GreenGecko. Harry defeats Voldemort, but Snape is the only one who appreciates how Harry is still suffering. Eventually they become a family as Harry moves on into Auror training, his powers still growing to the point where he can cross into alternate realities. The third story was abandoned with just a few chapters to go, but so much had been resolved that you could see where it was going. I took her notes from her website and added it to the material at fanfiction.net and made it all available for offline viewing with these files:

  Harry has been through a lot yet there are some perks to being as gifted as he is. So he's not going to just sit back and let the world shit on him. He's going to best the absolute best. First few chapters are hard to read. Get past those and I promise it gets better. Also, I know the beginning sounds very cliche. It's explained later so try to stick with it. M for bad stuff

** Rest in Silence By Rewrite Paragraph on ao3

(Sorry, but I don't know how to copy links.)

Oh, there are many things I could do with you Harry.' The undertone of his words rang through the air like a crack of a whip and Harry flinched. ‚ÄòAnd with the Horcrux embedded within you.'

‚ÄòTry it. See what happens.' Potter seethed.

Then Voldemort charged forward in a blink.

After they both danced upon the bones of his father, Voldemort discovers Harry Potter is the seventh Horcrux he never intended to make.

This changes everything.

A ceasefire is agreed, Harry Potter is collateral - the target of Voldemort's newest, most potent obsession.

And, Death has come knocking.

 

This fic is bloody awesome. Plain and simple. It also isn't what you expect and sadly, it isn't finished yet. The last update was nearly two months ago. And this is among my favourite Tomarrymort (my OTP) fics. Though I understand how this story, and pairing, is not everyone's cup of tea. And be warned, there will be smut and plot twists. It also gets worse before it will get better. Be warned.

And it's sequel

[[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunrise_Over_Britain/index/]]

I have no clue how folks post the links with the summaries, so I'll copy/paste for Sunset:

"Harry's life at the end of his 5th year was in utter chaos and his life was not going to get any better any time soon. From the flames, a brotherhood thought dead will reemerge, a family will break, trust will be destroyed, an enemy will change their path, a father will finally be found, a love will bring hope, and a hero shall rise from the ashes to become the legend he was born to be."

Just FYI, it is a Harry/Hermione story (with a crapton of side-pairings), and is very much an independent!Harry tale.

Very long, and super weird, but strangely great!

Also, Isolation by Bex-chan. Best Dramione fic I've ever read.

Edit: I've never read The Psychic Serpent, so HP & the Time of Good Intentions (sequel) can definitely be read on its own, but maybe it would be worth checking out.

** linkffn(Benefits of old laws) - does a brilliant job of handling a Voldemort working his way back to sanity and becoming a decent person, all while Harry comes to terms with being adopted by the man who murdered his parents.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]]) - first of a 3-part series in which Harry, Ron, and Ginny go back in time only to find that not all is as they remember, and someone else has come back with an agenda of their own...

linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool) - a classic in which Harry goes back and a bit sideways in time. It has some very dark stuff, and also some hilarity and zany antics.

linkffn(Faery Heroes by Silently Watches) - Lunar Harmony fic, the three go back in time to 1995 and start robbing the Death Eaters blind, with a brief break for a bit of Shoggoth-wrangling.

linkffn(Harry Crow) - It's got some issues, sure, but it also manages to make everyone's actions make sense in-character, and has more characterization and character development than the entirety of canon.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it.

** Linkffn(To Be a Slytherin by Morgana Deryn) This fic is my absolute favorite fic of all time. Twinfic, Has female hp twin Lorena Potter paired with Draco. One of the reasons that I think I love this fic so much is that I identify strongly with the character, and it provides a different perspective and new events while not being outlandish. In addition, it's super long, and Snape is the freaking best in this.

  Like every sister, I love my brother no matter what. Even when he's an idiot. Even when he's in the spotlight and I'm forever waiting in the wings. That's life as Lorena Potter. Can't complain, really. At least I don't have a psychopath out for my head. OC-centric DracoXOC
