:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a really cute child!harry fanfic on potions and snitches a while ago and I can't find again!

I remember Snape going to check on Harry around Christmas time, and he overhears little Harry and Dudley arguing, and Harry says something about waiting for his Daddy to come get him. Harry doesn't get any presents for Christmas, so Snape goes out and buys him a Merlin doll, and Harry loves it.

Pretty quickly Snape rescues Harry from the Dursleys and they say at an Inn on Diagon Alley for a little while, i remember the whole fic being super cute.

One other detail is that when little Harry meets Dumbledore, he compares him to his Merlin doll.

Any ideas?

EDIT: I don't actually remember if this is a biological-dad Snape fic or just an adoption fic.


** It's called "Mine" and it's on FF.net. I'll link directly for you as I assume there's loads of fic with that title so dont know if the bot would pick it up.

** For series, I prefer AO3 or Potions and Snitches to FFN, just because they allow the author to designate them AS a series. I don't like having to search the descriptions on FFN to find all the linked stories and make sure I'm reading them in the correct order.
