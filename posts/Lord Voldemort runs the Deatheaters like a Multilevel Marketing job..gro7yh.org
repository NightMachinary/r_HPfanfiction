**** Yeah we're led to believe that voldie and the Bois were winning the war when baby potter offed them. So the audience is sort of in media Res in that we see voldy post offing. And we only see voldy getting the Bois back together and winning before being offed again. So I'd love to see a prequel series leading up to his first offing. With the last scene being voldy entering the house in Godric's Hallow with James potter yelling "take Harfy and run!" As it all fades to black.

EDIT: Also I just feel like umbridge gets more screen time than voldy - at least in terms of the number of lines she has. Voldy has a few lines at the end of book one, end of book four and five and at the end of book seven

****** I meant Voldy's story in general, I have no real interest in Marauder prequels or Snape's story since we know enough about him. I really wanted some Grindelwald action and the Fantastic Beasts films gave me that. I guess I'm just a weirdo that enjoyed the second film up until the Blood Pact bullshit, which severely undercuts Dumbledore's entire character arc. As a more general thing, I feel like they can make a good prequel series as long as they ignore JK's apologist agenda and give it to a director who cares about the content.

****** In another thread people were talking about a ‚ÄúHarry Potter Presents‚Äù series where it's stand alone stories set at certain times and places in the Wizarding World. Like Rogue One was to Star Wars. HP Presents Nymphadora Tonka and the Auror Corps. Or HP presents: Androcles Mcdonald Undercover Auror. Or what not. Maybe then they could lay off of the fan service and just tell good stories. I love your comment

******** That is so true. I wish the new Star Wars series was truly about a next generation or stand alone tales. I agree that in reality they would make a Harry Potter Presents series as fanservicy as possible. I actually kind of wish the series was in public domain like Holmes or Dracula. Think of what could be done. One the other hand though there could be a ‚ÄúMy Immortal‚Äù movie of the series were in public domain. Not that that's a bad thing:)

**** That's an interesting fic. But when I say seductive, I don't mean it quite so literally. Tbh I abhor TMR/HP fics with a complete and utter passion. Though I've never read a FemRiddle fic so I'll give it a try. Ty.

Dumbledore mentions in Chamber of Secrets that wiser and more powerful wizards than Harry and Ginny have fallen to Voldy's charms. He was close to winning the first time and actually did take over the ministry the second time. There's no way folks would have joined him if all he did was Crucio his own followers. If he's supposed to be wizarding Hitler, where's the grand speeches, the whispers of gifts of power that he would grant to his most faithful & why does he only make a cursory attempt to get Harry on his side?

My own guess is that the first dying experience and soul splitting ruined his sanity, but we have no proof of that being the case in canon. Finding well written fics where Voldy's (relatively) sane, powerful AND not interested in boning Harry are rare. The only satisfying ones I've read are: Prince of a Dark Kingdom, The Lesser Sadness and Kurinoone's Dark Prince Trilogy (though IDK how the latter has stood up to the test of time).

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.
