While most witches and wizards would not have chosen this existence, there were a few who felt an ongoing duty of protection to Hogwarts and its students, giving not only their lives, but their afterlives to the cause.

Peeves took personal offense to such a exclusionary selection (having had no body as such, and only deigned to attend the 'death day' party to cause havoc), and promptly dropped the machine into the algae-ridden punch bowl, soaking several living attendees.
