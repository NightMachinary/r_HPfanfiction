After a few days of brainstorming I think I finally have the basic idea of my plot down:

I'm writing a crossover romance between Cornelius Fudge and Chancellor Palpatine. The basic story is that it takes place during Half Blood Prince and the Minister needs additional aid because of high casualties. So he contacts the Chancellor, who comes to England and stays with Fudge. During this diplomatic time, a romance develops between them.

However, things aren't too great because President Snow of Panem is also vying for power and wants to wipe out opposition overseas. President Snow ends up kidnapping Fudge and Palpatine is helpless and distraught, so he has to go to the Order of the Phoenix for help, but they're too busy fighting Voldemort.

So, Palpatine is forced to search for Fudge alone. He flies to Panem on an aeroplane and tries to go to the Capital, but Peacekeepers arrest him and he's brought to Snow. Snow puts both Fudge and Palpatine into a special Hunger Games called the "President's Choice" and makes them fight a bunch of other people to the death. Palpatine is severely wounded and soon it's just down to he and Fudge, but Fudge can't bring himself to kill Palpatine. They eventually escape when Dumbledore rescues them. Now, Palpatine is torn between staying with his lover in England or going back to his home. He realizes that he has duties to his own government job, but his love for Fudge is too strong to just leave and he feels indebted to him.

I like this idea because it's going to be an adventure survival story mixed with romance. Here you have the Chancellor who has to fight to the death in the Hunger Games. He only grabs a medical supply pack so he doesn't have any weapons But, his desire to save Fudge helps him push forward and he even gets really injured in the process. It's a sweeping epic.


** I would really question Palpatine being interested in Fudge, whose defining characteristic is political incompetence. I think you'd need to develop Fudge a little more to pull that off.

** I feel like Palpatine's force abilities might make the games a little one-sided. Perhaps his stress at having to fight Fudge causes his powers to weaken temporarily?

Not really. The stress would lead to anger, and anger is something the Dark Side is fueled by. Basically, stressing out a Sith Lord is a *bad* idea.
