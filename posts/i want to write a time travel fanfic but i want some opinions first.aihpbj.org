** Considerations:

- Do time travelers have freedom of actions?
- Do time travelers actually end up in their own past or in a different universe where things could be significantly different? For example in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight][The Red Knight]], Ron ended up in a place where Hermione and fem!Harry were actively trying to kill him!
- What advance knowledge do time travelers possess? For example in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], Harry did not know about Horcruxes, and that fact greatly increased his challenge level.
- If the traveler indeed had critical advance knowledge and ended up in their original universe, DON'T BOTHER with maintaining the timeline! They should try to maximize the effectiveness of their advance knowledge. For example, if Harry ended up back in Year 1 again, he could come clean with Dumbledore right away, out Barty Jr and Wormtail immediately, shut down Lucius Malfoy, confiscate the Lestrange vault, get most of Horcruxes within a couple weeks, and maybe even neutralize Quirrellmort. They would now have plenty of time to deal with his scar and remaining Death Eaters. The story might be less challenging, but it's still far better than to write about STUPID protagonists who tried to keep that BS timeline.
- Since your Harry came from an obviously very dystopian future, he should have no problem dispatching those sadistic genocidal maniacs. Don't get bogged down in "good guys don't kill" trope here. In fact, you might want to use another character (e.g. Hermione) from the new timeline to moderate his worst tendencies.
- Finally, if you have him going back to the 1930s, just kill Tom Riddle in his orphanage. We already have WAY TOO MANY fics in which he raised or shagged him. As for where that story could go, make him face off Grindelwald and stop Hitler before they killed millions.

*** Considerations:

- Yes, Harry would have complete freedom. I plan on doing a redo fic, Harry would go back to his first year, most preferably. -I'm not sure if it'll be the same, should it be? would it make it more interesting?
- Harry doesn't know Snape was tasked in killing Dumbledore because Harry killed Snape right after, he does know of all the horcrux locations except that he was one, because Snape was meant to tell him.
- I do plan on having Harry go to Hogwarts, only for first year most likely. This is to get rid of the diadem, Pettigrew, and Professor Quirrell. He'll most likely “disappear” during winter after he gets his cloak, and destroy the rest of the horcruxes then. He wouldn't tell Dumbledore, figuring he can do everything on his own.
- My version of Harry is literally incapable of using the Cruciatus curse because he doesn't truly hate anyone more than himself, but he's just fine using the other two.

thank you for your response!

** redos are a lot of fun, my only advice is to not spend a lot of time rehashing shit that the readers have seen already. if some events are supposed to happen pretty much like canon, then skip over them and summarize.

also its cliche not clique

** So you're saying Harry has an ally that used to be an unspeakable, but they can't remember ever being one. Then one day the secret keeper dies and his Ally suddenly is like, oh yeah I used to be working on a secret project that was about time travel, that'll save the day quite nicely.

Seems like an OK plot actually, maybe have Auntie Andromeda Tonks, or perhaps the arithmancy or ancient runes professors seem like they might be smart enough to pull something like that off, has to be someone intelligent.

Either Harry will go back in time as his adult self, or else you will force a soul merger of adult and child Harry. So maybe their experiement is with time soul magic. Easier to send a soul than a whole body. I dislike when the adult Harry then mopes about like he just killed child Harry or flipping fom one personality to another, or keeping child Harry like a Horcrux soul stuck in adult Harry's mind watching him killing people and feeling horror.

Don't have Harry sleep with anyone under 14(and preferably 16), even if they are married in the future.

*** Yep, thats the idea! I was thinking it could be Professor Vector, she was the professor of Arithmancy. I like the idea of soul time travel, and this Harry would be battle worn so I don't think he'd give much thought to his “younger self”. I don't plan on having romance be involved much at all, so no problem there. Thanks for your input!

  If you like certain pairings, you've seen them--the stories where despite (or perhaps in spite of) the author's best intentions, the story is painfully cliché and overdone. But how does one master the art of the cringefic? What are the beats necessary to achieve the masterpiece in the genre of time traveling Harry Potter fic?Wonder no more, dear readers.

** My only rule of time travel fics is : if you go there, you have to change everything you can. No excuses.

​

Because it is really annoying- especially with Hermione fics- when the traveller is worried about " not changing the timeline"...hell, dude, why do you think magic brought you there? just to bask in the ambience?

​

I would say there is some sort of degree of praticality involved; if you want to keep it a secret, for example, you will act in a way people will not suspect you...and if, for example, you cannot change the set up ( like, let´s say, stay at the Dursleys) you can definitely change the results( get into an agreement with them to be provided with room and board and be allowed to be a free agent at school no harry hunting of keeping the grades down, in exchange for money- not in a million years I would think Dumbledore practical enough to have offered the Dursleys compensation for taking Harry in...) really, any other idea that does not make Harry a willing victim, or repeating the exact same things...

​

IMO, Harry knowing the outcome, would definitely not want to be sorted a Gryffindor. In order to change things, he would have to act and change the mentality of that whole school. For that, a neutral house- Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff- would be better. He would definetely not form any golden trio, but make many friendships with key people along the Houses- Susan Bones; Longbottom; Hermione; Luna; some grey family at Slytherin- and I think he would be on friendly terms with all the Weasleys, without the whole 2 second son" to Molly routine because, if you come to think of, to be so closely identified with a family of that notoriety would place them in danger again and have this wised up Harry consider their safety in all his schemes.

​

I dislike time travel fics where Dumbledore should be " the only to know": in canon, he is the only one to know many things, and the results were far from positive.

​

All in all, if you are making an effort to go there, change everthing.

** I mean, honestly? I don't see the Unspeakables just "kicking someone out" with all that information.

They would either obliviate him, put him under a vow/magic ritual of some sort or never let him leave at all.

They are unspeakables for a reason. I don't imagine they would just let someone go with all those secrets because of a technicality.

*** hm. thats fair, it's a work in progress. I don't think they'd kill anyone, but yes, most likely obliviate instead of using that charm...

if they where to use a vow, i could make it so there'd be a technicality that the vow was null because the vow was to “As long as the Unspeakables stand, don't say a word”, and since there wouldn't be any left, the vow would break? Thanks for you input, in any case.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.
