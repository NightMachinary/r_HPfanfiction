It's always great to meet fellow writers! I write mostly humor and next-gens, and I post on HPFF. I haven't been writing very long compared to most people who do (about 1.5 years now). I certainly never would've expected I'd still be writing now. It's improved my writing in general quite a lot and been loads of fun, so no regrets!

*** Definitely :D Writing's like a idea dump for me and it's like a load off my mind. I hope you do publish something! I find most fic communities pretty friendly.

I'm pretty shifty with my knowledge of canon to be honest, which is likely why I've gravitated toward next-gen. I just really like writing in the world JKR has built. Quite nice how there can be so many different kinds of outlets in the same universe.

** I write! I am currently in the middle of two HP fan fictions in between my actual novel. One of them is a retelling of Snape's time in Hogwarts if he had been the fourth member of the Marauders instead of Wormtail. The other (and my main fan fic currently ) is a next gen fic. It's got Albus and Scorpius working as teachers at a school in America (thought it quickly dissolves into political intrigue, obviously).

I try to keep things as in character as possible, though I won't lie, I adore the Slash and even if its not super obvious, almost everything I write is Slash flavored. I only post to FF.net mostly because I grew up on the site and never bothered to branch out. I'm comfortable with their lay out, so there you go.

**** Oh, you know, decided to abandon Slytherin. I mean, come on, who wants to be in the evil House? Slavito of Slytherin is such a pretentious name. Slavito of Hufflepuff has such a nicer ring to it.

jk. The CSS gods have just chosen to put me in the House of the Partial Hufflepuff for the time being. :P

First they would call us the House of Spares... then they would call upon our House to /spare their lives/.

**** Ok! Well, you can find my next gen fic [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7253935/1/The_Art_of_Teaching][here]]. I warn you, I tend to write kinda long chapters. So there's only nine out at the moment, but it's already over 100k words. Basically, don't start a new chapter if you don't have the time xD

Just...please ignore some of my older stuff. I took a very long break from writing fan fiction and haven't gotten around to cleaning up my account yet. Thanks!

** I used to write Harry Potter fanfic and posted on FFnet. Now I stick to another series. But I'm not sure I want to share what 14-year old me wrote during my lunch breaks. I'm surprised I got so many reviews still.

But for the other series I write for - I just like writing as a hobby. Plus after reading so much I felt the urge to give back to the community of sorts.

I stopped writing in the Harry Potter world because I'm out of original ideas. If i'm going to write something I don't want to do what's already been done good, and after lots of HP fanfic I'm out of ideas. But I enjoy the occasional story.

** I write. I'm a shameless fan of most canon pairings (Except Harry and Ginny, you are NEVER going to convince me that those two had enough to make a lasting relationship).

Currently quite obsessed with the terribly cliched Rose/Scorpius fictions. But I do also have a nice Andromeda Black / Ted tonks fiction floating around in my head (but I can't bring myself to post it after one of the most quality fictions I ever read was on that pairing)

*** Not a Harry/Ginny fan either, mostly because Ginny annoys me. Maybe it's just a first impression that stuck from the first time I read the books. Movies didn't help.

Scorpius, on the other hand, I throw him everywhere in my stories. Rose/Scorpius, Victoire/Scorpius, Scorpius/OC. Poor thing's become the Next Gen wildcard. Do you write a lot of eras or just read them? HP's the only fandom where I like reading just about anything that's good, though I know most people have strict preferences for pairings.

**** I hate readding stuff that isn't cannon, just can't deal with it (Methods of Rationality excluded from this naturally).

Dracomione's just will not be read by me either (because, they exist in real fantasy landto me, I mean Draco REALLY didn't give a shit about Hermione and GENUINELY believed she was like the dirt on his shoe.)

Don't like Lily James fics because in all honesty, I dislike gryffindors. Sounds harsh, but I find them to be a very blunt, tactless boring house, Slytherins make for far better reading. (Hence my love for Andromeda/Narcissia/Bellatrix fics).

And yes poor Scorpius, he is totally wild carded. But personally, I think you can really do what you want with the next generation. I like to start from a standpoint where the Weasleys have been elevated to a point of high fame and an almost superhuman status, and the Malfoys being the equivalent to mudbloods instead, makes for some very interesting character development in my opinion. I mean how can the Weasley/Potter kids NOT end up fucked up if exposed to riches and fame. I mean I can just imagine Ron Weasley spoiling his kids rotten to avoid them never feeling poor in the same way that he did. I can imagine Harry's kids to be too at ease in the public spotlight. At the reverse I would have thought that on the whole, the Malfoy's would live a very horrid existence, after all they defected at the last second, so their standing among the pureblood community (well those left who aren't locked up, which really isn't many) would be severely dimished and then in the public eye they would be openly hated and Scorpius would be born into this hate (I love fics that use this as a driving point to define his character in one way or another)

Don't mind reading AU fics either, as long as they are pretty wildly AU, but keeping characters off JKR in character. Oh and I drop all fictions that are like "GRYFFINDORS GOOD, SLYTHERINS EVIL!" immediately.

** I've been working on a story for almost a year now. I think it's turning out pretty darn well so far, about 120,000 words in...but it's not even a third of the way to being fully written out, I'm afraid. It's the first HP fanfic I've attempted, but it's an idea that I've had for a while. Lupin is one of my favorites (books and movies), and I wanted to explore his character further. It's definitely more of a character exploration thing that just "OMG LUPIN YAY MAKE BABIES WITH MAH OC," dealing with grief, loss, loneliness...and, yes, a bit of romance. Once I finish it (who knows when that will be...), I plan to submit it to FF.net. But only when it's completely done. I hate when authors just quit on a good story due to hiatus or other obligations.
