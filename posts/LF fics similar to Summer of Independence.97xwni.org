I like that it has Harry studying subjects not taught at Hogwarts (in addition to the electives that he doesn't take in canon). I'd love to check out similar fics where Harry studies/learns a lot. I also (was very surprised to) like the Harry/Dudley friendship that came about in this story, so other stories where there is a positive cosuin relationship are cool too.

I've read Runemaster and MOR (and probably a lot of the other well-known ones, but feel free to suggest popular ones like this in case I haven't seen them somehow).

I also like the HG/HP pseudo-sibling angle so fics that contain elements of that are welcome too!
