I know, I know! Power cores and quantifying the level of magic in a person isn't logical and makes for lazy writing, but it is still something I would like to read about. We all have our guilty pleasures and this one is mine.

Stories that have magic that can only be done by magical beings with a certain amount of power, or ones that have some way to quantify how much magic a person has in them and then also gives a list of different levels such as: muggle, squib, wizard/witch, sorcerer, mage, grand mage, and so on would be what I am looking for. An example of the later would be linkffn(1470503). Do not judge me too harshly; it was a simpler time in HP fanfiction.

Any stories that fit the description are most welcome. I would also love to see any ideas you all might have on how such tropes could more realistically be used would be interesting as well.

** The ending plot in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter) revolves around using magical cores to enter comatose minds. Cores are referred to in the rest of the series but are never used as an uncomplicated power-up. It's the most interesting take on magical cores that I've read.

** linkffn(4776976) is one of my favorites, and it features "magical cores" and wizards/witches who are more powerful for various reasons. It's quite long, but I think it's fairly well-written, and it has enough interesting sub-plots that I've read it several times and have not remembered all the details.

*** So i do not generally read slash as I have found they are normally very poorly written but that can be said for most fics that deal with romance. I read the beginning authors note on how it isn't graphic so I think I will give this one a shot. The 600k word count on it is the main driving force behind me wanting to read this, especially on how quickly the author actually wrote this story. 600k words in less than 6 months is astounding so I tank you for the recommendation.

**** I hope you enjoy it! The main pairing is not the slash pairing. I am always surprised when I re-read it how long it is, and I love that - I can read for days and still not finish. I read pretty quickly so that rarely happens.

** A request is a request - since I've got a rec, I can give you judgement-free. I don't think magical cores factored into it, but some of Harry's powers work entirely differently when compared to modern wizards in linkffn(Prophecies, Secrets and Lies) and its sequels. Unfortunately abandoned, but there's enough there to indulge in, I'd reckon.

*** YOU! Well if SOMEONE might update their super awesome and amazing story, certain someones might have something to read! I absolutely love the story and pretty much everything about it. Sassy wand is hilarious. Please keep up the great work and I eagerly look forward to your next update.

As for your recommendation, I am well aware of that series by shinysavage, I wish they would finish it but I understand the issue they had with it. Plus, we probably wouldn't have linkffn(Hallowed by shinysavage) and that story is really turning the Tri-wizard tournament on it's head.

**** Eheheheheh... sorry 'bout that. I'm working on it, I swear. The encouragement is much appreciated, of course :)

As for Shinysavage, I also wish that he had the time, energy and motivation to work on both, but as someone who was introduced to his work through that series, I agree - /Hallowed/ is life and I'll be a fan 'til I die. Man, I love fanfiction.

** Engulfing Silence's Gift of Memories Series has Cores, he is 3 Books in, although the stories are on Hiatus as he finished up other unfinished stories on his page.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8670912/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Gift-of-Memories]]

LeadVonE's Current Work Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches uses a more obtuse but still obvious use of the Magical Core

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw]]

I personally like the idea of Magical Cores as it answers the question as to why anyone would fear Death Eaters and Riddle as they out numbered them 20 to 1. If the Death Eaters where magically stronger than other people than it makes sense they could run roughshod over the Wizarding Public, especially if they aren't strong enough to defend themselves. Same with Riddle, why would these Proud Purebloods who can't stand even working with Muggleborns accept kissing a man's robes like rats? Riddle has to be magnitudes stronger than them, but everyone says thats wrong and that Every one is the same... Bullshit Riddle got them on his side thru a slick talk, and then cowed them into submission through feats of strength they could only hope to replicate with the help of 5 others. Hell, Albus Dumbledore could match Voldemort but McGonagall, Slughorn and.Senior Auror Shacklebolt couldn't make him sweat in 3 on 1 combat, yet all things are equal?

*** I am with you on all of your points. There has to be levels or an upper echelon of power to describe people like Riddle and Dumbledore.

I don't think I have read your first recommendation yet so it is very much appreciated! I don't mind it being on hiatus as long as there is a glimmer that it might be finished one day. The second one is a story that I have seen recommended a lot on here but I have been put off by it's title. I will check it out though.

**** It is not a smut fic, rather a WBWL-Time Travel fic. Harry will eventually get it On with a number of women, but not for a number of chapters. May seem like "super!Harry" but not really, Harry is powerful but he definitely can't do it all and will be relying on his "group" for much of the things that will play Plot roles

*** To me, it also explains why floo powder is used when everyone can learn to apparate. If some people aren't magically strong enough to apparate themselves, or maybe they aren't strong enough to side-apparate their children, then it makes sense why the floo is still the primary mode of transportation.

** Maybe I should start my own thread, but are there any such fics where Harry /doesn't/ have the biggest, magicalest core of his generation, while not being a near-Squib either? E.g., Harry is plenty good, but it's Hermione, or Draco, or Ron, or Neville that's the powerhouse of their generation?

*** I haven't read it myself but I think this one probably matches your Hermione request linkffn(10070079).

There was a story from way back in 2003 or 2004 where the trio were learning how to become animagus from Prof. McGonagall, Draco finds out and weasels his way into it as well and becomes some crazy dragon with like five different heads. I think they explained it as him being stronger than them but I am not too sure. Maybe making your own post would get more traction.
