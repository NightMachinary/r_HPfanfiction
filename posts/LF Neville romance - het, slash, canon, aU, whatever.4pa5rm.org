What the title says. I'd prefer AU (and a bit of slash mixed in) but anything goes. Oh and I love the non-badass Neville as much as the badass one.

Thank you!

Edit: sorry for the capitalization mess up

  When there's a significant drop in the magical population, stressed Unspeakable Hermione Granger finds the answer. The Wizengamot threatens a Marriage Law unless a temporary Procreation Bill can make them see reason. Fortunately for Hermione, her chosen spouse knows how to work out all of her tension. --- Rated M for language and sexual scenes (Neville/Hermione) *Art by Simona Polle*

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

*** Yeah, /Amends/ is quite good. The writing is extraordinary (I love the "voice" and the playing with tenses and persons), and the threesome makes a weird sort of sense in context.

** linkffn(The Landscape of the Heart by Bedelia): Balances angst and fluff and humor and recovery and romance, all rather nicely.

linkao3(Not A Gentleman So Much As A Gentle Man by Rozarka): Fun oneshot with smut.

linkffn(7238489): This was a (technically) canon compliant Neville/Luna and Neville/Ginny fic, unfortunately abandoned early. I do like the part that's there though.

linkffn(11410569): Neville/Hannah. post DH. Romance with a dash of mystery.

  The Firewhisky became a habit after that, though they would both insist that it was a friend, not a crutch. The kindly intermediary that moderated their visiting across the bar on busy nights, slow nights, work nights, weekends. It loosened their tongues. Post-Hogwarts, Epilogue-Compliant.

** I've recommended this one several times here already, so I apologize for reccing it again, but it's one of my favorite fics of any pairing. It's Snape/Neville, which sounds ludicrous and might put you off, but I'd ask you to give it a try anyway. It was written long before canon closed so it's not compliant, but it's wonderful, and Neville is perfectly characterized IMO, and Snape is fantastic.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1104139]])

I just recced this one yesterday in a different thread, but it also gives good Neville, in this case Neville/Percy with background HarrySnape.

  Snape swooped around the room like a giant bat, adding ingredients to some cauldrons and stirring others. Then he stopped and tapped his wand against the benchtop impatiently. "Well? What is so important that I must risk a vital brew of Animaserum by having you in the room with it?"His tongue was so dry, he didn't know how he would ever get the words out. "Heartsease, Professor." There, that wasn't so hard. He took a deep breath. Dementors were worse, surely.
