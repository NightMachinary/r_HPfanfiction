Is it spending all your time inside a single cell? We know Dementors bring in food to your cell rather than taking all the prisoners to some lunch room.


** Hard to say. That bringing food detail is from Sirius' experience and as Fudge once said Sirius was one of the more heavily guarded prisoners in there so it could be different for lower priority inmates, who knows

*** Given the presence of Dementors, I'm not sure that having communal areas etc would make much of a difference. No one would be able to muster up the will to do anything other than sit in their cell, even if the door was open.

**** Debatable. Not everyone seems to react to Dementors by curling up into a ball and crying --- take Bellatrix, who was more of the "screaming wildly and thrashing" sort.

***** If you take the movies as canon, I guess. In the books, we know that the true power of Azkaban is that prisoners can't even muster the will to want to escape. Sirius explained it: he wasn't able to think clearly enough to leave until he latched onto a thought that was not happy, so that Dementors could not take it, but was nonetheless a thought that helped him muster the strength to leave: the knowledge that he was innocent. So the barrier to Sirius' escape for all those 13 years was not ability - he was an animagus all along - but that it took him that long to muster the mental strength to actually desire to leave his cell.

** It's guarded by one of the most fearsome creatures in not just the HP universe, but in all of fiction. Dementors are pretty goddamn brutal and Azkaban uses them as wardens. That prison is all punishment and no resocialization. Worse even, since you're not gonna leave that prison after any prolonged time in it without a bit of a mental health problem.

I would imagine prisoners get thrown into a cell and are then practically forgotten in it. Dementors bring them food, in order for them to gather more gain from the prisoners. But sanitation, room, comfort is all very medieval-dungeon style.

My further headcanon is that Azkaban is known around the world as pretty much the worst prison you could land in. It's as if Guantanamo Bay had a lovechild with an North Korean gulag.

** [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Azkaban][Here's the HP Wiki entry on it.]]

To my mind, it's sort of like Alcatraz in that it's on an island, but a bit different since it's out in the middle of the North Sea. With Alcatraz, you can see the City right there from the yard. I would be hard put to say which situation would generate more despair--being on an island with absolutely nothing around you or being trapped on an island with a vibrant, wonderful city in sight and sound.

I would imagine that there would be different levels of incarceration. Perhaps some offenders are allowed some freedoms such as movement and exercise out in a yard of sorts and maybe communal dining whereas others, such a Sirius, are kept in solitary confinement. Prisoner comfort would not be a consideration and they would be constantly cold which would contribute to the feeling of despair already generated by the Dementor guards.

Everything would just be unrelentingly grim and extremely boring. If you ever get the opportunity to visit Alcatraz, take the audio tour. You can hear former inmates talk about how they kept themselves sane while in a pitch black solitary confinement cell. Then multiply that by a thousand and you probably have Sirius's Azkaban experience.

** I just want to add that I think Azkaban is ripe for a good AU - could it be like a regular prison with abusive wardens, gangs, etc? Maybe it's a one giant cell with brutal violence for supremacy? I think it could be the basis for a good fic.

**** I'm not saying the prison industrial complex is good, I'm just saying that there is a difference between solitary confinement for life versus being able to move throughout a prison.

Obviously the prison industrial complex is discriminatory and another way to re-intrench antiblackness in our state, but I'm not a nihilist; there are worse systems (like North Korean concentration camps).
