Now Harry can be part of the story, but I'd rather him not be the main character in it.

If Hermione is the main character I don't want her to be written as perfect, so many Hermione is main character stories tend to have her written as perfect, with little to no flaws and struggles, which gets annoying.

ANYONE can be the main character, just not Harry.

No Weasley Bashing if possible please

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.


** The Arithmancer-verse is a three-parter Hermione-centric series. She's not perfect, although in general she IS slightly more powerful than in canon. Most of the differences, however, are very well-explained, and the story itself it top-notch. It's my favourite fanfic ever and I reread it every now and and then.

One of the things that keeps me in this series is that there is actually closure post-story in the form of AoA (Part 3). It feels like many authors think "Oh, the war's ended, someone won; end of story" or "War's over; fast forward to main character death after they've lived a long and happy life". However, there's this long period in the middle there that it seems many authors tend to ignore - sure, someone won, but how does society rebuild? How do people move on? How do people deal with PTSD, with trying to live normal lives again? The end of the war is the end of one story, but more often it symbolizes the start of another that far too few bother to explore, and it's sorely missing in general fanfiction.

It starts out a bit slowly as it does some worldbuilding, but it really picks up in year 3 or 4, and year 6 and 7 are just blow after blow.

  What if Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange had had a daughter during the first war, who had to grow up without her parents, living among the winners of the war as a child of the losing side? This is the story of Cassandra Lestrange, a girl with the fierceness of her mother and the determination of her father, lovely and lonely, who belonged only to herself.

**** It follows them all through Hogwarts (and earlier for Hermione) so there is a decent amount of adventure and silliness. It's a T rated fic so to me the romance is light and sweet more than anything but it's a major factor as they get older.

***** Well, I've gotten as far as the Troll Incident. The fic seems intent on showing all the amazing ways it could have diverged from canon and become interesting, and then /not/ doing that, instead rehashing canon word-for-word in some cases. Does it get better?
