:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This story takes place in year 4 exclusively. Harry is pretty close with Dumbledore, Dumbledore is like a grandfather to him, more so than in canon. I got the impression the Dumbledore felt responsible for James and Lily's death and he wanted to care for Harry when he could.

​

Harry is kind of a loner Ravenclaw and is unsurprisingly pretty studious. When he get's selected for the tournament he thinks that he's completely outclassed and thinks the only way to survive is an esoteric branch of magic that nobody else has used for centuries. I forget what it was specifically, but it was something like earth/nature/celtic/nordic/druid sorta magic with long chants and some of the spells he could do were like looking at Cthuluu levels of impressiveness.

​

It was unfinished when I read it and likely still is. any help?


** It was called the Helian Magics and its from linkffn(The Life he Leads)

He's also a Gryffindor, IIRC, even though he is indeed a loner.

**** Not really, you got it down pretty accurately, just the Ravenclaw stuff.

And lets be honest, it isn't hard to mess up different fics, seeing as they're all similar in the fact that they're all in the HPverse (xover excluded, obv)

So is Neville in the Tournament or is it only Harry?

****** Only Harry. Sirius was also in jail, same as canon. Its pretty much exactly as canon, except Harry isn't the BWL, Neville is. No parents for either, Dursleys (though I might be wrong and Harry went to an orphanage, I don't actually remember) for Harry, Augusta for Neville. The trio is Nev, Ron and Hermione, and they did all the shit Harry did. Harry's best friend is actually Tonks, and that's saying something, considering he only met her in his fourth year. Sirius is also more concerned in helping the BWL than with his godchild.

This is one of my main problems with many AU fics. Everything seems to happen because it happened in a similar way in canon. Most authors don't think about the effects of a single divergence can have on the timeline.
