I have an idea for a fanfic, but I'm struggling with what to call it.

Harry gets sorted into Slytherin, befriends Draco and doesn't ever interact with Ron except a handful of times and (by Dracos influence) Harry doesn't particularly like Ron and believes that (from Draco's words) "Some wizarding families are better than others."

Halloween comes around, and a troll is set free and kills Hermione after she had been in the toilets all day avoiding Draco and Harry's unnecessary comments and snide remarks.

The fanfic follows Harry and Draco through their school years and their hatred towards Ron, who blames them for the death of his first friend.

I only currently have one idea for a name: "Troll/s in the Dungeon" hinting at the actual troll in the dungeon that starts the whole story and that Harry and Draco are the trolls as their common room is IN the dungeon.

Yet, I'm not so sure I like it. Any suggestions?

(I put this in misc because honestly, haven't a clue where to put it)


** Would it just be a rehash of canon with Ron as Draco and the Gryffindor/Slytherin houses flipped bc I think that's been done already
