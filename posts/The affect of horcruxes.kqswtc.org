Have just been reading a story where between the author notes concerning it and the actual discussion that occurs "in story", had me thinking about how the horcruxes and Voldemort are connected to each other. We know they are supposed to "anchor" him, but what exactly are they made of and what happens when they are destroyed.

My thought (and the story plot point? Prompt? Very small bunny?) is that yes, a piece of soul is ripped off and stored, but that piece of soul includes a piece of his magic. Everything is fine and dandy while the "anchor" is still on this plane of existence, the soul anchors him and he can access that portion of his magic via the "thread" that connects between his "main" existence and his anchors. But, when one is destroyed (or thrown thru the veil) the thread is snapped and that portion of his soul and magic disappears from him. He doesn't know why he suddenly feels "off", he just knows something isn't the same as usual. I feel this would allow for the assorted related plot points to mesh in nicely. He steadily gets weaker and more paranoid as all those power enhancing rituals are slowly negated and he is brought back to "normal" levels of magic. Maybe they drained an amount of magic equal to how strong the magic is around where they are hidden (diadem in Hogwarts equals large amounts while the ring only absorbed from the wards he placed on the shack) and shared that along the same thread? So, he wouldn't really notice losing the amounts given by the ring or the necklace, but the diadem might leave him wondering what just happened. Add in the leaching effect of Harry's scar and you get the 2fer1... he has magic and Harry is weaker without realizing. Maybe that trope about the DarkMark feeding him power from all his cattle? After all, they are branded as his.

Feel free to use this as you like... and link the stories as you can I guess?


** We don't even know how magic works in canon, all this magical core stuff only exists in fanfics so we'll never know that answer.

*** True... but that is why fanfiction exists... to let people with imagination and skill attempt to write out their own unique explanations.

That's why I tagged it as a Prompt, to hopefully inspire someone to use it in their story if it makes enough sense to them.
