#+begin_quote
  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4308786][no place like home]]. Arguably the best story within the boy without scar series. It doesn't really focused on living in Ravenclaw though, more the impact if Harry lived in Hogwarts instead of Privet Drive.

** The main two I know of would be linkffn(To Be Loved) and linkffn(Three Black Birds). To Be Loved is an interesting take on the abused!Harry design where the Dursley's ignore him rather than anything physical, and the fic chronicles his growth from that. Three Black Birds as mentioned earlier is an alternate take on the WBWL genre, but it's probably my favorite one because all the characters have *growth*. Beware the glacially slow burn though.

  This story came from the thought that the Weasley introduction was a setup. This is NOT a time-travel story. The premise is that the Dursleys got him there very early and Hermione, being the perfectionist that she is, also arrived very early. Thus they meet and the glory of H/Hr begins. AU For now not a T rating, will probably change in later chapters.

Is a really interesting fic. Now, there is some debate as to whether it is too hard or too soft on the romance, is definitely very different to most fics and some would argue that the author is showing of their intelligence too much, but eh, I enjoyed it quite a bit.

The writing is superb and as long as you don't have an issue with science in general, I'd say that it's a great read.

It even got a printed release!

Harry being a Ravenclaw isn't really essential to the story tho.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
