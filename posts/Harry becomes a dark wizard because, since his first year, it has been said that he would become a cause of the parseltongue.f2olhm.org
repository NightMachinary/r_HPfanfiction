With my friend we were making an argument: is it possible that Harry becomes a dark wizard because, since his first year, it has been said that he would become a cause of the parseltongue?

What are the most plausible reactions, considering also the canonical treatment by Dursely and Snape? In your opinion, if Ron had discovered since the first year of Harry's "dark" ability, would he have accepted or bullied him?

PS: Since there has already been a misunderstanding, obviously the discovery of Harry's ability in his first year is a what-if. Both my friend and I have read the books.


** I can only imagine a humorous fic where he goes "I'm going to become a dark wizard? But I don't know any dark magic! I'm going to be such an embarrassment. Better go study..."

*** Is it not plausible, from a psychological point of view and in a serious context? My friend had brought me as an example the children of people in prison who, if bullied and labeled as criminals, could become so.

Because my friend says that a child does not yet have a solid perception of "self" and solid personality it's much more malleable and subject to external influences.

**** Yep. Definitely a thing, though as much a Pop Psychology thing as an actual one. Labelling is quite often ridiculously effective though. Tell a kid they'll be something or that they are something often enough, especially something bad, and they'll often become it. It's called, somewhat appropriately, a self-fulfilling prophecy. Works with positive stuff too, mind. You can build a child up and help them decide to grow.

Generally, the more self-possessed will fight back against it, but it's pretty regularly deterministic at young ages. Not enough to be utterly conclusive in research and studies and whatnot, but enough that we know it often works.

** I remember reading a rather dark crack fic where it's illegal to be a parselmouth, and when some wizard finds a pre-Hogwarts aged Harry Potter talking to snakes (like 6 or 7 yo), he's carted off to Azkaban. So you have this stupid baby thinking that he's going to be great and terrible and that Azkaban is his lair, and any jailer with even an ounce of kindness plays along because he's just a stupid little baby and what's wrong with their world!!

*** I found a fic similar to that on AO3, with Harry becoming dark thanks to being thrown into Azkaban with Siris Black.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.
