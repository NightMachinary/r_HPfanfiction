** I mean, if Voldemort touched SCP-963 he would seize to exist and Bright would take his place. The foundation would probably (unless they already knew about the wizarding world) experiment on the Voldemort body to figure out how magic tics. Before/after that, Bright would just dick around being a human/snake hybrid thing with magic.
