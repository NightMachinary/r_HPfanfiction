What are your favorite goblet of fire fics? I'm looking for any recommendations for this period. I'm alright with most pairings especially Daphne, don't particularly enjoy slash though. I've loved stuff like linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) and even [[/u/TE7][u/TE7]] 's linkffn(Letters). Any gems?

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** Are you asking for excellent 4th year fics or just for fics centering around the Triwizard Tournament? Because for the former "The Well Groomed Mind" is honestly a great 4th year fic despite extreme Dumbledore and Ron bashing.

** Since you mentioned TriWizard fics, I'll always recommend linkffn(Hallowed). AU where James and Lily don't die and Harry isn't marked (Voldemort is still around, but not as a constant dangerous figure). Harry enters the TWT legitimately as a 6th year and is chosen as champion.

  Once upon a time, three brothers came up with a plan to change the world forever. Centuries later, wizards still fight over the scraps of their power. However, only one person can truly lay claim to their destiny. AU. Harry/Lisa Turpin pairing in later chapters.

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!
