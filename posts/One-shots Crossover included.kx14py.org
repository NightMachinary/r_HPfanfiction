Both crossovers and non-crossovers


** Some good oneshots:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The-Wendell-That-Wasn-t#top][The Wendell that Wasn't]] by opalish. The true story of how Harry and Ginny's kids got their names. Really, it's all Snape's fault. Crackfic oneshot.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13115653/1/Misuse-of-Metamorphy][Misuse of Metamorphy]] by right what is wrong. No one expects a certain impersonation.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4308786][No Place like home]] by dirge without music When Petunia Dursley refused to take Harry in she forfeited his birthright protection, so Dumbledore took the baby to the safest place he knew: Hogwarts. The applicable staff (mostly just... not Snape) took Harry in on a rotating schedule as he grew from baby to toddler to child. They traded extra credit for babysitting among the older students, and Harry grew up knowing a few dozen different laps that were safe and warm to nap in. This was a Harry who grew up among books, among old transient walls and learned professors. They gave Binns night duty sometimes, and let him talk young Harry to sleep. This was a Harry whose world changed, on principle, daily. The stairs moved. The walls became doors. You had to keep your eyes open--you had to pay attention. So he did. He grew up in a school. Knowledge was power, but knowledge was also joy. This was his sanctuary. There was magic in his world from birth.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12391806][Where there's a will]] by alone in the rain. Harry writes the first draft of his will when he is 14.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12907644/1/For-The-Greater-Goof][For the greater goof]] by right what is wrong. Or, how Fred and George got the Order of Merlin, First Class, at the august age of thirteen.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548?view_adult=true#main][The boy who died a lot]] by star-crossed girl.Harry's always been known as The Boy Who Lived. Only Severus knows that this is a lie. (Or: a portrait of Severus Snape, in seven acts.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/67766][Snape: the home fries nazi]] by pir8fancier. When Harry defeats Voldemort, all those marked by Voldemort lose their magic. Snape decamps to the United States, where he becomes a fry cook in a diner. Five years after Voldemort's defeat, Harry comes to him for advice. AU, obviously, as Snape was still alive when I wrote this story.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/101475#main][No way back]] by MERI. At the end of fifth year, Harry falls into a mirror and is forever changed by the experience.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/304714][Chrysalis]] by star-crossedgirl. In which Harry is a tad messed up after the war, but Snape gives him a run for his money. Or: an epic tale of PTSD, recovery and gay porn!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12706909/1/Harry-channels-his-inner-Slytherin#top][Harry Channels his inner Slytherin]] by slytherinsal. set following the pensieve incident during occlumensy, Harry has a sudden fit of the smarts and works to enlist more active aid from Snape. Unkind to Dumbledore and some Weasleys. Umbitch gets hers. Hermione has to think, and wises up. A peek at what might happen if the occasional use of logic and intellect was applied instead of hokey reasoning and blind belief in prophecy.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/787368#main][Hey Potter!]] by sunsetic monster. Harry returns to Hogwarts for his 8th year, determined not to let Malfoy get to him. But when the snarky teasing starts up again, Harry finds that returning the jibes with compliments has a far more interesting outcome.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7548181#main][Slythering]] by Astolat. Draco found the nest down in the Manor's cellars, while he was clearing them out.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5400451/1/A-Sound-Like-Serpents-Singing][A Sound like Serpents singing]] by Lomonaaeren. When Draco Malfoy wants a magical snake for his son, he turns to the best in the magical world---serpent-breeder Harry Potter. Harry, who thought that all his past grudges had been settled, is startled by the way he responds to Malfoy. For many reasons.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/387467][Doing the Lambeth Walk]] by blamebrampton. There are only three traditional choices for the cashed-up hero after victory. Harry Potter is too young to settle down and provide the wizarding world with a happy ending, and has too acute a sense of humour to spiral downwards into a spectacular flame-out. That leaves a life of good works. Choosing to lead it in Muggle Brixton comes with its own set of challenges, including Malfoys in the biscuit aisle.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2199030][All Hallows]] by Esama. Harry Potter dies, and Hallow Evans of All Hallows' Eve rises in his place.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1149623][Disillusion, by Hermione Granger]] by Esama. Harry Potter went down in history as the man who destroyed the magical world. He received a Nobel Prize for it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1117301][Frozen to the bones]] by Esama. In the End Lord potter tells Albums how and why he took over the world.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1115355][Potters Wheel]] by Esama. Harry has been thinking, and Voldemort gets to be the first to hear the results.

Crossovers:

Marvel:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6477778][Real Enough]] by Esama. Harry potter, Jarvis, and a whole lot of artificial existentialism.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5366507][Spellist]] by Esama. The new reality had no wizards or magical nations -- but it had a whole boatload of powerful and occasionally inept sorcerers. Who were usually semi-public and sometimes very popular in social media. How it worked, Harry had no idea.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11426651/1/A-Child-Avenged][A Child Avenged]] by panda wears glasses. Harry Potter is a good guy, really, but there are some lines that should never be crossed, and Nick Fury has just crossed them.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8643484/1/All-Hallows-Eve-New-York][All Hallows Eve - New York]] by whispering darkness. Harry Potter had never really managed a normal, peaceful Halloween, so he really shouldn't have been surprised when he was suddenly displaced from the grocery store and found himself in front of a maniacally cackling man in a very dramatic outfit.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8216900/1/Legal-Alien][Legal Alien]] by whisperingdarkness. Normal people didn't have to worry about this sort of thing when they go on vacation. They worry about things like losing their luggage, catching a cab or something similar. Not alien invasions. Harry, however, had never been normal. Then again, neither were these guys. One-shot

Sherlock:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113588][Buisness]] by Esama. The Dursleys didn't rais Harry to be a very good boy.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1115333][Friend]] by Esama. Sherlock finds the skull when he is five.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113600][Magnificent]] by Esama. The birth of the ministry of magic, and his relationship with the British government.

That's all folks
