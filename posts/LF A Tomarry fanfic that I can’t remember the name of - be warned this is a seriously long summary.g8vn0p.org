I remember the basic plot and some key points in the fanfic, but I've completely forgotten the name and everything else. Basically, I know that it's a MOD!Harry, that it's a time travel/reincarnation fanfic, it's not a crossover, and it being really long but I forgot which site I read it on. It kinda goes like this:

•After the war, Harry moves into Grimmauld Place, and because he was the last Master of Death, he's also a necromancer, so he can summon ghosts of two female Black ancestors (who I can't remember the name of, sorry).

•I remember him being really good friends with Luna - like siblings, really - and her telling him to summon Tom's ghost, which he does. They don't get along at first but eventually they warm up to each other and start catching feelings.

•I think that they - Harry, Luna and Tom - travel around the world and it's all great, but then Luna gets old and dies, but Harry can't be having that so he uses his MOD powers to take them all back in time (I can't quite remember which era) and drops Luna off at Beauxbatons , with all of her memories.

•He drops Tom off somewhere (but I can't remember where) without his memories - he only gets them back when he sees Harry for the first time, but Tom goes on to become Voldemort without the memories.

•{Big time skip after he's collected Luna from France} He goes to this ball/gala thing (hosted by the Malfoy family, I think) where he meets a Tom-in-Disguise and they see each other and I remember Tom being really happy and then really angry because Harry didn't come sooner. I don't know if they time travel again after that, though.

I hope this extra long and quite frankly unnecessary - well, I wouldn't call it a summary - was helpful. I just needed to put this up here because I read this fanfic years ago and it's been driving me crazy ever since, so hopefully one of you could help me, or at least give me something similar.

I think it might be this one. I actually read this already so I was able to find it quickly.
