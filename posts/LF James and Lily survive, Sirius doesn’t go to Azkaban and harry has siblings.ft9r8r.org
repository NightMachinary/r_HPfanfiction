:END:
Looking for a fic I read a few years ago. I remember James and Lily surviving, and harry grows up around the marauders and has siblings. Goes through Harry's years in Hogwarts with some changes. In fifth year at the battle in the department of mysteries Harry is joined by Lily and the marauders, Tonks apparates into the battle but accidentally fly brings Harry's little sister who gets caught in the crossfire and dies.

These are the main details I remember, think it was completed.

Struggling to remember name and title.
