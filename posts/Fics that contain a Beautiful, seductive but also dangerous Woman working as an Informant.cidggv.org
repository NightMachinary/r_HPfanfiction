In these the Protagonist is visiting this Witch from time to time to ask for Information about the Magical underworld. She is working as a (unofficial) informant for the Ministry/Government. Said Witch would be attracted to the Protagonist and try to tempt him every time he visits her. i would like if he is in no Relationship and not always willing to give into to her alluring (so yeah, he will have some sessions, but sometimes/mostly stay "professional").

As mentioned in the title, she is Beautiful and seductive, but also dangerous, so the ones who encounter her should mess with her. Maybe she was once a Big number of the Crime fighters but now is having a Deal, that as long as she works for them her Guilt is ignored and the "Crimes" she commits (well, i would imagine owning a Storage or Warehouse that the criminals can use) are not registered...but from time to time the Crime Fighters need information and the Maincharacter is been send to her.

â€‹

If this is to specific, i would be simply ok with what the Title says, no matter if she is a low-criminal or a Gangerlady. And she should be attracted to him and try to go for him, sometimes he joins her, sometimes not.


** Ever read linkffn(Unatoned) ? Cuz it has pretty much this premise. Sort of.

There's also a character in the infamous, "unmentionable" and controversial fic "For Love of Magic". Which has so so so so many flaws it isn't even funny. But if you like it, you like it. I don't, and stopped halfway.
