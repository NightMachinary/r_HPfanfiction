For example, I am glad Harry was not made prefect. That would have been a disaster. I love Ron but Dean makes more sense to me.

I do not know why Hermione was made prefect. Who were the other Gryffindor girls? But she should not have been prefect.

Also do you know any fics with different sets of prefects?


** Hermione is the exact type of person to be made perfect lmao.

My school had prefects as well and there were always Hermiones. I mean that in a good way too.

Smart, strict rule follower, associated with someone like Harry and well-liked by teachers.

That's the recipe right there.

***** I don't think she'd make a good prefect because of the social aspects. A prefect needs to be able to empathise with their classmates and juniors. They need to help them with their problems. Like homesickness, and bullying. Hermione (in my opinion) has a the emotional range of a teaspoon. I don't think she'd be able to the job of a prefect without coming off as condescending. Nothing wrong with being shit at being prefect. I quit when I was made one because I quickly realised I wasn't made for it. I'm too adventurous.

Hermione also is a rule breaker. Poly-juice is a regulated substance but Hermione still brewed it. When she went to the hospital wing, there's no way the teachers wouldn't know. She was clearly planning as impersonating someone and that should mean punishment.

Someone clearly willing to break the law (for all they knew this could have been a bloody prank) at 13 is not a good prefect choice.

****** But it's not about her being perfect, it's about the best option of who's available. Between Hermione, Lavender and Parvati, she's the clear choice. By quite a distance too.

Plus, I don't think Hermione is as stoic as you make her out to be. She's definitely strict, but she does have a lot of moments where she's emotional. Her academic achievements is also something younger kids can aspire to. Plus both McGonagall and Dumbledore trust her and with good reason too.

I suppose there can be a case against her, but there is no case /for/ someone else. I think of the students in Harry's year she was the best choice.

****** I think you are misunderstanding the job of a prefect at Hogwarts. The only other example we have is Percy Weasley, who is even worse in the ways you have described. The only job of a prefect is to enforce rules and do some patrols, given that the teachers couldn't give less of a shit about the welfare of their students (Harry being bullied by most or all of the school most years, Luna, Neville being locked out of the common room and sleeping on the floor and nobody noticing), why would they expect the prefect to.

The only requirements I think a prefect has in Hogwarts is to follow the rules and be academically ahead enough that they can afford to waste time on prefect duties. While you are correct that Hermione isn't always the best rule follower, the only thing I think she was ever caught for which wasn't forgiven for being 'the right thing to do' was being out of bed late in first year.

For the Polyjuice thing, I suspect that if someone came in covered in cat's fur that Madam Pomphrey would assume a transfiguration accident or she was cursed in the back as a prank rather than a 13 year old had perfectly brewed a specific, rare, high level potion and then put in the wrong hair. I doubt there were many people alive who were aware that that could be a side effect of that circumstance, and I doubt a school nurse (or even Potions teacher if he was consulted) would be among them.

Also I think you underestimate what Hermione was capable of emotionally, especially as the Hogwarts years are so small that getting to know everyone, at least by name, would be trivial.

*** We don't know what metric they use to decide, though. Maybe in Slytherin, the more likely you are to use the position for your own gain, the more likely you are to get it. Or perhaps there they take into account social standing and influence, or your family name.

Given that you can make a decent case from the books that Dumbledore at most has a veto, and otherwise, the Heads of House decide, it's not out of the question.

****** You very heavily implied it.

Edit for clarification: Your only reason for not choosing Zabini is that he doesn't respect women (according to you). Well great, that's one reason, but you got like 50 different reasons NOT to choose Draco. It's not really Russian Roulette when one option is impaling your brain with a fork while the other option is shooting yourself in the foot.

*** Voldemort came back not even a few months before. Draco being made prefect could Snape using his position to help Luscius get his son some sort of power in Hogwarts. A potential easy way for Snape and Dumbledore to keep easier track of him? Draco being made prefect doesn't really hurt much and having him doing things from the shadows didn't work well year 6.

** Between her compulsive helpfulness and her sense of justice and fairness, Hermione makes for a great prefect. She knows the rules, doesn't take shit, and takes her job seriously.

I agree that Dean might be a better prefect than Ron though. From what little we see of him, he has a high sense of fairness, is pretty helpful, and quite honest.

** This depends on what a Prefect is supposed to /mean/, doesn't it? If the Prefect is supposed to be the person best reflecting the values of the house they're from, for instance, then you cannot get past Harry and Draco. Finding other requirements for Prefects beyond "responsible person following rules" makes the role a lot more interesting, IMO.

** I don't understand why people think Dean would be better. He didn't bother speaking up when Harry and Seamus were fighting in OotP, Ron did. Sense of fairness?

Ron wouldn't really make a great prefect either, tbh. The dude crashed his dad's car into a tree on school grounds. Everyone's going to call him out on it if he tries to enforce rules.

Hermione... A good prefect, maybe. Not the best. She's more of the "because I said so" type than the "well-liked and admired" type (Lavender and Parvati weren't exactly fond of her in HBP).

There's not much point in discussing though. We barely know 7 named characters from Gryffindor in Harry's year, and nothing much about most of them. Dean and Seamus could be getting high as fuck in the dorms all the time, we wouldn't know.

** In Gryffindor, Hermione is the only obvious prefect. She's the perfect type for it.

From the boys, none of them strike me as great prefect material (in the abstract). Sean and Dean we don't know too much about, and they don't strike me as reliable enough or assertive enough for it. Ron is Ron - I don't think he made a great prefect. So that leaves Harry, assuming canon interpretations but with more time on his hands.
