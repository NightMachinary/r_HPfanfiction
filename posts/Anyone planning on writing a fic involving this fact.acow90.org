  'Yes,' Merwyn the Malicious thought smugly, 'even though it is my wedding today, I think I shall relieve myself in full view of the guests, so that all of England may bear witness to the fact that even the putrid waste of mine is greater than anything they can ever hope to accomplish with their puny lives.'

Plumbing and sewer systems have been around for millennia. The earliest cities in the world were planned and built with those.

*** It's a joke about the 17th century. People /actually did/ just sort of shit in the hallways back then. Classical Rome may have had running water but Versailles was built without bathrooms.

**** Versailles was built with bathrooms. They just didn't have -enough-, and oftentimes they were exclusive to some highbrow knob. And besides the fact the wizarding world wouldn't identically mirror the muggle world in everything, they'd have the means to have chamberpots and commodes and garderobes and all sorts of solutions other than -shit in the corner-. Magic has to be good for something, surely they can charm, enchant, inscribe, or wish really hard for some way to reliably get rid of messes that 1st years who don't know which way to hold a wand can use.

And it might also explain a little of the disdain of pureblood families for muggleborns/muggles, considering indoor toilets weren't as commonplace in the muggle world until closer to WWI, and flush toilets as we know them were only developed around when Dumbledore was born. It seems more likely the muggleborns would be the ones most likely to have poor hygeine practices in this regard.
