I am talking like Highly Intelligent Draco, Ron, Ginny kind of fics . I read this fic where Draco had a harem and it was strangely good. I would like to read more stuff like that. usually it's Harry and Hermione who get all that treatment


** I think Luna has a couple. I'll have to see if I can find them.

** If you don't mind slash [[https://archiveofourown.org/chapters/28404420?show_comments=true]['' Chaos Theory"]] has the most interesting hyper intelligent, genius-like Draco i have read, while still making him likeable. And don't look at the major character death, the main characters are all good and dandy at the end.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.
