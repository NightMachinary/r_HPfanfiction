I always enjoyed the DA scenes in OOP and am wondering if there are any good canon-compliant fics of Harry as the DADA teacher after his career as an Auror?


** Hrm. Non-Canon compliant ones are all I have, unfortunately. Would you like some of those?

*** Sure. As long as it's not too far-fetched I'm fine with it. The closer to canon (except for that weird fic cursed child) the better tho
