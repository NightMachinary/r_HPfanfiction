With the Black Sisters and their interactions in pureblood society, how the family descended into madness and straight up supremacy. Like sisters of the House Black, guilty pleasure reads are fine with me.

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...

#+begin_quote
  Coming of Age in the House of Black is a story of turning points in the lives of the last generation of Blacks: Bellatrix, Andromeda, Narcissa, Sirius, and Regulus. It takes place over the course of Bellatrix's life, prior to the events of canon, and focuses on the five cousins, but is told from multiple perspectives, including Cygnus and Druella, Arcturus, Walburga, and all five of the main characters.Mary Potter AU magic and history applies; the Black Family tree as outlined by JKR outside of the books, and any birth-dates she has given for any of the characters do not.This is a long, drawn-out tragedy, heavy on suffering and angst, in case the tags were unclear.

It isn't a major focus of the fic, but it answers several questions about the House of Black, including "how could Sirius inherit if he was disowned?", and "Why did almost everyone in the House die in a short period?"

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22220911][before the door of hell lamps burned]] by basketofnovas (slashmarks)) takes place post the fourth book, but it slowly drips in more and more information about the Black family and its traditions. There's a lot of stuff about the Black sisters, it just takes a bit to get there. The sequel has some killer reveals about Narcissa.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663][Blackpool]] by TheDivineComedian) is mostly about Regulus but damn. It has some really messed up revelations and family dynamics. It's also a ghost story. The author has some other Black family fics, but this is the longest solely focused on the Blacks, although linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18456680][Styx]] by TheDivineComedian) is a fantastic one shot.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

  Regulus wishes -- sometimes, not too often -- that he were like Sirius, able to make things up on the spot. Sirius says he has never seen a single bloody thing in his tea leaves, or his cards, or his palms, in the milky depths of a crystal ball or the glistening entrails of a dead pigeon. He just enjoys telling stories. Regulus sees water. His tealeaves: Dregs of muddy water. His cards: The Queen of Cups, waiting by the waterfront. His crystal ball: Unmoving, opaque water. His sign: Cancer, one of the Water Trigon. His palms: Somehow, impossibly, water. So, yes. He really did deserve that P in Divination. - Or: Regulus thought he knew all the horrors of Grimmauld Place, but on this stifling hot summer night in 1976, the house seems hell-bent on terrorising him in new and interesting ways. It's all Sirius's fault, of course.

  Being reborn as a daughter of the House of Black was bewildering, but realising they weren't actually evil was another problem entirely. Despite a name and gender change, Harry Potter wasn't someone who would let their family suffer for no reason. Lyra was a Black, and Blacks protect their own. Time travel, genderbending - fem!
