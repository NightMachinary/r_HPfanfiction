I want to write fanfic but I'm not a good writer, my biggest issue is dialogue I just feel that it comes off as really weird and just doesn't work right and I get in my head bad about the story not being any good anyways and why would people read it etc. Any advice on writing better would be hugely appreciated. Thank you


** I recently wrote a little lesson on dialogue, based on what's worked for me and advice from my teacher in my creative writing class. You might find it useful? ðŸ™‚

Naturally so much of writing advice is very subjective and rules are there to be broken, so stay open minded and don't worry too much if it doesn't work for you, but do give it a go anyway and see what works for your style.

** Practice. Read widely, study the work of others, but mostly, practice.
