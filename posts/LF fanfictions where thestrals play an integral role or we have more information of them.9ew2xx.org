They were the most fascinating creatures to me in canon and I was disappointed that Rowling overlooked them

Thanks for any suggestions ☺


** Have you read antithesis? It comes on very late into the story.

** I once listened to a to someone who felt that the Harry Potter books were kind of like the X-Men, in that they introduce magic in a book, and often it is only integral to that one book's plot, not any of the others.

** She didn't overlook them; the thestrals were part of a pattern in the books. Introduce a surprisingly unmentioned magical 'thing' for some reason or another, offer a mild reason why they were never mentioned, then have them turn out to be hugely important to the conclusion of the story, then largely forgotten aside from occasional mention.

- CoS: Fawkes and the Chamber of Secrets in general. Fawkes was given the specific abilities and presence as D. pet to solve the basilisk solution, but he never really comes to Harry's aid ever again despite his 'extreme loyalty' to Dumbledore in the rest of the books. The chamber never really comes up again, except in the last book essentially in an off screen 'oh I saw how you did that, and I just mimicked parseltongue to get in.'
- PoA: the time-turner Hermione has (as well as the entire Buckbeak side-plot) was inventedas a way to save Sirius but not have him able to take Harry away from the Dursleys. Sympathetic orphan-boy and all that stuff.
- GoF: the reverse-spell effect was created entirely for the situation in the Graveyard to get Harry out of a situation where he was outgunned, outnumbered, outmaneuvered, tired and injured, without everyone just being completely incompetent. It never happens again after that though, ever. The entire Weighing of the Wand ceremony is a way of reminding readers that Harry and Voldemort have brother wands when its not really mentioned prior besides the first Ollivander meeting.
- OotP: the aforementioned thestrals. The carriages were originally horseless, but Rowling needed a way to get Harry to the Ministry (which is the entire reason he had the trial in the first place too - to show Harry the Ministry building beforehand) and didn't seem to think floo powder was sufficient.
- HBP: inferi, Felix Felicis - the inferi were only introduced because at the beginning of HBP because they were going to show up in the cave, then never are seen again despite the apparent big deal about Voldemort using them. Felix Felicis was introduced so Harry would suddenly be able to learn the secret of Horcruxes, but only later in the book (April) so we don't spend too much time focusing on that (in like two chapters after the memory is viewed, we are leaving for the Cave).
- DH: everything about the Elder Wand's abilities.

** linkffn(7118223) So the thestral is used once by voldemort for something critical to the plot. It's early in the story if only care about the thestral part.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.
