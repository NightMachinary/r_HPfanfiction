  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I don't even have my O.W.L.s. Between everything I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

**** I liked it quite a bit as well, but I'm usually happy with fluffier stuff. There's not much conflict in that story.

Also, "Chapters:1/1" undersells the length. It's not quite a novella, but definitely more than most of the 1-chapter fics on FFN.net.

**** It's a bit too fluffy for me and I've never been on board with the "Harry should have been a professor" idea to fully enjoy the fic. I probably undersold it though. It's lovely and heartwarming.

** On mobile so can't grab a link. If you haven't read the tragically abandoned 1-800-rent-a-hero it's probably the single best Harry as a divination professor fic ever written. It makes honest attempts to show the subject isn't useless and it was Trelawny who ruined the subject.

**** Yeah, he/she set up a patreon, and then promptly disappeared. To be fair it was paid per CHAPTER, not per MONTH so i don't think they ever got paid for it.

They did say they set it up for motivation to produce in a timely manner, i guess they realized money wasn't enough of a motivation and skipped ship.

******* I don't donate to any of Patreons (if it was Patreon) so I don't know how it works beyond, "pay $x/mo to support this person/group and you get perks (exclusive material, bonus episodes, etc.) in exchange."

I just remember that one day it had hit its goal and the next day there wasn't new content posted (either to the patrons or to the public at large) and people got pissed. The next day, the amount donated was less than the day previously.
