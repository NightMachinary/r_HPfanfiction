I just came across the sequel of /The Lie I've Lived/ linkffn(12714763) which was apparently published near the end of last year. How could that have slipped through the cracks?!

If anyone's read it already and could get me their opinion on if it's worth reading. I don't want to waste my time if it's not worth it.


** Low effort.

  Sequel to The Lie I've Lived. Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Threesome Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to bee.

** Hallelujah! I was very dissapointed when I saw that The Lie I've Lived Seemingly got abandoned. I have not yet read the sequel so I can't recomend it in good faith, but I still thank you for discovering it.
