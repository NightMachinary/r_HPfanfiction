** Well I've really enjoyed it so far. I think that the other comment was rude but each to their own. Sure, a few typos and grammar issues but I've still really enjoyed the story you've spun. People seem to forget that so much time and effort goes into producing (free) content. Hours of effort. The courage it takes to put your word baby out there. Reading people's work is a privilege. I think sometimes people forget that. Thank you for sharing chibzy. A learning curve to be sure but each update has always brightened up my morning train.

*** Forgive me, I never read the story, merely the title and it's summary. Enough mistakes were made in them alone that I couldn't imagine the story being any better. And that's supposed to be the most visible part of the work to all newcomers and outsiders. Messing that up doesn't bode too well for the rest of the story

** Everything from just the title and content of this post to the title and summary of the story seems to indicate this is literature of the face-palm inducing variety.

First of all, your grammar is atrocious. What I recommend is you go over your own work with a comb many times over as well as find other people to do it for you. There seem to be some who like your story, from what I glimpsed in your reviews, so let everyone of your readers know that you would appreciate anyone's help, suggestions and corrections, however big or small. Of course, you have to have the presence of mind to know which advice to listen to and which not, so take care during that process as well. Thankfully search engines are a thing, and a lot can be accomplished with them if you try hard enough.

I am no writer, though I wish to be, and I have written nothing more than a few thousand-words stories before. I do not speak English as a first language, nor do I think I can write as well as you do. I would probably suck ten thousand times worse. I can still recognize trash when I see it, though. I hope that emboldens you to try harder, however, and that you don't take this as anything but constructive. It's certainly not an insult leveraged at your person, but what I think of your presentation and how it reflects on your work.

I hope I'm wrong, though I doubt it, and if you or anyone else does find this to be too harsh or out of place, I am insisting that I can't but express my opinion as it is, and that when it comes to discussions about the quality of something created for the consumption of others, nothing but honesty should do.

*** Could you give an example of OP's 'atrocious' grammar? Only, I can't spot any major mistakes, and I'm slightly concerned for my own grammar right now.

**** Sure. "The" Progeny of Slytherin, not "Progeny of Slytherin". Without the article, it's nonsense. Simply wrong. It is a common noun, and cannot be written in that manner.

Yet again, very similar mistake in the other half of the title. Riddle clearly used as a proper noun, yet provided the definite article. Grammar does excuse style sometimes, but this much excess points rather to lack of taste. And in any case, aforementioned excuses are only expected to be rewarded to the masterful, and there, rarely. Certainly not twice in a phrase, and even less so in a title.

The whole summary is written so badly it's like a poor translation from another language. I cannot describe it otherwise. It is simply not the form encountered in any good literary works I have ever encountered. It assumes a familiarity of the reader that is untowards and out of place within that context.

The fifth sentence uses the wrong past tense.

I am under no illusions the author already slightly hates me, but I would still advise to take more care in polishing one's summaries and choosing one's titles. They are the window that ultimately may well determine the numbers of the engaged audience, and currently that window is very cracked.

***** While I agree that the title would sound better if it was /The Progeny of Slytherin: The Beginning of Riddle/, and that the summary could use a rewrite, I wouldn't really call that grammar 'atrocious'. I actually thought that /The Beginning of The Riddle/ was a play on the Riddle name, albeit one that sounds a bit awkward. And the summary's major flaw, imo, is not its grammar, but the repetition of 'he didn't know'.

Honestly, when I'm reading fics that use grammar like: 'The Dursely's were very afraid that thier secret would be discovered, and they swore they will stamp the magic out of thier nephew', OP's story is quite well-written in comparison. In fact, grammatically speaking, I think OP just needs a beta or perhaps a bit more polishing. From your comments, I had expected something much worse than what I read.

****** That's because this author has a fighting chance to retain anyone attention at all. The example of poor grammar you gave, on the other hand, is simply way too wrong to even discuss.

We, apparently, have entirely different standards for what we would call atrocious. See, if the author fixed their grammar, and yes, it's not that impossible to do, exactly like both you /and/ I have already suggested(with the use of betas and so on), I would still have to go through the story and spot bigger potentially bigger mistakes than that.

*** I don't mean to be big-headed or anything, but my grammar is anything but atrocious, compared to some of the other fics out there. I've addressed that there were a lot of mistakes in the earlier chapters, but they're not so bad that they make you want to gorge your eyes out. But it's fine. Criticism is criticism and I'll take what I'll get. Thanks man.

**** Most complaints like that are based on jealousy and annoyance from seeing a fic with worse grammar and sentence structure getting more attention than the complainer's fic.

I know this because it's how I feel, meaning that I HATE YOUR FIC AND BY EXTENSION YOU.

(jk, it's not that bad at all. Your comma usage needs some work, so maybe use the Grammarly extension with Chrome. It's not always correct when it advises comma placements, but it has an idea of where they should be, so listen to it and make your own judgment afterward.)

** Well, I'm three chapters in and done with the story.

First things first. You hurt your story with that summary. It's not terrible, but it's also not exactly inspired, and more importantly it's something that maybe should've been in the first chapter as part of the setting(bookend feels like one viable strategy), instead.

You made a choice to drop readers into the story instead of building a setting the traditional way. This is almost always a literary gamble, and in this case it's just not working for me at all, because too many variables are changed. Main character isn't Harry, story is AU, and the whole thing honestly feels like a complete blur between Tom Riddle and Harry Potter's backstories leading into the early Hogwarts years.

Your OC is another big problem. Quite simply, he doesn't quickly make me /want/ to find out what happens to him, which essentially is a death knell for the story. Every good protagonist gives us a very powerful, compelling reason to immediately invest ourselves emotionally in their fate. Fanfiction authors can 'get away' with not doing this when they're using established characters that we already know and love, but obviously that isn't the case here.

There's also some next-level shenanigans going on with your sentence structure. Let's take a small example from chapter one:

/"What did you guys talk about?" He scratched his arm as he remembered what Dumbledore had said./

/"We talked about me going to a different school."/

/"Really? What's it called?"/

/"Um, it's called... Tugforts." Louise raised an eyebrow./

As you can see, your actions aren't paired properly with the person doing the speaking. That, along with outright errors like 'Madam Milkin' makes the writing reek of sloppiness.

*** Yeah, I can see what you're saying. Every time I go back to the earlier chapters, it hurts to see so many mistakes in my writing. I can't guarantee that it gets so much better later on in the story, but I've done my best to check for errors. Obviously, it's not good enough. But I'll take everything you said into consideration, from the summary to the OC (even though I think it's a bit too late to change him). But seriously, thanks. Always felt like it was lacking in something.
