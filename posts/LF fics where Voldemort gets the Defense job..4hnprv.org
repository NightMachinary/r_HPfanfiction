** Hmm, not precisely what you're asking for, but I think this one is relevant enough: linkffn(5843349)

It's an AU story where Tom Riddle never truly became Voldemort. Features a prodigious, but realistic Harry with great interactions between Dumbledore, Riddle, and Harry. The dialogue could be better, and the first few chapters are slightly rough, but I would still recommend it as a great read.

*** To clarify, Riddle is the Defense Professor, but the AU begins earlier than that, so you don't get a /Quest for Tenure/-esque double life.

Highly recommended.

** Someone has to know the one I'm thinking of - Voldemort somehow blackmails his way into the position Harry's first year and Dumbledore keeps insisting the defense professor is evil and everyone is like "what's wrong with you" it's a dark comedy IIRC but for the life of me cannot remember the fic...

  More than two decades ago, Headmaster Dippet made the fateful decision to hire Tom Riddle as an associate Hogwarts professor. And now, at last, Riddle's double life as Lord Voldemort is threatening to bring the Wizarding World to its knees...if only he can convince his students to leave him alone.
