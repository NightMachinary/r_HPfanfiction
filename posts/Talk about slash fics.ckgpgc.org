I was suggested to ask the question at [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]

Link to thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/ckig2a/talk_about_slash_fics/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share]]

I was curious if people could give there opinion on slash fics from ones they love to the ones they hate as well as preferred pairings.

I'm trying to expand my taste in fanfics. Figured I might be able to find interesting fics.

And learn about both the good and the bad of slash fiction

Edited

For my history with slash I read one fic that was harry + voldimort (thought I believe he turned back to Tom riddle) fic was again and again on achieve of are own.

And I enjoyed it and it gave me my off and on again interest in shibari and rope in general.


** When well done, slash is just good fanfic that happens to have the main character(s) in a same sex relationship. When done badly it's just standard shitty shipping fics with fairy dust sprinkled on. People who hate on slash fics as being especially shittier than het fics are dealing with bias of some sort.

I like slash fics that have a good story, good writing and portray a gay/lesbian relationship at least somewhat realistically. I like slash pairings that pair Harry with someone he was at least friendly towards in canon, like Cedric or George. I dislike slash pairings with someone much older than Harry, like Dumbledore or someone Harry was in a antagonistic relationship with, like Snape. Drarry I only tolerate if Draco is very different from his canon self. Death Eater apologia is too similar to real life racism/Nazism for me to be comfortable reading in a fanfic.

Recs for good fics with slash in them: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9323225]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487/chapters/31624473]]; [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987408]])

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** I've seen many comments on this sub in which people say they can't enjoy reading slash because their sexual orientation prevents them from empathising with the pairing.

Intellectually, I can understand that, and I certainly don't begrudge them their preferences, but here I am, a person who doesn't find /any/ sex scenes attractive, and I'm still able to enjoy reading fics regardless of whether they contain pairings and/or smut. All smut scenes are equally absurd to me. If I only read fics that fit my own orientation then I would have run out of reading material /very/ quickly.

--------------

My story is maybe a little weird in that I don't look for pairings when searching for a good fic.

When I first started reading a lot of Harry Potter fanfiction the only thing I cared about was finding stories in which Voldemort/Tom Riddle is a more interesting character than in canon (more sane, intelligent, charismatic, etc. either as protagonist or antagonist). I began by going through every fic on FFN tagged with "Voldemort", and I was bewildered to find that Harry/Voldemort fics make up a surprisingly large proportion of that tag.

At first I just skipped all of those fics because the concept struck me as ludicrous and probably obscene, but the more of them I saw the more I became curious about why so many people might find the pairing appealing. Were my knee-jerk assumptions causing me to miss many 'diamonds in the rough', I wondered? So I eventually went back through and read the fics I had skipped. I found one that surprised me by being an amazing story with high quality writing ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8988616/1/In-Somno-Veritas][In Somno Veritas]]), so from then on I stopped avoiding stories that had an HP/LV, HP/TMR, HG/LV, etc. pairing.

At this point I've read a lot of HP/LV, and I tend to recomend some of those fics in threads where the OP says they are open to the idea, though I'm less interested in the pairing than I am in the well written characters and plot. Since I started out as sceptical myself, I understand where people are coming from when they voice their opposition to the pairing, and I try not to bring it up in threads where people would just react negatively.

  After Voldemort's defeat, and in order to keep control of Harry Dumbledore enacts a marriage contract between Harry and Ginny. Bound by Pureblood Traditions, Harry can only use that to his advantage. Not a Harry/Ginny fic. Pre Slash.

** There are so many different kinds of slash fic, it's hard for me to figure out what to recommend without some idea of what kind of fic you're interested in. If you only like time-travel or WBWL or dark!Harry, you can find all those things in slash fic, just expect to find a same-sex relationship as part of the story. I'm only recommending good ones here, since I've read and abandoned so much trashy fic (gen, het, slash, etc) it's hard to keep track.

I love this fluffy Harry/Draco one-shot Linkao3(Cake by Astolat); even though it's short, it's about both characters getting to know each other as people rather than school rivals/enemies at war.

On the more serious side, there's this interesting story of growing up during a war featuring the unusual pairing of Neville/Snape Linkao3(Night-blooming heartsease by julad). It's old, I think originally written before the books were finished, which is why dementors are such a prominent part of Voldemort's army and various characters are alive. The romance isn't the primary focus--it's about surviving the war, finding some way to fight back without dying, and how Neville grows into himself (from a clumsy, frightened teen to a herbologist and fighter).

Relatedly, I love this Harry/Draco story for the incredible magic the author created, from the curses lingering in Hogwarts to the indigenous magic systems of the Americas that Harry learned. Linkao3(Transfigurations by Resonant). And the way all the characters interact, you can feel Harry's frustration with his friends, both at what he missed by being away and what they are still missing about him even after being friends for years. Overall, it's more explicit, creative, and funny.

*** To add a little to what you said, Night-blooming heartease is a prequel to Transfigurations, written as a gift for Resonant because Transfigurations made quite an impact on H/D fandom at the time. I haven't read the original because I'm not into Drarry, but I love Night-blooming heartsease for Neville's voice, the energetic depiction of magical battles, and the humanizing of Snape. He's not quite canon, although that's partly due to when the fic was written, but he's an extremely well-drawn character.

  Snape swooped around the room like a giant bat, adding ingredients to some cauldrons and stirring others. Then he stopped and tapped his wand against the benchtop impatiently. "Well? What is so important that I must risk a vital brew of Animaserum by having you in the room with it?"His tongue was so dry, he didn't know how he would ever get the words out. "Heartsease, Professor." There, that wasn't so hard. He took a deep breath. Dementors were worse, surely.
