This seems like a rare one, I've only ever come across a couple in my time but they were poorly written. The concept intrigues me. Like, still having Lockhart be a braggartly prick, but actually having the capability and know-how to back it up.

*********** I'm not putting spoilers since we're so far down in comments.

I don't really see where you're getting that from. I'm sure Harry could have engineered Theo's adoption without being openly friendly. Also, Harry isn't the prince yet. AFAIK he only had one snake's approval for princehood AND most of the princes were 5th year or older. If Harry was a perfect character or had nothing to learn then the story would be very boring.

I really enjoyed the lecture on esoteric magic, although I'm confused on how the LOS works on the magic restriction. Is it that it can't be done while muggles are in LOS of you, or LOS of the magic that'd be performed? I knew right away what Hermione was doing when she ran away, I just didn't see that it'd be fire suppression. I really like the background for Gunther. The imagery was great.

Bear in mind that the Friar said no-one had ever got a Prince note so soon as HP and he's already got about 5 heads on his side. He's be Prince in or before book 4 for sure.

It's by far worth it imo, but be warned. Some people (especially those who really value the beginning of a fic) get turned off by this fic.

** I think that the best Lockharts are still bad at most magic, but they are actually clever about hiding their lack of ability.

In linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk), Lockhart uses psychology and prepared magic like enchanted items and potions.

In linkffn(When in Doubt, Obliviate), Lockhart is also better at hiding it than his canon counterpart.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** Linkffn(11913447) It's a Harry Potter and Lockheart soul mix kind of thing. Interesting to read at least.

  Ron Weasley had lived a good life. Having faced Voldemort with Harry Potter and Hermione Granger and becoming an Auror and Unspeakable, he is suddenly reborn in the world with his memories mostly intact. Hoping to do better this time around, he slowly realizes this new world was not the one he lived before. Things were different. And more dangerous. AU

***** Not so much bashing as it is Lockhart not being able to stand Ron's company without improving Ron as a person.

Lesbehonest, Ron was not the most mature of people when was 12.

****** I don't think telling almost everyone "ignore Ron, he's an idiot" is improving Ron. Older Harry is actively sabotaging the friendship between younger Harry and Ron.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!
