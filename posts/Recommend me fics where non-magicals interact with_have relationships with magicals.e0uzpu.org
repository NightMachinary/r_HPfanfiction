Relationships of any sort, parental, sibling, romantic, friendship, you name it.

Special request, toxic relationships.

I really enjoy stories that explore the darker sides of humanity, horror and fear, but I'm curious to see literally any examples because I just haven't found many at all.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** I see someone already recommended my story, In the Bleak Midwinter (thanks!) but if you want stories that are more dark and disturbing, I have some others that you might prefer.

Here's a complete tragedy, suitable for the season, in which the muggle-magical interaction does not work out well at all:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14842689/chapters/34356255]])

I also have some works-in-progress:

Greyback's werewolf pack captures a muggle:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14939201/chapters/34612796]])

And here's a silly play on the marriage law trope, for readers who like dysfunctional relationships. I have a reviewer who's eagerly looking forward to my muggle OC teaching Lucius to be a nicer person, and I'm like, no, sorry, that is not happening.

*** I'm an avid fan of In the Bleak Midwinter actually, and checked out The Last Pureblood Malfoy recently. Holy shit, anyone who thinks Lexie is gonna 'teach Lucius to be nicer' hasn't been paying attention to Lexie! She's hysterical! I nearly died when the girl asked Lucius "Do you want to go and gloat at them?" If anything I imagine she's gonna teach Lucius just how much fun it can be to have a 'pet' who enjoys being kept, and has morals around the same looseness as your own.

I'll need to check the others out though, thank you for recommending them.

**** Thanks! Yeah, I think this reader was expecting the bad-boy-redeemed-by-the-love-of-a-good-girl cliche, and so wasn't receptive to the idea that Lexie is not a good girl.

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

  When a human is captured by werewolves, escape is impossible, but she might be able to accomplish one thing: kill Remus Lupin. He's the most evil werewolf in the pack because he's the best at pretending to be human.

  Here's my contribution to the ridiculously contrived, trashy, marriage law genre. This one involves Lucius Malfoy and a muggle stripper, with snarky commentary by Percy Weasley. Rated M for some sex scenes.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4608288][Proud]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/SummerLeighWind/pseuds/SummerLeighWind][SummerLeighWind]]) has family relationships that have realistic flaws. Not necessarily toxic, but very flawed and grows and changes a lot. Complete.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12901407][Ottery St Catchpole]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Erisah_Mae/pseuds/Erisah_Mae][Erisah_Mae]]) has some really positive non magical friendships! WIP.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344][Grey Space]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/noaacat/pseuds/noaacat][noaacat]]) has a largely non magical cast and deals with a lot of child abuse. Also friendship in a bad situation. If you like the darker side, you'll probably love this one. Complete.

** There is one where Snape wakes up about 18 months after Voldemort killed him. Snape then starts getting close to a Squib who is now a teacher at Howarts. However, things go sideways and he finds himself in a toxic hot-and-cold relationship with a Pureblood. It's in progress but being updated twice a week.
