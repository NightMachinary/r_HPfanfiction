Hi!

I'm looking for a Drarry I read some time ago. It was post-war. If I remember properly, they were working at the Ministry and they don't really talk to each other. Draco has a crush on Harry. Harry hooks up with people in the bathroom of the cafeteria and Draco always stalks how he picks those mens. One day, Harry and him exchange looks and hook up in the bathroom.

That's the only think I remember!! If someone know this fanfict I'll be eternally gratefull

Thank you!!
