I'm looking for a type of story that is proving quite hard to find: stories about Slytherin characters (preferably Astoria, Daphne or Draco) during Hogwarts or post-Hogwarts (but not next-generation), that aren't about the Trio ending up in Slytherin or Ice Queen Daphne who ends up with Harry. Romance is fine, but the stories should be something more than just romance. Ideally, stories would give a nuanced portrayal of the Slytherin characters and house, and would neither be /everyone is super political and pure evil/ or /everyone is just misunderstood and Draco is a sweetie after all./

â€‹

To give an idea of what I'm looking for, I enjoyed Exile and Daphne Greengrass, Side Character. I liked also The Malfoy Case (even though I thought Astoria was a bit boring).


** How do you feel about OC-centric stories? Because I was really, really impressed with these two stories:

linkffn(Latet Anguis in Herba) is a series of one-shots to sort of introduce you to this group of four Slytherin OCs the author has created. They're the most compelling OCs I've ever encountered in fanfiction. Once you're done with that, then you should jump into linkffn(3353818) which is a much more plot-driven, structured story with these four characters at the center.

I finished both stories recently and was just blown away by how good they were.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

** I recently read The Changeling linkao3(the changeling by Annerb) and it's two sequels. It is focuses on a Ginny who was sorted into Slytherin, but does flesh out some of the other canon Slytherin characters, and Slytherin House as a whole.
