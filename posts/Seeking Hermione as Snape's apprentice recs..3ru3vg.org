** To those that don't know the story: their dynamic of master/apprentice evolves into one of father/daughter, there's no romance between them.

Which is also the problem for me in recommending other fics, I know other stories where she becomes his apprentice, but they all have a romantic relationship between the two as far as I can remember.

** In linkffn(9323348), Snape recruits Hermione to be Harry's bodyguard. Interesting premise and well written, though it uses a lot of bad fanon and some plot points are not well thought out. Ultimately HG/SS 'ship, though the age difference is somewhat addressed through time-turner abuse.

P.S.: OP, can you please add a link to the fic you've referenced?

  What if Severus Snape had taken Hermione Granger under wing secretly during her time at Hogwarts? What if Draco Malfoy really wasn't the bigot he let everyone think he was? (Follows canon mostly up until the end of GoF, and then detours off into AU territory w/Severus as father figure)

** I haven't read that one, so I'm not sure how their dynamics are, but here's one where Hermione is Snape apprentice:

linkffn(Amor Vincit Omnia by brandy01)

I have to admit, it's been years since I've read it, but I seem to remember this being one of the good ones.

** I haven't read the base fic, but there's a long Slytherin!Hermione fic, linkffn(The Green Girl by Colubrina) that I particularly like, where Snape takes her on as an apprentice in later chapters.

*** It fits, though it's kind of weird, since she kind of forgets all his lessons in order to rehash the relevant canon HBP subplot. (The fic's "skeleton" is to rehash canon, with Slytherin!Hermione (who is, for some reason, instantly accepted and befriended by all Slytherins), mostly sneering at Harry and Ron from the sidelines.)

******* Fair enough. To me, it's one of those extra-frustrating fics that have a premise that I love (Hermione, without any suddenly discovered magical ancestry, sorted into Slytherin) but that waste no opportunity to disappoint. :(
