Hello, i am a author who is just entering the world of all this. i also would be need of a beta. someone who could help with formatting, Briticisms and just general stuff like that. also it would be cool if i could use you to bounce ideas off of? if this sounds agreeable feel free to contact me.


** fanfiction.net has a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/forum/Beta-Reader-wanted-volunteers/15599/][*forum*]] for authors that are looking for a beta reader / beta readers offering their services. Not sure how well this works, though.

**** Depending on how much work your story needs you could also start posting the first few chapters and ask for a beta reader in the A/Ns. That way potential betas will know what to expect and if they're interested in the story. This only works though, if your writing is good as it is and you only need a beta reader to provide the final touches (like Briticism) and to bounce ideas in the future. If you have doubts concerning its readability, I wouldn't publish it. Might scare off readers.

** Depending on the general themes of what you're writing, you might find [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/index.php][Darklordpotter.net]]'s "Work By Author" subforum to be useful.

Alternatively, you might consider some of the author-centric ff.net forums. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/forum/The-Teachers-Lounge/87221/][The Teacher's Lounge]] is one that's particularly good.
