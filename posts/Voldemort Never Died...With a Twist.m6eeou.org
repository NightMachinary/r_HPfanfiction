Hi this is my first post here and I've mostly been lurking the sub on anon, but I had a really good prompt idea that I am not nearly a good enough writer to deliver on so I wanted to share it here!

Basically this premise is predicated on the basis of there being a more pragmatic voldemort. In this universe, horcruxes and the prophecy don't exist. Seeing that his side's losses were mounting in the war, Voldemort came up with an ingenious plan to win the war without having to spill more blood than he already had. Voldemort actually used the night at Godric's Hollow as an opportunity to fake his own death. By doing this he put a random child in the wizarding world as a savior while simultaneously opening up an opportunity to go underground and slowly take over the Wizarding World on his own terms. Corrupting ministry officials, building more underground support, etc are all included in this. Rather than a war fought on battlefields the war turns to one of subterfuge and strategy (but none of that lords and ladies wizengamot stuff that's such a ridiculously common trope in fanfics nowadays). Harry ends up actually being a threat to his cause independent of any prophecy and his character growth feels a lot more self-motivated and earned rather than being forced upon him by virtue of the plot. The Order will have found out Voldemort's underground activities, but I imagine a situation similar to book 5 where the government just refuses to admit he's alive in an effort to keep peace seeing as he isn't as much of a presence as before. Obviously, this is an incredibly ambitious prompt with plots that span multiple years and likely has a ton of complex changes to canon, but it's a plot bunny I really liked and wanted to share, even if it's not something I'm a good enough writer to deliver on myself!

** The problem with this is that it takes plenty of conflict away from Harry, and you still want him to have a central part.

Realistically, the war should be over by the time Harry arrives at Hogwarts. 10 years is a long time, either Voldemort should have won by then or Dumbledore should have taken the war to a point where the Ministry has fully acknowledged that Voldemort is still alive.

Even if you drag things, and things are still going on, Harry would have lost 10 years of active war where plenty of interesting things happened that are too big to put in a flashback.

*** I was actually thinking that it would be more of a story focused on the conflict between Dumbledore and Voldemort and Harry is a fighter that joins the fray down the line, but yeah I just generally want a story that can justify no horcruxes + no prophecy while still involving Harry in some meaningful way
