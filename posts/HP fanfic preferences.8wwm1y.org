What are some red flags or some things you loathe to see in fanfiction

Also what are some things you expect every good fanfic to have?


** Bashing. I hate it. What's the point? I come for the characters, why change them drastically? The same goes for the opposite direction. People suddenly trying to make characters 'better'. Snape is a frequent victim of that

*** I'd vastly prefer it if they just wrote the characters they bash out. Even if there's literally no in-story reason for it. Like if Harry and Hermione wake up one day and Ron is just completely gone and no one ever questions it, I'd prefer it over bashing.

"Who?" said Harry, "never heard of him."

Ginny frowned. "But--"

"Ginny, let it go," Hermione interrupted.

***** Have you read [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sasuke-uchiha-and-the-power-of-lies-naruto-comedy-au.472801/][Sasuke Uchiha and the Power of Lies]] by any chance? It's a Naruto fanfic but it's got a similar thing going on where characters and things are written out and people try not to think about them.

*** I don't mind the characters /becoming/ better though, as long as they start out roughly canon. I have a bit of a soft spot for "Snape adopts Harry and slowly learns to love" fics. I suppose that would also be true the other way around, a story examining exactly how a character ended up doing horrible things.

** Canon infodump. I know all that stuff. /It's canon/.

Now if you've done a massive AU and you infodump a little on the differences, I can understand. But not stuff that's actually in the original material.

** My preferences:

- Well developed original plot, the less canon rehash, the better.
- Canon characterizations, although I expect logical character development under different circumstances.
- Competent, smart heroes and villains; I especially hate dumbing down characters to force plot and manufacture drama.
- I don't mind non magical settings, but if magic exists, then I expect characters to USE MAGIC to solve their problems.
- Basic correctness in grammar, spelling, and cultural background (no smartphones in 1995!).
- Trio, Ginny, Sirius, Luna, Astoria(!), Fleur, Lily Evans, Dumbledore are preferred main characters, although Voldemort, Bellatrix, Lucius Malfoy, Victor Krum, Percy, and any other well developed ones will do.
- Speaking of Dumbledore, finally give his due and don't turn him into a dumbed down plot device like in canon.
- Speaking of Voldemort, don't turn him into an compulsive-obsessive idiot with an excessive reliance on the Unforgivables.
- Speaking of Fleur, I have yet to find a good, completed one that doesn't turn her into an object of male sexual gratification.
- Speaking of Astoria, I do like the name a lot and I want to see her more instead of her sister Daphne.
- Speaking of Lily, I want to see a good ass-kicking Lily in action, not Harry's bad tempered parent who is basically an useless bystander.
- I hate wanks of all kind, whether it's Harry power wank, Muggle wank, or Pureblood wank. Unless you are going for crack or curb stomps, balance of power is essential to have an interesting story. Good guys should be proactive, while bad guys should be subtle.
- No "Good guys don't kill" trope

** Don't like it when things follow canon too closely, especially when any number of the minor changes should have rippled out to a vastly different worldstate. Lazy and vexing.

Every good fanfic should have decent grammar, spelling, punctuation, and layout. If I see a wall of text five inches long, generally nope.

** I'll stay positive and give you what good fanfics need as there are far too many red flags, most flags are rather apparent; usually graveyard scene or a poorly written harem.

Every good fan fic needs 2 things: Originality and Magic.

Originality: Unique Ideas that set it apart and make it memorable. Firebird Trilogy is my ultimate example of this; you instantly know what fic I am talking about and it does something bold and new that no other fics have done. This can be expressed in worldbuilding of an AU, unique characterizations, or a whole new/altered magic system.

Magic: Too often fanfics focus on mundane things. Do you honestly thing wizards need to brush your teeth? Don't focus on events that in a /magical/ world would not occur. It is easy to write what we know which tends to be a pitfall as we don't know about the magical world, we are muggles after all. This especially is prevalent in romance fics, which although focus is on the relationship it isn't a Harry Potter fic if there is no magic.

**** I mean, once you get Harry away from the Dursleys (by whatever means), some sort of shopping trip is necessary. The clothing he got from them is described as atrocious. However, that trip can be summarized in a paragraph, and not take up an entire chapter.

I have two longer fics on FFN, both have a shopping trip. One is a couple sentences, one is around 1k words but has quite a lot of character building/development and the actual shopping is just a paragraph in total.

** A red flag I realized I had was that whenever someone describes Ron as 'good at strategy' I just nope out of the fic. It doesn't make sense, and it's either followed by a terrible characterization of Ron because they don't understand his character beyond 'hurr durr chess and chocolate' or it's followed by ', but [Ron Bashing]'

** I like to read fan fics that have as little to do with anything Rowling ever wrote about, in terms of plot, characters and place as possible. Only the magic is worth writing about. Nothing else.

I read Harry Potter. I don't need more of it. I read that story once. Rereading it a million times over in slightly different variations won't make me happy. Reading completely different takes on the same magical world will(in terms of characters, plot, style, culture, place, time, etc).

I don't like when the author forces down my throat plot repetitions from the canon, such as other variants of the Marauders, or overly-sentimental prose about the past done in fact poorly and in bad-taste. It quite literally disgusts me.

** A bit late, but I thougth I would try and give my two cents.

One thing I noticed just the other day, is really badly written interactions with self inserts. The one I had found was ok from a grammar perspective, but the more I read the more wrong it felt for some reason. I had an epiphany when the protagonist, who is a 20-something in a 11 years old body, checks out a woman, she notices and she's shy about it. Like she has a crush on SI, who is 11. And this doesn't just happen once.

Also, 11 years old harems are disgusting, especially in SI stories (it's the same goddamn fic too, it was just a disaster)
