  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

** My favourites: linkffn(11832261; 12157308; 10924369; 11987780)!

I have bookmarked (but have not yet read): linkffn(11987868; 12209843) and linkao3(8506921).

Ed: I normally wouldn't complain about this but it's really frustrating that this comment got downvoted so much. You may not agree with my pairings (I'm sure that's the reason...) but the thread asked for poly relationships and I recc'd 7 high quality options. Sorry they're not Harry & his harem. Honestly. ðŸ™„

  Narcissa Malfoy is done with crazy, and she is determined to fix the mess her life has become. She has brains, a plan, and more than one dark spell to help her. But before she can put her plan into motion, she discovers a shocking secret about Hermione Granger, one that the girl doesn't even realize about herself. Before Hermione knows it, Narcissa has cursed them both, sending them back in time to deal with the Dark Lord in the form of the child Tom Riddle. Of course, Tom is no ordinary child, and time doesn't take kindly to being rewritten, so this will be a bumpy ride full of awesome, magical women, pragmatic decisions, and, rest assured, dear readers, plenty of sex eventually!
