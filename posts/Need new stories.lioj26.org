I've started to hit a wall with stories I like an find. I prefer longer stories 30+ or more chapters and completed. Anything really goes harem stories femharry stories any pairings, evil harry, dark harry, evil dumbledore, good tom, time travel stories really anything. I just need something with detail, length depth lol. Thank you!


** A little self promotion ðŸ˜‡ðŸ¤­ I hope you don't mind.

linkffn(A Champion of the Light)

It's not completed, but it's sitting at 260.000 words. And I've never seen anything quite like it. I had been looking for something like this for a long time, but didn't find it, so I'm writing my own.

  A month after Dumbledore's death, Harry is depressed and wallowing in grief at Privet Drive. One night, shortly before his seventeenth birthday, Fawkes appears in his room, and whisks him away to a hidden stronghold. There, our hero meets the spirit of Godric Gryffindor, who takes Harry as his apprentice. Harry/Multi. Powerful, not godlike. Intelligent Harry. Ch 2 is NOT missing.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??
