I've recently read "Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived" by The Santi. It's a brilliant story in which Harry, after being tutored by Professor Quirrell, transfers to Durmstrang. I'm fascinated by how interesting he's managed to make the school. The teachers, the student, the culture, and how he writes the interaction between Harry and his family. It might be the most unique alive!Harry's parents I've ever read.

My question is- how could I attempt something of the same skin?


** I always get very annoyed when authors describe a new school and suddenly the magic is gone. What I mean by that is, the new schools don't have quirks and fascinating places, but are just normal-ass schools.

Especially often do I see this when a school in the US is described, may it be the Salem Institute or Ilvermorny. The cringiest fics go ahead and describe it as an american highschool that just happens to have magic in their classes. The reasoning is often that the school got rid of all the "useless magic" because its /such a goddamn superior school to old stinky Hogwarts/, or some godawful drivel like that. Absolutely horrible.

Magical Schools should, before all else, be *magical*. There should be secret rooms and walkways. There should be shortcuts that aren't quite as strict with their euclidean geometries. Uagadou should have a Voodoo Professor that sometimes sends their zombies to teach when he's not feeling well. Mahoutokoro should stress that students aren't to clean after themselves in the toilets so the Akaname spirits don't revolt. Durmstrang should have a frostgiant as a headmaster after Karkaroff fled and Beauxbatons students should be used to carrying burning salve with them because sometimes the crystal palace its located in happens to form burning lenses by accident. There should be a Wendigo Awareness Month at Ilvermorny where students try to melt the heart of one, and Castelobruxo should have a massive problem with an old aztec god insisting on being a teacher and trying to by all means necessary.

Or something... you know.

Shame that only Hogwarts (and possibly Durmstrang) seems to have well "magical" names, and nothing that the author pushed together with some google translate, like mahoutokoro (it's two words, "magic" (魔法) and "place," (所) after each other), and all the "[something with magic] Castles..."

**** FYI Dumstrang got its name from the "Sturm und Drang" movement in German literature.

That the names aren't the greatest is of only secondary importance. Its the content of the castle that decides if it catches me with the whimsyness, but also weirdness and even redundancy of Hogwart's magic.

Harry could literally open a place and name it "Magic School". As long as its workings and quirks give me the same sense of childish wonder Hogwarts gives me, I'm sold.

*** Why? That doesn't make a place magical, it makes a place stupid (I'd have no problem with it if say magic being used in a place for generations turns the place "wonky" (some people have said that Peevees for example is the manifestation of all the students who were up to no good in the school in the past, a manifestation of the pranking spirit of the marauders and others before them!), but having that as a matter of principal? Nah, especially since it's NOT conductive to learning! In fact Hogwarts is bloody fucking dangerous and needs to be cleansed of all that!)

What makes a place magical is what is taught there, the teachers, the creatures, the knowledge etc. - no some changing staircases or doors that lead to different places on different days etc. :(

**** If magical schools were an actual thing, as in, they actually existed, then I'd probably agree.

But they don't. They are fiction. Not the laws of reality (or child safety), but the laws of storytelling apply. Therefore I don't want to read about your design for a perfect learning environment, approved by the ATL, but I want to read about something that is fantastical, dazzling and turns on my imagination. And yes, those things can be dangerous, can be illogical or even just downright spiteful towards the student-characters. But that just adds to the feeling. It drives home the point that I'm in a different environment infused by magic. You don't make your reader *feel* like he's in a magical place by telling him "Today Harry learned about dragons" "Today Harry learned about transfiguring a needle into a cricket" "Today Harry learned about the Stupor". No! You can only create feeling by having a consistent and rich world surrounding these lessons that hint and poke at the fact that what Harry learns is only a small, controlled fraction of magic.

And my point is, in fact, proven by a lot of fics where Harry goes to another school only to find it a great place for learning. Guess what. A great place for learning is a shit place to have a story in. Because, by definition, all conflict and distraction is avoided there. There is no room with a cerberus in it, in its depths there isn't a basilisk sleeping, there aren't books that scream at you when you open them,... in short, /there is no adventure/. So your story, or at the very least the world it plays in, gets stale and boring - it looses its magic. Magic in the sense of wonder, playfulness, fantastical imagination.

This is a meta discussion. We don't argue about what I as, for example, a parent of a magic student would like a school to be. No, we're arguing what we /as readers/ want the story-world to be like which we are about to enter. And if you like to read about a normal ass highschool that just happens to also teach magic, then more power to you. You do you, as I say. But I can guarantee you that Harry Potter, the franchise, would have never become as successful, had the story played in an environment "conductive to learning".

** In most fics where Harry goes to somewhere else, Dumbledore, Hogwarts, and magical Britain all get mercilessly bashed. While I don't necessarily share those assumptions, I do think that Hogwarts was AWFUL during Harry's 7 years there, both in terms of its [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5kyfr0/did_you_change_your_preferences_or_pet_peeves/dbs7ne8/][abysmal safety record]] and large numbers of incompetent teachers (Binns, Burbage, DADA, Snape, Trelawney).

The government of magical Britain was a shining beacon of bigotry, corruption, cruelty, ignorance, incompetence, injustice, malice, and stupidity. But the scary thing is, it might actually be one of the more progressive wizarding societies. MACUSA, as shown in FB, was even more fucked up than the British Ministry.

So you could have Harry and (most likely Hermione) ditching Britain/Hogwarts, only to find themselves in deeper waters somewhere else.

*** But the MACUSA in FB was also a few decades before the current Ministry of Magic.

Given that the Ministry of Britain went through Grindelwald /and/ Voldemort, its entirely possible that the Ministry of Britain hadn't been able to properly reform to a functioning peace-time government, while the MACUSA had decades of peace to change their stance.

We know almost nothing of the history of both institutions, but I don't think the comparison between them is fair if you ignore the time difference and the fact that Britain was in almost constant post-war state throughout the 20th century.

** #1) Give the school valid weaknesses based on the culture surrounding it. We can assume that Durmstrang is a more 'battle-hardened' place, so we should also assume that classes and living conditions are a lot tougher.

#2) Don't bash Hogwarts, unless you create a rivalry between the school Harry goes to and Hogwarts, it will just come off as pretentious.

#3) Remember to have fun, add wacky quirks to the school that aren't in Hogwarts, as every magical school has its own history and own traditions.

#4) If you make the divergence when Harry gets the letters, as in, Harry gets several letters from several different schools, because he's Harry Potter. Give him valid reasoning for not choosing Hogwarts, instead of "I can feel a manipulative old fool in this school, I shan't not go there".

Bashing can also be done without a rivalry (if something is just better, then it's not even bashing in the first place!)

I agree on the last :) - Harry doesn't know Dumbledore and him deciding against Hogwarts needs a reason (you can use the "manipulative Headmaster" thing only if you let Harry somehow know that Dumbledore placed him with the Dursleys (which would probably place Dumbledore on the number one spot of Harry's shit-list!))

** The story by The Santi is really an anomaly and incredibly rare in fanfiction. Most authors don't really understand how to do world-building like this... they can't even make something simple like "The Hufflepuff common room" feel like a genuine actual place - most would be completely out of their league trying to create a whole new school.

I mean, that's the whole thing about fanfiction. You don't have to do the really hard parts about writing yourself and can just focus on story and character interactions. The reason that authors of higher calibre are so rare is obvious: They prefer to use their talents for original stories that they can own and sell.

I usually avoid stories with too many OCs or original locations unless they come highly recommended (Like "HP and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi).

** Its going to be hard. One of the first things to remember is that people love Hogwarts, in the first few books we're surrounded by magic and how fun and yet pointless it can be. Some doors that aren't really doors but just walls pretending, classrooms that move. Doors that won't open unless you tickle them and places that only exist on a thursday. Hogwarts itself is magical so you'll want to capture that.

Secondly, I don't know about other people but for the most part I dislike reading about other made up magical cultures. Why, because its often done so poorly. We learn little from the canon universe about the other schools. Dumbledore, Merlin and Morgana, the founders, Voldemort etc were all British or came to Britain depending on if you take the Slytherin of the Fenns (Essex) to be his home over the name Salazar which is probably more Spanish. The only foreign magical of note was Grindelwald who himself came to Britain to advance himself. Hogwarts is the premier school of magic. Ignore how bad Defense and History are, Divination too. Fleur and Krum are powerful and talented but their Headteachers felt the need to cheat. Cedric and Harry did receive help from Crouch Jr but we might assume less and far less direct help until the maze by which point they were the points leaders. This all matters because Britain is the home of magic in this respect, the place everywhere else looks to, Hogwarts' library is meant to be the greatest in the world. This makes it hard to read when people try to bash Britain, sure the politics may be backwards but the rest of the world is unlikely to be some enlightened super race who see the British as crazy.

You have to have a reason for all the changes. I don't mean this as you can't diverge but there needs to be a cause of divergence and a path we can follow. Why wouldn't Harry go to Hogwarts? He's English and its the best school in the world. He's also eleven at the start of the series so not going to be making super well reasoned choices. Hogwarts and Britain has its flaws but make sure your reasoning and divergence is shown not told. If you tell us it sounds preachy and descends into bashing very easily. Along with Bashing their is a fine line walked with many OCs, the mystical and terrible Mary Sue, care that you don't make everyone the greatest and nicest people. Hogwarts is the best according to the books, how do the others compare? What holds them back? Is it the students, the staff, the curriculum or something else?

Along with a reason for the changes in the story you should have a reason for writing the story. You wanting to write it and enjoying doing so is fine. If you want others to enjoy it though it should have a reason, a plot. What does Harry going somewhere other than Hogwarts provide or are you writing the same story somewhere else surrounded by OCs? Harry Potter is seven books. Each year has its own adventure, there is nothing wrong with having boring years that you basically skip if you do it well so as to advance the plot. A normal school for a normal student isn't nearly as exciting as Harry Potter's time at Hogwarts, there will likely be no three-headed dogs and defense teachers out to get him. You're more likely to hit racism, resentment for the British, why did Dumbledore not save the continent from Grindelwald earlier? Do the Europeans hate each other for their history. France vs Germany is a rivalry that is long and bloody, not as long however as GBR vs France however. Does the Cold war have any effect on the continent's magicals? The conflict that will occur will probably be more subtle that the bogey man that is Voldermort. It can feel forced if you try to have a big end of year conflict every year without reason.

I'll also throw out some thoughts I had a while back just after I read The Santi's great story. How far would Dumbledore go to ensure Harry grew up humble and away from his home? Imagine if Dumbledore wanted to let Harry have a childhood outside the spotlight. Dumbledore is old, it was only a few years ago James Potter was young and arrogant, the prophecy is still in play and Harry is marked. Could Lily and James stop Harry growing up arrogant and ensures he gets a proper childhood? Now Dumbledore clearly has a screwed up family situation so his decision making might not be sound. If he obliviated James and Lily making them thing Harry died then Harry could grow up somewhere else away from the spot light. When he reaches school age then they can reclaim Harry and guide him to become what he needs to become. He will have had a proper childhood, he will have not had his life dictated by his fame and they'll still gets years together as a family. I don't know about you but I could easily see the Potter's losing all trust in the Headmaster and moving to a school he isn't in charge of. Lily Potter was described as kind and compassionate but James Potter has a history of doing whatever he can for his friends and family without caring about the risk to himself. He might have been an arse to some people but he was without a doubt a man who loved strongly and would do anything for those he cares for. It and his love for his wife are what defines him as a character, don't betray that.

*** The only thing I'd add to that is that the British school Hogwarts is the greatest in the world, /according to the British/.

As a real life example, you could look at the global university rankings. In those US and UK universities dominate the top ranks. One would believe that, of course, the education there would be the best of the world. However, once you dig deeper, you'll see that the most commonly quoted rankings judge the quality of a university by us-american standards. Therefore universities in continental Europe, Asia,... that operate differently, get portrayed as lesser educational institutions. On the other side, one could just as easily design a ranking in which German universities rank top.

One example for that would be if we'd use the class of Alchemy. Hogwarts doesn't offer a course on that (at least we don't know about it), while Uagadou graduates are...

#+begin_quote
  especially well versed in Astronomy, Alchemy and Self-Transfiguration.

  - Pottermore
#+end_quote

So if we take the class of Alchemy into consideration, Hogwarts reputation of being the best is tarnished. It doesn't even enter the ranking in this specific class. If you take wandless magic Uagadou would outclass Hogwarts so much, it wouldn't even be a contest.

What I'm saying is, while other schools may not be as good in some fields as Hogwarts, there are definitely areas where those other schools produce more capable graduates. Its all a matter of perspective and the standards you base your judgement upon. But I do agree that it would need a special kind of explanation for a /british/ child to choose a foreign school.

I can honestly say I have never seen the castle bashed. The characters in it yes but the castle with its secret passageways and moving staircases no. Maybe there was one crack fic I read about the dungeons being a bit awful but they are dungeons.

Harry's time was awful but if you're talking about Hogwarts' reputation and what it is meant to be then its the premier school in the world. Without hindsight there is very little reason to not choose Hogwarts. Sure some of the teachers are trash but an eleven year old might not know that but they might have heard the legacy of Hogwarts. If Dumbledore is headmaster it can't be bad level of reasoning.

Also if we judge quality of stories on FFn by favourites, well I'm not sure that's a great idea. They aren't mutually exclusive but I think a lot of people think half of the top page of favourites aren't great.
