  Dropped alone in a world of magic that seems strangely familiar, I must take up arms to save the day-or I could just tell Dumbledore and let him deal with it? Yeah, I prefer that idea. A Harry Potter Self-Insert fic.

  Magic is dying. Death's creation of the Hallows in arrogance resulted in Magic herself intervening to reduce their power, avoiding disaster for all. And now, thousands of years later, with Magic on the decline, Death, with the assistance of Fate must break the rules and intervene. They must send their chosen to intervene in pre-ordained events and save as many magically inclined.
