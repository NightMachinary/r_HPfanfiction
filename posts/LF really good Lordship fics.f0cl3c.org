I enjoy the whole houses, lordships and family magic trope and was wondering if there are any fics that do it really well


** Definitely gotta recommend linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). Story focuses a LOT on the politics of Lordships and inheritance.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** The only fic with lordship tropes that I've enjoyed is linkao3(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn by Flye_Autumne) and its sequels (currently at year 4). It's well written, the lordships are generally used to describe a more complex and very different political system, there's good characters development and children generally speak like children (they can talk politics on occasion but often sound like kids quoting their parents, which is more believable). And the very best: major canon divergences. Particularly starting in the second volume of the series.

  The ultimate betrayal sends seventeen year old Harry Potter spiraling six years into the past, de-aged to eleven, but retaining his young adult memories of the brutal Second Wizarding War. Determined to end the war before it starts, a war-torn Harry is Slytherin! Grey! Independent! Powerful! and Cunning! Includes Mentor!Snape, Hufflepuff!Neville, and Sexually Confused!Draco Also, I was too lazy to separate the chapters, so it's all shoved into one. Be warned. Originally on FanFiction, under KaceyDJ5555Abandoned, but still very good in my opinion.

** linkffn(The Reluctant Lord by SmallBurnyThing) has the distinction of having all the tropes, cliches, and fanon that I normally despise, including, but not limited to, powerful!Harry, "magical power", lordships, Submissive!Hermione, harem, Manipulative!Dumbledore, treacherous!Weasleys, and I am probably forgetting some; but it does so in such a rich and imaginative manner that I was genuinely saddened when the author posted a chapter officially abandoning the story and outlining what he or she had planned.

** I'm a big fan of /Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw/ right now. Not complete, but updates are fairly regular. Harry has a twin who's mistaken as the boy-who-lived, Harry's parents are alive, and Harry and his brother both go back in time to their childhood selves (and are total enemies).

In regards to Lordship titles, Harry basically claims the long-lost Slytherin title and basically goes around as a masked figure meddling in wizarding politics. There's marriage contract politics involved, family magic being discussed, family heirlooms, and "family libraries." Sirius's daughter learns Black family magic in one of these libraries despite her father trying to disconnect them from the Black heritage, Harry magically usurps the title of Potter heir through time-travel details, and the Potters are very reluctant to teach Harry any family magic. There gets to be a ridiculous amount of drama over Harry learning his own family magic because he was raised at the Dursleys (so his first 10 years is identical to the Harry Potter of the books. That's always been a finicky point for me in AUs where his parents are alive) (they assumed he was a squib).

The fic is pretty heavy on politics very connected to lordships and seats on the Wizengamot (including Light/Grey/Dark used as like political parties), with Harry and his harem running around all under the guise of Lord Slytherin (literally; they take turns pretending to be Lord Slytherin when discussing things with other Lords). Within Hogwarts itself, there's Draco and his House buddies who are presented as an opposing faction to Harry + harem, and Harry's brother also creates his own group of friends to oppose Harry. In a way, they reflect the adults' political factions: Draco's group is Dark, Harry's group is Grey, and HP's brother's group is Light (and Voldemort's diary becomes a part of this Light group. It sounds confusing now but trust me).

It's truly a very fleshed-out world with this worldbuilding, and the whole plot can seem overwhelming at first, but it eases you into it and I've really gotten sucked into it. Haven't seen any smut in it, fyi. We're 600k in and the real Voldemort (the non-diary one) is like only just barely waking up now, so it's really a long haul you can't read overnight. Best read with plenty of breaks and a water bottle. There's also an audio version, apparently, so that might be easier to binge if you struggle with uber-longfics.
