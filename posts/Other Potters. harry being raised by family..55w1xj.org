  It is said that as long Alessia's heirs bear the Amulet of Kings, then Tamriel shall be protected from Oblivion and the Empire will be prosperous. But the Amulet has been shattered, and an eternal barrier has been placed between Mundus and Oblivion. But even as an Emperor sits on it, the Ruby Throne waits for its true heirs to return.

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. --- (Eventual Harry/Hermione) Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes.

  Massively AU. Assume nothing. Harry Potter is born into a very different world than the one in canon. A world where the Greats of history walk among mere men. A world where power is all that matters, and young Harry Potter is a commodity desired by many.
