:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi everyone.

In this fic, which I believe contains a Harry/Luna shipping, Harry is brilliant at magic but doesnt follow magical theory at all. He can cast spells by saying any word and just visualazing the effect, which drives Hermione crazy because correct incantation is supposed to be important. He teaches his particular way of doing magic to Luna.

In the fic, he cures Lupin of lycanthropy by providing him with an international portkey, so that Lupin never has to see a full moon during night time again.

Does that ring any bells ?
