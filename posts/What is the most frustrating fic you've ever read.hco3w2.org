Between good readings there're always some fics that frustrate me, or even anger me. That usually happens when I read the Dursleys abusing Harry in terrible ways, or when the only focus in the story is making Harry pathetic without any reason. Yes, I admit, I can't stand hurt/comfort stories.

So I was wondering, which is the most frustrating fic you've ever read? (It can be another reasons than mine) Just to share frustrations

**** Time travel or knowledge about the future is the ultimate Deus Ex Machina, but these authors either have a too strong attachment to canon plot or don't know how to use future information effectively. The key to improve the outcome is not trying to alter some canon stations to their favor, but striking directly at Voldemort's greatest vulnerabilities using future information.

There's absolutely no fucking need to repeat the canon timeline. Canon good guys only won through an atrocious amount of Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiats, Plot Armors, and multiple ‚ÄúLucky Hero‚Äù tropes. Even then, the bad guys completely took over, carried out genocides against Muggleborns, murdered who knows how many Muggles, tortured hundreds of Hogwarts students with Cruciatus, and finally killed off another 50% of the good guys before losing to JKR's (Words of the God) many shenanigans.

Good guys had it best a Pyrrhic victory. It's just awful.

Any time traveler who wants a repeat of that total cluster fuck is one big fucking coldblooded negligent shit head.

***** And then the epilogue goes 19 years later lulz, and everything is fine.

- Economy is destroyed
- There is no wand maker for the foreseeable future (it takes time to build up that many wands)
- Hogwarts is a mess
- Government is even more destroyed than usual
- So many people dead
- They robbed goddamn Gringotts of all places
- Death Eaters got off. AGAIN...

I'm surprised they weren't conquered by a neighboring magical country, the ICW, the Goblins, or the Muggles. 19 years isn't enough time to recover from that, even with magic.

This is why I swear by fics like Novocaine. Sure, he has 20 bajillion titles, and infinite gold. But he's busting his arse trying to get the country fixed.

*** Oh the random describing a character instead of using their name annoys the shit out of me.

"Harry smiled and followed the dog animagus out of the kitchen." No, he followed /Sirius/ out of the kitchen. We don't need to be reminded that Sirius is an animagus. We know that.

"Harry turned to look at the bushy haired girl sat next to him." No. Harry turned to look at /Hermione/. He knows it's Hermione, we know it's Hermione. We know she has bushy hair, we know she's sitting next to him, we do not need to be reminded of that.

"The sandy haired werewolf suddenly felt nervous." No, /Remus/ suddenly felt nervous. We know he's a god damn werewolf. If he's transformed and there's meant to be some suspense about if Harry realises the werewolf he can see is Remus or not, then it's ok to say "the werewolf," but "the werewolf was in the kitchen eating a sandwich" is unnecessary description.

Or even just things like "the shorter man rested his hand on the taller man's arm" JUST SAY THEIR NAMES unless the difference in height is important but even then you need names - i.e. "Sirius was pleased Snape was so much taller than any of them, neither him nor Harry would have been able to reach the book from the shelf half hidden near the rafters."

**** Disagree. Variety makes for an easier read. Consider, using your rule:

"Sirius! Wait up!"

Sirius turned around to see Harry running towards him. "What is it, Harry? Is something wrong?"

Harry leaned over, hands on his knees, trying to catch his breath after running across the Hogwarts grounds to catch up to Sirius. "Sirius, I just wanted to tell you not to visit any longer. I'm too afraid the Ministry will find you, it's not worth it!"

Sirius gave Harry a gentle smile. "Harry, I'm your godfather. I worry about you, not the other way around."

Harry wasn't convinced. "Godfather or not, I still worry about, you Sirius.

I don't know about you, but I get tired of reading the same word over and over, name or not. You'd hate a story that used the word "absolutely" every single paragraph, wouldn't you? It's the same way with names. Saying "the older man", "the brunette", "the animagus" mixes things up. It absolutely keeps things from being absolutely repetitive.

***** People don't use each others names like this when they speak to each other, and there's extra description or use of names in here that you don't need. It happens quite often in fanfic, and it's a trap inexperienced writers fall into. Let me rewrite what you've written and you'll see what I mean.

/"Sirius! Wait up!"./

/"What is it? Is something wrong?"/

/Harry leaned over, hands on his knees, trying to catch his breath after running across the Hogwarts grounds. "I just wanted to tell you not to visit any longer. I'm too afraid the Ministry will find you, it's not worth it!"/

/Sirius gave him a gentle smile. "Harry, I'm your godfather. I worry about you, not the other way around."/

/"Godfather or not, I still worry about you."/

So, you don't need to say Sirius turned around to see Harry. We know it's Harry, because the next line says it is. We need the dialogue, but again you don't need "said Harry, said Sirius" after each line. People take it in turns to speak, so if there's only two people chatting you don't need to name them. It's obvious Sirius is the second person to speak, because the first person to speak addressed Sirius. You don't need to say that Harry was running across Hogwarts "to catch up to Sirius" - that's clear already as he's asked him to wait up. He doesn't need to use Sirius's name when he's telling him what's wrong, both the character and the reader knows who is being addressed. Sirius only needs to give "him" a gentle smile - you don't need to name Harry, there are only two people in the scene and Sirius isn't smiling at himself. The use of Harry's name in "Harry, i'm your godfather" is necessary because it's a mild chastisement if that makes sense, it's there for emphasis. Harry doesn't need to use Sirius's name in the last sentence because again it's clear who he is speaking to. I've cut 50% of name usage and it still works as a story and it's very clear what's happening.

Go and read a passage of any published work, and make a note of how often the characters use each others name in a conversation with two participants. It will be only be to gain attention ("Sirius wait up") or to emphasize that they want the other to listen to what is being said seriously ("Harry, I'm your godfather"). People don't use each others name in every sentence when they speak to each other, it's really unrealistic dialogue.

Then look how often the author talks about their characters using bland description such as "the darker haired man" or "the blond." They don't. If the names are getting repetitive, that's what pronouns are for. You name your characters so you can use the name, or you use he she or they. It is acceptable to say things like "Sirius looked over at /his godson/ and wondered how he had managed to raise such a great boy" if you have already used Harry's name multiple times in that paragraph, because you're emphasising a specific relationship between characters.

Harry can "scowl at Petunia," (her name) he can "scowl at his aunt" (her relationship to him), he can even "scowl at her" if Harry and Petunia are the only ones in the scene so it's obvious who he is scowling at, but he cannot "scowl at the blonde woman" - it's lazy writing. You have already, hopefully, established that Petunia is tall, blonde, and a bitch. You don't need to emphasise these things when her name will do.

Say you have a sister who has blonde hair, is a barista, and is called Rachel. You're currently in a bar with Rachel. When you look at her, you don't think "there is the blonde woman" or "there is the barista." You think "there is Rachel" or "there is my sister." The best writing reflects how people think, act, and speak in real life.

****** I appreciate that you didn't intend to be rude, but I take issue with your generalizatons. I am not a bad writer if I choose to write from a 3rd person omniscient narrator, rather than a 3rd person POV (like canon is written - 3rd person narrative, Harry's POV).

If there are two people speaking, sure, you may not need to identify them. 3 men speaking makes it hard to use pronouns ("he walked over to him," etc and so forth).

Additionally, having identifiers based on appearance ("the beautiful woman", "the unpleasant man") can reaffirm or justify character re/actions or attitudes.

My point is, you may dislike it that style, and you may not prefer it, but to say that delineates good and bad writers seems like you are projecting a pet peeve.

******* It's what I've learned in a lot of creative writing classes, classes which have led me to being published. Don't over use names because it's clumsy and your characters should be distinct enough in how they speak and act that your reader can tell the difference.

It's got nothing to do with whether you're writing 3rd person omniscient or 3rd person narrative. It's to do with basic use of language. You do not think of people you know in terms of "the beautiful woman", you think in terms of "my wife" or <their name>, so your character will also think of them in those terms. When Harry looks at Sirius, he does not think "dark haired man" or "dog animagus." He thinks "Sirius", "Padfoot" or "my godfather." If the character is a stranger or new, yes you may refer to a "dark haired man" but once that person has a name, you don't need to.

Like I said, go and read any published work and see how often the author refers to "the dark haired man" or similar when that character has a name, or an established relationship to another character that they can refer to. They don't. Because it's one of the first things that an editor would strike out of a first draft. The first rule of writing is "show don't tell." You don't have to write "Sirius Black is a handsome man." You show he is a handsome man by, for example, having women watch him with interest as he goes about his business.

********* Oh absolutely, plenty of people take classes and never get anywhere. And most of it is luck, getting published or displayed. I'm sure you're not a bad writer, not at all.

The one thing I was told that really helped me to improve in terms of fiction and storycraft was that writing is as much about what you don't say as you do say, and the words you use should advance the plot or the characters development. Pointing out that Sirius is, for example, an animagus or a good looking bloke when he is doing something like reading a book or cooking a meal jumps out at people because it's got nothing to do with the scene. If you're writing Sirius from the perspective of someone who doesn't yet know him, then yes describe him.

/<New character> watched as the handsome man walked up to the bar. He brushed his dark hair out of his face as he met her eyes and smiled./

/"Hi there. I'm Sirius."/

But now your character knows he is called Sirius, that's how she will think of him. So to continue that scene by refering to "the handsome dark haired man" doesn't add anything, because the new character knows he's handsome, the reader knows he's handsome, and Sirius /definitely/ knows he's handsome üòÇ

/<New character> jumped in shock as where Sirius had stood, there was suddenly a large black dog. The animagus growled, and the barman backed away. <New character> laughed as Sirius reappeared./

/"Possessive, aren't you?"/

/A grin lit up his face, illuminating his good looks./

/"You don't know the half of it, babe."/

So you've shown Sirius is an animagus by both his actions and clearly stating that he is one so there is no confusion in the reader or characters mind that Sirius and the dog are the same person, you've reinforced his good looks, and you've shown something new about him - he likes this girl and doesn't want anyone else hitting on her, and he's reckless enough to change into a dog in public like that. But none of the descriptions are unnecessary, they advance the scene and the readers and other characters impression of Sirius. Whereas something like "The animagus was cooking bacon" sounds daft, because he's not cooking bacon as Padfoot. Although that would make for a good crackfic I guess...

I think maybe it sticks out more in fanfic because anyone reading a HP fic already knows that Sirius is an animagus and he's attractive with dark hair, so perhaps a lot of what would be new information in an original piece seems repetitive because we as the readers are so familiar with these people already, if you get what I mean?

"Mione" grinds my gears as well.

I don't think it's unreasonable that Sirius or Remus or even one of his friends would give Harry a nickname. People do have affectionate terms for their family and friends, and there's canon use of nicknames (the Marauders names, even Mad Eye goes by his nickname 90% of the time). I can deal with Sirius calling him "Pronglet" or "mini prongs" or something, or I've seen "snitch" or "snidget" used and they're ok because both of those are based on something actually about Harry - he's the son of Prongs and they'd perhaps want to give him a name based on what they called his dad so he feels part of the team, and he's a seeker so snitch, so they make actual sense. Not like "hurhurhur imma wolf so you're my cub." Where do you stand on those?

Yes, I can see Ginny crying after Harry leaves her, but to have her instantly bawling makes her seem like the has the mental capacity of an infant.

Then there's the time travel fics where people bend over backward for Harry. I can't count the fics where a 3 to 8 year old Harry walks into Gringotts and says Dumbledore is stealing from him.

Like when characters "roar" or "growl". I always wonder what the author had in mind, because these are not appropriate ways to communicate in life. (Don't these people have any self-regulation skills?!?)

What's worse is that I often see it in arguments between love interests / friends / people who supposedly have a decent relationship. Like, /how??/

Maybe I'm just too literal, but if someone "roared" or "growled" at me, I'd be so done with that.

**** Speaking with a ‚Äúgrowl‚Äù I have less issue with - it can demonstrate anger or frustration without going into flip-the-table levels (or roaring).

The problem for me is proportional responses. Amateur writers might try and show a character as being strong willed/impulsive by having them get furious when the are wronged... even if it's something really minor.

‚ÄúRON IS JEALOUS OF ME SO I'M GOING TO CUT HIM AND HIS MONEY GRUBBING FAMILY OUT OF MY LIFE FOREVER!‚Äù

Characters end up having 2 or 3 emotional settings - angry, happy, or sad, and play those emotions to the extreme.

It built up to this amazing scene (that actually had a surprise twist, yay) and I was ready for that sweet emotional payoff. Suddenly the character was all 'that's cool that you abandoned me for someone else, totally makes sense, in fact I think I'll try become friends with the person you chose over me'.

** I can't remember what it was called, but I read half of one that had the following plot points:

Harry goes dark after meeting the goblins and becoming Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin or whatever combo. Now he hates Dumbledore because obviously Dumbledore has spent all his money on paying the Weasleys to be his friends. (Standard dark Harry opening, if you will).

Voldemort adopts Harry and Snape as his family because they are both parselmouths. He makes them all sleep in a big bed together and cuddling is the rule. This is within 24 hours of Harry calling a truce with Voldie due to the Dumbledore-is-stealing issue. He literally keeps saying "this is strange I hated both of you twelve hours ago." (What. How. Why. Lord Voldemort doesn't hug, and Snape even less so, and the definition of "family" is very much not "we all sleep in a big bed together.")

It turns out Neville is actually the child of Bellatrix and Rodolphus and the Longbottoms"stole" him and that's why they got tortured. (No thank you)

Nagini has some kind of medical skills and calls Harry, Voldie and Severus her "hatchlings." (oh do fuck off, she's a venomous snake not a nurse with an adoption complex).

But the icing on the shitcake came when Hedwig dies but ends up in a limbo similar to Harry's in DH and is told that because she loved "her boy" more than any other familiar has ever loved a human so she can go back (ok this has potential if handled better) BUT because she is the Most Magical And Sentient Owl To Ever Live, she may choose a new form. So she chooses three (THREE) and becomes an "Ice Phoenix" who can turn into a special kind of "Oriental Dragon" (cringe) that speaks parseltongue because of course she needs to talk to Harry, that can ALSO turn into a Nudu cub.

Narcissa Malfoy occasionally brushes Harry's hair and tells him she's been waiting to have him in her family since his parents died. (Fifty shades of what is this fuckery).

Obviously Harry is really called Hadrian and Luna makes an appearance speaking in literal riddles and all the other tropes. But the big bed that they shared and Hedwig having an acid trip of a reincarnation just annoyed me so much.

There's also one that's really similar to this including the Neville plot point but also the twins go dark and renounce their family, and the teenage characters all somehow adopt a load of animals from Japanese mythology like a kitsune, some of them may even have been types of Pok√©mon. And that, well, I couldn't even see the words of the fic any more, they may as well have just written "haha I love Japanese stuff on Tumblr haha" over and over again.

I can just about deal with it if Voldemort in the fic is a Voldemort that came back via the diary and is actually sixteen because the horcrux doesn't age or something. It's still a ship I avoid like the plague though.

Loads of HP fic is bordering on being paedo in the topics it chooses.

** linkffn(Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe), without any contenders. I'm generally with you in disliking angst fics, but this one's different.

It's an Avengers crossover that's decently well-written, has /extremely/ good buildup, decent world-building, well-thought out meshups of magic and science and all that good stuff, but after all the buildup, every single story arc simply falls flat. Nothing happens. Harry makes friends with the villain or smacks them down and goes off to have sex.

The Harry of the story is also the most frustrating Harry I have ever read. And I dare say my fic count is well in the thousands by now. It's a Godlike!Harry, but his personality is weaker then a sheet of paper. Always moping, always whining, always "I'm literally the strongest being in the universe but I'm not good enough", a patented Nice Guy(tm) and a ridiculous pushover who can go from "I'm a badass who can literally destroy you with a thought" to "No I don't deserve this" in the same chapter. Not to mention what they did to the Black Widow... God, like, it takes a particular kind of person to turn the world's best assassin into the Daphniest of all Daphnes. And don't even get me started on the ending, ffs, all that buildup only to nuke Thanos' army with a black hole while Harry burns the rest with fiendfyre

** There are two things in fics that really frustrate me. One is a fic that makes a minor change, like putting Harry in Slytherin, and then basically tells the Canon story, except with Harry and two Slytherins instead of Ron and Hermione. It doesn't matter if the character names are different, it's the same story. If I wanted to read Philosophers Stone, I would be reading that, not a fan fiction.

My other gripe is something that happens a lot in stories but is not limited to any one fic, and that is repeatedly calling someone by their name while in a conversation with them.

Hermione walks in the room and sees Harry looking at her newly painted wall. "So Harry, what do you think of the blue wall." "I like it Hermione." She looks at him strangely, "But Harry, I thought you said liked red?".

Ok, the dialogue could be written out better, but hopefully you get my gist. The use of Harry in the first line of dialog is used to denote that it is Hermione talking to Harry, rather than Harry talking to Hermione. After that, they don't to keep repeating each others name.

And no, Harmony isn't that realistic. Look, I'm not a huge fan of canon pairings, but that doesn't somehow make Harmony a better pairing. It is explicitly stated that as much as Harry likes Hermione as a friend, he doesn't like spending time with her too much. It is clearly shown in Goblet of Fire. He likes to spend time with Ron much much more. That's why he chooses Ginny, who is closer to Ron in personality.

Also, narratively, Harmony has problems. It will automatically make Ron less important. Because you always put your lover above your best friend(unless they are the same person). It is also one of the reasons why Harry breaks up with Ginny, because if not, then Ginny would become too important to the story, which she never was in previous books.

#+begin_quote
  As Harry Potter slays the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, blood and venom get in his eyes, mostly blinding him. While Harry learns to adapt, he makes some new friends. But this is more than a story of adaptation and friendship as there are threats... and Harry isn't the only one with a past that haunts him. Blind!Harry POV. Disabled OCs. Very slow-build. No pairings.

** I can't remember the name of it, but the one that springs to mind is a fanfic where Harry went back in time but ended up having to pretend to be a squib so he wouldn't be recognised by his dad. He works in the Hog's head and sleeps in the goat barn.

Don't get me wrong, it's original, well written but it just got to the point where I felt it had come to a natural end and was only a fraction of the way into the story. It was too long for me to sustain interest which frustrated me greatly because I knew I going to have to search long and hard for another well written fic.

*** I think I know the one you mean, is it The Second String? linkao3(15465966)

I totally understand where you're coming from about the length, and I've abandoned similar fics when I felt they're getting stale or going in circles...but I strongly encourage you to give it another go.

I don't want to get into spoiler territory but there is a reason, there is a pay off and there is a change to the status quo (a couple of them, if memory serves). It's also nearly complete according to the chapter count and was last updated May this year.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** Something which has good idea, but the writing is just very weak (e.g., linkffa(311) this is just story, where all events which author wanted to happen really happened, but there is no development, no stuff around the story). Or the author had a good idea, wrote it down, and then he didn't stop when his original idea outlived its life (e.g., linkffn(6439871) ... if it was three and half chapters long, it would be brilliant; with twenty chapters, it is just pain).

** linkffn(Living with Danger by whydoyouneedtoknow)

Now, just to be clear- this is not a bad fic. In fact, I rather enjoyed the front half of it. The part of it that I despise is the "pack" and "pride" bit. It's extremely irritating, and from there, the series takes a turn for the worse. It's sad- I really liked it originally, but it just lost me.
