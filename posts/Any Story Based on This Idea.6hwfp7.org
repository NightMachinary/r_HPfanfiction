Basically an idea from Rorschach's Blot's Odd Ideas. Chapter 141.

In 1981, After wormtail blew the street, Remus told the aurors Sirius is dog animagus. So the aurors in their brilliance instead of arresting Sirius, arrested a dog thinking it's Black.

It will probably be a crack fic.

Perhaps stories how Sirius could have avoid Azkaban?


** Instead of a fic I immediately imagined this playing out as a Potter Puppet Pals skit and now I have to go rewatch a couple of them.

*** There's a story as far as I remember where Moody kidnapped Harry from Dursley's and gave him to Shacklebolt to rise him.

  A chance remark on the night of Halloween 1981 could have changed everything. Fate throws baby Harry into the custody of Kingsley Shacklebolt, assisted by a certain Mad-Eye Moody. And oh boy, heads will roll and history will change when this gets out. Dear Wizarding Britain: Your saviour has arrived. ON HIATUS.

** This would be hilarious. Of course, the spell that turns an animagus back to human would stop the innocent pup from going to Azkaban, but everyone and their mother would be bringing in black dogs and dogs that have been dyed black and goats and large cats and basically anything with four legs, hoping to get a reward. Chaos. Sirius would approve.

*** They could let the real Sirius slip away during that chaos. "Oh no, not another black dog again! Go away!"
