Well, this is the dilemma I present you, as said above, you are an SI/someone with the know-how, and want to investigate the blood looking for the magic trait (don't know if it is even possible, but let's suppose it is). You are convinced that no, the Pureblood propaganda is bullshit and blood purity has nothing to do with magic potential or whatever.

Plot twist, almost all the Pureblood propaganda was right and Purebloods are, in general, stronger than Muggle-Borns and Half-Bloods (I know, Tom and Dumbledore? where Half-Bloods but let's say they are an exception) what to do?

On the one hand, you are no bigot, you don't want to support the Purebloods cause, on the other hand, they are right, and if the Light side wins, it's possible that magic will weaken along the years.

How would you react? What would you do?

PD: this isn't a Pureblood apologism thread, it's just an hypothetical case.


** I'd probably double-check to see whether or not I'd made a mistake, or someone had tampered with the evidence, because those results don't seem to match up with the reality of the canon. There are too many uber-powerful half-bloods, and exceptional Muggle-borns, for them to be dismissed as mere coincidences or exceptions.

Even if they were, we are talking about human beings here. It's bad enough when you breed cats and dogs for "desirable traits" to the point where you get races that are interbred and unhealthy -- but we're going to limit humans to the smallest possible genetic pool just so "magic won't weaken along the years"? That's a short-sighted and stupid attitude.

*** I'm trying to force you to choose the lesser of 2 evils or find a solution.

So, let's say you are sure beyond any doubt of your discovery. The more ancient your line, the stronger and more varied your magic is. And you can avoid genetic problems, because magic. Though you could still get genius Muggle-Borns and dumb Purebloods, as this has nothing to do with magic.

You can then suppress your findings, and condemn the magic world to a slow decline in magic potential, public them and condemn the magic world to bigotry, or try to find another solution.

**** Research a way to solve the problem using magic or any other way. If I know beyond doubt that my findings are accurate, I must already have a thorough understanding of how it works, so I would try to build up from here.

Finding ways to strengthen magic isn't a waste of time anyhow, provided it works in the end.

So basically, continue the research.

** First off I'd have to have a clear understanding of what differences there actually are. Is it only a nurture > nature phenomenon? Are muggleborn babies just as capable as pureblood babies or are they more "powerful" the moment they come out of the womb of their mothers?

I would not publish this if I didn't have as much of the scientific truth as I possibly can.

As for the timing, I'd wait for the war to end, then publish my findings after a diversified government has been established in accordance with public opinion leaders (Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Kingsley Shacklebolt,...). Since they are divisive for the populace, I'd rather these findings are controversial, than beneficial for a government. If Britain falls due to a lack of magic, so be it. No magic > Magic under magical Hitlerstalin McMaoKim.

** What qualifies as 'stronger'? Make sure you get your selection criteria right. Then find out you have enough sample size. Next you need to determine why Purebloods are 'stronger'. Is it because they have access to better resources? Is it because they have better connections? Finally, you need to determine how much they are 'stronger' based on your criteria.

In the end, you still need to ask the question whether improving the average magical strength of the society justifies a caste society or even genocide.

** Why would lights victory weaken magic? Any more than purebloods killing eachother during the war that is? Light side has plenty of purebloods afterall. And well, muggleborns and halfbloods are still more likely to marry other magicals, which would mean that new pureblood lines will come to exist.

Why would I be convinced /before/ investigating?

Step one would probably be to develop a standardized measure of magical aptitude. Figure out what it actually means for someone to be a powerful witch or wizard. Ability to cast many spells without tiring? Ability to master new spells quickly? The goal is something like a muggle IQ test, but for magical aptitude. In order to exclude existing anti-muggle bias and structural factors, you'd be looking for something very low context (that is, most every learned skill that is used on the test, is learned /in the testing room/).

If you're really lucky, this was done a hundred years ago and the test is given to Hogwarts first years as standard practice.

Step two is making sure you're actually measuring something muggle IQ tests /don't/. If magical ability is binary (you either have it or you don't; a powerful wizard is a smart wizard), old pureblood families could be more powerful on average due to genes from smart muggle ancestors (love potions, Imperius curse, magic is sexy pre-Statue of Secrecy, magically-sourced wealth is sexy always).

Step three (this is the one that gets you chased off the Hogwarts board of governors), is actually investigating how magical ability is inherited, and how heritable it is. Most likely it's polygenic, like a lot of human traits (height, skin color, etc.), but basic Mendelian inheritance is a possibility (which would make it binary). The standard approaches here are things like twin studies (correlation of magical ability between identical twins vs between non-identical twins) and adoption studies (natal parent-child correlation vs adopted parent-child correlation).

If you wait a while after the canon timeline, or wizarding genetic science is a decade or two ahead of muggle science, you can get into step four: sequencing genomes and trying to identify genes that predict magical aptitude.

Sirius answer: Write parody lyrics about it to the tunes of popular Disney children's songs.

Serious answer:

In the best case, magical ability is binary, and we're just looking at intelligence. IDK if I'd really classify that as a "pureblood propaganda was right" scenario, but... If that's the answer, we don't have to worry too much about a wizarding world population bottleneck, and it reduces to the muggle eugenics problem. In the interests of altruism, you'd probably want to spread the magical ability gene through the muggle population. The ethical approach is encouraging outbreeding by fighting anti-muggle prejudice, and subverting muggle sperm clinics.

If magical ability is heritable and /continuously variable/... you obviously want to avoid having children with muggles (or magicals of recent muggle ancestry) to the exclusion of children with powerful wizards and witches. This could be the basis for an /(eugh)/ Marriage Law Fic. But encouraging the culture to adopt natalist attitudes and meritocratic (or, less effectively, pureblood-supremacist) ideology would probably be more sustainable and politically viable. You could also publicize a bunch of highly-difficult, appearance-altering human transfiguration spells.

How muggleborns come about becomes an important question. Are they bastard children of wayward wizards? Did they get lucky with random genetic variation? Does the continuous variation of magical ability extend into the muggle population? (I.E., are some muggles mugglier than others?) If so, then you might try to manipulate the fertility of muggles.

There's room for a half-crack fic where the demographic transition is the result of a *wizarding conspiracy to suppress muggle fertility*, the gradual spread of the transition is due to adoption by various magical governments, and Weasley family planning practices are fairly representative of magicals in general.

** Is there really a basis for there being a "power level" in magic? Some wizards seem to think there is but there's not much info to show power level actually being a thing. Personally, how strong you are in canon seems to be a combination of desire, knowledge/practice, and confidence. Yeah a few people get some special abilities (parselfmouth etc.), but they don't seem to sway the scales.

So you almost have to start with a slightly different canon for the idea to even work. If it was me and I was in that situation I'd definitely hide it. If muggleborns didn't show up once in awhile everyone would be even more inbred then they already are. And heck, if you have come across what essential makes someone "magic" and its measurable can make someone non magical magical?

** I'd keep it to myself until I found out the exact cause and see if I could find a way to increase HB/MBs magical power. If I couldn't, then I'd give my research to a capable pro-muggle higher up and let them decide. They'd have more experience at hard decisions than me and I don't want to make the wrong choice.
