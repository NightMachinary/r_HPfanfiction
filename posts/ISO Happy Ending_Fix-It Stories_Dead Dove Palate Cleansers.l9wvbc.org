Ok, so I am depressed as hell and, in my self-destructive depression brainspace, made the dumb decision to spend the day reading through my "to-read" backlog of an author in a different fandom who's writing I really like but who's stories are /very/ Dead Dove. This, unsurprisingly, did not help anything. I switched to HP for a palate cleanser, but the top new story in my to-read list was The Potions Mistress by myrskytuuli, which was /excellent/ but also really did not help. So now I turn to you, reddit!

I want stories about hope, where the good guys win, where it's not a phyrric victory and if there's trauma, it's not the kind that leaves people broken. I'd especially enjoy some good redemption fics for Bellatrix, Regulus, Peter, or Snape, but really anything that's got a nice hopeful tone is good. I don't have any NOTPs, but I'm not super fond of Harry/Hermione unless they didn't meet until they were adults or it's a /really/ stellar story (I'm looking at you, Starfox5, except don't actually rec any of Starfox5's stuff because I've read those already). Thanks folks! ^{.^}


** Well, linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay) is definitely light-hearted and optimistic. Voldemort is just an occasional nuisance; the real story is that there's /a school full of magic/. And magical creatures. No pairing for Harry at this point, Ron/Hermione happens but with quite a different dynamic from canon, as Ron has developed a passion for magical space travel, so he's working harder and doesn't feel so overshadowed.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Since you asked for Snape redemption, I'm here to self-promote because all my stuff is Snapefic! I'm [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/jalapeno_eye_popper/profile][jalapeno_eye_popper]] on AO3, and I got a bunch of HEA post-war Snamione short stores you might like for this palate cleanse. Little one-shots like "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26580946][So You Think That's an Age Gap]]" or "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27293059][Constellations Above the Bonfires]]" are nice and tame bite-sized fluff. If you want something a wee bit longer and more serious, in "Fridays I'm in Love" there's a bunch of trauma recovery where Snape and Hermione have their bad moments but really act like adults and work through their problems together.

Mind the tags on my stuff. I don't usually link directly out of concern for Rule 8.

Also, "The Potions Mistress" is now checked /marked for later/ on my own to-read list so thanks for that ;)

** Well, Fluff ist not really my domain, but here is some comedy:

linkffn(The Many Harry Potters of Little Hangleton) by VivyPotter

you probably know this one, but it's still a good palate cleanser, even as a reread:

linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them) by White Squirrel

this crossover is my latest obsession (and I reread this one like a week later, all 300,000 words of it!) in case you have watched Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (if not, it's worth it):

linkao3(snipers solve 99% of all Problems) by silentwalrus

Edit: this one is kinda comedy but mostly enjoyable because the MC fixes all of the Order‘s problems while cussing at everybody, everywhere, all the time.

*** I rather like A Little Child Shall Lead Them, because it starts with an interesting premise, develops it, then quits while it's ahead. I don't think it would work as a longer story, but at just 30k words, it's worthwhile.
