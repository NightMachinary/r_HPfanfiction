**** I've seen 'the gnomes of zurich' in fanfics more than dwarven bankers. I usually use dwarves as stone craftsmen, humans as wood craftsmen, and goblins as masters of earthworks.

But while each race has an affinity, any creature can be a master craftsman in other fields, it's just i see them as having an affinity due to 'prejudice.' Since their people always work in those fields, they are considered the best for it.

*** u/Abyranss:
#+begin_quote
  What motivates them?
#+end_quote

Dementors are soulless miserable beings that consume the souls and happiness from others to fill the void in their hearts. Poor things.

#+begin_quote
  Can they be killed?
#+end_quote

It is stated at some point that the Patronus Charm is the only defence against them, as that does not kill them I belive they cannot be killed. /However/ they do die from age. At the beginning of The Half-Blood Prince the Minister of Magic says that the fog appeared because dementors are breeding. If they can breed then they can die, else the world would be covered in them.

#+begin_quote
  How do you control them?
#+end_quote

You give them a supply of what they desire most: happiness and souls, but dementors are smart enough to know that a soulless human cannot feel happiness so they know not to eat the souls of everyone else they run out.

The information above is a combination of info from the books, my own intuition, and internet osmosis.

** House elves. They are so useful, and so much of wizarding society seems to depend on them implicitly. Yet, they get ignored at best or abused. This is despite the fact that a house elf uprising would lead to a blood bath the likes of which magical Britain might never recover from.

I enjoy stories that treat house elves as valuable beings, not just background props or a punching bag for spoiled pureblood children. I particularly like some stories in which a wizard (usually HP) teams up with a house elf to create a very hard to beat first strike advantage, useful in either robbery or asymmetric warfare.

** I have two.

1. From a cultural standpoint: Werewolves. We learn a bit from Lupin, but I woul love to learn more about them. Are they all like Greyback? Are there different factions (those like Lupin, those like Greyback)? Did they all support Voldie or was there a civil war among them between followers and non-followers? How does their society exactly work? Do they live as packs like wolves, alone, or are they one big society? What kind of laws do they have? I think it's something interesting to dwell on.

2. From a more general standpoint: Inferi. Because they are fucking scary.

**** I'm not sure, you bring up a good point. According to the wiki, it said they are human corpses. I don't think we've seen an Inferus (in the series) made of something other than a human corpse, although, as you pointed out, the possibility is there.

Many games/series consider "living dead" or "zombies" to be a race (like in WoW or how in TWD they emphasize that walkers are no longer human). Furthermore, they can no longer be considered "human" once they have become Inferi. So these points make it difficult to classify them.

Maybe more like a magical creature?

Despite all this, they're still scary as all hell and pretty interesting.
