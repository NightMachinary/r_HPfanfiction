I remember reading a fix a while ago where Harry find out he has money and decides to go to the shoemaker's. The shoemaker has 2 house elves and Harry gives him his old shoes and the shoemaker puts them on display

#+begin_quote
  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.
