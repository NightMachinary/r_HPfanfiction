I've been trying to remember what this HP fanfic was called and where it was for the longest time, but I still can't find it; I'm hoping all you wonderful people can help me out. There may be spoilers that I'm mentioning to help find the fic, so sorry in advance...

Here's what I remember about the fanfic: -The Potters are alive -Harry has siblings, and I think I remember he had a sister who got a big ego from either being a Potter or the Girl Who Lived -Harry had some kind of disorder and used a walking stick -They thought he couldn't use magic, but it turned out he was a shaman or something and could naturally use magic -He saved James by fighting Bellatrix in a Diagon Alley raid, warping the walls around him with magic and stabbing Bellatrix with his shattered walking stick -After that fight, his answer to the question of whether he was okay was "No; my walking stick is broken" -He falls into a short coma for some reason, and his sister loses her ego and helps take care of him in his coma -There was this magic cat that had lightning powers or something

That's all I can remember right now; if anyone has any idea what this fic is, please tell me. It was a fantastic story and I really want to read it again. :)

*** I open the link, and read the first word.

I cringe, but carry on. One missed error, nbd. Even if it is literally the first word of the fic. After the one paragraph summ*a*ry,

**** I only read one chapter (chapter 11 I think), It seemed to match up with what was being requested. Only thing I didn't read enough to see was if it had a lightning powered cat.

Edit: just skimmed it some more. Lightning cat confirmed. This is definitely the story.

** Yes, I do. I literally made my first reddit account to post fic searches on this sub.

And you know what? I was disappointed more often than not. Oh, the people here are brilliant and they found the fics right quick, but sadly they were only great back when I had nothing to compare them to. Now I'm afraid to re-read everything I have read more than two or three years ago so as not to destroy the memory I have of them.

I hope you'll have more luck with your fic.

** My problem is that I read so many shity fanfics that I can't remember which one had Harry doing a necromantic ritual to give Moaning Myrtle a body so she could join his harem and which one had Harry having awesome shape-shifting powers so he can impregnate Hedwig and the horntail from the Triwizard Tournament...

Completely serious about those two stories by the way I have no idea what they're called. There's a slight possibility that it is one single story but I don't think so.

** I've got around 3 stories I'm still looking for but no one else seems to know what they are. Oh well, I did read them a long time ago before Reddit got huge so... (shrugs)

** I hate this ! I remember reading this fanfic series I really adored about how things would have turned out had Snape not turned to the Dark Arts and Lily would have chosen him instead!

It was quite a fascinating read and I cannot remember where I had originally found it : (

â€‹

I've never read that fanfic though but that must have been a really cool read to see Harry with siblings...I hope you find it !

**** I'm not sure :( i read it what seems like years ago... i think it was on Tumblr because I'm always on that platform but perhaps it might have just been through fanfics on google? Have you read it as wellðŸ˜§

** For me it's a story where Harry is sent back in time to redo hogwarts, and unbeknownst to him, so is Draco. Harry and Ron are still best mates, both are griffindors.
