Prefer to have it with good romance. Can be set any time and can be a cross over. Long I mean over 100k minimum. More like 250k plus

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.

** I recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]] and the sequels in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/766017][The Armistice Series]] where Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. Written beautifully and easy to get into. Each of the works are very long as well. The first has about 180k words, with the rest having a total of 400k+ words.

I also really enjoyed [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/][The Pureblood Pretense]] and it's sequels, though it's ongoing. 229k+ words in the first work.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] has 529k words in just the first, and there's two more sequels!! It explores what the series might've been like if Hermione had been a whiz at math, which translated into arithmancy. Also wonderfully written

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12783124/1/][Rewriting Destiny]] is a dramione fic with well over 300k words. It's where the two go back to the marauders era to change how it ended up, but instead of posing as adults, they're born again as siblings to people in that time. Really good and makes more sense than how I explained it!

I know a few more so if you enjoyed any of these feel free to let me know so I can try to recommend more!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/][A Long Journey Home]] Sadly abandoned, but so good up to the end. FemHarry gets sent into the past and has to take the long way around to the future. 203k

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2736892/1/][Becoming Neville]] A Neville grows into himself fic, where he stays at Grimmauld Place after his grandmother is injured. 114k

***** Thank you! I've only read a few but these are quite interesting

Honestly I read any pairing as long as it isn't slash, fem!harry or completely weird

Example: Ron/Hedwig or Hogwarts/Giant squid would be some pairings I would categorize as weird.

** I'd recommend linkffn(13391445; 13140418; 8045114)

His Darkest Devotion is a Harry/Tom story set in an AU with heavy focus on soulbonds. I've enjoyed it so far, good writing, pace and frequently updating. The romance is there but I wouldn't call it fluffy.

HP and the ITT is also an updating story set from the start of 4th year and onwards. It's taken some previously used tropes and given it a new feel. The romance is good, I've enjoyed it alot thus far.

Since you asked for *long* I'll have to include "A Marauders Plan". The focus isn't on the romance but it's there.

  HPTMR, AU. Harry has been hiding in plain sight all his life, since he has Minister Tom Riddle's soul-mark on his arm, and a fulfilled soul-bond will make Riddle incredibly powerful. Harry works as a junior Ministry official feeding his fugitive parents and godfather what information he can. No one, least of all Harry, expects him to be abruptly pulled into Riddle's sphere.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13140418/1/][*/Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8729603/Salient-Causality][/Salient Causality/]]

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. Story contains more detailed magic, politics, and more. It is a story of growth and maturation.
