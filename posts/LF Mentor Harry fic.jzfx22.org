Hello. I'm looking for a fic where Harry trains someone and at the beginning they basically idolize him. I'm not particular about pairings as long as Snape and Malfoy are not good. Anything over 30k words will be acceptable.

Btw this is post war. Harry's career is not important though I assume he's either an auror or a quidditch player

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...
