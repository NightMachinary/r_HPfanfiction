** I agree. It's very annoying. Leaving a story with a wrapped up arch, a conclusion, with a possibility of a sequel would be preferable.

We're done with whatever the characters were dealing with, but let's give some hints along the way about possible further adventures, but nothing concrete.

Give yourself a way out!
