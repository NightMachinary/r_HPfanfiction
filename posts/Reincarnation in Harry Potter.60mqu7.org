** There's a crossover with Supernatural where the Archangel Gabriel takes over the body of Harry. If you haven't seen Supernatural you probabaly won't get a lot from it though.

As best as I can recall there's no slash, but don't quote me on that, it is rated M, and I would've read it regardless.

  Gabriel might have made a mistake when he borrowed pagan weapons to make a fake angel blade, but he'd thought it would be enough to trick Lucifer. Well, it was, but now the archangel find himself set adrift on another Earth. With his Grace almost gone and unwillingly possessing Harry Potter, what can Gabriel do? Maybe Hogwarts will be enough to distract him...

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11132888/1/The-Dementor-and-the-Mind-Game][Dementor and the Mind Game]] is one of the best in this category you're gonna find. Ender Wiggin from Ender's Game takes control of Harry's body at the start of second year. I can't recommend this fic enough.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5503251/1/Memories-of-a-Former-Life][Memories of a Former Life]] Bleach crossover. Harry hears a voice when he's near the dementors and slowly remembers his past life as Sosoke Aizen. I especially love the way Harry's personality shifts as he remembers more. Dead fic and I'm pretty pissed about that since I've never found anything quite like it.
