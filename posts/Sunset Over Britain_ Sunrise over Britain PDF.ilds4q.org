** Not at home right now, but I can link an epub when I am. Note that I've trimmed all the notes from the fics, if you care about that.

Will be at least an hour.

The first one is edited, and I apparently never got around to the second one. Fair warning: Bobmin wrote some.... /interesting/ author notes.

****** You're welcome :D

And yeah, I'm perfectly fine. I was stabbed pretty thoroughly by a rose bush and it was getting infected, so I just went in for a tetanus shot. Going into the ER in Canada for something that isn't an emergency takes forever, do not recommend.

I had a super exciting day, y'know @.@

******* Getting stabbed by a rose bush bad enough to go to the ER is kind of romantic in an ominous/mythical way.... foretelling a romance for the ages perhaps? Destined for love so epic it creates and destroys?

....I'm too far into the Wheel of Time to stop, apparently.

********** Lord of Chaos has an amazing ending, but the middle of the book drags a bit. If u were referring to the series as a whole; books 8-10 are known to be overly slow, and many ppl say it's the worst part of the series. There r some super important moments for the plot tho.
