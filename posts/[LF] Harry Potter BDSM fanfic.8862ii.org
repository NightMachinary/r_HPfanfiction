If you want something with an actual plot (although a very Luna-ish one). Bit of a cracky fic, but the actual relationship between Harry and Luna is very much BDSM.

  Now Complete! Severus Snape is not a kind man, but Hermione Granger is past caring. She wants his approval and will do anything to get it. How far will she go? Even she has no concept of the depths to which she will fall in her quest.

** My friend, I have done a thing. (Yes, this is self-promotion..)

[[https://my.w.tt/iikQEm9iHL][Bound]]

It's Snape/Hermione/Lucius. Notice that Hermione is in the middle - that's because she mostly is. It's set in their 6th year, however she is 18 (time turner stuff. Not gonna explain because it's a bit too in-depth to write out on my phone!) got some awesome OCs (as far as I'm concerned. Fabian is my favourite ever character that came from my very own brain!) I have an editor, however we live literally on opposite sides of the world and we both work, so chapter updates are slooooowwww but not more than a few months usually. That said, we're hoping to do a double update next, since the chapters were originally written as one and we decided to split them - more for our sanity than yours - so they may take a month or two to get out. If you read it, I hope you enjoy and pretty please let me know? Please and thanks! Bye!
