#+begin_quote
  "Father, I hate Harry Potter. I cannot stand how he walks around like he owns the place. It's as if the rules don't apply to him because he's rich and famous!" Draco sends his father letters. A lot of letters. And they all revolve around one thing: his son's silly crush on Harry Potter.

**** After finishing it I kept thinking of that scene near the beginning of the first HP movie, where the Dursley's house gets bombarded with Harry's acceptance letters from Hogwarts ;).
