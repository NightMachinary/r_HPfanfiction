:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Sorry if this is super vague but I need help! It was a fic similar to A Marauders Plan. It has super!harry, Sirius takes charge sort of thing, Dumbledore bashing. Last year I read this fic about Sirius adopting Harry. When he blood adopts Harry, Harry takes on some of Sirius' physical features and becomes his ‘third parent' It takes place during 4th year and follows Harry through the triwizard tournament etc but there was quite a lot of Dumbledore bashing and Sirius actually got the other professors together and had him removed as headmaster. Dumbledore is super manipulative in this and plans how he can get Harry alone for DADA lessons via detentions. McGonagall becomes headmistress and I know Harry becomes an animagus at some point. Harry makes loads of friends in the different houses and sits with them, encourages inter house friendships and makes good friends with the other champions. Sirius also spends a lot of time teaching him dueling and muggle fighting, which Harry is super good at and is more powerful. (I remember this one specific scene where they are practicing dueling and Harry is hiding in the lake in some long grass)!!

Another random detail is that The tasks in the tournament are shown to the crowd via giant screens with tracking charms on the champions.


** I don't know for sure but sounds like A Marauder's Plan
