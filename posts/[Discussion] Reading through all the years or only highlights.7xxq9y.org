As a reader if you find a particularly interesting fic with an interesting plot (or potentially interesting plot for ongoing series) would you want to read through all the years before it reaches the plot or just the major highlights of the years? Including if everything ends up staying cannon until the original plot begins? (This is excluding background build up/explanations for the reader to understand)


** If it doesn't deviate from canon I don't want to read it. If there are significant and important changes, I'd like them highlighted.

** Personally I hate canon rehashes, i've read the books. Canon rehashes with minor au elements are just as bad.

I like what many original fictions do, where they just start the story and the more boring past elements are referred to in the dialog or character thoughts. Not flashbacks, like some fanfics do, but just a few sentences that allow you to get the general gist.

*** Nah, it's quite common for stories to say that there will be X awesome changes and then you start reading it and see that the story is just a canon rehash with rather inconsequential change and ended up abandoned somewhere in the second or third year. Harry getting adopted by Lupin with a teased Fleur relationship seem oddly susceptible to that.

** Unless it's marauders Era or next Gen, I absolutely hate reading about anything to do with the school. It gets so repetitive
