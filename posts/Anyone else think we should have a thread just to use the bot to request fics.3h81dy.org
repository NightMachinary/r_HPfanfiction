For example I wanted to download an ePub copy just now and had to clutter an already existing thread to do so with the bot. Seems like a link in the sidebar to something like that would be handy.

Also it'd be like a mega rec thread if you ever need something but don't want anything in particular.


** The bot uses [[http://p0ody-files.com/ff_to_ebook/][p0ody-files]] to link downloads. It's the fastest, cleanest fanfiction download solution we could find.

**** It actually does - it's all in the EPUB metadata, I believe, like it should be. I can see descriptions for every fic I've downloaded through p0ody in my EPUB viewers.

Warnings: fluffy spankings Not bdsm *Creature fic, dominant Draco, submissive Harry*

  Sequel to Resonance and Revolution. Harry enters his second year as an Auror Apprentice. Snape's wedding looms, and Harry's odd new powers mature, creating mayhem, perilous temptations, and opportunities to gain real wisdom.
