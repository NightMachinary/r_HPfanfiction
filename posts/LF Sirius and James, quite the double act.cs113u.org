'Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James Potter!

'you'd have thought Black and Potter were brothers'

'inseperable!'

'both very bright of course - exceptionally bright in fact'

'the cleverest students in the school'

The entire Elvendork prequel, basically. But I cannot quote all of that. Gimme some Sirius and James being inseperable brothers and acting as a very awesome and iconic duo to have even Madam Rosmerta remember them and laugh fondly at their memory amid the thousands of students that come and go. And Flitwick and McGonagall remembering their friendship. A Sirius who runs away from Grimmauld Place and James takes him in with open arms. Someone Sirius would go unhinged over the death of, basically.

No Sirius/James but other ships are ok.


** Linkffn(the bet by auntleona0). This is mostly a story about L/J but their friendship, and especially the importance of it to them both, is an undercurrent.

Same author, one-shot: linkffn(and down they tumbled by auntleona0)

Linkao3(runaway by draconunquamdormiens). Part I of a series of stories all set in the same AU, and all of which seem unfortunately to be abandoned. The premise is that James and Sirius share a mental connection and were friends from birth. Also, the Blacks are in league with Voldemort. Angsty and borderline goofy in equal measure.

(At the risk of violating Rule 9: You have no idea how much it pisses me off there aren't obvious answers to this prompt. James plays second fiddle to the relationship between dumb!Sirius and sensible!Moony in everything, and it's the scourge of Marauder fanfic.)

  What Sirius told Harry about running away from home left a lot out. Here we find out what happened when he ran, why he ran, and the things that developed after. This is an AU fic, originally posted on FanFiction, ongoing and revised. Read, enjoy, comment. No Slash, angsty and dark.

  A hasty decision and a bet they never should have agreed to result in James and Lily spending a lot more time together in October of their 7th year than they ever anticipated. A story of growing up, identity, and falling in love.

  James celebrates Christmas by drugging himself on powdered thestral-hoof (as a joke), Remus visits Madagascar (it's sunny and it brings out his freckles), Peter takes up smoking (and quits), and Sirius flat-out refuses to read Nature's Nobility ever again (he would also like to make it clear that he detests the Christmas decorations in Grimmauld Place).  This version of events takes place from Dec 1975 to April 1976. There were some animals hurt in the telling of this story, but the boys would like to ensure you that the Giant Squid isn't one of them.

** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8252775/1/SiriusandJames]])

This one is my favorite. I love the dynamic of Sirius and James from other people's perspectives, the only thing is it's fairly short.

Also this is my first time trying to link a fic so if it doesn't work, here's the full link: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8252775/1/SiriusandJames]]

  When Sirius ran away from home he went to live with the Potters, but before he made it there he wound up lost, alone, and hurt in Muggle London. With James out of the country, Peter stuck at home, and Remus trapped by the full moon, it's Lily Evans (who hates his guts) that Sirius is forced to turn to for shelter and more advice than he could have bargained for.
