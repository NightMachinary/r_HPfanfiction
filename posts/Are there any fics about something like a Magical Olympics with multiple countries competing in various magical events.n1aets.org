**** Off the top of my head I can think of the Pureblood Pretence series linkffn(Pureblood Pretence) which has 9 students from around the world competing and I have just finished reading linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern) which has still just the three schools but more tasks including duels and broom racing.
