Anyone else miss the old Harry Potter Fanfiction Archive website? That was probably for the first website I ever used and it took me a while to get used to the search and finding fics but hey it worked. I just visited it again after years and man I miss that old website. Does anyone else? Has there been any major fanfic website changes you've disliked through the years?
