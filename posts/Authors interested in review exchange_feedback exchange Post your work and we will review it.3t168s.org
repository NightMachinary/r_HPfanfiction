** Here's my [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/][author profile]], I'd love feedback on any of my writing really. I have a DH from Ginny's POV work in progress fic, a Luna/Rolf one-shot I'm considering expanding in the future, a Lily/James family one-shot and the prologue to a short Sirius-centric fic about the days surrounding the Potter's death.

I love reviewing and helping people, so send me anything - I'll be honest that I drastically prefer canon stories, but I like OCs too.

**** I can read non-canon fics, I just don't enjoy them as much! More than happy to read some of your stuff later - I'm about to go out right now.

** Here's my WIP, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11506688/1/Captive][Captive]]. It's a Dramione warfic, and it is definitely on the darker side of fanfic so if explicit violence isn't for you I'd maybe tread lightly. But if the slowest of burns is your thing then this is it.

As far as what I'll read: I can get behind most ships, espically if it is done well. However, I won't do any Snape shipping or any adult/child relationships. I'll leave light reviews and PM you with any major critique ^ _ ^

** u/Co-miNb:
#+begin_quote
  I'll review every chapter of whatever I read.
#+end_quote

I don't understand people reviewing every chapter of something if they're reading it when multiple chapters have been released. It just looks like spamming to raise review-count at that point.

Unless there's something important to correct or inquire about in a specific chapter that is not the most recent one, just leave a single review in the most up-to-date chapter that summarizes your thoughts and says all you feel you need to say.

**** That's why I did allow for "something important or... [chapter] specific". But what I was mostly referring to as irritating was precisely that "it was great" review, posted for each chapter by a new reader. It just seems to be spamming to boost review count and I honestly wouldn't put it past some people to make short chapters and throwaway accounts for precisely that purpose.
