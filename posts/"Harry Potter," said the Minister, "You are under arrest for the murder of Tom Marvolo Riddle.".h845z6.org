*** Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

Today we will prove to you that Mr Potter carefully planned and ruthlessly executed the murder of Tom Riddle.

The defense will allege that Mr Potter is the victim here. That it was the deceased who used the killing curse. That the defendant simply stood there, waiting for his death, while the curse... backfired.

Expeliarmus is not a defense against the killing curse, ladies and gentlemen. So why would Mr Potter bother to cast it, when he could have gotten out of the way instead? Maybe the defense will suggest that The Boy Who Live, Triwizard Champion, panicked. No, He did not. He knew exactly what he was doing.

We will prove to you beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Potter knew Tom Riddle's curse would backfire. That he had planned the whole situation. His co-conspirator, Albus Dumbledore, ensured Mr Malfoy was the real owner of the Elder wand. Then Mr Potter systematically destroyed all life-preservation artifacts owned by Mr Riddle. Goaded Mr Riddle into attacking him at the grounds of Hogwards. And they simply enjoyed the curse backfiring.

This is not self-defense, ladies and gentlemen. No plan spanning years could even be considered self-defense. No. It was plain and simple murder.

**** The defence would like to point out that the very act of Mr Riddle casting the killing curse makes it self-defence. Even if these actions were planned out in advance one certainly couldn't blame Mr Potter for his foresight, after all, the deceased was well known for their tendency to... well, murder people.

And concerning these so called life-preservation artefacts, well it is important to note that in order to create each one of these seven artefacts, one of which was Mr P. himself, Mr R. performed (unspeakable and horrendous acts). That is, he did this once for each of the seven artefacts, for a total of seven times.

One might wonder how Mr P. managed to remove the artefact attached to his person? Well, prior to his death Mr R. cast a Killing Curse at Mr P., the intent of which was to kill Mr P., but instead in a twist of karmic fate instead removed the artefact.

This sets a clear precedent for Mr Riddle's attack on Mr P. and shows that it was clearly un-provoked, and entirely his own doing.

***** Objection! M'learned friend for the defence has, by these accusations against the deceased Mr. Riddle, quite clearly raised the issue of character: if the court will be so good as to recognise that fact, the defendant's extensive criminal record - underage sorcery, aiding and abetting fugitives from justice, criminal damage, participation in necromantic rituals, use of unforgiveable curses, and bank robbery, to name only the more egregious items - can be read to the jury.

****** Of course, there are many accusations levelled against both parties, but Mr P. has been acquitted of his underage sorcery charge due to his need to defend himself, as the record will show. He has admitted to the bank robbery and has already made reparations with the goblins. Mr P. has never been charged with these other crimes; aiding and abetting fugitives from justice, participation in necromantic rituals (meta: what's this one?), and the use of unforgiveable curses.

And while the defence only brought up Mr Riddle's history in respect to his homicidal tendencies, especially regarding Mr P., and not his character, we might gladly include a list of the other crimes he has been proven guilty of including, terrorism, arson, burglary, theft, at least 18 counts of murder, over a hundred counts of conspiracy to commit murder, providing refuge to fugitives of justice, breaking prisoners out of Azkaban, multiple counts each of using the unforgivable curses, the use of hundreds of spells classified as dark magic, and the use of multiple necromantic arts.

******* [after the criminal histories have been read]

Now that this business is concluded, I have to address an earlier statement of my colleague. The defense was arguing that the mere act of casting the killing curse makes it self-defense.

However, my colleague themself also reminded us that this was not the first time the killing curse had been used against him. No, we are aware of three. And that's only what's been made public. Perhaps there have been more? Perhaps Mr. P and his friends, known for using unforgivables, have even practiced them against each other?

Doesn't matter either way. The point is, ladies and gentlemen, the killing curse doesn't KILL Mr. P, now does it? And after the events from 1981, Mr Riddle was surely aware.

Did Mr Potter somehow forget this minor detail, that he had to defend himself?

On the matter of self defence, multiple witnesses have stated that Mr P. has, in the past, been struck by the so-called killing curse and yet lives. Considering the lack of harm this curse has done him, and Mr P.s awareness of this fact, what was he trying to defend against when he did murder Mr. R.?

But the truth is that the Magical community remains on the brink of civil war. People are calling for justice. We have to have a trial, at least.”
