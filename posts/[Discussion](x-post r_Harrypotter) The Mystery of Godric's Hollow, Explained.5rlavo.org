Hey everyone, I was trying my hand at writing my own fanfiction, when I ran into an issue, specifically, I was wondering why the hell James chose to make anyone but himself or Lily the Secret Keeper of Godric's Hollow.

I did a little research on the fidelius charm, and it turns out that the common explanation 'the Secret Keeper can't be protected by their secret' has no evidence behind it, and if anything, has evidence against it.

So I got to thinking, and came up with an idea which I think explains a great number of issues with the Harry Potter series, from why Harry has no access to family relics, to what the hell happened with the Potters (who were a rich and ancient family)

I posted my theory to [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]], and figured that I ought to cross-post it here so I can spread it around a bit.

Here's the link:

** You seem to be trying to find loopholes in canon using fanfiction cliches like the Potter Estate and Harry's trust vault.

In the books it says:

#+begin_quote
  He advised them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn't an easy person to hide from. Dumbledore told them that their best chance was the Fidelius Charm.
#+end_quote

It doesn't say that they moved house, and it could be assumed that they lived in Godric's Hollow before going into hiding. (The wiki is very unreliable). Even if they did move house, your theory doesn't really hold up. If they were already using the Fidelius charm on the "Potter Estate" then why would they need to move house? Surely they would be safe enough where they were.

Secondly, there is no evidence that the Potters are as rich as you think they are. They left Harry a vault full of coins. It doesn't say how much it is, and your idea that this was something done for every child has no evidence. The book says:

#+begin_quote
  "Don't worry about that," said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. "D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?"
#+end_quote

This implies that it was all inherited. And as for the relics (which there is no evidence that they even existed), they could easily been in the house in Godric's Hollow that was destroyed.

It's fine if you want to use your ideas in a fanfiction, but don't try to pretend there's evidence for them in the books.

*** My argument for the Potter Estate existing stems from the fact that the Potters from Harry's branch are at the bare minimum well-to-do, and over 800 years old.

The argument against the existence of the Potter Estate assumes that the Potters had no other homes and possessions aside from the one in Godric's Hollow. This despite the family being nearly 800 years old and, in the least charitable interpretation of my argument, at the very least recently rich (Fleamont Potter created the Sleekeazy hair potion and sold the company for 'a vast profit' upon retirement) and in decent standing in the Wizarding World (Henry Potter was a member of the Wizengamot). I find it difficult to believe that such an ancient family would have exactly one home in a quiet suburban town and nothing but a large pile of gold in their vault.

Now, I'm not claiming that the Potter Estate is some mythical castle with unicorns falling from trees and a dragon conservatory, nor am I claiming that they had a bunch of hidden magical knowledge and artifacts squirreled away in the 'Real Potter Vault' which Harry never gets access to.

What I am claiming is that this 800 year old, at least recently rich family, was not limited to a single house's worth of property and furniture, and that the absence of any mention of anything Harry inherited aside from a bunch of gold, seems to be a rather glaring omission.

Furthermore, my argument for the fidelius on this 'Potter Estate' would not only justify this omission, but also offers a better justification than the current accepted fanon for why James and Lily gave their secret to one of their friends, instead of keeping it themselves. I claim that my argument offers better justification for that mystery because the current accepted fanon either relies on equal or lesser circumstantial evidence in comparison to my argument, or boils down to 'Both James and Lily had unconditional trust for the other marauders, so much so that the thought of having either James or Lily keep the secret never crossed their minds'

**** The thing is though, your argument doesn't offer better justification. You're assuming a lot more:

- They own another property\\
- That property is also under the Fidelius charm\\
- They moved away from that place to Godric's Hollow (Why would they do that if they were already under a Fidelius charm)\\
- You can't be a secret keeper for two secrets at once

And you'd rather assume all of that instead of just saying you can't be your own secret keeper (which isn't contradicted in the books).

***** Actually, my theory is based on three primary arguments indirectly supported by the text, and all of them more strongly than the can't keep your own secret argument.

(1) My first argument is that you can't be the secret keeper for more than one secret at once

This argument is supported by the observation that the Weasleys had two secret keepers for their two fideliused locations.

(2) Second, Given the choice between absolute assurance of safety in exchange for isolation, and the near assurance of safety while being able to see James's closest friends, the Potters would choose the second over the first.

This argument, that James and Lily, given the choice, would choose near security and friendship over total security and isolation is supported in that we know that James was immensely loyal to his friends. His loyalty is shown in that he was almost a brother to Sirius (for example, when Sirius was having trouble with his family, the Potters invited him to stay with them). It is further supported in that James befriended Remus despite the latter's lycanthropy, showing that he is willing to experience danger in order to stay close to his friends.

(3) Third, that the Potters own another property is an argument I have already made, it ultimately boils down to the fact that the Potters are an old family who are rich and involved in politics, thus it seems likely to me that they should own more than just the property at Godric's Hollow (henceforth the Cottage).

(4) The observation that there is a lack of heirlooms passed from Harry's parents to their child, and a further lack of Potter family heirlooms is self evident. The only heirlooms passed on were ones not in the possession of the Potters at the time of their deaths, and numbered exactly 2 (the invisibility cloak and the marauders map).

(5) I argue that the lack of heirlooms from (4) is unusual because the Potter family has existed for a long time (which is explicitly stated on Pottermore and heavily implied in the stories) and a family that lasts a long time almost always acquires many items which the latest generation do not use. Given that the Potter family has over eight hundred years of heritage, even if /all/ of these items were in the Cottage at the time of the Potters' deaths, that not a single one of them survived the explosion (which, it is explicitly stated in the books, only damaged the 2nd floor of the house) to be made available to Harry seems unusual.

(6) That the Potter Estate is under a fidelius is a conclusion drawn from the assumption that the Potters own another property (3), and the observation that there is a mysterious lack of heirlooms passed from Harry's parents or extended family to their child (5).

(7) The conclusion that the Potters did not Keep the Secret of the Cottage because they were already Keeping the Secret of the Estate is supported by arguments (1,6)

While I initially argued that the Potters moved away from the Potter Estate to the Cottage due to information on the Harry Potter wiki which has no source, whether or not the Potters moved from the Estate to the Cottage or already lived in the Cottage is immaterial. Instead, I will argue that the Potters had the option of leaving behind their home in Godric's Hollow to escape to an alternate fideliused property, but chose to stay in Godric's Hollow despite that.

(8) We can conclude that given their inability to Keep the Secret of the Cottage (7) and their willingness to trust their friends (canon), James and Lily would then choose to make Peter Pettigrew their Secret Keeper

(9) The conclusion that the Potters had the option of escaping to the Potter Estate is drawn if we accept the argument which I have already made that the Potters own at least one other property and that it is fideliused (3,6).

(10) The conclusion that the Potters would choose to stay at the Cottage despite having the Potter Estate as an option is supported by the argument that James and Lily would choose good security and friendship over absolute security and isolation (2).

Therefore, using arguments 8,9,and 10 we can show that the Potters chose Pettigrew as their Secret Keeper because they could not keep the Secret of the Cottage themselves (8), and stayed at the Cottage in order to be able to see their friends despite the decreased security (10), while having the Potter Estate available as a backup (9).

Thus my theory is based on 3 arguments (1,2,3), all of which are indirectly supported by the text and the observation that Harry has very few heirlooms from his family.

As for my rebuttal: The argument that you can't be your own secret keeper not only has circumstantial evidence against it in the text, it is directly contradicted. The indirect evidence of the argument's incorrectness is shown when Bill and Fleur hide Shell Cottage, where Bill is the secret keeper. The argument is also directly contradicted by the secret of Grimmauld Place, as the exact text of the secret given to Harry is:

#+begin_quote
  The Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London.
#+end_quote

Given that both Dumbledore (who cast the charm) and Sirius Black (who owns the house) are both members of the Order of the Phoenix, this seems to be a direct contradiction to the argument that you can't keep your own secret, especially given that this secret was sufficient to hide the entire location of 12 Grimmauld Place from observation, exactly like how the cottage in Godric's Hollow is described as being hidden.

Thus I would argue that the Potter Estate theory has a better justification for James making Pettigrew his Secret Keeper because it is indirectly supported by the text, whereas the accepted fanon theory is directly contradicted by the text.

****** Sorry, you're wrong. Shell cottage is not said to be Bill and Fleur's (in the movie it's Muriel's) and Dumbledore is the secret keeper of Grimmauld place which belongs to Sirius.

The very fact that James and Lily weren't their own secret keeper could also be said to be evidence that you can't be your own secret keeper.

The problem I have with your theory is that none of your points have very strong evidence. It's still possible that Bill and Arthur would choose to both be secret keepers even if you can be secret keeper to more than one secret. It's possible that the Potters were an old family and only had one property. It's possible they didn't have very many heirlooms, or they were just left in Godric's Hollow because there was no one to take them.

I would say that it fits with canon rather than actually being supported by it. And it doesn't even do that that well. There are other problems with your theory. There is no reason for them to move to Godric's Hollow if they are already under the Fidelius. (Your point 2 makes no sense. They can still come over, they are not isolated). James and Lily are separate people. If they have two properties and can be their own secret keepers then why not one for each?

It's not a bad theory, and it could definitely have a place in a fanfic. But I don't think it's at all supported by the books. As Occam's razor says, the simpler explanation is usually better. In this case the simpler explanation is just that you can't be your own secret keeper.

******* I hate to necro this post, but I just can't let some of these arguments go unopposed.

First off, whether or not Shell Cottage belongs to Bill and Fleur is immaterial, because they are the ones protected by the Fidelius, thus being the ones who keep their own secret. If you could get around the 'you can't keep your own secret' clause you present as being part of the fidelius, *then why did James and Lily not try to get around it by moving to Sirius's flat?*

Second off, Dumbledore is the leader of the order of the phoenix, thus he is keeping his own secret when he makes the location of their headquarters a secret, in order to justify this, your argument must rest on the claim that the fidelius charm cares about property laws. I'm sorry, but that argument is /completely/ unsupported by the text, and sounds pretty damn absurd.

Finally, the evidence that James and Lily were not their own secret keepers supports both of our arguments equally, so it really shouldn't even be brought up as a justification.

For example, I could argue that James and Lily not being their own secret keepers is due to the restriction that the secret keeper of a fidelius charm can't have their first name start with a 'J' or an 'L', but to cite that as evidence for the 'no J or L' argument vs. the 'can't be your own secret keeper' argument is disingenuous.

As to arguing further for my theory, I'm just not going to bother, as it appears that you only skimmed through the theory I posted on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]], and I'm not going to re-defend every point without context as you bring it up, then re-re-defend every point as you skim through my defense of each point you bring up.

I also want to point out once more that while my theory has only weak support from the books, the 'can't keep your own secret' theory is /directly contradicted by the text/ unless you start pulling assumptions out of nowhere.

Finally, 'the simpler explanation is usually better' is merely the layman's interpretation of Occam's razor, the actual principle states that, "Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected."

Where Assumption is a specific technical term which means "an unsupported claim" such as my claim that 'you can't keep two secrets' vs the competing theory's claim that 'you can't keep your own secret'. (Note that to use the conclusion, James and Lily chose Pettigrew as their secret keeper b/c they could not keep their own secret, as evidence for either of these two claims would be circular reasoning)

So, unless you can give me some evidence from the text which is best explained by property law/who owns a house being relevant to the functioning of the fidelius /without using circular logic/, then it appears to me that the 'can't keep your own secret' argument has two unsupported claims/assumptions in comparison to the Missing Estate argument's single unsuported claim/assumption, and Occam's Razor works in favor of my argument as opposed to yours.

******** I'm glad you're not going to argue further, because it's obvious you're not listening to what I'm saying. The reason why I've been bringing up your points is because I have evidence against them or they don't make sense. You are not having to redefend your points, you are either coming up with new justification on the spot, or are just repeating the thing that I said doesn't work.

It does matter if Bill and Fleur own Shell Cottage because if they don't then they are not keeping their own secret. Just because the Potters could be secret keeper while living elsewhere doesn't mean they would want to. Dumbledore is not keeping his own secret, since the secret is the “headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix” which belongs to Sirius. You do not have any evidence against the opposing hypothesis, like you keep trying to claim you do.

Furthermore, you have more than one unsupported claim. In fact, most of your points are based on a lack of evidence. We don't see someone who is keeping two secrets, we never hear about the “Potter Estate”, there are no relics.

You also did not address the problems I have found. I don't see how you can claim that Occam's razor works in your favour, since you have multiple unsupported claims and evidence against your theory. There is a reason why the hypothesis currently used is that you can't keep your own secret. It is most likely right.

As of this moment, the evidence you'd used in the lined thread really doesn't work against it.

*** I don't think the property law logic in that post applies here, since we know that Godric's Hollow was not the Potters' primary home, but somewhere they moved to hide from Voldemort, thus the logic about them not being able to give the cottage to another person falls flat.

Also, this is the quote that the other OP cites as evidence for his theory that you must trust another person in order to use the fidelius:

#+begin_quote
  Professor Flitwick cleared his throat.

  “An immensely complex spell,” he said squeakily, “involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find --- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!”

  “So Black was the Potters' Secret-Keeper?” whispered Madam Rosmerta.

  “Naturally,” said Professor McGonagall. “James Potter told Dumbledore that Black would die rather than tell where they were, that Black was planning to go into hiding himself... and yet, Dumbledore remained worried. I remember him offering to be the Potters' Secret-Keeper himself.”
#+end_quote

[[/u/Taure]] claims that this quote 'fairly explicitly' rules out the possibility of being your own secret keeper, but does it? All Flitwick says in his quote is that the information is hidden inside the 'chosen person''s soul and is henceforth impossible to find unless voluntarily divulged. At no point does he actually say anything about trust being required, he merely give's James's justifications for making Black the Secret-Keeper. I think that this quote doesn't actually provide /any/ evidence to indicate that one can't be their own Secret-Keeper, and might even be argued as evidence against it because of Flitwick's choice of wording, since he almost explicitly avoids words like 'another' or referencing multiple people, when it seems like if the distinction between secret-giver and secret-keeper existed, this would be the place to mention it.

Furthermore, the entire post is speculation, just as my post is and is thus nothing but an alternate theory. Not that I have anything against that of course, since the poster is just trying to solve the problem presented by the fidelius. However, he essentially makes the argument that the Weasleys are able to hide at Aunt Muriel's properties, despite also protecting those properties via fidelius, on the basis that they don't technically own the properties. That strikes me as getting off on a technicality (which, as I said earlier, the Potters could also have easily exploited), and seems to me to be at the very least, unsatisfying for readers.

Furthermore, I have yet to see a consistent theory which explains the absence of pretty much any Potter Estate or heirlooms, and while Taure does a good job of offering an explanation for the fidelius plot hole, it's not a particularly strong one, nor does it explain the absence of the Potter Estate. For that, the best explanation we have seems to be that Dumbledore decided to act wildly out of character and steal it from a <11y/o boy.

And that is pretty much the gist of it, isn't it? Because this whole thing struck me as less of a debate about the Fidelius Charm and more you hanging onto it to have a reason to include “Potter Estate” in canon. I do understand that both theories are really just that, theories, but Taure at least posted only here and we all knew it was a theory whereas your attempt feels like something more ... hmm, let's say “ambitious” than that. There is also the fact that as far as I've seen up to now all the evidence you have that is not tautological relies on far-reaching interpretations and one even on something that simply isn't true. There simply isn't enough information that is canon to have anything more than theories, and as such if you feel like writing it as working in a certain way in your story then feel free to do it, but I think you should really stop for a moment and take a look at what and how you present as evidence if you want what you write to be applicable to more than just your story.

** not sure there's any evidence that potters would have an estate. the blacks lived in a townhouse, and it was the only black home available to the order. presumably if they can defend one place they could do it too more. chances are wizards have no interest in land, and probably don't have a real economy with how they treat gold. with the information jk released about his family you probably can't even work out if he's in a main branch of their line, or if they kept everything in one line to begin with.
