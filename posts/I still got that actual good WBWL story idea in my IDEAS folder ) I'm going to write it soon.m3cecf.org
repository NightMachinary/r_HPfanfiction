** Hey man, power to ya! You should link it when you get started, I love some good fluff and WBWL is always a yes. I look forward to reading what you put out, potter family dynamics are a fav of mine. It is always interesting to see how Harry's personality tuens out when he is raised by someone other than the Dursleys, as that forms a lot of his personality in canon.

Have you ever considered doing a WBWL fic from the prespective of a younger sibling in the house? I am a fan of the concept but haven't seen it done.
