I just finished Celebony's /Claustrophobia/, and I just have the most tingly, warm feeling in the world filling me up at the moment and NEED MORE!


** MY TIME TO SHINE. (Ginny is my favorite Weasley, although I do like Percy and Ron a lot. I love all of them, let's not lie. But Ginny features prominently in a few of these)

linkffn(In the House of the Quick and the Hungry) is so so so great. I love it. The first six chapters is Ginny reflecting on her brothers, little one shots as it is. Has a great first year view and then the next six chapters is the brother's POV's. Every single chapter has some really touching moments, the writing is IMO, fantastic and I must have reread this fic at least 5 times.

linkffn(Faintest, Slimmest, Wildest Chance) is two pronged. The rebuilding of H/G as well as the Weasley family after the war. Truly great moments between the family, sometimes I preferred it over the H/G plot. :)

linkffn(Seven Times Seven by Kerrymdb) is how the Weasley family came to be. Baby Molly and Arthur up until all the kids are grown up. The writing is not as sophisticated but it's such a sweet fic and the overarching plot was very interesting! 90% fluff, it's great.

By the same author linkffn(Elements of Family by Kerrymdb) is a great Percy fic. Gets me teary when I read it. :')

  Although Harry and Ginny both survived the war, each bears scars from their year apart. The end of a war and the death of a brother don't make for an easy romance, but as long as there is the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance... The Weasleys gained and lost a member in one night. Will they ever be whole again? Best Romance and Best Drama/Angst in the 2014 HP Fanfic Fan Poll Awards
