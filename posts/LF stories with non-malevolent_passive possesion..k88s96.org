I'm looking for fics where the protagonist is possessed by someone who isn't actively controlling them, but is a voice in their head, or an alternate personality type thing. I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12815044][Making Rent]] and I loved it. It's a yu-gi-oh crossover, but I'm looking for anything that includes the trope.


** Linkffn (the wizard and the lonely princess) The first book is complete, the second is abandoned. Harry, the titular princess and her evil counterpart look at each other's head and go "it's free real estate!"

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux). Its sequel is abandoned, but the first story has a satisfying ending on its own, in my opinion.

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
