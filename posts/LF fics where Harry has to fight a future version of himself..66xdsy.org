So far we have read many time travel fics. But almost all of them have been Harry either travelling back in time to correct things..and succeeding or Harry ending up in his younger body and fixing things. Or Harry bollixing things up and having to deal with far greater threats than Voldie.

But what if cannon Harry (4th year-7th year) had to fight with a twisted future Harry Potter has come back to past to 'correct' his mistakes. Only he believes that to fix things, he must either kill or make his younger self stronger by torturing him mentally and physically.

For those familiar with The Flash, you might have guessed that I got this idea from the Future Flash arc. :)

**** I have read this earlier. While a great idea, it doesn't exactly fit my idea. I was rather hoping for a story where we see canon Harry fighting a twisted version of himself from the future. This future Harry cares not for Voldemort but will not kill him either because he feels that his younger self only can do it, but needs to become stronger in order to that. But for Harry to become stronger, his older self feels that he needs to torture him mentally and physically. This kind of story where Harry is Voldie has kinda been done many times.

It's the first of its genre I've found. Do you have any other to recommend?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8770795/1/Harry-Dursley-and-The-Chronicles-of-the-King][Harry Dursley and the Chronicles of the King]] takes this to an almost ridiculous extreme starting around chapter 80 or so I think.
