*** What?! You can't tell people about the search bar!

How are people going to clog up the sub asking for the same stuff over and over again week after week if you let them know about the search bar?!

#+begin_quote
  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

** Well, if Harry/multi include MFF then I can't recommend Three to Backstep, but I'm doing it anyways.

For plain HP/DG you should try

Honour Thy Blood (TheBlacksResurgence)

The Pureblood Princess (TheEndless7)

Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts Redux (Clell65619)

Second Chances, Harry Potter and the Congregation of the Asp, and Harry Potter and the Horcrux Three (Zaxarus)

While writing this out I just realized how many of the stories I read are H/Multi

Also the linkffn bot is just a lot of work on a phone.
