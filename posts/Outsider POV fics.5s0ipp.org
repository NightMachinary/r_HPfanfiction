These are almost invariably one-shots, but I love fics in which the POV character is mostly unaware of what's going on, but readers know. They always provide interesting perspectives on the universe.

My favorite for HP is linkao3(971643) and its two sequels. And the beginning chapters of linkffn(seeing ghosts by story please). Tell me about yours.

  AU. The best place to start is at the beginning, and Harry supposes it all began with the mysterious Professor H. J. Prewett. Years 1 through 7.

  Fred and George are so inseparable that most people say their names as some kind of a set. Fred&George. Twins, brothers, business partners. Then the War strikes and nothing is ever the same again. Just when George is finally coming to terms with all that has happened, can it be that Fred is back? Or is it just another loose end come back to haunt him?

** I don't know if romances are your thing. This is mine. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10841322/1/Dark-Birthright][Dark Birthright]] The Muggle OC is generally quite well informed but is missing one fairly crucial piece of information that the reader knows.
