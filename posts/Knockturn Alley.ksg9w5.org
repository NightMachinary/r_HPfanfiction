It seems like a poverty-stricken area that simply deals in less than legal wares, not some hub of evil. In the Well-Groomed Mind, they sum it up as the poor area, which the Ministry writes off as Dark so they don't have to deal with the fact that poverty and crime go hand and hand. What do you think about Knockturn? It feels like it's never employed as a serious concept.


** Knocturn is clearly portrayed as the less affluent, less socially acceptable district. It's not hard to imagine that the majority of visitors would be squibs werewolves and other stigmatized groups.

so I'd think the ministry and general public have a view that their poor and/or criminals because their dark in a feedback loop of discrimination.

I think that knockturn may have began as segregated shopping/houseing where conditions gradually worsened as legal restrictions tightened.

The idea of knockturn as hub for an almost alternative magical community is rarely touched on in fic but would be interesting to explore.

*** I suspect Dark is actually just a label the ministry slaps on those they want to villainize. It would explain the inconsistency of the term.

** I always felt like it was the poor side of the Alley but also where people like Werewolves, Banshees and such could be without the necessary stigma they met elsewhere. Like, the reputation of Darkness/Evil probably came to be because your neighbour was not only a vampire but a poor one too.

I've read a very interesting fic not long ago in which TMR lived there among all sorts of people. Time travelling Harry gets a place there, too. And it really shows that it's not that dark, if you don't go looking for the supposed evils, you know? Because in the end, Harry is just living in an old/somewhat dirty place (which isn't really worse than Grimmauld Place) owned by an old banshee and works in a bookshop runned by a squib ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. It's really a realistic take of the society and the neighbourhood, I feel (and without being moralising or edgy or ruining the magical feel either).

I really crave some good look on other people in the magical society in such neighbourhood (because there must be others, too). And usually I only find fics centred on nobility, which, to be honest I don't care much about (especially when the main actors are Lord Malfoy and the old Longbottom matriarch).

Especially since, in my head canon, all the people without enough money or magic or something to go to Hogwarts probably live/work there.

(I can't believe that EVERYONE goes to Hogwart, there must be people who don't or can't go and are just as magical. Just to take the exemple of Remus: a lot of other people must have been in the same situation and didn't get the special invitation from the headmaster, you know? Or, people like the Weasleys: there must be some who are too proud or a little bit more in difficulty and can't really go, etc, etc.).

You're right.

  ‚ÄòAttendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,' he replied. ‚ÄòThat was announced yesterday. It's a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred.

That's Remus in chapter eleven of /Deathly Hallows/.

*** Honest thought, Grimmauld Place tells me that the worlds have more overlap than we might think. I mean would the Blacks really live smack dab in muggle London if it wasn't at least an average thing to do. I definitely agree about Hogwarts not being the only magical school. The school seems too small for that. Also, we know that people must have been prevented from going for things like lycanthropy.

**** One of my theories is that the Blacks owned that plot of land before London was truly London and they just kept living there to be stubborn.

But I also like that the worlds overlap more than we're lead to believe!

Harry accidentally starts the Zombie Apocalypse because he was ignorant of why the building hadn't been renovated for so long.

**** I believe they're talking about the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27745546][original version of this fic,]] but the author deleted it. They started rewriting it and they're uploading again. So, I guess some of what they described is spoilers because it hasn't been reposted yet?

** It certainly looks as though there's canon support for that idea. Borgin & Burkes is an antique and pawnshop. There's a store selling poisonous candles but for all we know, those could be fumigation "bug bombs" or some other legal purpose. Hagrid buys slug repellent there. And a street vendor sells human fingernails (though the very nature of a street vendor is that they're temporary). The films added a few shops: The Coffin House, Toxic Tapers (probably the poisonous candle shop from the books), Mulpepper's Apothecary, and The Starry Prophesier.

So that's a pawnshop, a funeral home, an apothecary, a poisonous candle shop, a gardening supply, and something unknown (rival newspaper? Fortuneteller?). That sounds more "poor and therefore crime ridden" than evil to me. At least two of those are essential, if perhaps distasteful, to society. We see Lucius, Hagrid, and Hepzibah Smith in there, too, so obviously it's not automatically and publicly evil.

** Honestly, I like the idea that Diagon is just one of many streets in the magical quarters. And the whole area around Knockturn is like one of the harsher areas of New York or Chicago when the Mafia was big there.

** Knockturn always seemed to be the black market district, flea markets, knock off stores and the like being mixed in one. It's a lot less regulated and probably caters to a larger market. You'd probably lose your wallet to a pick pocket or get mugged if you walk into the wrong back alley. Probably has things you need, but isn't where you'd want to go when you need to keep an eye on an excitable child. Also since it's not as popular amongst wizards and witches, it's frequented by other beings like Vampires, hags and werewolves, whom you definitely wouldn't want your kids around.

It's not alone in that respect.

Anyway, I don't know about /poverty/. What is the rationale there? We don't see beggars or the likes. There is the hag peddling stuff, but that doesn't imply poverty, just shadieness. Conversely, the wandless begging in DH are in Diagon.

It pretty obviously is a place to buy more questionable stuff, as both evidenced by the items Borgin sells (and buys), and by the Twin's reactions to it. Depending on your definition of "evil" it is that, then, or it isn't. What's more relevant is that in-story you need a plausible way to hide the shady stuff, because if everyone knows shit goes down there, the Ministry could just place all their Aurors there, and collect the delinquents in an afternoon. I was never convinced by "the Ministry just writes it off". It's the opposite of what their express purpose is; Aurors are Dark Wizard catchers, if you have an Alley full of them, they are going to be happy it's that easy, not avoid it because it's too much of a hassle.

So if Borgin displays cursed necklaces, those items can't be illegal. And on the other hand, the poisons he buys, which /are/ illegal (since that is why Malfoy gets rid of them) can't be on display, which means in conclusion there's an effective mechanism for under-the-counter sales; in a world where Polyjuice and various other disguises and tricking magics are a thing.

And in that sense, I don't mind Knockturn being "evil". If you can buy everything from Muggle-baiting-items to a hit job there, it's fine, as long as it happens in a way that the Ministry can't get rid off, or they would have.

*** That's just how it's defined it the well-groomed mind. However, if it's where the werewolves and other similar creatures live, it's most certainly a poor area. Additionally, you tend to see higher rates of crime in poorer areas, so if we're going to make it a higher crime area, which it's implied to be, the evidence is there. The Ministry does have a tendency to avoid their problems. So it's at least plausible that they'd ignore Knockturn. But I think there is one thing that proves Knockturn is cooler than Diagon. Knockturn is a cooler name

** It has Borgin & Burke's, a pawn shop, and a gardening(?) Store where Hagrid buys some magical remedy to save his pumpkin patch? So probably a normal street with stores that can't afford the better street. I think hags hung around there as well? Probably the wizarding folk that isn't privileged pure blood folk looking for short jobs?

Maybe a few hookers or dealers outside that won't bother you if you don't bother them?

Basically a normal street where the least wealthy gather and also try to live their life.
