:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fic once about i believe Sirius having a daughter, she gets adopted by muggles who live near privet drive and becomes Harry's friend and i believe that house Black finds out and tries to educate them? I can't seem to find the fic if anyone knows it's name I'd love if you could tell me.

** I haven't actually read this, so I don't know whether it fits in any aspect other than 'sirius has a daughter who lives near harry', but maybe this? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9322278/1/]]
