I'm currently fascinated by this set of scenes and would love fics that explore this part of the story, or offer slice of life OOTP chapters. Humor or angst or adventure or mystery - whatever. I'd prefer stories that have Harry as a character . Thanks.


** I've been immersed in Summer of the Phoenix recently. Rather old but completed, and is a 'missing scene' fic bridging GoF and OOTP from Sirius' perspective. Unfortunately, no Harry but he is referenced. It's about life at grimmauld place as the order reassembles.
