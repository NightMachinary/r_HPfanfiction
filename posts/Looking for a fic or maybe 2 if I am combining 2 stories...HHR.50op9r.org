OK, bits I remember. I think they are from the same story but possibly not.

1. Harry and pals (Hermione, Luna, Neville?) use a car on the Hogwart's Express that is for Harry's use only. May be an heir of the founders thing? Malfoy and others knock or try to use it but are unable to do so. EDIT - found this one. linkffn(Angry Harry and the Seven by Sinyk); it is actually a Harry/Daphne pairing

2. Harry and Hermione have their own quarters and look after all bullied kids; Harry is able to work with Hogwarts to make things happen; H/Hr have extra rooms in their quarters for their friends to stay when needed. Again, this is probably a Harry is an heir of the founder's thing OR a "Hogwarts wants Harry as headmaster" thing.


** I'm fairly certain that I've read the story with the private car, and it wasn't the same as the one with point 2. Sadly, I can't remember the name off the top of my head, but it was pretty shit if I remember correctly.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
