I know of [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection]], book 5 through Luna's eyes, and linkffn(Not From Others), Book 7 through Ginny's. (Maybe more, it's been a while since I've read either of them) Are there other fics like this?


** I love a good "books through Lupin's eyes" fic, like linkao3(Remus Lupin and the Prisoner of Azkaban)

linkffn(Calibration by The Divine Comedian) shows Remus training the Boggart before his lesson with the third years.

FloreatCastellum, who wrote Not From Others, has written several "the books through other characters' eyes" drabbles, such as [[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/post/186550527216/absolutely-loved-your-recent-remusharry-missing][the Hogwarts Express scene in PoA from Lupin's eyes]], [[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/post/185848257806/hey-have-you-imagined-remus-reaction-to-siriuss][Remus reacts to Sirius' death]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19788034][Ron after Harry's name comes out of the Goblet]], and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19820686][Ron waits in the stands during the Third Task]]. Her list of ficlets is [[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/LinksToFiclets][here]], but I think it's an incomplete list.

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus trains the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/981332][Before I Knew]] and its companion story, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2385353][This Is Where]], looks at the series from the POV of respectively Dean/Seamus and Lavender/Parvati. They're set up as a series of vignettes that look at canon events, and moments between canon events, from the perspective of Dean and Seamus for the first story, Pavati and Lavender for the second.

Fair warning; Both of these evenually involve same-sex relationships... but it's very tastefully done and not explicit.

linkao3(981332; 2385353)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9094981/1/To-Know-You-is-to-Love-You][To Know You Is To Love You]] retells the entire series from the POV of Ron and Hermione, but with a twist.

The premise is that Ron and Hermione, a few years after the Battle of Hogwarts, decide to try out couples councelling. In order for them to understand one another better, the councelling has them magically re-live their entire lives up until that point, but from each other's perspective. linkffn(9094981)

**** There are some flaws in the fic, but I think the good parts far outweigh the bad. :)

** Thanks for mentioning my fic NFO, I have a bunch more of canon from different points of view, but they tend to be one shots if you're interested? [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/1407286]]

For other fics I would also recommend linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince)

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.
