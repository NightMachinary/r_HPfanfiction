Hello everyone! I've finally come around and updated chapter 4 of my WIP!\\
I can't wait for some concrit, and opinions about my very first WIP.

If anyone is interested this fic is an AU that follows along with the trope of Sirius and Remus 'raising' Harry but there's a twist!\\
It's an alternative universe in which the small choices Sirius and Remus made affected their whole lives in different ways.\\
What if Remus and Sirius had girlfriends they were serious about just like James was?\\
What if they had more than just the Marauders in their lives?\\
How much can their different lives affect Harry?

If you're interested in this sort of story and you like Sirius and Remus, give my fic a chance!\\
I promise there's going to be parallel universe travelling, dealing with Voldemort and with parents and friends that are damaged and different.
