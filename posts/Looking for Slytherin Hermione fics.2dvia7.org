** Jeconais's [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/][Perfect Slytherins]] starting in second year. A couple hundred thousand words. Years 1-3 are complete, year 4 is WIP.

Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6671596/1/A-Necessary-Gift-A-Harry-Potter-Story][A Necessary Gift]] by cosette-aimee has her sorted there (though she doesn't really belong); 156k words, WIP, probably abandoned (last updated July 2013).

#+begin_quote
  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

Sigh... Reading through the first year, the author is having his avatars (Harry and Wednesday Addams) condescendingly school Hermione to fix her character's flaws; flaws which are, funnily enough, her fanon flaws, not her canon flaws (of which there are plenty).

I think I've seen it go a year without updating, then update, so I think it just updates very, very slowly.

All in all, both of these fics feature Hermione in Slytherin, but not a Slytherin Hermione. For one thing, the focus of the story is far, far away from Hermione's (mis)adventures in Slytherin. For another, rather than forcing Hermione to sink or swim and develop her viciousness, cunning, and ambitiousness, as in ACA, these fics immediately supply her with a no-strings-attached protector or three, who insulate her from all the adversity that she would experience in Slytherin, through which she could develop in an interesting direction.

***** Good point, but there's the letter of the request, and then there's the spirit.

There are, perhaps, hundreds of fics in which Hermione is actually a pureblood, or where Hermione gets resorted into Slytherin for some poorly contrived reason later in her Hogwarts career, where Hermione's sole purpose of existence is to get 'shipped with a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][Slytherin in Leather Pants]]. In most of the first kind, she has most of her personality, values, and even physical appearance rewritten; in the latter two kinds, she usually has no personality to speak of.

However, to someone who liked ACA, those fics would most likely be /worse/ than a fic that focuses on a Gryffindor Hermione as the lead protagonist who develops in a non-sidekick direction while staying in character.

Now, I know that the fics you linked don't have those exact unfortunate tropes, but the point stands, I think.

****** I suppose. I tend to respond with "letter of the request" and let others make their own decisions. Otherwise, this (relatively inactive) sub has the tendency to spiral into some form of the following:

*OP*: I've read V. Are there any other stories with X and Y and/or that ship Z?

*t-e*: /This/ story. Also /this/. /Here's/ another. (None are my favorites, but recommending something seems better than nothing at all.)

*person 1*: I didn't like them. They're nothing like V. Your taste in stories sucks.

*person 2*: Yeah, they totally suck. Go home, whitey.

...

[days go by]

*OP*: Are there any stories with A and B?

*t-e*: [crickets] (has stopped posting in the sub)

******* Fair enough. Please interpret my reply as a lament as to the dearth of good Slytherin Hermione fics (as opposed to fics with Hermione in Slytherin).

******** Noted in the spirit in which it was intended.

And I agree completely with your lament--I'd read the heck out of any more stories like ACA.

Another recent one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9821720/1/The-Stark-Effect][The Stark Effect]] by NexusNebulous, which seems to be going for a MadScientist!Hermione, though it's too soon to tell how good it will be: she just got Sorted.

What Should Have Been by Catherine or Cate Harry Potter u:08-07-2014 - Slytherin! Harry Potter, Neville Longbottom, Hermione Granger, Daphne Greengrass, Draco Malfoy - it's going to be the Famous Five not the Gryffindor Trio. So much better me thinks. Alternate Universe. HPDG
