  AU. Bitten by a Vampire the night Voldemort attacked, Harry Potter is believed dead. So what happens when Remus shows up at Hogwarts with a fifth year son bearing the lighting scar and the name of Lupin 14 years later?

  Harry, during one of his semi-regular tussles with the Dark Lord, is bitten by a vampire. He ...does not adjust that well.

** There is Corruption. Harry is a vampire (kind of) and I think it's a pretty interesting take on a creature fic. I will throw up a warning for the beginning though, it's a bit dark.

  Voldemort has captured Harry and for his own twisted reasons has chosen not to kill him outright. Revenge in the Dark Lord's mind requires a fate worse than death and Harry is about to find out what that is.
