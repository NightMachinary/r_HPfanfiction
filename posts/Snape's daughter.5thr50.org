Hi! I'm looking for a fic when Snape has a daughter. Her mother is dead or still alive, but Snape and the woman aren't married. It could be a compicated father-daughter story. Maybe the daughter is paired with Draco. Do you think this kind of fic exists? :D :D


** There is an absolutely marvellous, but sadly incomplete fic, linkffn(Keogh by ChelleyBean), in which Hermione is Snape's biological daughter. The very first chapter, in which Snape learns about the fact, is priceless (not that this fic has only this to recommend it).

**** From the look of it, it stops right after a variant of the Battle of Ministry, and right before a major new story arc (time travelling to young Riddle time), so it's not that bad that it stopped when it stopped, even though there is no clear resolution.

  An unexpected connection is found between Hermione and Professor Snape, but that's only the start of her headaches. Being her father's daughter is one thing. Being her mother's daughter is something else entirely.

*** After how they just kept Harry at the Dursleys and how Snape was still an asshole to Harry my SoD broke. I thought the only way to redeem it would have been for Harry to go Dark/evil because he's resentful b/c his sister is given everything he doesn't have. It was just so fucked up that Harry was forced to continue living in a shit situation but his sister wasn't.

  AU. Harry Potter was not the only one marked that fateful Halloween, and Severus Snape is given redemption in a form he least expected. When two children are Marked that night, three fates are intertwined to rewrite history. There are secrets long thought lost, however, secrets that might have the power the change everything. A Sibling!Addition AU beginning pre-PS and through DH.

Linkffn(Snape Not Lovegood)

Can't remember 100% if that's the right name of the tic, but if it's not google Callista Lovegood Snape and it should come up, it's a unique name.

  During the sorting of first years, Severus recalls a moment of weakness with Pandora Lovegood before her death. Callista Lovegood does not look like her third year sister, Luna... And neither does she look like her father, Xenophilius. Is Severus a father? And what is Severus going to do when he sees how Callista looks at Harry Potter?

** I can't remember the name. But there's a fiction in which Snape had a sister who was dead. Her sister had a daughter who was a year junior of Harry. Harry Potter left Dursley's around 8-9. And never got Hogwarts letter. As unknowingly he could do some kinda magic(he probably called it glitches) which blocked owl to find him.

On the other hand, Snape's niece somehow was left in her own she, Harry and another kid ended up living in a slum together. After she got Hogwarts letter, the camber of secret happened. I forgot whether she was petrified. Meanwhile Snape learnt she was her niece. And Dumbledore found out she lived with none other than Harry Potter. I forgot what happened next. Story probably abandoned.

Anyone recall the name?
