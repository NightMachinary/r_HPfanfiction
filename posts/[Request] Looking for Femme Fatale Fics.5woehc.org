Mainly Harry gets seduced by those, like Fleur. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4525701/1/The-French-Affair]] (unfortunetly not complete) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3060795/1/The-Master-Bedroom-of-Delacour-Manor]] (also not complete, as far as i know).

Im fine with other females who are "dangerous" and seduce him, but i prefer Fleur, because especially "Master Bedroom" shows that she uses her Veela Magic to get him (i guess especially Veela are good for it, because they dont have to poison their "VictiM" with Love Potion). And i also would like to have it Post Hogwarts. Also, if not Fleur, then maybe another unknown Veela or something.

Im curious if there are some that want to seduce Ron (again, Post Hogwarts, but not necessary married or coupled with Hermione)


** Not exactly what you were asking for, but I wrote this cause your post inspired me.

** linkffn(Silence Game by SilensCursor; Temptation Game by Silens Cursor; the Game is Afoot by Perspicacity). Actually, both of those authors have a penchant for the Noir, so give all their stories a try.

  The War is over. Harry and Ginny plan a life together, then Harry disappears without a trace. Eight years later, Ginny wants answers. And where does Daphne fit in? A Harry/Ginny/Daphne anti-romance.

  Su Li plays a subtle game of power - but Harry never plays to lose. Harry/Su Li, the first of its kind, and NOT appropriate for younger audiences.

  Temptation is a dangerous tool - one Harry Potter knows how to use to maximum effect. A shame unfinished business has to interfere. Oneshot sequel to 'Silence Game', NOT appropriate for younger audiences.
