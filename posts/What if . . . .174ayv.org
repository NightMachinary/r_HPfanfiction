/Draco/ were really the chosen one?

What kind of fanfiction would /that/ make?


** The kid would be /unbearable/. He's a brat as it is (I love him, but he's a brat) but if he'd grown up being told he was the Chosen One (and you know Lucius and Narcissa would have told him) his head would be too big for the Great Hall. He would use it to his advantage as much as he could. On the other hand, keeping in with this characterisation, I think this big-headedness would only last until he finally came face to face with Voldemort and realised "shit, this Chosen One business isn't all it's cracked up to be". He'd still be an arse and use his status for his own good, but he'd realise there's more to it than just being that famous kid.

That is, of course, assuming he grows up with his parents. If his story went the same as Harry's, then things would likely be different. I'm writing this as I think it so let's see where we end up. (Also, warning: this might get rambly. Ramblingly. Rambling. IDK, you catch my drift.)

So, prophecy puts Draco as potential defeater of Voldemort. Let's stick with Snape being the one who told Voldemort; let's also say that Snape learns that LV is going to go after the Malfoys. (It seems likely that LV would try and keep that info as quiet as possible because he'd realise that some of the DEs would warn Lucius, but for now we'll ignore that.) Okay, so Snape, who's (sort of) friends with Lucius (at least, I get that impression from the books), warns him that LV is coming after Draco.

So what happens next?

(1) Lucius pleads his case to LV, LV allows him and Narcissa to live but insists on killing Draco. From there there's another few options:

- L/N let Draco die (or are forced to stay away while it happens) and it precipitates the spiraling downfall of their marriage as they each blame one another. Alternately, the death of their son drives them to switch sides and Lucius becomes a spy for the Order of the Phoenix.

- L/N refuse to let LV kill Draco and the entire Malfoy family is killed.

- L/N refuse to let LV kill Draco; Lucius dies and Narcissa sacrifices herself the same as Lily did. Draco becomes the BWL.

- Lucius keeps LV occupied to give Narcissa time to take Draco and flee the country; Lucius dies

- L/N both take Draco and flee the country.

(2) The Malfoys go into hiding as the Potters did in canon. I think that their options for Secret Keeper at this point would be suddenly limited because going into hiding from LV makes them essentially traitors so all their pureblood friends are going to abandon them. Bellatrix is definitely not an option, given her loyalty to LV. I think Snape would be a possibility, depending on exactly how close he and Lucius are. I don't think they'd go to Dumbledore or the Order for help (although Snape might suggest it) because L/N's pride wouldn't let them. Betraying LV is bad enough; going to Dumbledore would be pouring salt in the wound.

--------------

Okay, from this point, we'll work with the idea that L/N die and Draco becomes the BWL. The hours following that would be crucial because if Bellatrix or any other loyal DE gets to baby Draco first, they might very well kill him for LV. Auntie Bella doesn't strike me as the kind of person to turn on her ideals just to take in a baby and raise him. So Snape gets there first (if he is not the SK that betrayed them) and takes Draco... much that I love Severitus and Dad!Snape fics, I can't see Canon-Snape as a father. I would certainly love to see a fic where this did happen, but for the purposes of this discussion, lets say he takes Draco to Dumbledore because he doesn't have a fucking clue what else to do and he knows lil Draco needs protecting from the other Death Eaters--

Actually, you know what, scratch what I said. If Snape took Draco then he'd need protecting as much as Draco, so maybe Dumbledore would convince Snape to take Draco and go into hiding. They go under Fidelius with... someone as SK (maybe even Lily; Snape would trust her probably more than anyone else right then) and Draco grows up under Snape's care. He'd know about being the BWL but perhaps wouldn't be as much as a self-absorbed prat as described in my first paragraph. Still full of himself though because /fuck you, I'm the BWL, and I have a shit tonne of money/.

The biggest issue at this point would be how he's raised to view blood purity. We all know Snape harbours dislike/anger/hatred towards Muggles/Muggleborns, but how is he supposed to explain that the very person who tried to purify the world for wizardkind is the same person who left Draco an orphan? It's possible that by the time Draco hits Hogwarts-age, he won't be a complete bigot. Maybe distrustful and disliking of Muggles, but a little more accepting of Muggleborns. (Especially if Lily is their SK; Snape might be able to justify to himself hating all Muggleborns except his friend, but I think a child wouldn't be so accepting of "we hate all Mudbloods, except that one".)

Hogwarts: Draco's still a Slytherin, and now life starts getting a bit tricky. Half of Slytherin are kids of people who (openly or otherwise) support LV. Some of these kids were probably raised being told "Draco Malfoy's the son of a traitors; he destroyed our Lord, he's the bad guy". He's going to have to deal with that, but I think he'd come through. He'd prove himself. /Yeah I'm the BWL, and yeah I want LV dead out of revenge, but I'm still Draco-fucking-Malfoy, a pureblood wizard of impeccable breeding and you'd all better remember it, bitches/.

As for the Harry-Draco dynamic... they would know each other if Lily's the SK for Snape and Draco. They might not be friends exactly, but they probably had playdates as kids. (Can't see Snape taking Draco to the Potters, but Lily definitely would have taken Harry round to their place.) Although the Sorting Hat might offer Harry Slytherin as in canon, I think James (and Sirius) would have made too much of an impression on Harry and he would still choose Gryffindor. Depending on how close Harry and Draco grew during their forced playdates, either Harry would still insist on being friends (with the subsequent backlash from Gryff and Slyth students; Ron would likely be outraged that a Gryff dares to be friends with a Slyth, and he wouldn't be the only one) or if they never really became friends, then the house difference could drive them to the point of mere acquaintances. They might not fight when their respective friends started throwing insults, but they wouldn't stand up for each other either, although this could eventually progress to the point of being canon-style enemies.

Okay, I've probably rambled for long enough. Hopefully no one minds. I look forward to seeing what other people think!

*** okay i know stupid to reply to just one point but --- Secret Keeper for in hiding L/N & baby Draco = Andromeda Tonks. i mean, right? would take a bit of reworking but i could see Dromeda being killed & secret revealed by Bellatrix and L/N being slain and Draco being a bit of a shit growing up with Nymphadora &Ted, pariah of the pureblood world, despite the immaculate and careful breeding. who else would take that risk for The Malfoys? Blood, that's who. all the sister angst! almost a bit more exciting than friendship betrayer, with all that Noble House of Black going on. but i'm a bit biased. so i can't say. although if they chose Andromeda as their Secret Keeper, they might not even die. she's a much better choice than Peter Pettigrew! i mean c'mon everyone could see that THAT guy was a bad choice from the start.

i kind of like this idea. although that leaves Draco's ideas about blood purity wide open. if:

a) Andromeda lives but the secret is revealed some other way - torture, threat on Nymphadora's life, whatever, Draco would be raised totally aware of where he comes from and the blood in his veins, but doubt it would make him hate people like Ted, or his cousin Nymphadora. At best (and worst) it would make him super conflicted about his maniacal fascist aunt Bellatrix, his basically-eloping-burning-all-the-bridges aunt Andromeda and his ridiculously middle of the road Mother, and how it relates to this world he must now face as BWL. This is the kind of stuff good fics are made out of.

b) Andromeda and L&N are killed by Bellatrix (i like her as this hypothetical villain) and Draco lives with just Ted & Tonks, I doubt he would know anything about anything at all. Sure, Ted would try and tell him about his mother, and his aunt, but not like Dromeda could. he'd be fumbling around like Harry did, getting half truths and surprises out of every corner, until Hogwarts, when Snape could tell him more...solid things.

i haven't thought past that though, so yeah, Andromeda for SecretKeeper!

**** I did, in the process of my writing, consider Andromeda as Secret Keeper but I had doubts that L/N would choose her because of the Black family considering her a traitor. So in my head I couldn't think of a way it would work because my personal headcanon says Andromeda hasn't spoken to her sisters since she was disowned, and L/N always struck me as so damn prideful that even with LV after them they'd be reluctant to go to a blood traitor for help. But I like your theories and I certainly enjoy seeing other people's thoughts on this topic!

***** Lucius might be too prideful, but I don't think Narcissa would be, especially if Draco's safety is on the line, and considering they would be blood traitors too. But who knows, it could go either way! I like your ideas!

**** Ha, that's a far bigger project than I'm willing to take up right now. I'm currently in the middle of over-hauling my 160,000 word fic as it is (it's a terrible thing to get so far and then realise you've got a fucking great big plot hole that needs a total rewrite to fix), but I would certainly love to see someone else take it up. This here is literally just my thoughts when I first read the question. I'll probably never take it any further than this.
