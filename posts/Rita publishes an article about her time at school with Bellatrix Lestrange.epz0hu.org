In the main sub, there's a post about how these two were born in the same year and must have gone to Hogwarts together. I would love a fic where Rita writes about her impression of Bellatrix, in typical Rita fashion, of course.


** I always thought that after the war, Rita would decide to focus on the Death Eaters & associates and do the same thing she did to Harry & co.

The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black probably has a lot of sordid secrets and Rita's gonna let everybody know

I actually am inspired to incorporate this idea into something now

** Bellatrix and Rita started dating in 6th year.

So, a) Bellatrix parents forced her to marry a male.

b) they tortured her in order to "put her right"

or, c) they somehow threatened Rita into breaking it up.

*** Rita would then write a trashy tell all after the war called “In the arms of a Death Eater” or some such

*** lol. This is too funny. I didn't mean it that way, but that's still amusing. Maybe I should have phrased the title differently.

**** Nah. You phrased it correctly.

I was just thinking of them being rivals in Slytherin, and, eventually, being the most talented, pretty, smart (etc, etc... it /is/ from Rita's pov) witches it's only natural they became a couple...
