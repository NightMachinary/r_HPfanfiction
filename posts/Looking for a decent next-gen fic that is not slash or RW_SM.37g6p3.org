Hi, as we all know by now the next-gen fic section is either filled to the brim with RW/SM or slash. It's becoming a chore to dredge through all the trash to find a decent fic to read.

I have already read Hogwart's House Divided, are there any other good next-gen fics?

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=325749][Clash by shez]] is reasonably good. Not as good as, and /completely/ different story-wise, than Hogwarts Houses Divided though. Clash and Hogwarts Houses Divided are the only two next-gen fics I've ever liked, so if you've found any other good ones please share. Summary below.

  Albus and Rose, brilliant but opposing minds. He is cold, cruel, and nothing like his father. All she wants is to save her brother. War looms, magic consumes, and lines between right and wrong blur as they egg each other down a path no wizard has dared to go before. This time, it's not just about saving the world. First you have to survive it.

*** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=262950][Breaking the Quidditch Code]], which has a sequel, that has just been finished. James II/OC

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=314084][Hormones]], by the same author. Fred II/OC

theres also [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=240987][Delicate]] which was really really good when I read it 4/5 years ago. basically what got me into FF. RW/SM, which i guess doesn't fit OPs criteria

*** I have heard about this one. I am not really fond of apocalyptic fics but I guess Ill give this one a try. The premise does sound interesting.

** Genre preference? Are you looking for something canon-esque? I know a lot of slice-of-life gen and shorter fics. And Clash is A+

** A good one is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8255131/1/Ignite][Stygian trilogy]]. Does have some RW/SM but it's not gratuitous and it makes sense in the story.

+1 for Questions and Answers, absolutely one of my favourite fics of all time. +1 for Hogwarts Houses Divided as well.
