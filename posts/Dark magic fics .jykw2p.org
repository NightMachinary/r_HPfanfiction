Can yall rec me some fics for harry getting into some dark magic ??? I don't mind him being evil but pls no het major paring that's all lmao


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][Evitative]] focuses on dark magic, and dark magic also plays a pretty big part in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20719073/chapters/49221263][In Willing Sacrifice]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456][Antithesis]]. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5103614/chapters/11740079][The Art of Self-Fashioning]] isn't technically about dark magic, but it is about Harry secretly doing dangerous magic, so it has a very similar feel.

*** The only thing that comes to mind is that fic where Harry and Tom keep being reborn into different lives and they regain their memories every time they meet eyes. Sometimes both are girls, sometimes both are boys, sometimes one of them is one gender while the other is the other, sometimes they're siblings or mother/father and daughter/son, sometimes one is way older than the other, sometimes they get married and have families, sometimes they're from different countries or whatever, sometimes they're in the future or the past, sometimes they're Muggles, and sometimes they're witches/wizards. The fic basically goes over these moments where they relive their first life and Harry and Voldemort. Dumbledore's reaction to Voldemort's "son" dating Harry is hilarious.

A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. Story is high on Political intrigue.

  Lillian Potter, the Girl-Who-Lived. For years she suffered in her uncle's home. Physically, mentally, sexually. Her pleas for rescue were left unheard and with that, the last flicker of light in her was snuffed out. For her, there was only one thing left to do: await the Dark Lords return. /GoF TWT Finale/ fem!Harry/RiddleJr. / evil!fem!Harry / Warnings in AN / Rating: MA

Linkffn(5402147) is a favourite to reread.

Linkffn(8195669) is more Hogwarts based.

Linkffn(4924413) is enthralling. Utterly enthralling.

  COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

  He was a genius. He could paint, play music, talk to snakes, control fire. He was more powerful and intelligent then any knew. He had strong 'friends'. The problem was, he had few emotions. Dark Harry. I Do Not Own Harry Potter. -Slash-
