** I like how a guy sporting "masturbation is sin" as their username is looking for porn.

** Kinky, but:

Isn't that a) about the last thing Harry needs (seriously, Harry is broken - he himself doesn't want to admit it (and look for a therapist!), but that's why he so easily defaults to self-sacrifice when he truly shouldn't and also why he values his own life less than the lives of other people - and he doesn't need someone else overriding his own will constantly!) and b) unlikely to work? I mean we've seen that Harry is pretty resistant to mind-control magics (imperius curse and even the veela-aura (to an extent...he doesn't turn into a fool around Fleur, but him being immune was fanon, right?))...hell, didn't they try love-potions on Harry in canon? I seem to vaguely remember some love-potion infused candies....

*** I'm not saying it's the most realistic or best plot, I just happened to enjoy it and wanted to find it again.

Very valid criticisms btw, you should write a fic. I'd love to read it

**** Maybe ;) - The thing is that I kind if dislike hurting my MCs or throw too much problems their way and so stuff that I write would probably be boring to read -.-
