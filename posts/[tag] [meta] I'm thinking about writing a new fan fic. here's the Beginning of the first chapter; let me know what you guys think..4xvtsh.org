A flash, black with streams of emerald green. You can see it reflected in his eyes. But not his son's; his son's were that same green color as the light.

So yes, a bright green light, a streak, it sucks the light out from the room and leaves death where it has has been. He is standing in its path. His cry dies in his mouth. It does not pass through her lips. And alongside his tear, that one that moves down his cheek, comes first a drop of blood and then another, a stream. His eyes don't move. Their life is gone. His son just sucks his thumb.

You all know what happens next. The curse bounces back. Voldemort shrieks. His phantom spirit flees the scene. For some time he goes unseen and those that don't know any better think that he's gone, although we know that he is not.

That version of events is true enough, I suppose. But it was not a shriek. That was not the noise that Voldemort made. Voldemort was not scared. He was not afraid. He might have been in pain but I doubt that he would have cared even if he was. You see what Voldemort valued above all else was knowledge and comprehension.

Do you know what it takes to be a dark lord? A dark lord in not some simple minded idiot that happens to have the most ‘magical power'. That's nonsense. That's not how magic works. Magic is a science. Not merely a science but a whole field of sciences and philosophies. Only the most brilliant and the most original magical thinkers would dare to call themselves a dark lord.

But Voldemort wasn't just any old dark lord. No. Though he stood on the shoulders of the giants (both light and dark) that had come before him there is no denying that Voldemort was the greatest Dark Lord to ever live. Some might even say that he was the greatest wizard to ever live. Of course those who say that are wrong. Albus Dumbledore was and is the greatest wizard to live. However, what there is no denying is that Voldemort and Dumbledore were in a league of their own. Their grasp of the magical sciences were unlike anything that the magical world had seen up until that time. It was if thousands of years of magical research, all the magical experimentation since Headmaster Francis Bacon first brought the scientific method to Hogwarts, had lead up to these two geniuses and to the magics that they would each produce.

If not for the horror that came with them then the whole magical world would wait on Voldemort's latest discoveries the same way they had once waited on those of a young Albus Dumbledore.

There is of course a reason that I tell you all of this. I tell you all of this so that you will understand that when the curse bounced back and when Voldemort screamed it was not out of shock nor out of pain. As the phantom crack of his soul split off from his body Voldemort only laughed. Voldemort loved to learn new things and boy had he just learnt something new.

So even as a fled, a phantom without a body carried in the wind, he considered the night as whole to be a great success. There was that whole disembodiment thing of course but knowledge has a price and his body was a small one to pay. He knew what he must do next. He knew what he must learn. If he was correct then James Potter had proven something that Voldemort had attempted to prove a thousand times and failed. James had proven that intent is not only a part of magic, James proved that magic is intent; or at least he had provided an experimental means of testing that hypothesis. He would remember what James had done and would make sure that James one day received the credit that he was due.

That old half-senile fumble-dork wouldn't stand a chance. He just hoped that Dumbledore didn't die too soon. Voldemort was hoping that he would get the chance to kill the old man himself. His plan would take some time. He would need at least ten years to put everything in place. He would have to tell Severus to keep that senile medaling old fool healthy.

Yes. Perhaps he would have him apply for the potions position. Only Severus could be allowed to know his whole plan. Severus: his most loyal servant. Voldemort now realized how wise he had been to spare the girl.

Severus was somewhat of a prodigy. He had within himself the makings of a great dark lord. Yes, Severus would one day be a great dark wizard. And now Voldemort knew that he had the man's undying loyalty.

Now readers, it will be some time before you realize the genius of what Voldemort had done that night. I will tell you though that there were some players that Voldemort failed to account for.

Unlike our disembodied dark lord, the boy with the lightning bolt scar wasn't having a good night. He cried in his uncle Remus's arm while his brother, the one with deadly hallows scar on his forehead was rocked back and forth in the arms of his godfather. Sirius sang to Nate but his eyes were on Lilly.

James' body was sprawled before the fire place.

Lilly's had been looking at James's dead body for an hour now. She hardly blinked and her eyes had little life. They were nearly as dead as those of her husband though they shined in the same bright green color as her son's.

There was a ring, the chime of a bell. Sirius went outside to take down the concealing charms and then there were lights. The green of the killing curse flashed in the window.

Remus began, “stay with the children”, but Lilly was already out the door. More lights, brighter this time, far brighter; though they were never green. After a moment or two the lights died down.

Remus keeps the twins behind him. To his surprise Lilly and Sirius' bodies are gently levitated in through the door. Dumbledore walks in behind them, his robes are a deep purple, appropriate for the somber yet joyous occasion.

“Remus” he says, “I will not insult you by taking your wand with force. I only ask that you trust me and hand it over”.

Something was off.

“What was James' senior thesis in Transfiguration?” Remus asked. His wand remained raised.

“Ah ever vigilant my young Remus. Mad eyes doing I suppose” said the man that looked like Dumbledore before he laughed and then said “I'm not likely to forget. My dear James published some truly groundbreaking research on the properties of magical maps.”; Remus lowered his wand but Dumbledore continued to speak, “It was most impressive for a mere 7th year to produce such sophisticated research”; Dumbledore paused reflectively and then laughed adding “ of course I knew that he had completed his research in his 3rd year. I believed he called it the Marauder's map. But I saw no harm in letting his pranks go unnoticed, especially when they were producing such ingenious magical creations”.

Remus felt like a student being chided by his professor once again. He handed Dumbledore his wand.

“Where is James anyways?”; Dumbledore asked as he put it in his pocket; “the wards appear to have fallen”.

Remus pointed over to the fire place, to James, to Dumbledore's most prized student, the heir to all of Dumbledore's magical discoveries. In an instant Dumbledore was as white as nearly-headless Nick. But Dumbledore was not as white as Remus became once he noticed who was standing behind Dumbledore. As soon as he saw Severus's smug face hiding behind Dumbledore he reached for his wand, but it was gone. He realized that this is what Dumbledore wanted. That meant that Dumbledore was protecting Snape. Dumbledore would not protect Snape unless Dumbledore knew something that Remus did not. Dumbledore trusted him, he realized. If Dumbledore trusted him then Remus would trust him too. Remus quickly realized what must have happened outside with Lilly and Sirius. No doubt Sirius had been the one to cast the killing curse; he was unsurprised. The two were closer than brothers so there was no doubt that Sirius's mind was full of the vile things that a killing curse required.

Remus looked to Dumbledore who nodded and began to speak; “I must say that our young Lilly gave me quite the run for my money. Sirius, a trained auror, I was expecting, but Lilly? Even my James cannot perform magic at such a level”. Dumbledore whispered something to himself before beginning to speak once more, “In all my time I have only seen three wizards perform such complex magic at so young an age. The first one was my soulmate, the one true love I have ever known in this long and lonely life”. For a moment Dumbledore seemed broken, but he managed to pull himself together and to continue.

Both Remus and Severus wondered who this witch was. She must have been something for Dumbledore to talk about her like that.

“The second” Dumbledore continued, “ was if I may for a moment abandon all appearances of humility, myself. The third, a student with so much potential, such a waist; his name was Tom I believe. However, he goes by a different name these days I suppose he must consider his knew name more sinister and villainous. No doubt, you've heard of him. These days he has people call him Voldemort, Lord Voldemort”.

Remus was filled with a chill. There were goosebumps on his skin and prickles dancing down the edge of his spine. Nothing was known of Voldemort's childhood. He collected himself and began to speak, “He went by a different name, you mean, professor?”.

“Of c-” Dumbledore froze, “Surely you don't mean?”. Dumbledores eyes were wide and his jaw was open agape, dumbfounded beyond belief.

Remus nodded. Dumbledore grabbed Severus's arm and pulled up his sleeve. Remus noticed that Severus had only the outline of a dark mark.

“My children. The mark has begun to fade! The dark lord has been defeated!”, Dumbledore was all smiles until he looked down at James's body; that helped bring him back down and somber the mood.

“What” whispered the wizened old professor who was for the first time in his life at a loss for words, “What happened here tonight”.

Remus gave Dumbledore wide and unknowing eyes, “you will have to wake Lilly and ask her for yourself”.

“Yes” Dumbledore said, “but first two calming droughts perhaps?”

“That seems wise headmaster” the potions master slowly drawled. He pulled two flasks out of his pocket and handed them to the headmaster before he turned around and gave one to Remus.

Remus tried to refuse but Snape continued to insist, “You're best friend just died for Merlin's sake. I would expect this from the three idiots but you should know better”. Remus gulped it down. Severus looked at the sleeping twins for a moment; he flinched and then nodded before putting another flask in Remus's pocket; “for later” the potions master plainly stated as he tucked it into Remus's pocket.


** You need to sort your dialogue out, both in terms of punctuation and OOCness- would Dumbledore really say anyways? The talking to the reader at the beginning feels a bit 2edgy4u, and you seem to switch from present to past tense halfway through.

That said, it's an intriguing start with good characterisations, a nice balance of description and dialogue, and with some fleshing out could be a really nice fic.

**** "Out of character". Generally you don't have a problem, but at times your dialogue doesn't seem to fit, such as the "anyways" problem I mentioned. It's just something to look out for. :)

As for punctuation, a very brief overview:

The format should always be: "[dialogue][punctuation]"

The punctuation can vary, but should always be there. If you're saying "he said" after, it should be a comma. If that's the end of it, it should be a full stop/period. If you're using a question mark or exclamation mark, it can work either way.

You have a habit of either not using punctuation or adding it after the closing quote marks, including on one occasion a semicolon, which is a little odd.

I can't commit to long-term beta work, but I'm happy to look over a chapter or two.

** Your beginning sentence:

#+begin_quote
  A flash, black with streams of emerald green. You can see it reflected in his eyes. But not his son's; his son's were that same green color as the light.
#+end_quote

Does not draw me in. It's boring. It's unoriginal in the sense that I can think of many, many fics that start with something about "emerald green eyes". Even changing it to:

#+begin_quote
  A flash, black with streams of +emerald+ *intense* green. You can see it reflected in his eyes. But not his son's; his son's were +that+ *the* same +green+ color as the light.
#+end_quote

Is much better and cuts out the repetition. Except, then you reiterate your first paragraph in the /very next/ sentence.

#+begin_quote
  So yes, a bright green light, a streak, it sucks the light out from the room and leaves death where it has has been.
#+end_quote

I think you can combine the two together while still keeping your writing perspective.

#+begin_quote
  A flash, black with streams of intense green. You can see it reflected in his eyes. But not his son's; his son's were the same color as the light. +So yes, a+ *This* bright light, a streak*.* *It* sucks the light out from the room and leaves death where it has has been.
#+end_quote

And /then/ start your next paragraph with, "He is standing in its path."

Then we get to....

#+begin_quote
  That old half-senile fumble-dork
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  keep that senile medaling old fool healthy.
#+end_quote

Ignoring the fact that I hate your out-of-place nickname for Dumbledore (this is part of the OOCness [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] mentioned), you're again repeating yourself. I recommend you take a hard look at your vocabulary usage and sentence structure in order to prevent this. This early in, there's no need to remind readers of information/thoughts/opinions. They just read it. They know.

Other than that, keep a close eye on your Dumbledore characterization. I got the sense that your Remus was much more in control of the situation than the Headmaster, which doesn't make sense considering age gap/experience/loss of Remus's best friend.
