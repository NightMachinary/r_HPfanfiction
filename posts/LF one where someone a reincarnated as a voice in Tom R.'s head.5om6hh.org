I read it a while back, but I still remember some details about it. Basically, some guy from our universe dies and instead of the usual reincarnation business, he becomes a voice in young Tom Riddle's head.

He goes on to plant some ideas and all that into Tom's head, but that is as far as I got.

I distinctly remember it being on ff.net

Any help is greatly appreciated.


** Would it be The Evil Overlord List?

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
