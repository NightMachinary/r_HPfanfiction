  Hermione is told Love might be the Power-He-Knows-Not and vows to help Harry find it at any cost. Be Warned of some R/Hr until chpt 20 but skipping those chapters means missing out on H/Hr/G goodness. This is rated MATURE for ADULT CONTENT. Harry/Many

**** I overdid Ron/Hermione a bit and I understand why some people can't handle it. Also the first 30 chapters are my favorite, just poking around at home with Harry and a couple of girls... But there is a lot of seriously good stuff later one too..

of course I am biased, I've re-read my own story like 5 times over the years and I'm always thinking "This author is a genius! This is the best smut I've ever read!" etc etc... its like mental masturbation.

  Fem harry; Harriett Potter and co are getting drunk in Grimmauld place when Voldemort gains entrance. In a panic, Harri locks down the manor trapping everyone inside and leaving them powerless. With nothing else to do, it is only reasonable they play spin the bottle, right?Drunk humor, Secret sharing & a load a smut! :)
