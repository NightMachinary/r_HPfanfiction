:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So it starts in Harry's 4th year with the triwizard tournament, he plays like a magical projector of his childhood, gets a ton of people in trouble and its also got him paired with Hermione, daphne, and fleur. It was really good but now I cant find it for the life of me. He gets quarters in the “married” or betrothed section of the castle I believe and hes also got Asperger's somewhat.


** Maybe *Harry Potter and the Daft Morons* by *Sinyk* .
