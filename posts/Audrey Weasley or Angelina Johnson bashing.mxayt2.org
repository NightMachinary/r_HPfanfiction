I usually read Weasley (Ron, Ginny, Molly) or Granger bashing but I wanted something different to read and I tried looking it up but didn't find any so I thought maybe you guys would know of one

Thank you in advance!


** Audrey Weasley is just given as a name as Percy's wife. There are no existing traits we know of in canon or post canon material. What do people bash her for?

*** I mean, I remember a thread where someone randomly bashed Daphne Greengrass, and Audrey and Daphne have the same level of canon background

** So, it's only in one chapter but the very dark and twisted revenge rampage and bashfest that is "Harry Potter and the Rejected Path" by zarkham has Angelina Johnson-bashing in conjunction with its Weasley-bashing: every male Weasley (I forget about Ginny and Molly) in it is a sexual predator and she's Fred and George's willing collaborator.

**** Read the series a few months ago. That I can remember the fic from hundreds of fics from the time is a testament to its quality and uniqueness. Reading your latest additions!
