It may be simply in my head, but I somehow remember cry-laughing at this scene in a fic that I don't remember, where Harry, either during the introduction to the wizarding world or later after a traumatic event accuses someone of being a witch, while probably being at Hogwarts, and (maybe) tries to burn them. Anyone knows it? Thanks


** I've never heard of a fic like that, but this reminds me of a popular comic of Dumbledore burning Hermione on a stake because she used a pen.

  This is a series of oneshots that involve Harry believing that everyone in the 'magical' world is insane. Starts with Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall getting Harry, instead of Hagrid, and goes in random order from there. Involves much sarcasm from Harry. Feel free to adopt.

** I'm pretty sure in a scene of the original version of darkness ascendant in my linkffn(anthology on broken pottery) i make just that joke but it's internal monologue, i think. Can't remember if i used it in the current standalone version yet.

  She nodded. "Is it like in the stories where the hero has some unknown power that came to him through his blood?"

  One of the Darklings appeared in his eye line with a sign that said 'she knows too much, she's obviously a witch! Burn her!'

  Harry burst out laughing and hermione looked affronted until he assured her he wasn't laughing at her. Then he said, "mostly."

  "What do you mean?"

  "I was reminded of a monty python scene. The witch one."

  Harry and the Multiverse: stories of Harry and friends in worlds unlike the Potterverse. Crossover starts and stops, ideas that are only half-formulated. Mostly HHr but some other pairings on occasion.
