I've just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11367427/1/In-the-Heat-of-the-Night][In the Heat of the Night]] and looking for more like this. This one was just a one-shot during the trial of Mr and Mrs Weasley, for attempted kidnapping of Harry from the Ministry. It's further explained that Dumbledore basically brainwashed the Weasleys into helping rescue Harry from the Ministry, stating that he's being a puppet, a murderer. Ginny offers herself as wife in order to save her parents from being thrown into Azkaban and she starts to see the brainwashing / unwarranted Dumbledore worship.

I guess it would be Independent!Harry but also paired with Ginny, and Dumbledore and/or Weasley bashing...

Thanks in advance!


** Well, this sounds like an absolute train wreck. And I could use a train wreck.

*** I had an edit about how I was aware this would be pretty OOC, but that I thought this specific story was /not very OOC/ then I re-read that and went, well, maybe I should stop deluding myself...

** I'm legitimately curious, what causes someone to actually go searching for bash fics? Almost always the characters that are being bashed are incredibly out of character, their reasoning is usually 100% nonsensical, classic cartoon villain replete with the evil cackle. In fact, that's what it is. Most of these fics are cartoonish. The characters are caricatures of their worst flaws, amplified a thousand times over.

Ginny is always a HP fangirl seducing him with love potions, Hermione (even though Hermione bash fics are rare) is always a prim and proper girl who shows nearly drooling obedience to any authority figure, Ron is a jealous prick who would become a Death Eater if Hermione paid even the slightest romantic attention to Harry, and Dumbledore, one of the most complicated and exceedingly hard characters that JKR created, is reduced to a manipulative, evil simpleton, where a 15 year old boy outwits him regularly, chapter after chapter. And though I have an extreme dislike for Snape, JKR has always portrayed him as one of the most intelligent characters in the series, like Dumbledore. And also like Dumbledore, when writers bash him, they usually make him into a dim-witted fool, frothing at the mouth for no real reason other than to look rabid.

I don't think I've read a really well done, non-guilty pleasure bash fic. I'm not sure it's possible.

Not to say that I haven't read these fics when I've come across them and am really bored... but to actively go searching for them? I don't get that.

*** I get what your saying. Bash fics are lazy writing by the author and the characters are really ooc but sometimes after reading something really serious and well written, I like to read a bash fic where it is so over the top that its almost comical. Plus I don't really like Ron in canon that much so Ron bashing is sort of a guilty pleasure read of mine though I don't read it that often. I like stories where Harry branches out to make new friends so bashing is an easy way to drop Ron. That being said I do enjoy a well written Ron as well. It just depends what I'm in the mood for.

*** The only way to make Dumbledore a villain is to alter the motives of the main character. Dumbledore is very much against Voldemort, so if, say, Harry were to align himself with Voldemort for whatever reason Dumbledore would be against him.

You could very well write a John Grisham-esque fanfiction, where the main character is a spy, without anyone knowing it. It would certainly turn the tables a bit.

*** I can't stand bashing. But I think the real problem with bashing is laziness. It might be interesting to read a story were any specific character is evil, but in all these bashing fics they are never interesting characters, just awfully written.

*** All the bashing you've described isn't actually what I was looking for, so actually bashing is probably the wrong term for me to use. But, I'm more inclined to the Dumbledore "bashing" side mostly because he really was an incompetent headmaster at running his own school. I won't deny his character is complicated. I actually do like Dumbledore in the books. But, I can see a world where Dumbledore /is/ manipulative, and not necessarily evil. I don't know what to call that. But I'm sure you've heard of the phrase: the road to hell is paved with good intentions. For a fanfiction to explore that side of it, that's what I enjoy about fanfic in the first place. If I come across a fic that takes the bashing/OOCness too far then that's where I draw the line. But where /you/ draw the line is vastly different from where I draw the line.

Your question really doesn't belong in the world of fanfiction. You might as well be asking me why I read fanfiction in the first place since everything that isn't canon is wrong and not worth reading. I probably feel the exact same way you feel about my looking for "bash"fics , with Snarry fics or Snamione fics. And I've seen the discussions that come up. "Harry/Tonks shippers, WHY?" etc. And the answers would never satisfy the person who asked the question. Or even if they did, they'd probably say something like, "I guess I can see that. Still not my thing though."

We can all make assertions as to how "in-character" Harry or any other character would be, but no other person can objectively correct us other than JK Rowling herself. My line of OOC is different than yours. As I've already mentioned to another commenter below, I do find certain fics in this genre OOC as well, and I'm definitely not looking for those.

** You'll love Harry Potter and the Butterfly Effect, linkffn(9065880). Same author. The structure of the story may be somewhat strange, but it has what you are looking for.

I'm really not a fan of Weasley bashing, but the story is well written and the plot makes sense. So I just grin and bear it. And at least I know that Harry and Ginny end up together at the end, lol.

  Minor events can have repercussions far beyond their size and importance. When one of these minor events occurs to a ten year-old Harry Potter he finds his world turned upside-down and it starts him down a very different path than the one he expected to follow.

**** Figured you had probably read it, but it was the first thing that came to mind.

You could try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8281675/1/Perilous-Journey][Perilous Journey by sbmcneil]]. The only Weasley bashing is a bit of Molly for a bit of trusting naivety, but it *definitely* bashes on the Dumbledore in what I could call a decently realistic fashion, when compared to bashing of the, say, Partially Kissed Hero sort.
