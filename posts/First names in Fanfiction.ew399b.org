One thing i hate in fanfics is Harry always saying to goblins, aurors, madam bones ect. to call him Harry instead of Mr Potter, and also getting permission to call them by their fist name in return, thats like calling your teacher Robert instead of Mr Turner, weird and quite impolite in my opinion. Would you tell the bank to call you by your first name? what about a random cop? What about a politician? No. You would if you were very familiar with them but in the fics they make one appearance and suddenly they are best friends calling each other by their names.


** I totally agree. I believe that this is done because the writer's wanted to show that Harry is friendly and down to earth and is really common in Lordfic's and IndyHarry. But it makes Harry look rude and uncultured

** In a lot of these, it's got Harry in a position of social status (eg, being a Lord). Past that, moving to a first name basis shows that you're friendly with them. So the idea is less of you telling the bank to call you by your first name - but instead, one of the bank's biggest customers, someone super famous and rich and with a powerful inherited status, telling a manager or a front desk employee that they can address him informally like a friend - which conveys a /very/ different social dynamic in most societies than some random nobody doing the same. Eg, think of it like if Bill Gates did that - it'd play into a way of making him look friendly and down to earth to ask people to call him Bill, instead of Mr. Gates.

Obviously it's taken to extremes that don't really make much sense - and moving way too fast. But the idea of it isn't necessarily the worst.

***** I just graduated high school in Virginia a couple years ago. I only ever called my friends by their first name. I would call teammates by their last name if I was not close to them. I had not so flattering nicknames for some of my teachers, but I always called them with their title and last name, and most of my teachers called me by last name. Calling my teachers by a nickname would have been weird. The closest I came to using a nickname to a teacher is some teachers knew their names were hard to pronounce so they would tell us to call them Mrs M. or something like that.

**** Northern Netherlands chiming in, first names for everyone are extremely common (honestly, sometimes aggravatingly common). The only people I've ever called Mr., Mrs., or Prof. are the CEO of the company where I did my internship, the HR lead at the same company, and a few professors at the university. Other professors are first-name basis (even names like Ben Feringa, which hasn't changed after he won his Nobel) even if I've only ever interacted with them via lectures.

**** In former USSR (well, Russia, but it's common way in Belarus and Ukraine too, AFAIK) we're addressing our teachers by their name and patronymic, i.e. Nikolay Ivanovich, Elena Alexandrovna. Well, not just teachers - pretty much anyone who's not your own age or not your friend. And calling someone by his surname could be disrespectful - that's how teachers address students, officers address soldiers, government officials - pretty much anyone outside the system... So if person calls you by your surname, that usually means he considers himself your superior - well, apart from the cases when he's actually your superior.

**** I'm from California and I've only ever had three teachers/professors have me call them by their first name. One was a pair of co-teachers in second and third grade who I think were trying to seem cool and down to earth (spoiler: one of them enjoyed bullying me both years I was in her class - she taught 2nd and 3rd). I called them by their last names because my parents thought it was too weird.

The other was a married pair of professors in college who I knew for two years as the really involved faculty advisors to a club and in that context asked me to use their first names. By the time I was taking their classes, it was decided that it would be weird for me to start calling them Dr. Lastname and Dr. Surname.

*** But I assume they've read the books and after 7 books they should realize that calling authority figures by their first name or even a nickname is not normal. When writing fanfiction you already try to immitate the way of speaking of the characters. Snape shouldn't sound like a 10 year old and 10 year old students shouldn't sound like 30 year olds. Names are just another part of this.

********* I think it might be that way in the US, but here in the UK I can say for definite that it's unmarried vs ambiguous. We also fill out Mrs to Missus, but that's more a slang thing that an actual usage these days - you can find it used like that in older literature and news-articles and such though!

Actually, Ms, Mrs, and Miss are all short-forms of Mistress, which was the female version of 'Master' back in the day (Mr being short for Master too, incidentally). Mrs was actually pronounced Mistress, too. Mistress was mainly referring to experts/authorities in a trade or craft, like 'master of music' would be 'mistress of music' or whatever. Miss and Master were indeed both used for children at that point, but miss was solely for female children though.

Back in the 1700s and earlier, titles were entirely a class thing. The majority of people, being lower class, wouldn't have had any title at all, you'd be referred to by name only. It's a bit semantic, but mostly it just inferred some kind of authority over others (which was usually found in the older and/or higher class). The Lady of the Manor would be Mrs Whatever, as would the head of the staff, but the scullery maid (as a commoner) would be referred to by first name only.

Mrs became used (in addition to all the previous uses) to refer to older women in the late 1700s/early 1800s. We're not terribly sure why it was adopted as such, but that's the earliest time we can find that semantic connection.

Neither term definitively had anything to do with marriage at all until about 1900 or so. It was always either age, class, or expertise. Never definitively any particular one, but always one of them. Made historian's lives more difficult, as they always had to check semantics to know which one they meant.

Oh, and we did used to use Ms, too. That was just a third option for Mistress, at one point. It fell out of popularity until people picked it back up again in the 1900s as a way to talk about women that didn't revolve around what man they belonged to.

Edit: Region names are a bit misleading in the US because they're more cultural than geographical. There are 4, the Northeast, the South, the Midwest, and the West. The Northeast is most of the original 13 colonies, plus Maine and Vermont. I say most because some of the 13 ended up in the South. The South is made up of all the states that tried to secede during the American Civil war. The Midwest is farmland, and the Great Lakes area. It was mostly all settled before the Homestead Act of 1862, by farmers, lumberjacks, railroad towns, and people looking to use the Mississippi and the Great Lakes to ship things. The West is everything else.

So I say Minnesota is in the Midwest, even though it is along the Canadian border.

*** I cant speak for the 90s part but oof. Britain is hugely, hugely hierarchical. Im not british but I've lived there and colleagues (I worked in a school) came up to me and gossiped about "She is really posh, her family is rich" and "Yeah he comes from a good family" and stuff like that.

The entire school was also weird when it came to teachers. In Germany, Teachers are colleagues with only a few "Fachleiter", who are not really that more important than other teachers. And then there is the headmaster/headmistress and a vice headmaster/mistress.

In England? At several schools? Its the leadership - several vice headmasters/mistresses, head of house, head of year 6,7,8,9,10 etc. Head of department, Vice Head of department (My school for example had about 1000~ pupils, with 6th form included, and was built this way), then you have the regular teachers, and the NQTs (Newly qualified teachers) below that.

What I am trying to say is: No way in hell, would regular teachers allow their students to call them by their first name. Hell, some of my supervisors didnt allow that to NQTs or Leadership would always address and demand being addressed by their proper title and last name.

Once I graduated Highchool, I had a few teachers who invited me to call them by their first name, but not while still going to the school they taught at.

EDIT: In University I would always start out by default calling a Professor as Professor LastName but I found the occasional professor invited you to refer to them by their first name. It depended on them. Highschool and below though, by school rule it was always by title.

I live and grew up in Georgia - the US state, not the country - and I wouldn't dare call an authority figure, teacher, or doctor by anything other than "<Title> <Lastname>." I'd feel horrifically rude. I don't know how it is in other states, but /nobody/ in any of the schools I've been to would refer to a teacher by their first name until they're well out of school, and even then it would be awkward.

*** Not at all. Born and raised in NYC, went to public schools all my life, now in college and I've never called nor seen any one of my friends call an older person by their first names unless we were extremely friendly with that person. Like, after we graduated from high school, our principal said she's now just Marie to us, but none of us actually called her that. We just stuck with Ms. G

**** Born and raised in NYC too, my nieces the same, and when we did high school admissions three years ago for the older niece nearly all the schools that made it onto the list were schools where all the teachers were called by their first name.

For the younger niece it was /half/ the schools that were first name schools.

***** I just graduated last year, where were these schools when I was applying 😡😡😡😡 woulda loved to call my history teacher MATILDA sometimes. I mean, I know of one high school in the Bronx that does that, but it's a highschool for children with disabilities so I always chalked it up to being super friendly, I guess.

****** To give some context, my sister and I attended LaGuardia and Stuyvessant. And with the nieces (her children) we wanted them to go somewhere that wasn't a massive pressure cooker with limited support if kids struggle. Even at LaGuardia and Stuy and schools like that, sometimes kids struggle. Sometimes they have learning disabilities or problems at home or they simply bump into the wall of a subject that they can't learn with minimal effort and have no idea how to proceed.

We also wanted to avoid the kids going to a school that's run like a prison.

So, if you're curious (perhaps to encourage a younger cousin, sibling, or friend) and not just venting, the list for the older kid comprised mostly consortium schools (they're very academic, but exempt from Regents exams) and CTE schools (also academic, but with an emphasis on what used to be called "vocational") - so Harvest Collegiate, Essex Street Academy, Urban Assembly Maker Academy, lots of schools like that. (You'll note that the schools we picked were mostly in Lower Manhattan, which was most convenient for us, but those schools exist uptown as well. I don't know about what's around in the Bronx.)

The younger one is more arts focused and cared primarily that there was a strong art program, and more of those schools are older and more traditional.

*** Yeah, this. I grew up in Denmark. We have a formal rule stating that members of parliament have to address each other as "Mr/Ms Lastname" /during proceedings/, and people find that stuffy and oldfashioned because they otherwise don't. We pretty much go directly from "Firstname" to "your Royal Highness", and there aren't that many people around for whom the latter is appropriate.

I still feel weird writing dialogue with British social rules, let alone actually talking to people here.

*** Same for me, in some sense. I am Australian and each year it changed, to be honest.

In primary school, a lot of teachers would address you by your given name as it created a small bond and allowed you to feel safer and more at home. As such, you were allowed to do the same. I feel like the older we got, the more it became uncommon to do. My nephew, who is twelve, calls his teacher by her first name and she does the same toward him.

High school, for me, was a little different as I went to an all-boys' private school. There was no way you could ever address a teacher with such disrespect. It was Mr Surname or Sir. The latter could only be used after you used the former. You would greet with Mr Surname and then use Sir for everything else.

Looking back, it was quite a headache to deal with. No wonder I always got in trouble.

** I think it's (when used by good writers) used to show that Harry is still uncomfortable with having his opinion taken into account. Whether you think the Dursleys physically abused him or not, you have to agree they emotionally abused him and that has to have had some effect on his self-esteem.

Well, I think so. I have no experience with this (thankfully), so I can't say for sure.

** Obviously depends on context, but also culture. In my country, for example, I can think of very few situations where youd call someone by their last name. Maybe in a doctors office, or someone in a VERY high position, like the President or so. Funny how that changes depending on where you're from :)

** In the middle east, you call people by [Title][First Name]. If someone is a doctor named Jack Peters, you call them Dr. Jack. There are just too many people with the same or very similar last names, especially as some careers seem to pass down in families.

*** I'm also from the middle East...

We call almost everyone by their first name...

And if you refer to someone by their title, it would be /only/ the title. "Sir Prime minister", "Sir/ma'am minister" and much less common: "the doctor", "the teacher". Ma'am and sir are used mostly when trying to catch the attention of someone you don't know: "ma'am, you dropped something".

** You can play a lot with names, it says a lot about how everyone sees everyone else. For example, Dumbledore calls Harry "Harry" to his mild annoyance, Snape calls Harry "Potter", other teachers go with "Mr. Potter". Personal friends go with "Harry". Harry calls Dumbledore "Dumbledore" in his internal monologue and when talking about him to friends but "Professor Dumbledore" when talking to him.

** I'd say that in the UK teachers are often the only people really called Mr/Miss. We don't use sir or miss unless to a teacher or in a super formal setting, like in court or if you're being arrested or something like that. You are almost always told by people you are talking to, to use their first name. Police officers, bank workers, university lecturers, even in a job interview. In fact I went through three years of University without learning some of my professors surnames. It creates a level of communication and openness I guess that is pretty common place in the UK. Also 90% of the time when introduced to someone they will use your first name as you will theirs unless, as I said, its super formal, or if you are asked to do otherwise. Also if you do say Miss whatever I and most people in the UK would just say "oh it's just....."

I worked in retail and in resturants and can safely say I have never called a single customer anything even close to sir/ma'am. It was excuse me and thank you. But we don't use formaility in the same way as America, I think.
