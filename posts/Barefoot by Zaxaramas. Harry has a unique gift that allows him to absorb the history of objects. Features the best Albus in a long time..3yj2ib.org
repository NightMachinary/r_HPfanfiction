** I dislike first person and present tense - the two together are too much for me to bear :(

*** It's a shame because it's an intriguing premise. It's just rendered unreadable.

Why do people write in the present tense? It does not read well.

**** I feel like the combination of first person and present tense really only works in cliche noir-detective-esque stuff, and I didn't stick around long enough to find if that was the case, because I'm sure it isn't

**** I actually like present tense, but it requires a certain tone. Something a bit more fast paced, and a lot more personal. Done well, it can be fun.

**** Hmm ... I wouldn't say present tense doesn't read well. It's just more suitable to things like Choose-Your-Own-Adventure stories.

** A decent read. If you're not into Super!Harry at all, you might want to avoid.

Kinda messed up the title. Meant to say the best Albus I've read in a long time. The other characters and dialogue are really good as well. Harry is a bit OP but he hasn't faced a real challenge yet.

** Only skimmed over the first chapter by now since I'm too busy to try actually reading it, but it seems to have that unfortunate thing where the author capitalises certain words that should not be capitalised in the context they are in (“Aunt”, “Uncle”).

Still, that's minor stuff. Here's to hoping it has no high-tier nonsense, so to say.

*** Sylar, by way of Bridget Bailey. It was called clairsentience, there. As has the occasional superhero (Longshot of the X-Men, for one). It's psychometry.
