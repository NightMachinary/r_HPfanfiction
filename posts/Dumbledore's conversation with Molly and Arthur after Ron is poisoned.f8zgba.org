** "Hey, Molly, you know how your only daughter was kidnapped and nearly died but was saved by Harry?\\
And how Arthur was bitten by that venomous snake but Harry saw it so we could get to him in time?\\

** “You know there is that one small thing about the best friend of your son, and possibly a boyfriend of your daughter I have somehow forgotten to tell you ... many years ago, in Novermber 1980, I was doing an interview with a job applicant for the post of the Divination Professor at Hogwarts. ... Yeah, so being his friend or even a girlfriend is not the safest thing in the world. That's what I probably should tell you earlier.”

** "Unfortunately, your son Ron survived tonight. Disappointing. I know! My secret plan was to have him die, so Harry would get angry and finally focus properly on the task at hand ... alas! Lemon drop?"
