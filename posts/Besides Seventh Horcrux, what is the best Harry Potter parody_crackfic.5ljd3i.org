** Some one-shots:

- linkffn(Lessons With Hagrid): "Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord."
- linkffn(How Moody Got His Eye): "The real story of how Moody got his magical eye."
- linkffn(Ninety-Nine Trope Subversions And A Deckchair Party): "Harry Potter and friends kick back and relax at the First Annual Post-Voldemort Party And Jamboree."
- linkffn(Two Weeks in the Alley): "13 years old, a vault full of gold, and two unsupervised weeks in Diagon Alley---what's a boy to do?"

linkffn(What Would Slytherin Harry Do) also has elements of parody and sometimes outright crack (chapter 5).

  Harry Potter and friends kick back and relax at the First Annual Post-Voldemort Party And Jamboree. What did Bill Weasley refer to as his "Rod of Wonder"? Where is Crabbe Castle? How did Voldemort get an army of steampunk ice giants? Who is Albus Baker? What does Hermione need the chloroform for? Why is Ginny a lich? Get ready for none of these questions, and more, to be answered.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
