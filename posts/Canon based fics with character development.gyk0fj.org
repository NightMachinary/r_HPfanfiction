I'm not a fan of fics when they stray from canon too much I am just desperate for extra character moments especially weasley family things, either during hogwarts times or post I don't mind. Lmk!


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/floreatcastellum][FloreatCastellum]] has a lot of fics exactly like that! Canon-compliant, following character development. Especially in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1407286][these]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1344409][two]] collections.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.
