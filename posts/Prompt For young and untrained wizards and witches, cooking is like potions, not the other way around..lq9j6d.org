Everyone's seen it. That most misused of comparisons. "Potions is like cooking." No. No it isn't. If you add the garlic later in the recipe, it isn't going to blow up and kill everyone in the room. If you accidentally rough chop instead of dice the carrots, it will simply lead to uneven cooking times, not noxious gas that makes you turn into a blob of semi-sapient sludge levitating on the ceiling. Potions is magical chemistry, not cooking. But what if it /was/ like cooking. Or rather, what if when a young and untrained wizard attempts to cook something, magic interferes in the most /delightful/ of ways.

The Dursleys discover that for a young wizard with an innate talent for potions, who perhaps has a bit too much of his mothers' aptitude for the subject, even the most basic muggle recipes become immensely powerful potions. Have him watch breakfast so it doesn't burn? The food swells to the size of a small car and explodes, causing everyone to grow feathers. Stir the soup for a few minutes? The vegetables come to life and start swimming in the air like strange fish, melting through anything they touch. Brew some tea? The steam puts people to sleep. Forget to add the garlic? The dish ignites and makes the stove turn invisible. Etc etc etc.


** I would love to read this. However, it could mean, that Dumbledore & co. would know, that they MUST be more involved in young wizard's pre-Hogwarts life, because he is literally life danger of Dursleys. Thus, non-abusive Dursleys household.

*** I mean, if you were playing it straight rather than crack, the most likely scenario is that the Dursleys refuse to keep Harry if it means interacting with magic on a regular basis. So they reject Harry, who then grows up elsewhere, without the benefit of the blood protection, and sooner or later some Death Eater likely offs him, probably before he even starts Hogwarts.

**** Harry and Dudley getting attacked by dementors a couple blocks from his home show that all the blood protections do is protect Harry from Voldemort directly till 4th year and from any hostile attacks on #4 privet drive itself. Harry's sole protection during the summer and pre-Hogwarts was his location's anonymity. It's only after 4th year that Harry gets bodyguards at his home cause Dumbledore thinks Voldemort could find out his location either through ministry spies or through their connection.

Not true.

1. In OotP, Dumbledore states that the bond of blood charm protects Harry from Voldemort's followers, with direct reference to what happened to the Longbottoms being at risk of having to Harry if he had been placed elsewhere.

2. In DH, Voldemort and a large number of Death Eaters are forced to lie in wait outside the house to ambush Harry as he leaves; they are unable to force entry into the house even though they know where he is.

The limitation of the protection which permits the Dementor attack is that it doesn't protect him in all locations, only at Privet Drive. But that would be true of any location he was in - when you leave the protected location, you are no longer protected. The difference between Privet Drive and other possibilities is not that it protects Harry everywhere, but rather that it offers a superior level of protection /when you are inside its protection/.

The only "multi-location" protection on Harry is the lingering blood protection, which Voldemort neutralised as of GoF.

****** Thats literally what I said. Harry is protected from Voldemort directly and from any assault on #4 privet drive, but he isnt protected away from privet drive. therefore anonymity is his only true protection. If his address was ever found out he could be killed when he goes to the park or muggle school, or to the store or any other time he's not in the house itself. thats why he needs guards when Voldemort comes back cause if he finds out his location death eaters can lie and wait for him to leave his house to kill him. So the guards arnt necessary for when he's in the house but for when he leaves.

Edit: so on one hand harry can be sent somewhere where Dumbledore knows he will be mistreated where he is only safe so long as he's anonymous. on the other hand he can go literally anywhere else where where he wont be mistreated and he will only be safe so long as he remains anonymous. therefore Dursleys dont matter get him out of there.

**** Well, we may say that magic in children gradually grows, so it is an issue only when they are slightly older (closer to the Hogwarts age; point of the boarding school being that kids are in the protected environment and they are not danger to their parents any more).

** Kind of an aside, but I really like that comparison to chemistry. The cooking "comparison" always bothered me. Chemistry is hard - having all the instructions doesn't just make everything work out, which is what I presume is happening with potions

*** This gives me flashbacks to lessons on redox reactions and worksheets about balancing chemical equations. Ahhhh... high school chemistry. I can't do those now but you made me itch to look up stuff on YouTube.
