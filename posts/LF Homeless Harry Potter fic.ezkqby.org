:END:
So,

- Harry is living on the streets

- doesn't know he is a wizard

- rides the subway in circles to avoid detection

- meets draco

- the two make pretty jewelry

- is spotted on the streets by Remus? And Sirius?

- kidnapped by that bad werewolf

Help me please, you are my only hope.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhk√§se.
