** I quit Sacrifices after the third book, so we probably have different tastes.

However, one of the most 'beautiful' stories I've read is Esama's /Death and the Boy/ linkao3(1115380). It's short, but I thought it was truly lyrical writing that was both effective and affective. The only thing I didn't respond positively to were the rather pretentious (imho) little titles throughout.

I think writing in the ubiquitously-recommended /Cauterize/ is also beautiful in its way.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** surrogate by 17734 is phenomenal and elegant writing; my only complaint is that a few paragraphs feel like they're copied from a psychology/sociology textbook while Voldemort is explaining his views to others.

There is one line that really stands out to me in a different fic, Vacillation by fairmaidofkent. It's at the very end: "He would slaughter legions for her or no one at all; whatever it took to keep her by his side" idk something felt very disturbing but beautiful about that notion of love to me.

** If you like sacrafices arc, you will probably love [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8873683/chapters/20344381][Broken Mind, Fractured Soul]] by sensiblyTainted. Harry Potter watched his mother die when he was fifteen months old, a piece of Voldemort's soul invaded his own, Vernon abused him, Petunia tore him to shreds with her hateful words, and Lockhart molested him throughout Second-year. After all that trauma, is it any wonder Harry created multiple personalities to deal with it all? In Harry's third year, Severus Snape decides to do something about it. He gives Harry therapy in secret, and this opens Harry up to a friendship with Neville Longbottom, another victim of Lockhart's perversions, and Draco Malfoy who can understand Harry's Slytherin alter better than anyone else. Even though the premise is very different to sacrafices, they have similar vibes, and styles of writing.

** I was very impressed by the prose quality in linkao3(Come Once Again And Love Me). As Severus time travel stories go, I actually prefer the plot of The Peace Not Promised, but Come Once Again really does have excellent writing.

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but for what?
