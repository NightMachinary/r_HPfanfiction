Hello! Looking for fic focused on Severus as a child or teenager. Any rating is fine as long as it is well written. Thanks!


** You've read the A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles?

It's, literally, the gold-standard.

*** Thank you! I really enjoyed the beginning immensely, and then trailed off a little when it began to overlap the actual books. I binged quite hard on it though, so I'm sure I will go back to it in a little while when I've had a breather. So epic in scale! I really liked a lot of it, the motivations etc, but my only criticism is that the characters use so much American English in their dialogue as opposed to British English, especially as it was set in the 70s at the start. Otherwise, really great, thanks! Poor Russ. You have any other ones you like?

Not ones that deal with a younger Snape, unfortunately. I do have several other favorite fics though. I like how Snape is portrayed in Stages of Hope, and that is another well-written fic.

*** That one's my favorite. Took me nearly two weeks to read it all when I first found it.

** If you're interested in AU, I'd recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The-Moment-It-Began][/The Moment It Began/]] by Sindie where after Snape dies in the war, he is sent to his teenage self to relive his life. It's interesting to see how the author thinks about Snape's relationships with his parents, especially his mother. You can skip the end if you don't want an eventual Snape/Lily fic, but I liked it. It's a little long

** How about one where Snape goes back to when he's a teenager and changes history? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7670834/1/bCome_b_Once_bAgain_b_and_bLove_b_bMe_b][Come Once Again and Love Me]]
