I'm currently plotting out a (mostly slice-of-life) fanfic.

As part of the background for this fic, Voldemort never made Horcruxes - so he died the first time.\\
Harry's parents also survive, Snape's life-debt causes him to give forewarning about the Halloween attack so they have time to figure out a way to fulfill the prophecy without anyone (except Voldemort) dying.

Snape, having fulfilled his life-debt and indirectly caused the end of the War, probably wouldn't stay on as Potions Professor - he'd probably want to start a new life somewhere that isn't Magical Britain. Further, with Voldemort's permanent death, the DADA Professorship wouldn't be cursed anymore.

This all does leave me with a bit of a conundrum, in the form of needing two Professors.

Can this sub help me list any viable Professors I could use for Potions and DADA? Especially ones that are dead/in jail/whatever in canon, but wouldn't be in this AU as a knock-on effect.

One candidate I already have is Sirius Black - but to be honest I can't picture him as a Professor.


** Slughorn might continue as the Potions Professor (he taught it right until the moment Snape was hired).

Remus Lupin qualifies as a DADA professor. There won't be any bitter jerks whose idea of revenge includes getting him fired, so that's a plus, too.

Idk why, but Professor Tofty (the kind O.W.L examiner) seems like a good candidate. As he was qualified enough in all (common) fields of magic to be allowed to examine the students, he would be skilled enough to teach them Defense, too. Judging by his reaction to Umbridge and her attack on Mcgonagall, he won't be a spy for the Ministry. The extent of his loyalty to Dumbledore is unknown, but it shouldn't matter that much.

Is there a link? I would love to read something like that.

*** I'm still in the planning stages, so I can't link anything yet. I want to have an outline of at least First Year before I start actually putting chapters online, that way I don't run out of steam partway through.

Thanks for expressing interest, though!

** Maybe someone from the first order- McKinnon, Meadowes, Dearborn. They would be OC with familiar names, but I don't know if you'd find anything better.

*** I can work with OC-With-Familiar-Names.

Thing is, all three people you mentioned canonically died before Voldemort fell (and in a manner entirely unrelated to whether Voldie had Horcruxes or not).\\
I don't want to diverge from that too much to be honest, if people survive it'd be purely as a knock-on effect of things I already mentioned (Voldemort not having Horcruxes, Snape specifically warning James&Lily).

The Order itself is a good shout, though, and it does remind me of a candidate - the Longbottoms were tortured into insanity in canon because Voldemort's body was never found and the Death Eaters thought Frank and Alice would know something in that regard.\\
With no Horcruxes, Voldemort would have left a dead body behind, thus the Longbottoms wouldn't be tortured (or, at least, not for information they didn't have). Either one could be a candidate for DADA Professor.

**** Ok, so the timeline stays?

Regulus Black died before Voldemort's fall in 1981 but his death was related to Horcrux, so it wouldn't happen. He was a death eater though so I don't know how would he fit this AU.

One of Neville's parents, maybe?

***** Timeline stays for the most part, yes.

Frank and Alice are good shouts for DADA Professor.

Regulus being alive might work, if I spin it a little. He would have still wanted out of the Death Eater ranks, Horcruxes or no Horcruxes, because Voldemort's still a cruel son-of-a-female-Crup - I could have him turn spy, and become the Potions Professor.

******* I did write a few Wholesome!Potions!Molly ficlets on here, but to be honest "Molly is a Potions Master" could be an in-joke-fic in and of itself. And I don't want to bash her (because it's overdone and doesn't fit the tone I'm going for) so Evil!Potions!Molly is right out.

******** I was talking about just having her as the Potions Professor just to contrast against Snape. Not Manipulative Potions Molly, lol. For eg. -

Snape teaches potions as a chemistry class, Molly teaches it like a cooking class.

Snape prohibits 'no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations' in his class, Molly actively teaches some spells to complement the potions.

While Snape's potions are top of the line (eg. Wolfsbane) but his teaching skills are trash, Molly's potion brewing skill is comparatively low (she can't make Wolfsbane, for eg.) but her teaching skill is way better.

Snape is loved by the Slytherins and hated by everyone else, on the other hand Molly is hated by the Slytherins and loved by everyone else, etc.

********* I feel like that'd be a more fun idea if Snape was actually there in the fic, to compare and contrast. Maybe if Snape was the regular teacher, and Molly was the substitute - but I've already decided that Snape would do a runner.

*** That's an option, indeed. I could see her as Potions teacher, in fact I distinctly remember a few fics where Snape gets fired and she becomes Potions teacher.

Would be more fun in a Tonks-focused story though, to play her off of her mum.

I could see James giving a few guest-lectures in DADA or Transfiguration too (not as a full time teacher). Thanks for giving me that idea.

** I went through some lists of minor Harry Potter characters, and these fit the criteria of 'not dead, and not on the dark side'

*Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank* - A substitute Care of Magical Creatures teacher in book four and five. Competent and well liked. I could imagine her as a general substitute teacher who gets promoted.

*Dirk Cresswell* - Muggle-born, member of the Slug Club during his time as Hogwarts student. He was Head of the Goblin Liason Office until Albert Runcorn exposed his falsification of his family tree and caused him to be sent to Azkaban. However, he escaped, but eventually was killed by Snatchers along with Ted Tonks and Gornuk the goblin.

*Sturgis Podmore* - Member of the original Order of the Phoenix. Worked in the ministry and guarded the prophecy room in book five, until he was arrested for attempting to break in, most likely under the Imperius curse cast by Lucius Malfoy.

*Emmeline Vance* - Member of the original Order of the Phoenix. Helps Harry escape the Dursleys in book five. Killed in 1996 by Death Eaters.

*Deadalus Diggle* - Member of the original Order of the Phoenix. Helps Harry escape the Dursleys in book five. In the Deathly Hallows he helped take the Dursleys to a protected area. The Death Eaters later burned his house in a raid, but Diggle was unharmed.

All very minor Characters with only a little characterization, but enough to build an interesting OC on and still make them recognizable. If I read up a bit more I can pobably help with their canon portrayal.
