  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** Linkffn(you're a wizard, harry by shedoc)

Though coming to it from this thread is a bit of a spoiler. I still like it though. Oh, and just a bit of barely even PG slash, for anyone looking at that pairing in the summary.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4751586/16/Lonely-Moon][Lonely Moon]] Harry is sorta a single dad. This story was pretty unusual. In it, Harry is a hogwarts prof and he gets scorpius in his class. In this AU, scorpius and and teddy are the same age and become friends. Also Scorpius has been raised as a muggle and Draco gave up magic and is a cellist. Over the summer, Harry has Teddy and they live in the same town as Draco and Scorpius. Harry and Draco become friends and it is a SUUUPER slow build and then like two years later they are eventually together. I liked this story a lot because it had some nice and different elements - especially with him and Draco both being single dads. linkffn(4751586)
