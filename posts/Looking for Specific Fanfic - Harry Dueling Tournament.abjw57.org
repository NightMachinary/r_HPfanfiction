The fanfiction I'm looking for has Harry enter a dueling tournament at Daphne's father request. He managed to make it to the end and it's him against Fleur.

If anyone can help me find this specific fic, that would be great :)

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

*** Nope, I was reading this fic thinking it was it at first but just finished reading it and it isn't. The fic was what prompted me to make this search. The fic I'm searching for has a dueling tournament.
