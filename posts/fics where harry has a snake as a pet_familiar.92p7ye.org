** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097): his conversations with the snake are hilarious, and both Hedwig and Crookshanks want to eat it.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

** I don't know in which book he acquires the snake, but Harry does get a snake as a pet somewhere in The Sacrifices Arc, which starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283][Saving Connor]], linkffn(2580283) IMHO it's the most well-written HP fanfic out there (well, the series, the first book isn't my favourite out of all seven books)

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE
