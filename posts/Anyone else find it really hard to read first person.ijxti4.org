As a reader, I've never really thought about it. I'm pretty quick to bail on a fic that doesn't engage me no matter what POV it's in. If a story is good, it doesn't matter to me. Some stories just need to be told in first person. Like mine, for example! I wrote the first chapter in third person and it just didn't work.

** First person in fanfiction can get problematic because as a reader, I already feel like I know the characters before reading a single word of the story--and most of us have slightly different Harrys and Hermiones and Dracos and Dumbledores in our minds. As soon as I start reading from one of those characters' POVs and it isn't exactly what or how I expect them to think, it throws me. If the author does the internal voice well, then I can get drawn in, but that's extremely difficult. Things can feel out of character very quickly in first person.

Third person is far more forgiving. I can still hold onto some of my preconceived notions of the characters, while the author changes my perception little-by-little instead of all-at-once.

It's more difficult to swap POV around than it is to stick to one, but plenty of major authors do that quite well. GRRM and Brandon Sanderson come to mind. So I don't think it's something that should be discounted out of hand, at least in third person. Never seen it done in first person.

** Sometimes. For some stories, integral parts of the story need to be told from 1st, like in Wastelands or tlil. It can also be annoyingly repetitive saying things like "they knew this" or "they said that" in order to give information. But if the world is affecting the mc, then 3rd is the best approach. It can give the reader important info that would otherwise be unincluded due to the pov. But when the info comes from the character, 1st is almost a must. It can go into great detail about info that would be inaccessible or awkwardly included if it was in 3rd. Of course, when the writing is subpar, I find it easier to stomach if it's in 3rd lol.

** It's kind of always felt incredibly rushed to me? While being condensed into this short frame of time that's difficult to follow and frustrating to read. To be fair, I know that it's also really difficult to keep track of all of it when you're writing in first, but.

I've also noticed that things usually tend to become a lot more straight forward, too. Sometimes painfully so. There's a lot less room for description, and any of the other characters during Big Events. You can't slip in a lot of details that you otherwise could. Ones that would complicate it but still serve to improve it when it's something the character wouldn't notice then and there. Or process. So it kind of just... Falls flat, a lot of the time?

There's a lot of limits in that style, and it can be done well, but I think the amount of people who messed up kind of turned a lot of people away from reading it, too.

** I think first person writing is less immerssive. Also, most first person fics are usually kind of cringy, no offense to good writers out there. I haven't found one I could sit through yet.

** It only really bothers me if it's switching characters, and all of them are in 1st person.

Just the main character as a 1st person doesn't bother me at all.

** Oh, god, yes. Harry Potter was written third person, so third person it shall be. The only time I'll accept first person is if someone does a fic from an OC's point of view or if someone from our world was reborn as Harry Potter and it's Harry's point of view.
