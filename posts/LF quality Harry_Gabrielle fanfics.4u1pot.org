I was just reading A Fine Spot of Trouble (an excellent Harry/Daphne fanfiction by the way), courtesy of this subreddit's recommendation. Around chapter 20ish, there's this tender Harry/Gabrielle scene that had me realize I may be interested in reading more of that ship. I'm mainly looking for quality character development, but good oneshots would also suffice. Any recommendation?

@OP: I only know of one even semi good H/Gab in the fandom, which is by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9444529/1/Vitam-Paramus][TheEndless7]].

** [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net][Jeconais]] has a few Harry/Gabrielle stories of varying quality. /Hope/ is probably his best.

Kokopelli on the same site has one as well (sort of, it's complicated; to say more would be to spoil it).

**** Jeconais has a vast number of stories where Harry grows into a sort of suave, super-powered, bigger-than-life guy who manages to get the girl. If this is your thing (i.e., if you find you like /Hope/ by the time you get to the end), then some of the others you might enjoy are:

- /White Knight, Grey Queen/: arguably the first popular Harry/Pansy fic. A few cringe-worthy moments, but a decent read nonetheless.
- /Perfect Situations/: The face that launched a thousand (Harry/Daphne) ships.
- /Perfect Slytherins/: The obligatory HP/Addams Family crossover
- The /Object Lessons/ trilogy: at his heyday during the purple period of the fandom, Jeconais was bigger than life. A fellow writer said something to the effect of, "You could write a story about Harry getting a drink of water and everyone would flock to read it." Jeconais: "Challenge accepted."
- /This Means War/: takes Ruskbyte's magical email equivalent to an extreme, the origin of the "I didn't know I shouldn't break the laws of magic so I did" trope. Slightly over the top. [[/spoiler][At one point, Harry rides into outer space on a dragon.]]
- /Best Man/: his take on a [[/spoiler][almost]] Harry/Fleur.

** I apologize for the mobile links, but switching to mobile was the easiest way to find each fanfiction on my favourite stories list.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11326267/1/][Back to the World]] This is a (21k word) one-shot. Probably my favourite Harry/Gabrielle fanfiction, although that's mainly on the basis of it being completed.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11372848/1/][Broken Pieces]] I like the story, but it hasn't been updated since October (having been started last July). If the author picked the story back up and completed it, it'd probably be my favourite.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9458931/1/][The New Dark Lord]] 44k words, but abandoned. The author claimed to give up on writing after they got a lot of hate for the ending of one of their other stories. I personally liked the ending to that story, but I wasn't too interested in it to begin with. Note, they did post one chapter late last year and debated whether to finish this story or start another.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7997729/1/][A Wizard's Fairytale]] Cliche ridden and on hiatus, but I figured I'd through it out there because there aren't many Harry/Gabrielle pairings.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6988455/1/][The After Years]] Despite how it lists the characters in the description, this isn't a harem. It isn't solely Harry/Gabrielle either, but 3 girls trying to win his affections.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9444529/1/][Vitam Paramus]] is a very good story and revolves around Harry and Gabrielle, but isn't a true pairing. Although, I'd imagine that would be the pairing if there was ever a sequel.

This is my favourite pairing, but it just hasn't been done well yet. Shame I tend to fizzle out of plot ideas after 20k words, otherwise I'd try and write one myself.

Bonus:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10025439/1/][Big Brother is Listening to You]] This is Harry/Daphne, but has Draco/Gabrielle as the second pairing. Quite a good story, in my opinion, and it's completed to boot!

** Sadly, not really. The problem is it has to be post-hogwarts, so everything will be OC and the variance in that is massive. Otherwise it's creepy. A few people have tried but I haven't found any worth recommending.

Also, I'm sure someone is going to say Vitam Paramus, but that's not a Harry/Gabrielle fic at all since there's no payoff and no plot.

*** It does not have to be creepy or post-hogwarts. You are assuming pure canon where shes under 10 at the time of GoF. One could easily age Gabrielle to be Ginny's age or something at that time. I know folks often use the "Veela mature earlier" routine as well.

***** Yea I actually am not a fan of the early mature thing myself, which is why I mentioned the changing an age aspect. Ive seen plenty of FF where they alter ages to fit people together in a more appropriate way (apart from Gabrielle, most notably Tonks getting younger, McGonagall getting younger, Astoria getting older, and a few others). And I am talking about all types of pairings (like A younger Sirius/Fleur pairing), not just Harry ones.

As for your asside, I dont disagree, but I also dont have a problem with it. Someone will always want to write it, and others will always want to read it. Its "fan fiction" or "fantasy" for a reason. One look at the Japanese Hentai and Anime worlds can show you that this is hardly unique to FF.

If you can create a story and make Harry a female, or make Harry dark, or make Draco good, or whatever and have such a story become a quality story, you can easily adjust an age up or down and have it still be a quality story.

** I wrote a fic a couple of years ago, it's a H/Hr but with a decent bit of Harry/Gabrielle within. Their meeting is quite a long time into the future, so there's none of that icky young Gabrielle business. While it's not the best thing ever written, I enjoyed writing about that pairing.
