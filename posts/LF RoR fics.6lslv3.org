I have read a couple of fics where the RoR (room of requirement) is beeing used in interesting ways, - asking the room to provide training tools, books, create an avatar of hogwarts, a crystaline grotto with poils of water etc- So What fics do you guys know where the RoR is used in interresting new cool ways?

For anyone interested i can recommend is hermiones furry little problem, where hermione is turned cat-girl, (polyjuice 2'nd year) and has lots of harem fun, orgasmic releases in RoR turnes lots of wild magic loose in the castle that strengthens the wards, also, patronus in RoR has funny effect on muggle girl...


** "D.S.S. Requiremement": The DA gets a spaceship through the RoR.

** In linkffn(Silly Ruler Waving by Horace Nihil), the larger the space expansion, the slower the time inside the expanded area flows. So at one point when RoR is requested to produce a tropic island, it connects to some pocket space dimension (also accessible by other means) with time delay factor of 24:1.
