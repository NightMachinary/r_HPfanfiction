its very rare where you can find a good fic where harry uses a gun, like the fic "old soldiers never die", if there are any other good complete ones out there i would love to hear some recommendations.

** This one does? It's a pretty dark fic, so read the first authors note if you're unsure. First part is complete, sequel is WIP

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** I liked this one, but it got a little too realistic for me after a while (all the political arguments about who blames who for what, the in-group bickering, etc.)

And the fact that the normal MC and his best buddy were completely useless children, when previously in the series, they were always the ones rushing off to do the impulsive and brave thing. I never actually got over that characterization, and I liked the story less because of it.
