I thought about that Voldemort either happened later or that he send Bellatrix as some sort of Spy to the Order with the possible intention to attract some of the Members to his side. Bellatrix would be a rather unknown Person, unlike as in the Canon, and her Beauty and appearance would either be mostly intact or she would perform actions to regain this attribute. I wouldnt forbid that Lily or Alice might be attracted to Bella too. Maybe it was Voldys plan that he send her to find out, who of the Babies might be a bigger Threat by investigating the Families or Fathers potential. Anyway, it can also be AU by Voldemort is dead, she Harrys and Nevilles Parents survived and wants them put into a affair. It would be good if the Fic has obvious sexual content.

****** I liked the first half but it falls apart in the second half.

That been said no place in Cursed Child was good so I'd agree with this if it were the only option xD.

***** lol

I'm not fond of it either, but it does make a case for Bellatrix not being a faithful wife.
