I'm looking for dark magic that is far more vile than typically seen. Most of the dark magic we see in canon (not all though) is just 101 ways to painfully kill someone. Show me the vilest spells, artifacts, and rituals imaginable; things that corrupt and pervert reality around them. No more bone-breakers or blood-boilers, give me spells that cause people to go violently insane, twisted experiments that create monsters (ala Ekrizdis), and rituals that feed on souls to do terrible things. Magic that wields fear or creates foul locations is especially preferred!

Main character doesn't matter so much. Any of the main cast, or next-gen, as long as they are either hunting or performing vile magic. If the main character is using the magic, then none of the typical excuses by them of "Dark isn't evil, it's all intent!" unless they are attempting to corrupt others. I would strongly prefer stories that take place outside of Hogwarts unless it's crackish.

(As an aside, I've already read linkffn(Too Young to Die) and linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts), neither of which are what I'm looking for. TSoTP is amazing, but not evil. TYtD suffers from too much bad writing and awful cliches in my personal opinion. linkffn(The Nightmare Man) is closer to what I am looking for, but a bit too... angsty? Cliche? Something like that...)


** You probably want the Black Queen series, which starts with linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches)

A great deal of the magic therein is entirely disgusting, practised by vile, awful people. It's a compelling and well-written fic, albeit you occasionally have to catch yourself on that you're rooting for the protagonist, whose magic requires the regular practise of ritual murder, and still manages - by my admittedly rough reckoning - to be only the eighth or ninth most evil character in the story.

*** I love this series. Sure, she's evil. But she's also a badass, which is all I need to enjoy a fic.

**** I enjoyed it too, despite thinking that the world depicted therein would be /considerably/ improved by a visit en masse from the Most Holy Inquisition of the Imperium of Man.

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry

** Linkffn(I Am Lord Voldemort?)

Voldemort OC, somewhat AU magic system with heavy focus on seriously dark magic. The main character experiments on prisoners, sacrifices a few hundred muggles to power the ritual to turn his dead enemies into zombies, and turns other enemies into his most loyal followers through heavy use of extreme manipulation.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) has characters who partake in especially twisted facets of Dark Magic, especially in the most recent chapter. I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say I was internally screaming (in horror, and in awe).

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
