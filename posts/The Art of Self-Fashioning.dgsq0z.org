I'm reading the Art of Self-Fashioning and while it's an interesting story, I dislike Harry in it. Does he ever become more socially adept? Does he ever actually tell the truth to someone? Or get over his hatred of Slytherin?

If not, I don't think I'm going to continue reading.

P.S. I'm on chapter 6

  Does he ever become more socially adept?
#+end_quote

Yes, but not by much. He ends up with a couple friends, but he still has trouble navigating social circumstances.

#+begin_quote
  Does he ever actually tell the truth to someone?
#+end_quote

He gets discovered, so yes.

#+begin_quote
  Or get over his hatred of Slytherin?
#+end_quote

I don't remember his hatred of Slytherin being particularly strong to begin with, though it has been awhile since I read the work. But to my knowledge,Slytherin house in general doesn't play much of a role in later chapters.

** I recently read that one. Some parts of it were hard to read, either because it was hard to empathize with Harry, or because it could get slightly soul crushing. But it's a beautiful sort of despair, and it absolutely gets better. It's worth finishing.

***** If you can say "you are" then you can substitute you're, as that is the same thing. If "you are" doesn't fit, then you would use your.

What is /your/ name - what is /you are/ name doesn't work, use your.

Quit while /you're/ ahead - quit while /you are/ ahead works, so you can use the contraction of you are, you're.
