I think it'd be a funny subversion of the Evil!Dumbledore and Manipulative!Dumbledore cliches.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

**** Canon Dumbles is well-meaning but stupid (because Adults Are Useless and he's not the main character) and very, very much believes that great goods outweigh the small evils that they require---or, "the ends justify the means".

If at any point past, say, the fifth book, a magical switch was flipped from "these are characters/pawns/elements in a story, not real people" to "these are real people in a real universe with real goals and wants and needs" he wouldn't be evil. But, if the entire story was a bit more serious from the start, and he made the same choices, he very much would be.

  My take on the manipulative Dumbledore stories - from Dumbledore's point of view. Written late at night, not proof-read. Will probably go over it later, if people think it's worth a tidy-up.
