#+TITLE: Harry started laughing madly. When he woke up in 1883 as a baby Gellert Grincelwald, he thought his life couldn't get any crazier. Now as he looked at his two best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, sorry, he meant, Arcturus Black and Honoria Dumbledore, he had to swallow his words.

Ron is confused.

That by itself is not that strange. He and his friends have been doing nothing but getting into all sorts of situations since Hogwarts started. Situations that often range from bizarre, disastrously dangerous, and "how did you get out alive?" dangerous.

However, even with everything he had been through since then, he was still confident that this fits in for rank one, because seriously, what the fuck?

He vaguely recognizes the face of the man carrying him. Although he can't remember his name, he's pretty much sure he's seen it in some history book or something. Not to mention that he seems to be very clearly a Black. The man looks at him with a frown, as if wondering why he isn't crying. It is not normal for a newborn baby to be so quiet.

After a couple of minutes of staring at him, the man's expression changes and Ron feels like he's passed some kind of test. Immediately, the man turns to the woman lying on the bed, who until now had done nothing but yell at the nurse, asking her what was wrong with her baby.

"Ursula" says the man, drawing her attention.

"What, Phineas?"

“We will call him Arcturus, after my uncle; Arcturus Black II "

"Oh shit," Ron thinks, regretting that he had befriended Harry in the first place, the bastard had obviously passed his Potter luck on to him.

​

Hermione is scared.

Only a few hours ago she had been with her friends, planning the next DA meeting, and then going to bed like every night. And then all of a sudden everything was black and she felt enormous pressure all over her body.

Now, she stares at a woman with gray-blond hair (who honestly looked too old to be a mother) and tired-looking. At the edge of her vision, she leans out an equally old man whose face was wrinkled with concern.

Following some kind of weird instinct, Hermione screams.

The woman, surprised, begins to rock her in her arms while she murmurs sweet words in German. But Hermione is too shocked to pay attention.

"Quiet, mein Mädchen" the woman whispers, smiling, then turning to her husband. "Come meet your daughter, Wulfric."

The man, who until a few moments ago was laughing with relief, reacts and takes Hermione into his arms. Little tears of happiness spill from his eyes and his smile spreads from side to side.

"Hello, Honoria" his tears are shed. "Honoria Adelaide Dumbledore."

Hermione screams again.

​

Harry is really, really mad.

Not only did he have to suffer the detention with Umbitch again that night, but now he was in a strange room with two strange adults staring at him.

The first was a blonde woman with whitish blue eyes. Her face was flushed and her breathing was racing. A relieved smile spread across her face, as if she couldn't believe what her sight was telling her. Her shoulders were shaking slightly and her eyes were shining with joy.

Suddenly, Harry was aware that his body was /much/ smaller than it should be.

Bloody Potter luck.

The woman grabs him with her shaking hands and holds him against her chest, which might have been extremely uncomfortable if not for the fact that he was a bloody baby again.

The man (thin and scrawny, with blond to white hair and dark eyes) approaches them and begins speaking to the woman in German. Harry decides that he shouldn't be surprised that he's not only a baby again by some twisted quirk of fate, but that his new “parents” aren't even British.

Looking back at the German lessons he received in elementary school, he barely understands anything.

"What will his name be?"

The woman closes her eyes for a moment and when she opens them again, something fierce glows in them.

"Gellert"

/Oh my.../

"Gellert Grindelwald".

Harry Potter officially renounces life.

​

Bagryana Krum walks slowly through the corridors of the ship. Her journey to Durmstrang had only just begun and, as a prefect, it was her duty to help the new students with whatever problems they might have. She takes her obligations very seriously and, thus far, she had already comforted two children who missed their mothers, two others who could not find a bathroom, and one who suffered from serious dizziness due to the movement of the ship.

As she crosses a corner, she hears strange noises coming from one of the more distant rooms. Without much thought, she walks over and opens the door.

The first thing she sees is a little blond boy, probably a Grindelwald, rolling on the floor as he laughs like a total maniac. His hair is a complete mess and his uniform is ripped in various places. It's amazing how, even while he seems crazy, he still retains the natural grace that characterizes his family.

Then, she catches sight of a girl huddled in the corner, her head tucked between her legs and a high-pitched squeal drowning in her knees, writhing as if she wanted to disappear.

Lastly, there is a boy with black hair and gray eyes sitting in the middle of the room and looking completely lost. His eyes alternate between looking at the other kids and looking at his shoes. Finally, he buries his face in his hands and says, in a tearful voice:

“At least you will not be the parents of your own grandmothers. "

Suddenly, Bagryana is very happy that this is her last year at Durmstrang.

​

(I apologize for poor spelling or grammar. English is not my first language)

Before you guys say it, I know the title says "Grincelwald" instead of "Grindelwald", I'm wrong and I don't know how to edit it.

** I can totally see those three getting up to some serious shenanigans, what with them being them and the first half of the 20th century being the first half of the 20th century.

For example:

In this timeline, Grindelwald isn't on the run for being a Dark Lord, but for killing a number of reactionary German politicians across the political spectrum ( with you know who among them, of course). Nobody knows why he did it, but he didn't stop there and it started really getting on the ICW's nerves.

They roam the planet, basically emulating the A team and trying to prevent World War 2 from actually kicking off for as long as they can.

*** Well, it seemed like an easy excuse why Hermione is going to Durmstrang instead of Hogwarts. Her mother is a foreigner and after the bad reputation that got their name from Percival's actions, Wulfric Dumbledore and his wife decided to send their daughter elsewhere to protect her from being "the younger sister of a man who tortured and murdered Muggle boys for no reason". So they send her to Durmstrang.

***** I know Durmstrang is in Scandinavia. However, it also takes students from countries like Germany, Austria and Switzerland. There is also a Fanon thing about growing up that German is used as a lingua franca within Durmstrang (the language the classes are taught in, the language the books are in etc). which may be due to the fact that the name from the school "Durmstrang" comes from the German expression "Sturm und Drang".
