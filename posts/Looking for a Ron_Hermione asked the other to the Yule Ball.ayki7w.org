I can't remember who asked who. I think it was Hermione who asked Ron. Anyway, it kind of had a full, detailed background and thoughts about how the reacted to and felt about each other, like POV.

Hermione bought Ron new robes, taught him how to dance, etc. It was very sweet and fluffy. The twins got some ribbing in as well haha.

I read it in February but I can't remember the title ("What if" or something like that) and forgot to favorite it.

Any suggestions?

  Sometimes, one little thing changes everything. What if Ron had, for a change, thought before he spoke? Warning: ungodly amounts of fluff! COMPLETE. Rated T because I'm paranoid.
