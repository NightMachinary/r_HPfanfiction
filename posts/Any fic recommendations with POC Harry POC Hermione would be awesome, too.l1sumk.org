*** You can put it through culture as well as discrimination - it is part of the academic definition of ethnicity, after all. And that can go both ways. Exploring a character not raised in a culture exploring their heritage (eg. Indian Harry learns about India), or exploring how a character defies their heritage culture for whatever reason (eg. Maybe the Patils are Muggleborn and have super traditionalist parents, so there's some cultural conflict at home between the new Wizarding Cultures and the Older Traditional One.), or something else entirely.

  Hermione Granger, age 11, makes a wrong turn when shopping for her Hogwarts supplies and finds herself transported from the year 1991 to 1941. Tom Riddle doesn't know how to feel about the fact that by trying to cultivate Hermione's knowledge hungry side he's cultivated himself a younger sister.

  When she visits Diagon Alley, Hermione hates that the first thing the shop clerk in the apothecary tries to sell her is a potion to “tame her hair.” She likes her hair the way it is, curls and frizz, heavy around her shoulders. She thought the wizarding world would be different. (Black Hermione character study.)

  Harry Evans is a perfectly normal sixteen year old, thank you very much. Except that... he isn't. Not by anyone's standards. (Not when he can make things move with his mind). He tries not to let it bother him, but he's doing increasingly freakish things, and the world around him is getting stranger and stranger. People are following him, and speaking in metaphors, and somehow knowing his name. It's unnerving.He wonders when his life became this much of a fever dream. Or... Harry Potter somehow slipped under the radar, and now, 5 years after that first Hogwarts letter was sent out, they've finally found him. The world is darker, and more hopeless, and the Harry Potter they get seems like the furthest thing from a beacon of light. He's angry and reckless and world worn. But he's their only hope: the saviour of the Wizarding World. If only he gave a shit.

*** When a Shakespeare society casts a female Hamlet they are doing it because they want to see something different from a story they've heard a thousand times. The same is true for any other trait. Slytherin/Genius/Indy Harry are the same way, how does a change impact the story?

In the case of Desi Harry, did the Dursley's mistreat him more? Did other people ignore it easier because he was brown? What does Harry look for when he learns about his parents? A different wedding photo, different traditions. Maybe he can learn about Fleamont and Euphemia travelling over from India (in places where it breaks canon you patch up the holes with more ideas). How does Harry interact with the Patils? Do they expect him to know about his heritage or do they help him out. How does this change the Yule Ball? What is magic like in India? I doubt it's Latin based, do they have different spells and potions? Harry usually likes DADA, so are there differences in duelling? Are there unique dark creatures? What if that's why Harry's a parseltongue since there are more snakes in India? (Bloodline traits being strengthened by a muggleborn aligns with Tonks). What other characters have similar experiences by travelling to Britain? Even if there isn't a system of racism, could there also be regular stumbling blocks? Is Umbridge an even bigger bitch?

And actually a good 70% of the story has completely 0 changes. Voldemort is still the bad guy, and Harry still goes to Hogwarts.

I think the problems you mention start with Rowling. For example, why is Dean black? Where in the text does it explore that in any way? Why is Cho Asian?

Stories that make Poc Harry explicit usually try explore that in some way in the story, even if it's just a different outfit for the Yule Ball, or Harry reopens Potter Manor and it's got cool architecture. Lots of opportunities for storytelling.

  Harry Potter is 18 years old and he doesn't know who he is. It may be a bit dramatic to say something like that, because he realises he is Harry Potter. But he's just a random guy who doesn't even know what he likes to do for fun, now that Lord Voldemort has been defeated. Or, the one where Harry Potter doesn't know what to do with himself after the war, so he becomes an architect, makes new friends, falls in love, and accidentally changes the world.
