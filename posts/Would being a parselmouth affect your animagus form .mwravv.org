Like would it make your form a snake or an animal that can speak parseltounge or would it have no impact on your form apart from it being able to hiss


** I don't believe it would make your form a snake, as Animagus is kinda a representation of your true/primal(?) self in creature form. Just being able to make snake sounds while in other animal form seems quite meaningless, too, but it seems possible since Parseltongue is a magical ability and physical attributes while in human form don't seem to affect speech as seen in the Gaunt family.

*** That's a cool idea, being able to still speak parseltongue while in animal form, I dont think I've ever seen that in a fic before. It would work well for getting Intel, if your animagus form was a bird, they could carry a snake in, tell it where to go, and then carry it back out when it's got it.

** I honestly was thinking about that myself recently. My Harry in the fic I'm working on is a Parselmouth with a snake familiar, but for some weird reason I can see his animagus being a kitten rather than a snake, but I don't know if it would make more sense for a Parselmouth to be a snake animagus.

Though the idea of Harry as a little kitten riding on the back of his big snake is also adorable, or both Ron and Harry's snake tailing little kitten Harry because they're afraid he's going to get stepped on or hurt or something.

*** That sounds really adorable harry threatening someone as a cat and thinking he's terrifying while everyone else is really just scared of the big snake

**** LOL, itsy bitsy kitten with its fur all spiked up trying to be intimidating and this giant snake glaring protectively from right behind him where Harry can't see him but the other person can. ((Though Harry would probably realize his snake is scarier than he is.))

*** Teah i always saw harry as a bird as well but as parceltounge is a magical ability directly connected with a animal i was wondering how that would affect the animagus form

*** Or wolf (some kind of pack predator). Certainly, nothing to do with snakes (not that I would have anything against snakes, but not Harry-like).

** Off-topic but congratulations on using the correct verb. People bitch about small things like your/you're, but my real pet peeve is affect vs effect.

On topic, from what I gather from JK's writing and the fact that the spell uses the word 'anima', the animagus form will take the shape of your spirit animal. Parselmouth seems to be an independent skill of your true nature, however the few true Parselmouths we see in the series (Voldemort and the Gaunts) take much pride in this skill. In fact Voldemort is better friends with snakes than with people. So I would imagine that if prior to your first transformation, you allowed this skill to define your identity to the point that you feel more like a snake than a human, it could be likely that you may turn into a snake.

Harry, on the other hand, who is only capable to speak with snakes because he's a horcrux and doesn't put much value on the skill except for practical purposes, I would expect not to be affected by it.

** Does being an animal allow you to speak to animals? For example, if my animagus */was/* a snake, would I be able to speak parseltongue/snake-talk?

*** I think Sirius was able to somewhat communicate with Crookshanks, in his dog form but I don't know on what level.
