Also the new chapter is twice as long as the other ones! It's 7,000 and the last biggest one was 3,000!!! :) :) :) The chapters keep getting bigger, but I want to make them stay kind of the same length...so I guess I can just make my maximum size 10,000 and stay below that? :)

Edit: Sorry the link just opens up on the newest chapter as a start! Is that how I should be doing it, or should I always link to the FIRST chapter so people aren't confused? :)

#+begin_quote
  When a fragment of a darkest soul takes refuge in the body of an innocent baby, life is not one lived unscathed - nor unaffected. 11 year old Sadie Potter has lived her whole life knowing this as truth. Now, the time comes for the rest of the world around her to know the same. But will she find help, acceptance and comfort from those around her, or adversity and hate born of fear?
