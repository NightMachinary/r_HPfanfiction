Okay I might have put a post under the wrong kind of flair. Specifically, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/92z69s/the_slighly_altered_and_still_incomplete_story_of/][this one.]] I would really appreciate some opinions, advice and suggestions as I really wanna continue this story, but don't know how.


** Hi! Don't have too much time right now, but I read the beginning... At first I thought it was a summary. There is a bit too much exposition for my taste.

**** Everybody needs to find their own writing style, but maybe try and not tell us all of this background information in one go? We don't need to the parents' names right at the start etc

***** I suppose at first I was influenced by JK Rowling's story about Isolt Sayre and Ilvermorny. But soon I wanted to build my own little corner of the world.

** Unless I'm in love with an opening line, I usually drop the reader into the middle of some dialogue to start a story. The way your writing is structured right now it's hard to see how you would make the transition from description to action. I guess I would suggest taking what you have and using it as background: imagine something interesting happening to the character you've created and then drop us into the middle of that action. Draw from your character notes as necessary, but don't repeat them. Alternatively, you could find a story that you connect with and try copying the structure the author used. /my two cents.
