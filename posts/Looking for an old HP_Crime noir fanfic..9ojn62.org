Some years ago (Can't remember when) I stumbled upon a reddit post that was some sort of harry potter/crime noir cross-over. The wizarding world had been exposed, and had taken to the modern muggle world very poorly. Goblins ran the alleys in track suits and polyjuice potion seemed to take the place of crack or heroin. The two main characters were a man/woman team. I would very much like to read this again, and find out if there were any updates or sequels.

â€‹Anyone? Bueller?
