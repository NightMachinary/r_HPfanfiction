Just interested in reading stories where it was written before, or during one or more of the books, just to see other people's outtakes on them.

No character bashing please, characters disliking or hating a character is fine, but a author going out of their way to hate on a character is usually a no go.

Would rather it be completed if possible.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash, and it can be on any site.

It can be dark or not as well.

Horcruxes can or don't have to be a thing.


** *Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor* linkffn(2841153)

This fic actually made me stop and count horcruxes in my head. Because some of them are different. And in different locations.

​

*A Black Comedy* linkffn(3401052)

One of the horcruxes were different. How canon ended was different.

​

Both of these fics started *before* Book7, yet still continued on their path until they completed *after* Book7 released.

** id recommend the works of Jenorama, she began posting on the old Checkmated site probably before HBP and DH, maybe even OoTP. A series of one shots that led to her biggest story, California Dreamin', and several shorter stories after, so all set in her Potterverse. Harry/Ginny is the main ship, and Ginny is a healer (a popular career theory for her back then). I really love the way she writes Ron tho, a rarity these days. Find her on Ao3 and on the HarryandGinny discord page often
