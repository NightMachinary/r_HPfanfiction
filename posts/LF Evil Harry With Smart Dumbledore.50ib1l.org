I don't actually know if I've read one before but I'm looking for stories where Dumbledore isn't some manipulative but impossibly incompetant fool or some rose colored glasses wearing fluffy optimist who believes Harry can do no wrong.

I want to read a story where Harry has to fight tooth and nail for every advance in his evil plan.

If there are no fics like that, how would you all feel about one being written? I'll probably pester my writing partner into letting me bounce ideas off of him.

*** This somewhat fits the bill. Dumbledore can't truly punish Harry for the \six\ murders he has committed before age 14 because Harry is truly insane. Up until the latest recent chapters, most people, Dumbledore included, know that Harry is an extreme wildcard to be approached with extreme caution.

**** The amusing thing is, despite his insanity, Harry is in a way the most sane of the lot of them.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is Worthy of Magic and who isn't.
