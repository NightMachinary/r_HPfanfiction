Preferably he goes bad in the end and joins voldy but idk if there's any like that

Like, imagine Dumbledore bringing you Harry to be the perfect little saint weapon yeah, then a couple years into Hogwarts Harry ends up letting slip hes been contacting Voldemort for years and leave to join him and bam evil explodes and Harry and voldy win

If there's any remotely like that or even if Harry's just brought up in Hogwarts ðŸ˜‚ but preferably not with the whole fic as Harry as a young child. I've not read nearly as much of those as I have where snape adopts Harry and they hate each other but the child ones bore me ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
