:END:
I read this a long time ago, way back when I was engrossed in the fandom. Now I've gotten back into reading fanfiction and I remembered this fic I can't find. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, and I think Snape are forced to live in a house in the muggle world. Two notable moments I remember...

Hermione leaves cooking duties to Snape and Draco and comes back seeing a mess and screaming “YOU BOILED THE SAUCE”

And Sybill Trelawney looking through the fridge yelling trying to find her sherry.

It was solely humor I believe and I read it on fanfic.net. Any info would be appreciated.
