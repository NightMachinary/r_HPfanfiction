Did not think this was a genre I would be interested in. Found a short story and I realized there are a lot of issues here that are very interesting. I would like to find a as-close-to-canon story except for fem!harry, but would be interested to read any compelling story.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A_Butterfly_Effect][A Butterfly Effect]] is an excellent OC Fem!Harry fic.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4606270/1/Effects-and-Side-Effects][Effects and Side Effects]] is an excellent Harry-turned-female fic.

You could also browse the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/community/Miss-Potter/19146][Miss Potter]] community on ff.net. Most of it is self-insert crap... but there are a few gems scattered throughout.

** My favorite girl!Harry is my own.

Holly Evans [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path]]

Then again, I came up with those ideas, so to say my opinion is tainted doesn't even begin to cover it.

** I'm currently writing one called [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/1/The-Snow-Queen][The Snow Queen]], an HP/HG (harry potter/ hunger games, ya doofuses) crossover fic. Expect everyone to be a bit OOC though. Ok, a lot OOC. And [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/699762/The-Mad-Mad-Reviewer][the Mad Mad Reviewer]] is definitely the shit if you're into fem!Harry and time travel. Enjoy, my friend!
