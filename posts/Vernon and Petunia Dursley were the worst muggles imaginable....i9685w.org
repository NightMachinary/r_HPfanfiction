...That is, the worst /acting/ muggles imaginable. The Dursley's are magical themselves but, in their efforts to be more like muggles, more normal, they've made themselves stand out even more. Now they have their probably-wizard nephew in a basket on their doorstep, and have to decide whether to continue their charade or face the music.


** Okay then, more dreaming: Petunia secretly loved Severus, but she knew he wasn't going to be good for her and she could see that he loved Lily so she kept her mouth quiet for the whole rest of her life. Maybe Harry learns of this one day! Maybe not.

*** I find myself awfully fond of a trope I saw used a couple times, but am sadly never in position to incorporate it in my own fics. Basically, Umbridge canonically has a squib brother. In the trope, said younger brother was treated like shit when the family found out he was a squib, and he eventually ran away to the muggle world, taking his wife's name when he married - Dursley. Due to his hatred of magic, he raised Vernon and Marge to be as mundane as possible, including refusing Vernon entry to Hogwarts when the letter arived. When he eventually told him about it, Vernon got angry about being denied learning about magic (just like Petunia did), and they easily hit it off over their hatred of magic.

*** There are plenty of theories about delayed magic (e.g., linkffn(Petunia Snaps by Meester Lee)), some state between squib and a witch, e.g., the hedge-witch in linkffn(There Will Be No Foolish Wand Waving by kgfinkel).

And that is not about Vernon, he is [[https://web.archive.org/web/20110827061839/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=26][canonically]] the most anti-magic person possible.

Prompt: Harry and friends conspire to infect Voldemort with Dursley DNA, in order to neutralise the Dark Lord's magic and make him a squib.

****** But wouldn't a love potion exposed to even a hair of Vernon lose its magical properties due to his sheer antimagicalness?\\
That'd be funny too; imagine Snape or Slughorn with a bottle of Vernon Dursley hair, sprinkling it on potions gone wrong to neutralise them. Or using them like a bezoar to neutralise poisons.

**** Just to point out there's a difference between something being a theory and something being in a fic. The word theory imparts a level of authority that suggests it has some sort of canonical basis.

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?

*** Petunia was homeschooled because Hogwarts had too many students at the time. By bad luck of the draw, Petunia was chosen as one of the persons who wouldn't get to attend.

Vernon is a near-Squib who changed his name after his pureblood family cast him out.

Alternative because it's fanfic and making big changes is fair game: They both went to Hogwarts, all the students were absolute dicks to them, so they went "nope, sod all this, we're out" and left magical society.
