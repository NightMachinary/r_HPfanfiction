Well... after reading a story where harry is born inside of a sterile room with normal birth, I wonder if there's method of childbirth that is more magical? Side along apparate that splinch the baby inside of the mother's womb so that they are separated, partial engorgement so that the cervix is larger, thus allowing easier childbirth, or something like an extension charm implemented on the womb, or any kind of childbirth that feels magical or old instead of mundane and modern?


** "But how are you up again? You gave birth not even ten minutes ago!" Andromeda wanted to know in disbelief as her daughter walked through the ward of the Royal Dutch Hospital for Wizards and Witches, Teddy cradled to her chest. Perhaps if she had not been so shocked to see the pink haired witch wandering through the corridor, she would have paid more attention to the little bundle in her arms and its blue, no wait, orange patch of hair, but with everything else going on, this was a little too much for the disgraced Black .

"I thought it is obvious," Tonks pointed out without turning her attention away from her son who was happily matching her oscillating hair colours.

"And why did it take them so long to inform me? By the time I got here, I was told that I am already a grandmother."

"Mum, I can do way more than turn my nose into a pig snout, you of all people should remember that."

"So you used your gift?"

"Yup. Took all of three minutes until - "

"3 Minutes? 3? Tres? Drei? Trois? Drie? Tre?"

"Uhm, yes," the metamorph replied and briefly wondered if maybe her mother has finally lost it. With the war going on and Edwards disappearance -

"Nymphadora Nymeria Tonks, you are grounded! For the remaining year!"

"Muummm!" she wailed out of habit before even thinking about the absurdity of her mother grounding her at the tender age of 24. Or the reason for it.
