this can either be a kinda Canon compliant one that have a surviving Bellatrix or the Men or Woman travel into an AU and there meet a (slighty) different Person.

Actually i find the idea of Harry and Neville, who both lost loved Persons (atleast Nevilles Parents still live and there is slight hope for recovery, but....hmmm) grow over time attracted to a Female (former) enemy, quite tempting. Maybe Bella indeed survives the War or the circumstances are that they need to work together with her.

It can also be a total AU fic with Bellatrix never turned the dark way, but behave like her old one at some points.

Or it might be a Noir like Fic.

Affair/infidelity is ok.

Maybe Bella use this attraction to play with them or she has some fun in her own way. I would also accept it, if both sides are attracted to each other. But something like Romance wouldnt happen.


** Only thing I can think of is linkffn(watching over harry) bella was under potions and imperius curse. Neville doesnt fall for her but she and harry do get together with the help of some Black family magic. It's really good though not kind to Dumbledore molly or ron

  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.
