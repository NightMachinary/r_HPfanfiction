Recently, I've been seeing a lot of people go around yelling that Sirius tried to kill Snape. I disagree.

Imagine a scenario where a wild animal (lion, tiger, bear, whatever) is locked inside a house and the doors open to a password - which I know. The windows, doors and other entry points are completely secure and made of a mixture of mithril and unobtainium - essentially, the only way to get inside the house is with the passphrase. I know there is a wild animal inside the house. I go up to someone who hates me (the feeling's mutual) and strongly suspects that there is a wild animal inside the house and tell him the passphrase, he goes there and nearly gets himself killed.

Sirius is a prick to betray the key to Remus' secret to Snape (as far as friendships go, it's just about un-salvageable), but the fact is that no one forced Snape to go looking for Remus. That's all on Snape. From Snape and Lily's conversation later on, it's clear than he strongly suspects Lupin to be a werewolf and has shared his theory with Lily before the conversation. And from Lily's words, that memory was the first time they spoke about that incident after it happened, so Snape had suspicions before the incident (because otherwise, Lily wouldn't know about Snape's theory).

So - why would Snape decide to follow Lupin, who he strongly suspects of being a werewolf, on the night of the full moon? Snape is intelligent (we certainly see him bragging about it often enough), he knows how dangerous werewolves are to humans. Also, Snape hates SIrius, why would he take Sirius' word for anything at all?

I get defending Snape, but really, the only one to blame for Snape putting himself in that situation is Snape himself.

It's sort of like how Harry decides to go after Voldemort in his first year - Albus is responsible for putting the stone there, but it's not like he forced Harry to go and protect it. Harry is almost certain that the Dark Lord is going to be down there, but Harry chooses to go stop Voldemort anyway. Or saving Ginny in second year - Harry is almost certain that the monster inside the chamber is a basilisk, and no one forced Harry to do it - Harry chooses to do it. And that makes a lot of difference.

It's the same with Snape - nobody forces Snape to do anything stupid, Snape just does it anyway (and cries foul about it later on).

I am not trying to excuse Sirius' behaviour towards Remus (this should have ended their friendship), but the idea that Sirius tries to kill Snape is plain wrong.


** I never saw it like Sirius trying to kill Snape because I don't think Sirius really thought the consequences through. I think he wanted to scare Snape, not murder him. It's kind of like Hagrid with his monster-pets, Sirius spent a lot of time around transformed Remus, so he kind of forgot how truly dangerous a werewolf was. Plus, in PoA Remus says there was many close calls (of him biting someone) and they laughed it off. If they brushed off people they didn't know (probably) like that, Sirius hardly would have cared about Snape whom he hated.

As for Snape having only himself to blame. I agree that part of the blame does lie on him. He did knowingly put himself in danger, nobody forced him. However, Sirius did intentionally bait him, knowing he most likely would go to the Shack. In my eyes, he was guilty of malicious intent at least.

And I also agree that Sirius' betrayal of Remus trust was huge in this case.

***** Well-spotted. This debunks the ridiculous theory that Snape went to Sirius to tell him he knows about Lupin, and Sirius replied that he could find him under the Shrieking Shack.

Sirius was convinced Snape didn't know Lupin was a werewolf, and he purposefully sent Snape into the jaws of a werewolf. That's murderous intent.

If anything, it's possible Snape suspected Lupin was a werewolf, and Sirius told him /something else/ was down there, to alleviate his suspicions.

** I see Sirius' action as the action of a very immature teenager who does things in the spur of the moment without considering possible consequences.

Like those teenagers who throw stones and other heavy objects from bridges on cars or from houses onto the sidewalk just for fun, without realising that their action could kill people. If you call them out on it they get apologetic and say "Sorry, we did not think this through." and generally stop, but until you catch them at it or somebody from their age-group calls them out on it they will often continue. Teenager stupidity at its worst.

Sirius is the type of boy who rough-houses for fun at a bus stop or at the train platform and might even push somebody in the general direction of the incoming train or bus, not expecting anything bad to happen, because it never did before. Until there is an accident.

** the entire werewolf incident is ridiculous, to be honest

i don't think sirius tried to kill snape, because i don't think it was that premeditated. it was, more than likely, an impulsive and thoughtless action

remus and sirius echo or don't challenge snape's version of events- that sirius played a trick on snape; that it was something done /to/ snape

you can create a scenario where sirius and snape make assumptions about what the other is thinking

- sirius tells snape how to get past the willow, thinking he wouldn't trust him and actually go

- snape assumes sirius wouldn't actually put him in serious harm's way, so that he's telling him means he wouldn't be in immediate danger if he does go

snape /suspected/ lupin was there, but he doesn't know what state lupin is in, what the room is like, etc. maybe he's restrained

sirius expresses no remorse. james also finds out- either sirius knew snape went and didn't care, or james found out somehow and james assumed snape would go anyway

*** My theory is that Snape's theory was "they are/are trying to become illegal animagi". It makes eveything fall into place, including Lily's dismissiveness and why it was suddenly urgent for Sirius to get rid of Snape etc.

But people are just fanatically attached to the idea that Snape knew, even though this theory just defies parsimony. If he knew, or even suspected it, he would have had a month at least to prepare for the contingency of being trapped alone with a werewolf. It's so stupid, seriously. And they somehow maintain that Snape was both clever enough to figure Lupin's secret out when no one else has, and dumb enough to walk into the SS alone.

From the moment of figuring it out to the moment of going down the tunnel, Snape would have had, by the laws of astrophysics, a month. A month to plan how to tackle the werewolf he's expecting. A month to come up with a better plan then "walk into a predator's cage and hope for the best". Impulsiveness doesn't apply to this particular case of recklessness, it's not like doing it without protection in the heat of the moment.

Snape did not necessarily see Pomfrey leading Lupin down every month, only that one time. Nor do you know for certain that she /always/ did accompany him, actually.

The staff is helping a student become an illegal animagi is as absurd, prima facie, as "the staff is concealing a fucking werewolf in a castle full of kids without their parents' knowledge or consent". Snape could have figured they were lying to her about something or I don't know what.

It's a much better theory than "Snape alone figured it out and then decided to go get mauled to death to make a point". If anything, Pomfrey's involvement, to Snape, would suggest something much /less/ sinister than anything he might have suspected. Unless you think the theory was "Snape not only knew, he also knew about the staff's involvement", and yet he still believed he had any chance at all of getting anyone expelled.

The wannabe DE in question is also still best friends with Lily so he is not that far gone just yet. Furthermore, he wouldn't share his werewolf theory with Lily before commiting murder, to the point that she's sick and tired of it. If you're planning a murder, you don't make it look premeditated.

Also, Lupin was guaranteed to transform again, like clockwork, the next month and the month after that. He had 10 full moons to kill Lupin on, in years 6 and 7, when he wasn't friends with Lily anymore and much deeper in with the DEs, and also with a much bigger reason to hate Dumbledore.

It's obvious that the prank and the cover up pushed him further toward the DEs.

Your theory assumes that keeping a werewolf in the castle is indeed illegal and Snape knows this, since otherwise it wouldn't discredit Dumbledore that he had admitted Lupin.

The wannabe Death Eater was /obsessed/ with Lily and delusional to the point that he thought, according to JKR's words, that joining the Death Eaters would /impress/ Lily, even after their friendship ending argument in fifth year. He would definitely think killing a werewolf would impress her.

And, knowing that Lupin is a werewolf, incapacitates him, which he did not do as a teen, which means he was unprepared as ac teen. Snape rushing alone toward immediate danger exemplifies his courage, and, if you insist, his desire to be the one who catches Black and wreak his revenge. This is completely different - on Snape's part. Black's behavior, however, and his words, do indicate that he never got over his obsessive hatred toward Snape - which supports an intent to kill all these years ago.

And yet, when he went down there, he was unprepared. Should have spent less time coming up with potion mods and more time studying up on how to kill werewolves, I guess, if he was gonna go face on of his own volition. Almost as though he didn't know.

You are hell bent on whitewashing someone who, even according to you, is callous enough to betray and endanger his friend. According to you, it's almost as though Black cares less about Lupin than he does about Snape - he doesn't mind either of them dying, but it is Lupin whom he puts in danger Lupin absolutely can't control or prevent. No. Someone who would treat his friend like that is much more likely to be someone who is perfectly willing to kill an enemy. Sirius tried to kill Snape by his own account as well as Snape's, Lupin's, and Dumbledore's. And implicitly, James's, who had understood what Sirius had done and prevented it.

You keep saying he didn't know, even though nearly everything from his memories leads towards him having a suspicion of what Lupin was - him watching Pomfrey lead Lupin to the Willow, watching Lupin get sick several months in a row under the same circumstances, and trying to follow the Marauders at night - literally everything points to him trying to get them in trouble in any way possible.

Don't try to turn this into some sort of rant giving reasons why Snape would do that - the fact is that Snape did. Snape could have just said fuck you to Sirius and done literally anything else.

This is pure fanon.

Dumbledore says he remembers exactly what happened - Snape going off on his volition to an out-of-bounds area where a werewolf was present.

Snape's own account...well, the less said about that, the better.

And it's like you can't comprehend basic English, even. Sirius doesn't force anything on Snape. Snape chooses to go to the Willow and beyond --- in spite of knowing that the Willow is dangerous, nearly permanently injured another boy in their year. All that Snape gets up to is Snape's own doing.

If Snape kills himself with a cutting curse to the neck, would you blame Ollivander, and the teachers at the school? Ollivander sold him his wand, and the teachers gave him the knowledge of the cutting curse - according to your "logic", are they responsible for Snape choosing to kill himself?

Your animagus theory is outlandish - like a member of the school would help an underage student to learn to become an animagus. Or the fact that Snape would suspect them of trying to become animagi, because animagi are incredibly rare. There are only 7 registered animagi and 4 unregistered animagi (1 during the time of the incident) in that century.

It'd take someone with an extreme bias to still believe Snape has no responsibility for his own actions. But then ---

I'd ask you to look in the mirror once in a while - I remember your comments from the other post here where you went around justifying Snape joining the Death Eaters (along with everything else) because he was poor, had a bad childhood, was bullied and so on - but the thing with you Snape stans is that you're pretty much completely unable to accept a view of Snape that doesn't involve him shitting rainbows and unicorns.

Gee, I was ragged in college and my friend was poor, but we didn't join any mass murdering death cults. Do we deserve awards of some kind?

Talking to a Snape fan is like talking to a brick wall. There's just no point.

******* Before I check out of this discussion, a couple of things, and then you may have the last word and keep it.

First, the difference is that while I attempt to understand and explain why Snape has become a DE, I'm not denying that he was one. You are attempting to outright deny a major plot point.

Second, I am not passing my theory off as canon, but as a fan theory. It, at least, has the advantage of not making Snape or Lily look like a couple of idiots when canonically, neither of them were.

Third, your entire premise hinges on a single line in the book and yet, when [[/u/Vrajitoarea][u/Vrajitoarea]] quoted a single line in the books about Snape and Lucius, you dismissed it as bad writing or an incidental inclusion, even though a close relationship between Snape and the Malfoys is established from PS onward. You wanna play this game? Fine. The line about Snape having a theory is bad writing and was included by accident. Harry himself, and the narrative, however, dwell not on Snape's theory but on how he went toward the Slytherins and "away from Lily".

Fourth, re the medal you deserve for not joining a death cult, you're describing trauma that has happened to you as an adult (and I'm sorry it happened to you). As a college student, which already means you were priveleged enough to attend college, at least. You /also/ have the privelege of not having been targeted by a cult, which Snape was. As for whether or not you deserve praise for this, of course you don't. Non-addicts aren't praised for not drinking. Addicts are. It's harder to change than it is to stay out of trouble in the first place. That... is the point of Snape's story. Among many other points JKR has skillfully illustrated and that you've chosen to dismiss in favor of total nonsense. Have a nice life.

** The issue is intention. You're absolutely right by saying Sirius didn't tell Snape to go down there, at least not directly. But by giving him the information to get down there he was indirectly sending him to his doom. Sirius knew damn well that Snape would feel compelled to prove himself right. Snape hated them and would stop at nothing to defame their good names. Now in all fairness Snape was already pretty sure Remus was a werewolf, so he should have known better than to try and get near him. Except in this case Snape's jealousy and hatred clouds his judgement, something Sirius was counting on. Upon hearing what Sirius told Snape James acts immediately because he knew Snape wouldn't be able to resist. Considering James and Sirius were best friends it's likely they both knew that Snape getting this info would mean he'd go check it out. Sirius had without a doubt intended for Snape to get himself hurt, but I don't think he realized how much that would've hurt Remus. Remus would've been overcome with guilt had he attacked Snape, I'm surprised he stayed friends with Sirius after such an attempt. Sure, Snape should've minded his business, especially considering his suspicions, but Sirius is definitely guilty in this situation. In fact the true victim would've been Lupin. Remus would've had to live the rest of his life with the guilt of either making Snape have to live the horror he did once a month, or even worse killing him.

**** Agree with the last part, but Snape's worst memory is after this whole event, and we see Sirius and Remus talk and joke quite normally there. So if they fell out they must have fallen back in before the end of the school year. More likely, I personally think, is that Remus (who also has shit self esteem and blames himself for anything and everything) felt so indebted to his three friends because they stayed friends with him after they found out he was a werwolf and even became animagi for him, that he would have forgiven him quite quickly. Maybe not forgotten, though, because something, maybe a change in how he acted towards him, definitely led to Sirius suspecting him to be a traitor a few years later.

However, 'Reckless Endangerment' is a heavy charge, and Sirius' actions would even qualify as 'First Degree Reckless Endangerment because a) he engaged in conduct that created a grave risk of death, b) he was aware of and consciously disregarded this risk, and c) his behavior before and afterward demonstrated 'depraved indifference', i.e. an utter disregard for the value of human life -- a willingness to act, not because he means to cause grievous harm, but because he simply does not care whether or not grievous harm will result. In other words, a person who is depravedly indifferent is not just willing to take a grossly unreasonable risk to human life. Instead, that person does not care how the risk turns out.

In real life that sort of behavior is considered heavy enough to warrant a 2-7 year prison sentence.

The biggest issue though is that even reckless endangerment is looking at from a muggle justice system. In the magical world, the fact that Sirius was a member of House Black means that no matter what, he would have been afforded every single leeway and allowance imaginable. The folks who say that Sirius did nothing wrong are actually looking at things as most of the Wizarding World would look at it with regards to what Sirius did.

The reality is that Snape was a half blood and thus, to make in the Wizengamot and in "high society", his death wouldn't have mattered much and would have likely been seen, in dying to Remus, as a good thing because a) it would have lead to a werewolf being executed and b) it would have been grounds for discrediting and getting rid of Dumbledore, a known muggle sympathizer. So they would have considered, maybe not publically, what Sirius did as not just "nothing wrong" but possibly "acceptable" and "laudable".

There's no way they'd expell him. We also know that he's been hanging out with people who went on to become Death Eaters. It wouldn't have been illegal to kill a transformed werewolf.

Based on Fudge's reaction to Lupin's stint as teacher in the 4th book, after Snape had outed him, it's safe to say that the Ministry never knew that there was a werewolf at Hogwarts. Snape must've counted on the Ministry's support after killing Lupin, simultaneously discrediting Dumbledore and increasing his reputation with Voldemort's supporters. At that point, Snape was fully on his way to become a Death Eater.

** The impression I got from the books is that Snape followed the Marauders around at school trying to catch them at wrongdoing/get them into trouble with the ultimate goal to get them expelled. They bullied him and he bullied them. He stalks them to the point he realizes they go somewhere every full moon and makes his deductions, tells Lily who doesn't believe him. Nowhere does it say Snape knew that Dumblerore approved of a werewolf going to Hogwarts, I think what Snape was trying to do was expose Lupin as a werewolf the other three Marauders had been hiding and thus get all four of them expelled for doing something majorly against the rules. We know Lupin is the first werewolf to ever go to Hogwarts so there wasn't a precedent.

Sirius does a really shitty thing to Remus for reasons we don't know. I don't think we can know for sure if he wanted Snape killed, scare him to stop following them around or if he was uncharacteristically stupid in the moment and didn't realize what the consequences would be. Fortunately James did. Snape went down and glimpsed the werewolf and was pulled out of harms way by James. We don't know what punishments anyone got or indeed if anyone was blamed by Dumbledore for the event. We only know that Dumbledore forbade Snape to tell anyone that Lupin was a werewolf.

I agree that Snape is mostly to blame for putting himself in danger, and it also explains why he would have hated James even more afterwards, rather than Sirius. James saved his life when he did something he later must have realized was stupid and he was indebted to him. I would speculate that Snape, who by all means is very intelligent, went to see a werewolf on a full moon night because he thought that he wouldn't be believed that there was a werewolf at all unless he had proof, and therefore decided he needed to see it with his own eyes, show Dumbledore and then get his enemies expelled. Maybe he had already told a professor of his suspicions and they had told him he was wrong (which they would since they would have to protect Remus). Snape too was uncharacteristically stupid in this scenario, but I think in the books we are shown a more obsessive and manic side of him so I think it just about fits with his character.

Hard disagree on both these statements. Lupin never went to transform alone, he was always accompanied by a member of the staff, Pomfrey according to canon. Snape knew that whatever Lupin was doing, the staff was aware of it. I'd say that he went there to kill Lupin since he figured out that he was a werewolf only to realize that he'd bitten off more than he could chew but James pulled him away before he could get anywhere close, this saving his life.

**** Ah my mistake! There goes that head canon then... I really thought it made most sense that way.

This makes it very confusing why Snape went there in the first place, unless like you suggest he wanted to kill the monster. But if he knew the staff approved of it then he should have realized that it would lead to him getting expelled and possibly sent to prison, depending on the ministry's stance on killing werewolves. And that's really out of character for Snape, I think, he would have wanted to harm the Marauders but not to the extent where he would ruin his own life. Unless he was a lot more self-destructive as a kid than as an adult.

Maybe Snape thought that just Madam Pomfrey was in on it, not the other staff... A bit far-fetched too I'll admit.

***** Based on Fudge's reaction to Lupin's stint as teacher in the 4th book, after Snape had outed him, it's safe to say that the Ministry never knew that there was a werewolf at Hogwarts. Snape must've counted on the Ministry's support after killing Lupin, simultaneously discrediting Dumbledore and increasing his reputation with Voldemort's supporters. At that point, Snape was fully on his way to become a Death Eater.

** Source for Snape "strongly suspecting Lupin of being a werewolf"?

Explanation for why Snape doesn't give that information to the Malfoys and the Lestranges, who would use it to create a huge scandal, get Dumbledore fired, and the Marauders (notable blood traitors) expelled? It would be an immense victory for Voldemort, who would be very pleased with Snape.

Explanation for why Snape decides, instead, to kill himself by going to the Shack to... what? See what he supposedly knows, already?

Explanation for why Lupin and Sirius, who were there and saw Snape's reaction to meeting a werewolf, say Snape didn't know?

The fact that Sirius thought Snape didn't know Lupin was a werewolf makes it, at the very least, attempted murder with oblique intent - even if he didn't intend that particular consequence of his action, he could foresee it and he accepted it. The undeniable evidence of Sirius accepting it is the fact that he didn't even bother going with James to help him stop Snape.

Snape's only fault, in that entire incident, was that he didn't realise Sirius was a sociopath.

And Sirius's actions clearly made an impression on everyone, from Lupin, to Dumbledore, to McGonagall. There's a reason /absolutely nobody/ doubted Sirius was a mass murderer capable of killing his own friends.

  ‘He's ill,' said Lily. ‘They say he's ill --'

  ‘Every month at the full moon?' said Snape.

  *‘I know your theory,' said Lily,* and she sounded cold. ‘Why are you so obsessed with them, anyway? Why do you care what they're doing at night?'
#+end_quote

Lily has heard Snape talk about this subject often enough to respond with exasperation rather than curiosity. More than that, it must have taken Snape some time to note that Lupin is always ill or otherwise on a full moon.

#+begin_quote
  It would be an immense victory for Voldemort, who would be very pleased with Snape.
#+end_quote

Voldemort didn't know Snape from Adam at this point. The sequence of events goes Werewolf Incident -> Mudblood Incident -> Snape becomes a DE. At this point Snape and Lily are still talking so, while he's palling around with Avery and Mulciber, he doesn't have a massive impetus to actually become a DE.

As for why Snape wouldn't hand the information over to people like Malfoy or the Lestranges (who are all graduated and have probably largely forgotten about Severus Snape), he has no proof. That's the point. All he has prior to going down to the Shrieking Shack is this idea that Lupin is a werewolf. What Sirius told Snape was how to get past the Whomping Willow, with the implication that getting past the Willow would give Snape the answers he sought.

#+begin_quote
  anyway, Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me towards the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it would be -- er -- amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree-trunk with a long stick, and he'd be able to get in after me.

Lily has heard Snape talk about *something*, which he is trying to use as proof that the Marauders, particularly James and Sirius, are shitty people. Setting aside the fact that the werewolf theory would not help Snape prove that, it would also make the entire conversation nonsensical, or Lily is evil.

Let's assume this is the case:

- Snape comes up with the theory that Lupin is a werewolf (but keeps it to himself, for some reason, instead of just telling everyone - it would be impossible to hide the truth);

- Snape repeatedly bring up the theory to Lily;

- Snape is almost killed by "something" in the Shrieking Shack, and James is present;

- Snape is suddenly bringing the werewolf theory up, immediately after the event, during his first conversation with Lily

At this point, there are two options:

-> Lily is a complete moron, who can't put 2 and 2 together

-> Lily is a monstrous friend, who understands that her "best friend" (in her own words) has just been almost murderer by a werewolf, that the dude she considers a bullying toerag" was involved and yet... instead of asking Snape if he's OK, she takes the bully's side. She also displays zero shock at the confirmation of having a werewolf in her dorm - something that even pure-blood wizards are shown to find shocking and scary.

Now, I think Lily was neither imbecilic, nor a monster, and Snape was neither imbecilic, nor suicidal, so the idea of him knowingly walking into the jaws of a werewolf is nonsensical Sirius white-washing.

The Mudblood incident takes place the same school year as the Werewolf incident, and Lily explicitly accuses Snape of wanting to become a DE. Lily ended the friendship because Snape was considering joining the DEs, not the other way around.

Granted, Sirius seems a bit obsessed with Snape, but even so. Lucius was probably the one who even introduced Snape to Voldemort.

And he didn't /need/ any proof. Lupin being a werewolf was impossible to cover up. All Snape had to do was spread the rumour around, and wait for students to gather around the Gryffindor Common Roon on a Full Moon.

If the information reached the likes of the Malfoys and Lestranges (I mentioned them exactly because they had graduated), who were part of the Board of Directors, they could have easily demanded to have Lupin examined.

Besides, this actually makes Sirius look /worse/ - what you're arguing is that Snape suspected Lupin was a werewolf, but Sirius alluded to the fact that their secret was something else, tricking Snape into going. That is attempted murder, with direct intention.

***** Luna Lovegood believes wholeheartedly in a bevy of creatures that no publication other than The Quibbler agree exists. She also believes in several conspiracy theories. Ostensibly those things might have evidence for them but generally, anyone going around claiming that Fudge eats goblins or that the Aurors are using gum disease to bring down the Ministry is probably going to have people roll their eyes at them.

To Lily, Snape probably sounds /exactly like that/. He has a conspiracy theory (Lupin is a werewolf) and he has circumstantial evidence. Lily is perhaps relying on things 'everybody knows' (werewolves are all evil, there is a monster living in the Shrieking Shack) but Hermione does exactly the same thing when she meets Luna.

Lucius Malfoy very likely shared exactly one school year with Snape and the Marauders during which he was a seventh year and Snape was a first year. Bellatrix had already left Hogwarts and the Lestranges would not have been very far behind her. I don't doubt that if Snape went to Lucius and said 'I want to be a Death Eater' Lucius probably helped him out but in 1975/6 Lucius would have been out of school for four years and potentially married already. I doubt he was vitally interested in the day-to-day schoolboy drama of a fifteen-sixteen year old boy or that they were regular correspondents.

More importantly this is coming towards the height of the Voldemort war. A good chunk of people believe Dumbledore is the only thing keeping Voldemort from taking Hogwarts and is very possibly the only hope of defeating Voldemort. Dumbledore didn't get ousted from Hogwarts after having a werewolf teaching the Boy-Who-Lived (in a year where that mattered) or that werewolf attacking three children and a teacher. Remus had to quit, but that was the extent of what happened.

Snape at this point is a fifteen-sixteen year old child. Remember the part in PoA where the Minister believed two children about Sirius Black being innocent? Or maybe GOF where the Minister believed Voldemort was back because Harry Potter said so after appearing with the murdered body of a student and right after a supposedly dead Death Eater turned up alive and convinced Lord Voldemort was alive? Right, neither of those things happened. Hell, Dumbledore threw his weight behind both of those assertions and still nothing was done.

Maybe, /maybe/ Dumbledore gets kicked out if Remus had actually killed Snape but that's still a maybe. We know Armando Dippet didn't get fired after Myrtle died. /Hagrid/ got expelled for murdering another student but nothing happened to Dippet. Incidentally, Lucius Malfoy was /not/ on the Board of Governors in the '70's so far as we know.

****** Werewolves, unlike, the creatures Luna talks about, are a well-known reality, that they study during their third year. Assuming Snape kept pushing the werewolf theory, it's hard to imagine Lily would not have seen the signs - that Lupin was constantly missing at the Full Moon, that he looked ill and weak when he came back etc.

Then, she hears that Snape was attacked by "something" in the Shrieking Shack.

Snape starts bringing Lupin - and only him, when I think it's safe to say he usually has an issue with James and Sirius - up, drawing attention to his regular absences.

At that point, the only possible excuse for Lily not putting it all together is that the theory was never put to her.

Based on Snape and Sirius's comments, Snape became interested when they all started missing at the Full Moon ("*they* sneak out at night"/"trying to figure out where *we* went [...] get *us* expelled"), when they started training to become Animagi. The reason he singles out Lupin during the conversation is because he's trying to steer her towards the truth, which he can't, because she drops the bomb that James has been portraying himself as a hero, which enrages Snape.

During the First War, most of the influential families (who also ran the school) supported Voldemort. Dumbledore's position was much more precarious, and Voldemort was winning the war.

During the Second War, the families who would be interested in getting Dumbledore sacked have been nearly decimated, with the exception of the Malfoys.

The Minister didn't believe Harry because he didn't want to, since Voldemort coming back would be a disaster for him.

The Malfoys, Lestranges and Blacks would have believed Snape, and had all interest to use that information. And if the Board of Governors (if Lucius wasn't on the Board, his father likely was) investigated Lupin's situation, there would be no way to hide it.

At which point those families could easily run an outrage campaign about evil Dumbledore endangering children and harbouring dangerous monsters in the school (they'd even have a point, considering the "many near-misses" Lupin mentions).

Remember what Sirius and Lupin say - a lot of people actually supported Voldemort's ideals, but not his methods, and the Death Eaters outnumbered the OotP twenty to one.

But since you're arguing that nobody would have cared about Lupin being a werewolf, and that Snape knew about Lupin... why would Snape risk his life to... catch a glimpse of Lupin? While knowing nobody would care?

The only explanation would be that Snape expected, at most, to find some people ready to get into a fight, and he assumed he could defend himself. Possibly, he had seen that James and Sirius were still inside the school, so he figured he'd face Lupin and Peter at most.

Did you not read my post at all?

Snape wonders how Lupin can be regularly ill on the night of the full moon at every month. Since there are no other creatures that transform with the moon, it can be quite safe to assume Snape is almost certain that Lupin is a werewolf. From his conversation with Lily, it's also evident that he has shared his suspicions with her, and she'd rebuffed his theories before.

It's also mentioned that Snape sees Pomfrey lead Lupin away from the castle on the days he transformed, and was trying to find where Lupin was going.

Because Snape isn't associated with the Death Eaters at this point? This incident happened either in Snape's 4th or 5th year - Lucius would have graduated years ago. The Lestranges are quite a bit older than Snape, seeing as Bellatrix is about 9 years older - Rodolphus would be at least her age and chances are Rabastan is too.

And Dumbledore wasn't fired when it was outed that he hired a werewolf for a teacher, so why would he get fired for taking a werewolf student on? Sure it's a stronger case of contact with the students, but the possibility is far too small, and Dumbledore's reputation and political contacts far too strong to be fired over a single incident.

Not to mention that it would be Snape's word against Dumbledore's. Nobody in their right mind would believe Snape. Also, Snape would have made an incredibly powerful enemy in Dumbledore. While his sense of self-preservation is seriously questionable from the incident, I don't think even Snape would have risked that.

It's quite nice that there are stuff like polyjuice potions or disguise charms, isn't it? All Albus would need is for one of Remus' friends to disguise as Remus and Remus to disguise as one of his friends for one night. Albus might even be willing to do it himself.

Sure, I have an idea - Snape loses all semblance of logic and presence of mind and turns into a mindless, hate-filled maniac when it comes to Harry and the Marauders (as shown at the end of PoA). I think that he would have been willing to out Lupin as a werewolf, even if it was at the cost of his own life. Or maybe he thought that killing Lupin in wolf form was possible - and he wouldn't even face legal trouble seeing as the Wizarding World views werewolves like dirt and Snape would have been in mortal peril.

But that's just me.

#+begin_quote

Gee, I wonder why. All I said was that Snape was breaking rules himself - rules that he accuses his tormentors of breaking all the time. If Snape had kept to his common room, he'd have been safe - like every other student in the school.

The rule for curfew and out-of-bounds areas are for the protection of the students, Snape included. Snape violated them and nearly gets himself killed, and suddenly I'm trying to victim-blame Snape.

#+begin_quote

There are certainly better ways of doing this. For all Snape knew, his tormentors could be lying in wait. Or Sirius could have been flat out lying about the Willow and Snape would have literally gotten whipped by the tree. It's not like Sirius has any reason to be honest to Snape, seeing as he hates him - and Snape knows this too.

If Snape assumed the faculty was fully OK with what Lupin was doing... why would he even go there? The natural conclusion would be that he couldn't use the information to get them expelled. And /you/ were arguing that he wouldn't spread the truth about Lupin because he wouldn't want to get on Dumbledore's bad side - but going in the Shrieking Shack would be fine with Dumbledore, in his view?

No, the logical conclusion is that he assumed Lupin (and the other Marauders - Sirius makes it clear that Snape was interested in them as a group, not only in Lupin) had lied/tricked Madam Pomfrey.

And yes, the fact that someone remembered, 15 years later, that Snape was very close to Lucius is pretty relevant. Snape could write a letter to Lucius, telling him that Dumbledore was hiding a werewolf among students, and Lucius would have used that to curry favour with Voldemort.

And once the information was out, and the parents properly enraged, no amount of Polyjuice Potion would help. The Board would ask for Lupin to be examined, and that would be the end of that.

At the end of PoA he is enraged because he thinks the man who betrayed the Potters and got Lily killed has just escaped, aided by Lupin and a tricked Harry. Someone being enraged does not translate into someone being suicidal.

Also, you're arguing that Snape had known for months about Lupin - plenty of time to prepare, and no reason to be out of his mind, he hadn't suffered a shock.

If outing Lupin was so important, he was willing to die for it, how come he never told the truth after that? Not even during SWM? Or during PoA? But I'm impressed that you've managed to turn Sirius's canonical murderous intent into Snape actually being out to murder someone. 😂

Oh, I agree that Snape believing Sirius is a bit of a plot-hole. I've seen theories that Sirius might have Confunded him, based on him telling Fudge, in PoA, that the Trio only attacked him because they'd been Confunded. i don't know if I believe that, but it's irrelevant.

No, that goes back to Sirius being a shitty person. Lupin was the one who made them feel "ashamed, sometimes" of their behaviour. Pettigrew idolised them, and never went against them.

The whole reason Sirius insisted on switching places with Peter was that Sirius thought Voldemort would come after him, knowing he was James's best friend, and wouldn't go after Peter.

But...

a) Why would Voldemort go after anyone, in that situation? Surely /Voldemort/, of all people, knows how a common charm works.

b) If it's impossible to extract the truth by force... wouldn't Sirius have been the perfect Secret Keeper, since he would be the one person who would never willingly betray James? Why trust the one friend in the group who is weak and prone to siding with "the biggest bully", at a time when Voldemort was winning the war?

c) As far as Sirius knew, there was a 50/50 chance that either Lupin or Peter was the spy. So he took a huge risk, by making one of them Secret Keeper... for absolutely no reason.

I don't have an issue with most of JKR post-HP additions, but this one is ????? It was bad enough, already, that James turned down Dumbledore's offer to be Secret Keeper, "because reasons".

  Lucius Malfoy is seen taking Snape under his wing, after the Sorting
#+end_quote

According to you, giving someone a pat on the back after they got sorted into your house counts as taking them under your wing? What.

Malfoy is at least 6 years older than Snape (born in 1953/54 to Snape's 1960)- making him a seventh year when Snape was a first. And you say he forged a great lifelong friendship with the man...all based on a single generic pat on the back after Snape becomes a Slytherin?

#+begin_quote

Daphne Greengrass is shown in Hermione's exam. Never before that, never again. Does that mean anything? Maybe she and Hermione were best friends in secret? Was Daphne a golem made by Hermione on that day, doomed to exist for one day and one day only? Did Hermione kill her after the exam, is that why she was never seen from again?

So, to answer your question, yes. JKR accidentally wrote that. She isn't some great writer that leaves miniscule plot points here and there. Half of what she writes gets contradicted later on by herself in her later books.

I could argue that Snape forged a relationship with the Malfoys during his time as a Death Eater in the first war, and the years that followed the war.

Also, your idea that the Malfoys were on the board in 1975? Prove that. Malfoy is on the board in 1992-93, but there's nothing to suggest that he's on the board in 1975.

I made this very argument once before, when I was criticising Albus, so it's quite funny to see it again. The person I was arguing against just harped on about werewolves being similar to AIDS patients and descended to name-calling. /shurgs/

Honestly, I've no clue what kind of protections exist around the Shack, if there even are any, so...I'd say that since no one got even remotely curious as to what was making the shrieking sounds during the full moon nights for seven years, there are some protections around the building.

#+begin_quote
  At the end of PoA he is enraged because he thinks the man who betrayed the Potters and got Lily killed has just escaped, aided by Lupin and a tricked Harry.
#+end_quote

No. You're wrong.

Lupin sees Pettigrew on the map with Sirius, Ron, Harry and Hermione, and rushes off to confront them. He leaves the map open. Snape comes to the room to deliver the Wolfsbane to Lupin, sees the open map, sees exactly the same thing Lupin did - Sirius, and the students, *along with Peter*.

Or are you going to say Snape didn't see Peter's name but saw Sirius' name, even though they were both in the same room? That Snape had eye problems?

Next, from the scene where time traveler Harry and Hermione are waiting outside the forest for everyone in the Shack to come out, we see that there is only a short interval of time before they see Lupin rushing out of the castle towards the willow and Snape running out after Lupin. Maybe about ten minutes.

#+begin_quote
  “All right... but you'll need to help me, Sirius,” said Lupin, “I only know how it began...” Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing. “No one there...” “This place is haunted!” said Ron.
#+end_quote

That's from PoA. Since doors don't open of their own accord, and the Shack isn't haunted, most anyone will deduce that Snape is waiting right outside the room in the Shack. Snape is then witness to the fact that the Marauders were animagi. Remember, he'd also seen Peter's name on the map.

Lastly, Sirius says that the other Death Eaters are quite aware of Peter's identity as the Death Eater who gave Voldemort the location of the Potter family.

#+begin_quote
  “What, scared to hear your old master's name?” said Black. “I don't blame you, Peter. His lot aren't very happy with you, are they?”

  “Don't know what you mean, Sirius ---” muttered Pettigrew, his breathing faster than ever. His whole face was shining with sweat now.

  “You haven't been hiding from me for twelve years,” said Black. “You've been hiding from Voldemort's old supporters. I heard things in Azkaban, Peter... They all think you're dead, or you'd have to answer to them... I've heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds like they think the double-crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went to the Potters' on your information... and Voldemort met his downfall there. And not all Voldemort's supporters ended up in Azkaban, did they? There are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they've seen the error of their ways. If they ever got wind that you were still alive, Peter ---”
#+end_quote

So, it's quite clear that the Death Eaters inside Azkaban know all about Peter. If the Death Eaters like Bellatrix know, there's very little reason to suggest their her brother-in-law Lucius doesn't know. And if Lucius knows, he would have told his friend Snape as well.

You know, the same Snape who has a very strong friendship with the Malfoy family? Even if Snape didn't know about Peter in 1981 (IMO he did, he just let Peter give the info in the hopes that James and Harry would be killed and Lily would be spared, but for Snape's sake let's assume he didn't), he would have found out about him later on, in the years after the war.

Not to mention that Snape, Lucius and Bellatrix were all part of Voldemort's Inner Circle - they all have their Marks and Voldemort mentions Snape's absence during his resurrection. Inner circle members are aware of each other.

Snape isn't a spy for Voldemort in 1981 either - he becomes that only in 1995, after Voldemort's return. He says this quite clearly in the books. So the idea that Voldemort keeps his spies' identities secret from each other won't work here.

So - Snape knows Peter was the traitor, Snape sees Peter in the same room as Sirius, and what does he do?

#+begin_quote
  “Professor Snape --- it --- it wouldn't hurt to hear what they've got to say, w --- would it?”

  “Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,” Snape spat. “You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your life, hold your tongue.”

  “But if --- if there was a mistake ---”

  “KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!” Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite deranged. “DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!” A few sparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointed at Black's face. Hermione fell silent.

  But there was a mad glint in Snape's eyes that Harry had never seen before. He seemed beyond reason.

  “Come on, all of you,” he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. “I'll drag the werewolf. Perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too ---”

  Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door. “Get out of the way, Potter, you're in enough trouble already,” snarled Snape. “If I hadn't been here to save your skin ---”

  “Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,” Harry said. “I've been alone with him loads of times, having defense lessons against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn't he just finish me off then?”

  “Don't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf's mind works,” hissed Snape. “Get out of the way, Potter.”

  “YOU'RE PATHETIC!” Harry yelled. “JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU WON'T EVEN LISTEN ---”

  “SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!” Snape shrieked, looking madder than ever. “Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! You would have been well served if he'd killed you! You'd have died like your father, too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black --- now get out of the way, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!”
#+end_quote

Tries getting Sirius and Lupin kissed. Snape inadvertently delays things enough that the moon rises and causes the real traitor to escape. Which eventually leads to Peter finding Voldemort and helping is his resurrection.

We've digressed quite a bit though.

#+begin_quote
  Also, you're arguing that Snape had known for months about Lupin
#+end_quote

Yes. He's observed Lupin getting ill on a regular basis on every month. The periodicity for Lupin's illness is one month, so Snape would have to be observing Lupin's patterns for several periods - which is several months.

Snape does not share living space with Lupin as a student, so the details of his illness wouldn't evident to him unless he was observing Lupin properly.

#+begin_quote

Nothing is written "accidentally", from the fact that Snape wore his mother's blouse (crippling poverty), to him and Lily being harassed by James and Sirius on the train (establishes the reason why Snape and Lily disliked them, and the fact that James and Sirius were bullies), to the fact that he is warmly welcomed at the Slytherin table by Lucius himself (the beginning of his grooming). That you would compare this to... not all students in Harry's year getting a detailed backstory is baffling. And no, "half of what JKR writes" does not get contradicted in later books. Feel free to provide examples.

Again, Snape is shown being welcomed by Lucius, Snape is remembered as Lucius's "lapdog" by Sirius, who would have zero information on their relationship post-Hogwarts, and Lucius thinks he knows Snape better than Dumbledore does. Which points to an old and close relationship. Lucius would have no reason to like and trust Snape, if he'd only socialised with him after Snape's graduation, during the 3 years before Voldemort's fall.

The only reasonable theory is that the Map only shows people in Animagus form to the creators of the Map or to people who know the Animagus's true identity.

- Lupin has spent a year lying to Dumbledore, hiding the truth about how Sirius has been entering the castle (Lupin outright admits it);

- Sirius has repeatedly infiltrated the Gryffindor Tower, and has even injured Ron;

- Sirius is screeching about "getting on with it" while manically staring at the children (he is staring at Peter, but Snape doesn't know that).

And Snape's reaction to all of it is to... bring Sirius to the authorities, when he could have easily killed him while he was unconscious.

********** I think that person was arguing that Snape wasn't spying for Voldemort, yet, so Voldemort was comfortable with telling him the names of all of his spies.

Because according to that person's logic, spies' names are only kept secret from other spies, but are freely shared with everyone else. 😂 😂 😂

But what can you expect from someone who thinks everyone knew Peter was the traitor...

#+end_quote

I'm going to disagree here. People don't take kindly to anyone taking shots at their father, especially young boys.

Also --- "where do you think you're going if you're neither?" --- if you think this is "bullying", you're stretching the definition to breaking point and beyond. Tripping someone after they implied your dad was not brainy isn't bullying either. You'd have to be mad to think that literally every single action of Sirius and James has to viewed under a bullying lens.

  "Abbott, Hannah!"

  A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause --

  "HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat.

  The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.

  "Boot, Terry!"

  "RAVENCLAW!"

  The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.
#+end_quote

The Ravenclaws are shaking hands with Boot - are they hoping to do business in the future with him? And the ghost of the Friar, he's Abbot's distant ancestor, is he? From your logic, it would seem that way.

But okay, let Lucius (a seventh year) forge a lifelong friendship with Snape based on their interactions in Snape's first year. Because, you know that all 17 year olds have that one friend six years younger than themselves that they befriend...

#+begin_quote
  The "Snape knew Peter was the traitor" is truly the most cretinous, canon-breaking theory. Snape was willing to forfeit his own life by going to Dumbledore, but wouldn't give him the full information about Peter? He betrayed Voldemort, with all of what that entailed, but also prevented Dumbledore from adequately protecting Lily, because he thought Voldemort would spare her? Yet he also didn't think Voldemort would spare her, which was why he went to Dumbledore in the first place.
#+end_quote

It fits in line with Snape's character - befriending Lily while calling every other muggleborn mudblood, joining the Death Eaters while claiming to love Lily, asking Dumbledore to protect only Lily at first (and changes his request after Albus expresses his disgust). Snape wants only Lily safe - the rest could burn and he wouldn't give a fuck.

But that's my own idea, and I did say that Snape could have found out about Peter being the traitor after 1981, from the other Death Eaters.

#+begin_quote
  This does not mean the people in Azkaban know Peter was the traitor. This means that the people in Azkaban think the spy (Sirius, as far as they know) actually betrayed Voldemort, and sent him to the Potters to get him killed.
#+end_quote

So, according to you, when the prisoners inside Azkaban think Peter's dead and curse Peter's name in their sleep, they still think Sirius is the spy?

Seriously?

#+begin_quote
  “You ask where I was when the Dark Lord fell. I was where he had ordered me to be, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, because he wished me to spy upon Albus Dumbledore. You know, I presume, that it was on the Dark Lord's orders that I took up the post?”
#+end_quote

This is another JKR contradiction, thank you. Umbridge asks Snape in 1996 how long Snape has been a teacher at Hogwarts, and Snape replies that he's been one for 14 years.

In case you've temporarily forgotten primary mathematics, 1996 - 14 = 1982, ergo Snape became a teacher in 1982. This coincides with Slughorn retiring after Lily's death (movie canon as well as wiki).

#+begin_quote

  In conclusion, Snape didn't know a) that Peter was the traitor,
#+end_quote

Look if the Death Eaters inside Azkaban know, the ones outside know as well. By your own admission, Snape is friends with inner circle death eaters outside Azkaban.

And apparently, these Death Eaters never laughed at Sirius' being wrongly thrown in Azkaban with Snape at all? In spite of knowing that Snape hated Sirius with all his being?

Okay. I mean, sure, this is possible. Like 0.001% possible.

#+begin_quote
  I argue that, if Snape had known about Lupin being a werewolf, he would have used that information to gain the favour of other Slytherins, future DEs, and Voldemort himself, and to get Dumbledore and the Marauders thrown out of Hogwarts. He didn't do any of that, so he didn't know.
#+end_quote

And I've been saying this so many times, but you seem to ignore it every time - Snape suspected, not knew. Suspicion != Knowing.

Also, Snape accusing one of his classmates without any proof would just make him a laughing-stock in the eyes of all those entities that you mentioned. Not to mention that it would make Albus Dumbledore observe him more closely - Snape can't exactly go to future Death Eater gatherings when Dumbledore is keeping his eye on Snape, now can he?

And getting Dumbledore thrown out is a very, very long shot. Nothing happens to Dippet when Myrtle is killed, and only Hagrid is expelled. Snape is 15-16 years old. Fudge didn't believe two 14 year olds (Harry is almost 14) when they said that Sirius Black was innocent, and he didn't believe a 15 year old when he said that Voldemort had returned to life. And that was with Dumbledore throwing his support behind Harry. Why would the Minister or anyone at all believe Snape when he comes up with his theory with no proof?

#+begin_quote
  “You must understand,” said Karkaroff hurriedly, “that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named operated always in the greatest secrecy... He preferred that we---I mean to say, his supporters---and I regret now, very deeply, that I ever counted myself among them---” [...] “we never knew the names of every one of our fellows---He alone knew exactly who we all were---
#+end_quote

It's pretty obvious Karkaroff is lying to make it sound like his information is valuable. He himself knows the names of several Death Eaters.

When Voldemort returns at the end of GoF, he makes no attempt to hide the names of the Death Eaters who do come to meet him --- Voldemort talks to everyone using their names. The Death Eaters at the end of OotP are also aware of each other's identities. Same with the Death Eaters who enter Hogwarts at the end of HBP. They all refer to each other by their given names, not even their last ones.

Unless you think nothing new should have been added post-PS (which would exclude the vast majority of magical concepts and creatures), it was inevitable for some small discrepancies to show up. JKR provided a decent enough explanation.

What? James and Sirius started mocking Snape and Lily, and insulting them, then escalated to name-calling and physical violence. Don't even try it with the ridiculous "Snape insulted James's father", when James was the first one to say Snape and Lily were trash for wanting to join Slytherin. Meanwhile, Snape didn't insult anyone's character (unlike Sirius and James), he criticised the idea of James valuing physical courage over intelligence, and only after being prompted.

#+begin_quote

The fact that James uses, word for word, Draco's line is supposed to make it clear, for even the most dense reader, that he's the bully in that scene.

And please explain what Lily's fault was - they ignored her while she was crying right in front of them, then insulted her choice of house, then started mocking her. Clearly, she wasn't a believer of your ridiculous explanation, since she was still angry with Sirius after the Sorting, and continued to find them disgusting for years.

#+begin_quote

?????????????

Are you comparing the relationship between adult Snape and Draco the relationship between irrelevant, newly-recruited Snape and the other Death Eaters? While Snape was close enough to the Malfoys, that Narcissa felt it was safe to basically go to Snape behind Voldemort's back?

Are you forgetting that Bellatrix is Draco's aunt and Voldemort's favourite, and also that, during the Second War, Voldemort has a lot fewer followers???

God, this theory become more imbecilic the more one thinks about it.

You say that TPT is a carefully written chapter that tries to fit all of Snape's lifestory? I say that it is a poorly written attempt to excuse Snape's actions in both childhood and adulthood, trying to make Snape "grey" when his character is darker than black.

And please do not try to say that the Marauders modified the map after Harry is born - because finding a map that they lost years ago, modifying it for the sole reason of including one name, and then taking the map back to Hogwarts and placing it inside Filch's office doesn't make sense.

Voldemort went to the Potters' on your information... and Voldemort met his downfall there. And not all Voldemort's supporters ended up in Azkaban, did they? There are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they've seen the error of their ways. If they ever got wind that you were still alive, Peter ---”
#+end_quote

According to you, the death eaters always say "double crosser" all the time, do they? For 12 years? Nice.

But Peter still feels the need to hide from them all? Even though they wouldn't know the spy was Peter because his name (and face) was hidden to them?

#+end_quote

It can be hidden quite well, using methods I've talked about before on this thread.

Greyback is not technically part of the Death Eaters until the second war. He's free for the entirety of the interwar period, seeing that he wasn't in the list of names of those who broke out from Azkaban - his list of crimes is large enough to warrant the death penalty if he were apprehended, not a stint in Azkaban.

Besides, Greyback is a wanted criminal. He's not in any position to be making any sort of "big scoop" - anyone who even implies that their information regarding a 15 yo student being a werewolf came from the notorious Greyback is going to be taken into custody for having contact with someone who is that high up the most wanted list.

#+begin_quote
  The most powerful people in the Wizarding World...
#+end_quote

This also ties into the point above.

The same people who were supposedly powerful enough to get Dumbledore booted, were also forced to take back literally everything they said in one stroke at the end of OotP. They were not able to make any excuses - even ones as lame as a disguised Voldemort that I once saw.

Fudge is booted from office. He was in a position nearly as powerful as a total dictator, and all that went down the drain inside a single week. Of course, he isn't imprisoned for treason, so that is a point in your favour.

Malfoy had been gaining influence for a decade and a half, and all that influence couldn't help him when he was found in full Death Eater regalia. He was not able to use the Imperius defence (which isn't as weak as some say). No bribing his way out of Azkaban that time.

Fudge and Malfoy are at the centre of the defamation campaign against Dumbledore and Harry - and yet, they fall so fast it's like their support base is non-existent. The whole "influential families backing Voldemort's schemes" can be debunked fairly quickly from this.

#+begin_quote
  He knows "several" DEs out of dozens/hundreds
#+end_quote

Karkaroff was giving names of Death Eaters who have the mark.

There are hundreds of death eaters who don't have the mark - Greyback, in spite of being as notorious as they come, and trusted enough to be part of the group that is sent to witness Dumbledore's death, does not have the mark.

Death Eaters who are in the inner circle have the mark. There are only 20 of these - the scene at the end of GoF certainly doesn't have hundreds of death eaters.

Also, how does Voldemort address Death Eaters when he's meeting more than one or issuing directions/plans? Does he use pointed fingers all the time, or use nicknames like the Unsullied have? Bellatrix is CrazyEyes, Snape is HookNose, and Lucius is PimpCane?

Another thing that invalidates Karkaroff's statement that names were kept secret from each other is that the Lestranges knew who Crouch Jr was when they went to attack the Longbottoms. Out of a lot of masked individuals, they were able to pinpoint exactly which one the Dark Lord's most trusted was.

Then, there's the fact that Karkaroff knew the names of those who went to the Longbottoms in the first place - this even happened after Voldemort fell, so there was no meeting held (seeing as people who don't know each others' names/identities can't hold meetings because they cannot contact each other). In fact, that whole bit of dialogue is full of holes.

Anyway, this little thread has gone far, far off course. It's quite clear that you will not change your mind, just as I will not change mine either.

I will respond to the other comment I made - the one about Dark magic, and the others - and disable inbox replies after that. I suggest you do the same, and not waste your time writing a response that I will not read.

Under that link is textblock for Curses. She says Curses are reserved for the "worst kind of Dark magic".

Now, I'm not sure how well you remember it, but one of the spells used by Hermione in her FIRST YEAR is the Full-Body-Bind *Curse*. Another curse, one that the first years learn in their /very first term of Hogwarts/, is the Leg Locker *Curse*.

There are a lot of theories regarding Albus Dumbledore and Hogwarts, but something that nearly everyone agrees is that the man doesn't tolerate the use of Dark magic. Hogwarts does not teach Dark magic either, especially not to first years. That's Durmstrang.

Sirius sent what he thought was an unsuspecting Snape straight into the jaws of a werewolf. That's canon.

So Sirius is an attempted murderer, with either direct, or oblique, intention.

Even if you try to argue that Sirius was a moron who didn't realise what would happen to Snape if he went inside the Shrieking Shack... he found out when James freaked out and ran after Snape. At which point Sirius, knowing what would happen to Snape, did nothing.

There is no indication Snape knew prior to actually seeing Lupin. Lupin himself says Snape only knew from that time on.

Sirius was intent on doing damage and adult Sirius shows not a bit of remorse for it...saying "it served him right". Not only is this disgusting with regard to Snape, but Sirius yet again overlooks Remus.

If Snape really thought Lupin was a werewolf, he would have spread rumours and caused as much trouble as he could that way. He didn't because he didn't know and once he did know, he was inexcusably silenced by Dumbledore.

Sirius knew full well what he was doing. He had to become an animagus just so he could safely hang around with Lupin at the full moon. He knew full well the consequences of sending Snape down there. He just didn't care...about Lupin either apparently.

It was absolutely malicious intent, so, no, not Snape's fault since he did not know what was down there.

Sirius not only risks Lupin's secret, but puts him in great danger of becoming a killer.

Sirius spends the full moon as a dog, running about with a werewolf, and he does so because werewolves aren't a danger to animals. He knows exactly what would happen if someone is down there with a fully transformed werewolf. Clealry people's dislike of Snape sees them trying to justify this, but consider how awful you have to be to decide to risk not only your friend's secret, but him becoming a killer against his will.

** On the assumption that Snape knew, you still have to prove that Sirius knew Snape knew, otherwise Sirius still has mens rea. You won't be able to prove it, because it's false. Sirius's own words were that he was "sneaking around, *trying* to find out what we were up to". Then, if Sirius did know, you have to wonder just how despicable he is, since he was putting Lupin not only at risk of being outed but at risk of being killed by someone who knows what awaits him down there. So, like you said, this /should/ have caused an irreparable rift between Sirius and Lupin and in fact it seems that it did - just a short while after that, they each suspected the other of being the spy.

On the assumption that Snape knew, you also have to explain why Lily says Lupin is ill, as if that refutes Snape's theory when it actually validates it, and why, if she had "werewolf Lupin" on her mind even as a theory that needed refuting, she did not ask Snape what the fuck was he thinking venturing out on the full moon. You also have to explain why Lupin says "*from that time on* he knew what I was”.

No, of course Snape didn't know. His theory could literally have been anything.

I believe that Snape's theory was “they're trying to become illegal animagi”. This is something he might have overheard them talking about while snooping on them. Pottermore canon explains how one becomes an animagus, and this process requires keeping a leaf in your mouth for a full month (which would be noticable) /and/ going out on full moon nights. It also explains Lily's dismissive attitude toward Snape's concerns: If the theory that's on her mind is “they're trying to become illegal animagi”, that's indeed none of Snape's business. Sirius, knowing that this is the sort of thing that might actually get them expelled, since it's the truth and hence, it would be possible to find evidence of this, does what he does, and teen Snape forgets all about his theory (in POA, he does not bring up any suspicion of such a thing) because, in his mind, he just received confirmation of something much worse about what they get up to at night. The conversation with Lily is an attempt to warn her, or to tell her what had happened to him. It fails, because of whatever measure Dumbledore has taken to ensure Snape's silence.

Edit: Dumbledore does not contradict Snape's assessment that it was attempted murder, either.

Context matters.

Snape is telling Lily there's something wrong with Lupin, Lily says that he's ill, and Snape wonders how someone could be ill every month on the night of the full moon - and that is when Lily shuts him down saying that she knows Snape's theory.

From that, it's quite clear that Snape's theory is about Lupin, not the others, since Snape and Lily are talking about only Lupin for a few lines.

#+begin_quote

I didn't think I need to seeing as it's pretty obvious - from that night, Snape knew for certain that Lupin was a werewolf. Before, he strongly suspected Lupin of being one, and his suspicions were confirmed that night.

#+begin_quote

No. The conversation with Lily is a poor attempt to deflect the conversation from the kind of company Snape's been keeping.

Becuase now that he knows there is something wrong with Lupin, that's what he is focusing on, and not on the others, duh?

On the full moon.

Can you explain how come Snape acted so monumentally stupid, literally walking into the jaws of a predator? Can you explain how could Sirius put his friend at such risk?

** Here's what I think happened:

Snape did or said something really horrible to the Marauders. I am personally of the opinion that he found Sirius making out with some boy and threatened to tell his brother about it, and so Sirius, full of rage and embarrassment, told Snape. He probably thought Snape was not STUPID enough to go somewhere on the full moon when he already KNOWS that Lupin is a werewolf as instructed by Lupin's best friend, who he suspects knows since they call him Moony and always disappear on full moon. Snape goes, Sirius is shocked, and desperately tries to apologise, now realising what he's done to Remus. Dumbledore makes Snape promise not to tell, a promise he breaks in Harry's 3rd Year.

I'm not saying Sirius' actions were justified, I'm just saying that he probably was provoked, and definitely tried to apologise. Sirius was NOT trying to kill Snape, he would never do that, and he was never trying to hurt him either. He just said some stuff in the spur of the moment which he expected Snape never to believe, and it went wrong. It was a teenage mistake. Things happen. He grew up. The real question is why Snape can go from abused buy to death eater to dumbledore's servant to Voldemort's right hand man to hero, and all for selfish reasons and be forgiven, but people can't believe that the Marauders grew up

But add Harry as a Slytherin - suddenly, there's someone who is just as rich as Malfoy, who is widely revered, who is liked by the entire faculty and the Wizarding world at large. Being Harry Potter's friend could be very socially advantageous, and I imagine people like Zabini (who openly disdains Draco in HBP), Nott, and Daphne Greengrass would gravitate towards him, for that purpose, or just to get away from Malfoy. As for the older and younger Slytherins, we don't really hear about them going around bullying people.

So, I think a lot of Slytherins would get along with Harry because it would be advantageous for them, but would secretly resent him, and would be ready to drop him whenever it would be inconvenient for them to be associated with Harry.

This whole idea that Harry is very wealthy is not borne out by the books. Yes, he has more than the Weasley but so do most families. The money from an invention that was monetised a minimum of 15 years ago and which could only be sold to magical people would be dwarfed by that of someone with their own country mansion.

Basically, by the time he's reached Hogwarts, Harry has already been indoctrinated against Slytherin, and in favour of Dumbledore and Gryffindor. And his main issue isn't that Voldemort was one, it's that he was repeatedly told everyone there was evil (and Draco only confirmed that impression).

Replace those interactions with people who are less biased, and he might not have such a strong opinion. Replace them with Slytherins, and Harry might even end up at Hogwarts without knowing Voldemort had been a student, since the Slytherin kids would probably prefer to avoid the subject entirely.

Add on top of that he is attacked by dementors and then finds out that his name is being run through the dirt in the national news paper and even people he was friendly with calling him a delusional liar. Then there is the constant torture at the hands at hands of Umbridge and the one thing he does for stress relief (flying) being taken from him. Then learning and teaching students of up to NEWT level to defend themselves and pass their exams. And this all happens in the OWL year which is supposed to be really stressful on it's own with teachers drowning students in homework.

James became friends with Sirius over insulting Slytherin and mocking Snape /and/ Lily, who had been crying in a corner of their compartment. In any case, being nice towards your friends isn't a sign of kindness and compassion. James bullied people, and tried to pressure Lily into dating him by threatening her friend.

I don't know why people always want to whitewash the Marauders. They were bullies, not just to Snape but evidently to a number of people. What they did during "Snape's Worst Memory" was absolutely cruel and in the real world would be classified as sexual assault. Sirius sending Snape off might have been a thoughtless and petty act, but it doesn't matter. He was old enough to realize the consequences of his actions.

Are you the sort of person who thinks prisoners getting raped is fine, because they committed crimes themselves?

Why are the Marauders habitually bullying Snape, who didn't personally do anything, instead of bullying the people who actually did it?

(The answer for that, as given by JKR, was that James was jealous of Snape's relationship with Lily, as seen from the fact that he uses Snape to get her attention and harass her into going out with him, then assaults him after she rejects him. There was nothing righteous about it.)

Would Bertram Aubrey' friends be justified in catching Lupin and sexually assaulting him, as revenge for the fact that he stood by and did nothing about James and Sirius bullying Bertram?

If you want an example of Sectumsempra properly used, look no further than Snape's attempt to protect Lupin during the the Battle of the 7 Potters - he attempted to cut the Death Eater's hand, missed, and the spell took off George's ear with razor-sharp precision. Snape has perfect control over the intensity of the spell, and the spell acts the same, regardless of the target it encounters.

You still have not explained why Snape would attempt to murder James in front of the entire school, and how such an action would make any sort of sense, in this reality or any other.

And the Marauders would know that, how? And if Snape didn't defend Mulciber and Avery's actions, would his friendship with them suddenly be OK?

Lupin, as a prefect, stood by and did absolutely nothing to stop his friends, which is worse than Snape trying to get Lily off his back. And during SWM, Lupin is complicit just by being present, since bullies are empowered by knowing they have back-up, especially when said back-up is the person who normally should have stopped them.

Lupin also admits he never told James and Sirius to back-off. If Lupin is too scared to stand up to supposedly-good James and Sirius, why is Snape expected to stand up to evil people, over whom he has no authority, and who don't care about him (if anything, they look down on him for being poor and a half-blood)?

So, by your logic, the friends of everyone James and Sirius bullied would have been perfectly justified to abuse Lupin. Which, I guess, means the proto-Death Eaters were actually better people than James and Sirius, since they didn't go around sexually assaulting their friend.

Also, as an adult, Lupin downplayed Snape's feelings regarding being bullied for years, sexually assaulted, and almost murdered, as a "foolish childhood grudge".

Using illegal dark magic and sexually assaulting people are definitely not pranks.

***** Ultimately Snape made worse choices, but he was also in a worse position. He was poor, isolated, and abused at home. The Marauders were in a better position to take the higher road and didn't. In fact they contributed highly to Snape's misery. I don't really blame Snape for joining the death eaters. The only people who showed him any respect or friendliness were the future death eaters - why wouldn't he join them? The Marauders made it clear he was not welcome on "their side" and Dumbledore reinforced that by being lenient with them after Sirius' "prank." (Despite this being the culmination of years of abuse against Snape).

Snape made bad choices but I don't think that makes the Marauders any less cruel or any less bullies. There's no reason to whitewash what they did. Snape being unpleasant or "not innocent" does not justify them bullying him. It's also made clear that they bullied lots of people and we don't know anything about who those other kids were.

If you run around with the "purge a people" crowd to the point where you insult your best, truest friend with a racial slur exclusively used by your genocidal buddies, you deserve anything that happens to you. Because it was not just idle talk of chest-puffing teenagers but Snape, and many likeminded people later voluntarily joined the Death Eaters. Like, what do you think would happen to a teenager walking around shouting "Heil Hitler" in the USSR ca 1943? Or in Israel '49? Snape's "worst memory" would be a pleasant fantasy in comparison.

And there were certainly other options, especially for someone with Snape's abilities.

It's quite amazing that certain users here are trying to justify Snape joining the Death Eaters because he was poor, had a less than stellar childhood, was "bullied". They even say that Lily overreacted, and that the school's inaction in this very incident that I'm speaking about "pushed" Snape to join the Death Eaters. They even justify Snape's ridiculous behaviour as a teacher as a result of "trauma" --- after nearly 2 decades.

And then they have the audacity to wonder why people despise Snape?

Seriously, I didn't know that living like normal person was so difficult. I mean, I was hazed in college too, and I didn't join any mass murdering death groups - do I deserve an award of some kind?

Who cares who the recipient is? People are only in control of their own actions. Lupin knew even as a teenager knew it was wrong and didn't participate. Sirius expresses a little bit of remorse as an adult. Why is so hard to except that they were flawed teenagers who did something bad?

***** There's no "to some extent" about it. They were... worse than Malfoy. Hell, they're worse than HBP Malfoy who has at least got the excuse of being the means of his parent's destruction (i.e. if he fails, he dies). OOTP Malfoy is Malfoy at his worst and that's the closest comparison we get to the Marauders.

And, yes, Snape was also worse than Malfoy. And, yeah, worse than the Marauders too. But that doesn't make them remotely defensible people.

And that fact makes Harry's (and presumably Ginny's) choice to use the names James, Sirius and Severus for his (their) kids much, much more interesting.

Also, you would have been a Hitler Youth too. That was an entire system based around being a Nazi. Unless you lived at the time and weren't a Hitler Youth the comparison is just not even worth addressing. Snape and his cronies are more like British teenagers running away to join ISIL.

Excuse me?

Let's rephrase... Malfoy hospitalised one person on a long term basis, another on a short term basis and enabled an invasion of Hogwarts. That's three "war crimes" (seriously?). These were committed because Malfoy's own life was under threat.

The use of poisoned weapons is prohibited by article 23 of the Geneva convention. A different paragraph of that article also forbids the use of arms which create unnecessary suffering.

Pressing the enemy's civilians into armed service is a war crime, as is targeting civilians.

Any time Malfoy did something Death Eater related while wearing his Hogwarts uniform was a count of perfidy since civilians are entitled to protections combatants do not enjoy. And before you dismiss that as trivial, the allies shot captured German commandos just for the same offence committed just one time.

Then congratulations! By your reasoning here, Malfoy, at the very most, endangered Katie, Slughorn, and Ron, since the intended recipient of the cursed necklace and poisoned mead was Dumbledore. Katie looked at the necklace of her own free will and Slughorn kept the mead for himself and shared it with Ron during the Love Potion incident. So Draco was not directly responsible for what happened to them.

So, the only "war crimes", as you put it, he committed were premeditated murder in Dumbledore's case, and "endangering" the students of Hogwarts, in the Vanishing Cabinet's case, because the late hour meant the students should have been in their dorms, safe from harm.

And the only reasons Malfoy goes along with this is to save his and family's lives since they are so far out of favour with Voldemort due to Lucius' failure to retrieve the prophecy at the end of OotP. Malfoy only had the Dark Mark in the 6th movie, it was NEVER stated he actually joined up, he could very well have been forced to coerce and that is supported in canon since he looked very unhealthy and he had often been crying about what all he had to do to stay safe/keep his parents safe.

Your distaste for Snape and Malfoy and probably all of Slytherin House is clear, and it is also clear that you generally like the Marauders and the Gryffindors. That's fine, and no one is saying you have to like or dislike a character because they do. All the people who disagree with the OP's statement that "Sirius didn't try to kill Snape" are saying is that no one's perfect - everyone's flawed and they make mistakes - and this one mistake made by Sirius was very immature and had the books been written with a more mature audience in mind, could have been lethal for two of the four parties involved, with the third a possibility, and Sirius himself probably incarcerated.

1) James, no doubt, saved Severus' life, and Severus did repay that debt by saving Harry's in PS; he may have not been happy about it, but he did it anyway. If James had been too late, Severus would have been torn and bitten to shreds.

2) Had Remus killed Severus, his own life would have been forfeit because as a werwolf, would have been considered "less than" even more so in the seventies, and it is within the realm of Wizarding World that he would have been put down for the death of wizard, like a rabid dog who bites a human.

3) James, being in the tunnel and a human himself at the time, could have died as well; there's a possibility he could have transfigured into his stag form in time to stave off serious injury. However, shock at seeing Remus kill a student, a student they had bullied relentlessly for far longer than "he was a DE in the making anyways", could have put James into a paralysis of sorts and he may not have reacted in time, despite his experience in the matter. I believe when this is being explained to Harry, it is mentioned that James saved Severus at great peril to himself. Do correct me if I'm wrong. Shock does things to people.

4) If the deaths of any of the above characters occurred in canon, Sirius would have been held responsible. Had Severus died, James would have known Sirius' immaturity was to blame, and might have been honour-bound to tell the authorities, regardless of their friendship and brotherhood, doubly so if the Ministry killed Remus because of Severus' death. Had all three died, I have no doubt it would have affected Sirius (James and Remus playing a part of 99.99% of the guilt) to come forward and say he had been the one responsible for the actions - whether before the Ministry executed Lupin or not. The Ministry might have killed Lupin anyway and then incarcerated Black, or incarcerated them both.

To address the whole Hitler/Nazi thing - we are talking about the Wizarding World! While JKR used much of our history as ALLEGORY, this does not take place in the real world, and drawing comparisons between "FICTIONAL Hypocritcal Psychopath and His Minions Killing At Most a Few Hundred People" and "REAL Hypocritical Dictator and an Army of Assholes who Committed Mass Genocide of Several Million People" is rather a stretch.

********** Malfoy did not only endanger Katie and Rosmerta, he cursed them. And he forced them to aid him in his illegal attacks. That alone is a war crime. Not to mention that he used unforgivables to do so.

Coercion is not a valid defence in crimes against life. It only works if what you are threatened with is worse than what you did. Attempted murder is therefore not covered by that stipulation. Because again, otherwise you could only sentence very few of those who committed war crimes.

And you are missing the point of the whole war crime argument. Malfoy wearing his Hogwarts uniform is a war crime every time he does something Death Eater related because he is abusing civilian protection to cover his illegal acts of war, even if he does not end up killing anyone. Even the Allies executed prisoners for just that single offence. His chosen weapons are considered illegal to be used for the two reasons I mentioned earlier. His method of the Imperius curse would be considered illegal drafting of civilians if we had such magic.

And I am not denying that it was a serious dick move towards Lupin, but Snape's fate would be his own making. And any fate Lupin would suffer would fall on Snape as well because even though Sirius enabled him, it was still SNAPE'S choice to do anything with the information.

And obviously we are talking about parallels, but Rowling did not even bother to make significant changes from our timeline. The laws Umbridge is enforcing are basically the Nürnberg laws with Jews replaced for muggles. The snatchers are another obvious parallel, and many more are parallels, but could also be compared to other authoritarian dictators like Stalin.

Okay, so by your reasoning, Harry committed war crimes, as well. He used the Cruciatus on Bellatrix Lestrange and he used the Imperius on goblins at the bank to steal from Bellatrix. He used a highly dangerous spell, one he only knew to be used for enemies, on Malfoy in HBP. With no idea what it did, he could very easily have killed someone at the age of sixteen, and would have if not for Snape healing Malfoy.

And, with complete disregard for the movies, Harry could very well have been in civilian clothes/his Hogwarts uniform for BOTH the Cruciatus/Sectumsepra scenarios - and was actually wearing his invisibility cloak during the Imperius incident, thereby using his own status as not belonging to the DA, Order, or DEs in regards to him "having a side" and presenting himself as such. So I hardly think what they're wearing should come into this argument.

Had Snape not been there in time, or known what spell had been used, Malfoy's death, in this regard, would nullify everything he'd tried to do to save his family and himself; both his parents would have died because he'd failed; Dumbledore might have lived a bit longer since the Unbreakable Vow, to my recollection, didn't have a time limit; the castle very likely would not have been invaded by DEs; and 7th year could possibly have been held as normal without having been taken over by Voldemort's forces.

This would have prevented the war from breaking out so early and Harry would likely have served some sentence for imprisonment since no one would have any knowledge of what his intervention had stopped from happening - and his friends knew that he'd had it out for Malfoy almost from the very beginning. While the readers know he had good reason, his friends were rather dismissive that Malfoy was really up to what he was up to until a little further before/during the DE invasion. They would probably have been forced to testify at a trial - and I doubt HP's fame would have saved him from being punished since he was responsible for the death of a Wizarding minor, a fellow student.

Again, the books never stated Malfoy was officially a DE, he only had the Mark in the movies, so Harry very well might not have had any proof that Malfoy was indeed working for LV. The only people with said knowledge would be Snape, Lucius, Narcissa, Bellatrix, and LV. The Malfoy's would be dead, Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix would obviously not have cared a single whit about Harry's trial or imprisonment, and Snape would have to be the one to reveal the plans to Dumbledore, and by proxy the Ministry, in their entirety in a desperate attempt to save Harry's life/ensure his well-being. Something he would have done, as evidence by first-year, because while he didn't have to like Harry - he owed a life-debt to James and Harry is Lily's son.

I realise the what-could-have-happened part of this is hypothetical, so you will probably dismiss this anyways, but I wrote this to allow you to follow through and think on several of the "heroes'" actions and perhaps come to the conclusion that, and I repeat, everyone is flawed, and everyone makes mistakes. If you have not fought in a war, personally, then you have no idea about the drive to follow orders, the drive to save innocents, the drive of self-preservation, the drive to kill before you yourself are killed - there's a reason soldiers and victims of crime end up with PTSD, that while able to lessen in severity through therapy, often will stick with someone their entire life.

This is something Rowling barely touched on beyond Harry was sad over the summers a little and had a few nightmares that went away unless LV or his Horcruces were affecting his mentality. It would have played a large part in his life after the war was over. I will not take The Cursed Child into consideration as canon, since Rowling herself did not write it and only signed off on it. But the shitstorm that was TCC went too far and was not accurate to the behaivour/personalities of most of the characters, especially Harry's.

I'm sorry, but I believe this statement to be very incorrect. Remus' fate would be because of Sirius' actions - had Sirius not mentioned anything to Snape to taunt or lure him to the Whomping Willow and/or Shrieking Shack, Snape would not have been in the position to be harmed in the first place.

If you're trying to draw "parallels" from the Wizarding World and apply them to "real life" scenarios - you are inherently agreeing that the consequences of Wizarding issues are handled the same as consequences to real or "muggle" issues when that is just not the case. A few cuts and bruises can be healed, Healers and hospitals like St Mungos are there to do their best to reverse magical diseases and the like, antidotes can be brewed and administered to mitigate/negate the effects of other potions, and for most curses/jinxes save the AK there exist counter-curses and other spells to help someone recover.

If you are so blinded by your hatred of Slytherin House, Lord Voldmort, Death Eaters, that pureblooded/bigotry nonsense of a FICTIONAL world that you must use REALITY to force your points - then might I suggest taking a step back from the Potterverse and accept that it is FICTIONAL and does not actually exist before you return to it.

If you must bring up WWII, it would be more applicable during Grindelwald's reign as a Dark Lord rather than Voldemort's - as LV was more contained to a single country rather than millions upon millions of murders and casualties throughout the continent, not to mention countries from other continents that came to assist only after they were personally subjected to the devastation.

I doubt OP meant to stir up such a controversial onslaught of arguments when they just wanted to state their opinion, but it is highly clear that people still harbour grudges and hatred for fictional characters - and that is just not healthy, especially when said characters are wizards and could actually NOT exist in real life.

To OP, I apologise for having responded to such an off-topic subject, but these things do need to be addressed.

Sirius might be the reason Snape knew how to get inside the Willow passage - although, given enough time, Snape could have easily found a way in all by himself, seeing as he's pretty intelligent - but the only person actually responsible for Snape being in that situation is Snape himself.

He makes the conscious decision to go down there, on the night of the full moon, suspecting a werewolf could very well be waiting at the other end of the tunnel. That's all on him.
