Are there any decent dark harry fanfics out there? I've read a really good like The darkness within by Kurinoone. Are there any like that one? Or just fics that don't have a harry x Hermione pairing or harems, or an instantly OP Harry. I really want a fic where he slowly turns dark and his friends realize and turn against him along with the rest of the light side. Are there any like this?


** Wait so you want his friend against him without the bashing?

**** No problem I didn't mean to correct you I just wanted to understand what you meant correctly so I might recommend accordingly. 1)Petrichor by BlameMyMuses might be a recommendation that meets your requirements. Harry becomes the MOD after the death of Sirius in the OOTP but he is unaware of this weird stuff begins to happen and he gains his powers slowly but surely with the support of his friends. He slowly begins to question his morality and identity so this isn't a Harry who becomes dark immediately.

2)1k+Evil Be Thou My Good Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again. Dark Harry though it's not the focus of the story he has a lot of power that is conditional and his friends stay with him till the end [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good]]

Hopefully you'll like them if you haven't read them yet!

***** Ah it's okay, I needed to change it so it wouldn't confuse any other people. Thank you for the recs, they both sounds really good especially the first one! I find it hard to find fics where Harry gradually goes dark instead of just instantly going dark for barely any reason.
