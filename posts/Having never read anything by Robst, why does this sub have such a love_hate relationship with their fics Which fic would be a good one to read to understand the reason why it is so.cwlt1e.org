Edit: Yep, i'll never read a Robst fic unless under duress.


** The thing about robst is that his fics, on paper, sound great. They have great and unique premises, and he writes ungodly amounts of words at ungodly speed. Except all of his stories end up as bland power-fantasies riddled with bashing, no matter what the premise. So readers of taste's history with robst fics is to see a great new fic has popped up on ffnet, to get excited... and then to see the author's name and slam their heads on their desk for having been taken in again.

***** Of course, the thing about /Harry Crow/ is that he actually stole the premise from a way better story, the only advantage robst' version has over which being that /Harry Crow/ is completed. It's called linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone) and for all that it's unfinished I highly recommend it.

**** I'm gonna be upfront and say the first time I read through Harry Crow, I liked it.

The summary made that story sound a lot cooler/different than what we actually got. That's the problem with most of his stuff, too. He's got great ideas, but instead of executing them, he just falls back on bashing and Hermione being Goodness given form. We see Harry use Goblin magic once, and it's to point out to McG that Wizard Transfiguration is ridiculous. Then we see them celebrate Harry being amazing, and then not much else outside of some Goblin dueling.

** There's a lot of wish fulfillment and fan service at the expense of certain characters. Expect a lot of Weasley bashing, Hermione worshipping, and Harry acting like a cheeky little bugger. (Yes I'm aware he's such in canon but in these fanfics he's usually pretty rude). I think Banking on Her was the only one I've read through, but it's hit or miss. Robst created a lot of the modern fanfic tropes, so he's very influential but not everyone agrees with his interpretation of the series

*** I went to check his stories, and pretty much every single one is H/Hr with a few H/Hr/L. Considering I hate any form of bashing, Hermione in general (both canon and fanon) and what seems to be goblin-as-house-elves, I'm really starting to think that I'll never ever read a fic of him.

** He has great ideas, decent writing (in terms of grammar, structuring sentences, etc), very dependable in terms of uploads. However his execution in everything is just mediocre. Filled to the brim with tropes and cliches. They are also very similar in the details, once you've read one you've read them all. I think it's okay to recommend as an entry level fic but beyond that not so much.

** For one, his stories are even more Disney fairytale than PS and CoS, but with far too much romance between an 11-13 yr old Harry and Hermione.

Each story is essentially the same, but with a different premise. They're everything you hate about your typical Harmony story: Ron, Ginny, Dumbledore, canon bashing, deification of Harry and Hermione, muggle wank (I think it's been a long time), and really stupid/easy to defeat villains.

** I do actually like most of his fics, but many things said so far are true as well.

I think of Robst Fics as the summer action blockbuster genre of fics. You get a premise which is then played out rather straightforward und predictable. And it usually it is a power fantasy of our heroes.

And this is not necissary a bad thing. For every Schindler's List I do as well enjoy the big Marvel movie with beefy heroes punching stuff.

I think once you dive deeper into the fanfic world you see that Robst fics are shallower than many others, and this leeds to sometimes too harsh criticism.

Right? Flaws aside, I've never noped out, not even "Crow" (though I may have paused my reading until he finished so I could speed through it).

There are a lot bigger sinners in the realm of Harry Potter fanfic than RobSt.

That said:

  "Hello, my name is Hermione Jane Granger. What's yours? Mother says I'm not supposed to talk to strangers so that's why I'm asking." -- Hermione Granger, age 2.

[[https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/expert-answers/toddler-speech-development/faq-20057847][This is an egregious sin]] from "A Different Halloween". The second sin in this story is that Lily and Harry just happen to bump into Hermione and her mother, Emma (!!!!), at a random doctor's office. Both of these sins take place within 4 paragraphs of chapter 1.

** It is a feel good, guilty pleasure for me.

Robst is quite imaginative and funny, his stories have no angst and a pretty straight forward approach in dealing with antagonists- they are only there to make the herpes shine. Robst is not interested is discussing Grey characters or redeeming villains. Robst is all about loving the heroes unconditionally and making Fun of The nas guys.

I read Robst to have a good laugh and a good time and that It is all. I really appreciate How he loves and roots for his characters and, more often than not, even when he is bashing someone It is more like for the same of a good joke than out of hatred for said characters.

Harry Crow is the work he obviously put more effort into; fate's gambit and its sequel is among the best Lunar Harmony in which the while sould bound thing feels quite natural and Knowledge is Power is a riot.

** I think RobSt is a perfect for the new readers. From what I remember from his fics (didn't read one since pretty long), his writing is fine, there is not a lot of mistake, it's pretty easy to read, and he does finish most of his stories (in not all).

But my problem with him is that he is kinda predictable. No matter how a fic start, you know that in the end, it will be a Super Harry that will be better than anyone else and will easily deal with the problems (Voldemort and the retarded Wizard Society in general). Harry will fall in love with Hermione at 11 (every single time) and both will be in a perfect relationship (because god forbid a couple has any form of disagreement), sometimes joined by Luna. Also Dumbledore is a manipulating old coot and the Weasleys are bad.

It's fine when someone just started fanfics, but after monthes, or years, of reading, people learnt the tropes and will only see his fics as cliches nest (though to be fair, some cliche appeared only because he got an idea and made it popular in the first place).

There is also the fact that RobSt seem to love Hermione, and hate Ron. In all his fics, Hermione is perfect and Ron so stupid it's a wonder he can breath. He is one of the reason why I changed my opinion from "neutral toward both of these characters" to "Hermione's hater and hardcore Ron's defender".

​

So in the end, I think that most of the people who love RobSt fic are either pretty new readers who don't know all the cliches (or are not sick of them yet), or people who just want to read a power fantasy with their goddess Hermione Watson (main reason why she is so loved), and see the traitor Ron being bashed to the ground.
