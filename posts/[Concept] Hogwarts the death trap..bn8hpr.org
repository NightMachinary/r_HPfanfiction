Hogwarts seems rack full of child endangerment because magic really is deadly to teach.

Wizarding families are really all prolific like the Weasleys, but when the offspring die at Hogwarts wide area memory charms make everyone forget the fallen. The students we all know are just the ones who survived till the end of their schooling and so are remembered.

Endangerment and bullying always seems to stop right before deadly let was because no one remembers when it goes over.

Every year 15% of the class falls to fatal magical accidents in school. Taking the 32 students/year graduating class, that gives us:

- Year 1: 100
- Year 2: 85
- Year 3: 72
- Year 4: 61
- Year 5: 52
- Year 6: 44
- Year 7: 38
- Graduation: 32

Which means a total of 68 kids dying across all years per year... 100 would mean each dorm room started with 13 kids or so first year.

The death eaters are not that misaligned with magical society, they just want to do away with the whole hiding the brutality for the sensibilities of half-bloods and muggleborn.

Purebloods target Slytherin tradition started because if it's lower fatality rate.

Weasleys were just lucky that so many of their siblings survived school.

I am mostly just airing an idea I had, although if anyone knows of a fic along these lines I would love a link.


** An interesting concept.... but what about a family's physical mementos? Photographs and the like, clothes, books, shoes? Memory charms could cause someone to forget, but their things would still be there.

The memory charm would have to stretch over the British isles---possibly farther for people who have international family.

Maybe Hogwarts rewrites reality in some way?

*** Maybe it does partially rewrite reality but needs a magic humans sacrifice to charge up. Like maybe the castle passively helps protect the statute of secrecy and only kills the children and hides their existence so that it can continue to do so

*** Well you don't need it to be statute levels of secrecy. Simply the 'we wipe the students to prevent trama'. Maybe the family of muggleborns as well.

You would want a decent explanation. Such as ALL magic schools have high fatality rates. Deaths to other, preventable causes might get covered up as well, but it is primarily 'when teaching transfiguration, a certain percentage of your students end up permanently pumpkins'.

You could imagine a anti-bullying, saftey oriented school say in France taking longer and getting say, a lower 10% fatality rate.

Justifying it would be easy: uneducated wizards coming into their magic at home end up with a 90% self termination rate.

Kids get wiped because it is too much trama to see that much death at 12-16. Maybe they get told after OWLs or NEWTs.

Muggleborn parents wouldn't understand so they get convinced there was a car accident on the way home from Kings Cross.

Car accidents. Best thing for wizards since gas pipeline explosions.

*** We already have a charm that removes info from people's perception. Maybe Hogwarts in this AU casts a Fidelius for each dead kid using the headmaster as the secret keeper. Wouldn't that make for a fun guilt complex for Dumbledore? Every death would weigh on him but he's the only one who can remember.

** I remember reading a fic once that was a crossover with hunger games. Every year there are several deaths to things like the moving stairs. Obliviators try to cover it up. Hermione gets missed when one of her friends died and decides she's not going to let it happen to anyone else. She learns lots of spells and builds a bunch of enchanted items to help her save lives. I dont remember the name of the story but if you search hunger games crossovers on ff.net you might find it.

** When I saw the title, I thought I meant all those fics that stopped updating once the main character(s) got to hogwarts.

Crazy idea though, i can't see it being real considering the lack of magical families to meet a 100 student quota. With your pessimistic view that magical children are extremely dangerous to each other, I doubt hogwarts would still be open in the 20th century. Rather, magical children would be educated in smaller schools with safety measures in place to make no one dies. Like-minded students from similar socioeconomic and statuses would find themselves segregated in the same schools, leading to educational differences and their many social consequences. The rich purebloods would have a richer education than halfbloods and muggleborns. Hogwarts supposedly has free tuition, paid for by the ministry; I doubt the MoM would cover all the educational costs in this world.

*** Well, the idea goes with "The story as you know it is only the one the students remember", so of course they are not going to remember their peers who got killed. And honestly, JKR is sooooo bad at numbers. Her currency numbers, her population numbers, etc. You simply can't sustain a society the size of the one she showed with 32 kids/year.

I also think you are missing the premise here. The basis would be something like:

- Learning magic is dangerous: Kids who attempt to learn magic on their own / via self study blow themselves up / turn themselves into fine china 5 feet in the air 75% of the time.
- Not Learning magic is dangerous: Kids who refuse to learn magic are likely to accidentally tap their magic and the propability of an early death before 18 is 90%
- The best education one can buy (24/hour private tutor) greatly increases survivability, but 50% of the students still manage to off themselves
- In comparison, an institutional education provided economically to all students at a school like Hogwarts reduces the death rate to a good 60% or so by 18, however, introduces the trauma risk associated with seeing your peers permanently turn themselves into a pumpkin

Under such a situation, providing free schooling (indeed, getting all the ticking time bombs to a central, protected location so they don't cause damage if they go off) is something you can imagine. As long as the fatality rates of 'education' don't differ too much depending how much you spend, and the risk of people not being educated is high enough, you can easily see a "Everyone has to go to school because it protects general saftey"

** I think things didn't actually get quite as close to "death" as you think they did... remember that magical people (particularly children) are ridiculously more durable than their mundane counterparts. How much bullshit did Neville survive courtesy of his great-uncle Algie before he finally did accidental magic to save himself?

*** I'm not sure how "Magical children are more durable so all the shit Neville went through is ok as long as he was magical" makes that situation any less horrifying because they were doing that to /test if he was magical/

Anyway, Ignoring Harry's adventures (Which are, clearly, a lot closer to mortal peril as is needed for the plot), it is easy to view Hogwarts as a mostly competent school.

It is also easy to view Hogwarts as a criminally undersupervised school where they give kids loaded weapons and don't teach a single thing about responsibility.

This thread would clearly be more toward the second version ;)

**** It doesn't make THAT situation any less horrifying - but it makes Hogwarts seem less of a deathtrap and more of a serious-injury-trap. I've seen theories posted that the magical power of new students is low enough to restrict them from abusing higher-level spells, but it doesn't really play out that way in canon.
