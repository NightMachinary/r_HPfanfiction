I'm looking for FFs where Harry has a sister and they have a wholesome relationship. The story should mainly be told from Harry's POV. The characters and story should be close to cannon. Ships should be Harry+Ginny, Ron+Hermione. Harry's sister shell NOT be shipped with Draco/Snape. Also if possible the story should be long (100k+ words).


** Proper flair is request not recommendation

***** Yes I already read this one. Personally I really enjoyed it, however there is an argument that Harry and his sister Emma are way to smart for their age and therefore character development is not that huge, and I can see that. Also it's been a long time since it has been updated.
