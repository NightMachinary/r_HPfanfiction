She's known to mysteriously disappear for days at a time, but Augusta has always put that down to the obvious carelessness and forgetfulness of her disappointment of a *grandson. No matter how she reminds him, that boy just can't seem to keep track of his toad!

E: Yes, inspired by discussion in the previous Trevor thread. Posted here for greater visibility!


** *grandson, but lmfao. Clearly crack, but this could be a great starting point for a serious fic.

*** Could be cracky or serious! I like it being a series of wacky vignettes perhaps with Umbridge developing genuine affection for the Longbottoms despite herself.

*** Oh, she'd still be a horrible racist otherwise. She'd just give the Longbottoms a mental exception and try and justify it to herself.

Tbh the main thrust of the story would be her getting exasperated by what I imagine is the zany way the Longbottoms live and/or having to escape a series of increasingly cunning traps to stop 'Trevor' getting lost. I'd imagine it being canon compatible, filling in the gaps kind of thing.

**** The Longbottoms are pure blood though, so at lest that wouldn't be an issue.
