I like the concept behind Wblw trope but the bashing is a turn off. Are there any fic where the supposed bwl isn't an arrogant ass? Same with dumbldore not being an asshole No slash no fem Harry no bashing


** Genius Fratris has this. James survives and raises Harry and his younger brother (the assumed Boy who Lived). Harry has a good relationship with both of them.

  Only two people know what happened the night John Potter became the Boy-Who-Lived: Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter. And neither of them are talking.

** Most WBWL stories are Harry's sibling is a stuck up prat and The elder potters are fame hungry child abandoning idiots without brains. This is so wrong....Lily Evans Potter, who put herself between her child and a killing curse, would never abandon one child for fame, James Potter, best friend of the disgrace of black family and a werewolf and one of the inventors of legendary Marauders Map, would never hold fame above his family.....and I just scroll upwards whenever I see this kind of fic

*** This gives me an idea for a short story (not a one-shot, but definitely less than 30k words). Basically, start with the most cliche WBWL story you could imagine, but then very quickly reveal that the potters are being Mind-controlled/manipulated into being like that, which ends up revealing a whole chain of people controlling other people into being bastards in the most convoluted, absurd, recursive plan possible (i.e. pure crack).

** I had a passing idea for this sorta thing the other day. Take the basic Harry is the twin who lived, but mistaken for a squib and sent to the Dursley's. The difference is its in a world where Petunia and Lily had long since made up and remained really close. For bonus points maybe Petunia actually being a squib results in Dudley being a wizard as well leading the two twins and their cousin being close friends as well.

** Does it count if the WBWL grows out of his initial jerkish behavior? If so, linkffn(Prince of Slytherin) might fit the bill. Fair warning, it SEEMS like it is bashing the Potters initially, but you gradually find out that they are flawed but decent people who are trying to rectify their mistakes and had understandable (if not ENTIRELY justifiable) reasons for doing the things that they did. Dumbledore isn't even bashed at all in this one for the record.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter's life had been hell. He'd spent ten agonizing years slaving away for his only living relatives, only managing to escape through the surprising hospitality of a strange book store owner. On his eleventh birthday, he discovers things about himself he'd thought were only fantasies, but the greatest revelation was that he had a younger sister who'd somehow saved the world.Inspired by Sarcasm and Slytherin.

Charlotte Potter was proclaimed the Girl-Who-Lived who destroyed Voldemort, while her twin Harriet was left a squib and sent to be adopted by her aunt Petunia Evans.Ten years later, Hogwarts letters are on the way, and Petunia's greatest fear is that her daughter might turn out to be a witch after all.

** I know right? Been watching the new Superman show and the brothers have an awesome relationship. They fight and hurt each other, but even then, they make up by episode's end, and are still there for each other when it's a life and death situation! I want something like that with Harry and his sibling. They can fight sure, but when it comes down to it they're there for each other and still care when it's a literal serious emergency. Need more realistic sibling relationships instead of demonizing the WBWL and propping up the other with stupid bashing bullshit.
