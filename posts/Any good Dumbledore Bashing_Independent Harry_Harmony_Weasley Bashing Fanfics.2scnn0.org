** Bobmin's [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset Over Britain]] Is pretty fantastic, extrememly long. Believable in its bashing, but is also a great story. Again it is really long, each chapter being about 30 or so pages... and there is a sequel that is just as long. So you're in for a pretty epic ride.

Just fyi, you'll need to make a profile on that site for it

**** Having the right to an opinion doesn't make it any less ridiculous. Bashing is a juvenile excuse for people so pathetic that they despise a fictional character to shit on them. It's impossible to have a good story contain bashing for the simple reason that bashing negates characterization and character building. You can like them all you want, I've read a few myself, but they can't be good.

EDIT: /Some/ comedy based stories can be an exception.
