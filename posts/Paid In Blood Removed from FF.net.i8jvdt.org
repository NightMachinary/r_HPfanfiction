Does anyone know why? This story is easily one of if not my favourite HP story of all time, was rereading it again yesterday, woke up this morning to the story being removed/deleted. Anyone got any info on why or does anyone have the story downloaded somewhere that I can have so I can read it again without worrying of it one day being gone?


** [[http://ff2ebook.com]] has it. Search for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9474009]] .

** Not just that, he removed his whole profile. But top comment is right. The ebook downloader has it. I agree, it's a good guilty pleasure fic of mine.

** Story was pretty good. I liked it. Can't understand why the author decided to get rid of his profile and stories. Guess he got a wild hair stuck up his ass over a review or something.

** Grammar on this story isn't great. What's so good about it?

Edit: why are people down voting a general comment on the story after reading a chapter and the follow up question what the user likes about it?

*** Grammar isn't everything, just the storyline in general makes it one of my favourites, I've found it hard to find one similar since.

*** I can't tell you much without spoiling the story, it's just a unique take on a betrayed Harry TT fanfic, with my favourite pairing in Harry and Daphne or Haphne as people seem to call it... meh.

I thought the same as you the first time around, for the first couple of chapters, that this seems like someone who either A) doesn't have much knowledge of wording things correctly. B) English isn't their first language Or C) they're rather young. Around, chapter 7 is when I started to REALLY enjoy the story first time around, I started to appreciate the story more and began to ignore the grammar mistakes. Which I generally do now these days as there's some really good stories out there, that just isn't worded correctly but they're still pretty decent stories as a whole. Sorry it's taken me this long to fully respond, I first replied just before heading to bed so that's my bad for the short initial reply and just now got around to fully answering you.

**** No worries man, thanks for getting back to me regardless. I'm on chapter three at the moment and enjoying it so far. Got sidetracked for a bit with a Star Wars HP cross over.

*** Because it was a tactless thing to say. Here OP is asking what happened to a story they liked and you answered them with 1) not an answer to their question, which is dismissive and 2) a comment implying you didn't like the story for a pretty trivial reason. All comments that criticize FF are likely to be downvoted, just because this is a community that strongly defends its authors, unless the critique is asked for of arrises naturaly in discussion. Doing so outside of a discussion about the merits of the work comes off as kind of mean spirited, even if the critique is accurate.

**** Someone answered him already which is how I was able to read it... otherwise I clearly wouldn't have been able to comment on it.

He said it was one of his favourites so I'm trying to understand what are the highlights of the fic. â€˜Strongly defensive' seems to be getting dangerously close to oversensitive if the mere suggestion that a fic is anything less than perfection is that deeply offensive. I wasn't aware that trying to understand someone's POV was so contentious?

*** It's a time travel fix-it revenge story where you get trickle-fed backstory as it becomes needed.

It has it's sad parts, the happy parts, and the bittersweet parts. It's a journey. It also has some neat butterfly effects in a few places.

**** Sounds interesting. Does Harry stay a Dark Lord upon going back?

***** No, Voldemort wasn't really the main focus. Sure, fixing the problems of the second blood war were objectives, but it was the post-war stuff that is the main focus.

In fact, without getting too spoiler-y, Voldemort is small potatoes in this story.
