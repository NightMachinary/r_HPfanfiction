** I saw this fic yesterday and I remembered this post. It's only one chapter until now, but from what we already know, Neville is the BWL and Harry is another regular dude. We don't know what happened to James and Lily yet, but maybe this might get your interest. I don't know how to use the bot, but here's the link.
