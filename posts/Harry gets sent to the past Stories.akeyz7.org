  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

** Linkffn(Voldemort's Last Spell by Louis IX) It has some crossover with X Men and maybe Naruto (it has been a long time since I read it). It is abandoned though but it fulfills your Harry sent back in time.

Linkffn(The Wishmaster by lokilette) Harry is sent back to the Founders' time. He is raised by Slytherin (it does not go into the details as much as you'd expect.) It deals more with the Deathly Hallows than the time travel in the later parts.

  Voldemort intended to kill the whole Potter family, but something unexpected happened. Now, the Dark Lord must face the result of a severely twisted Prophecy as well as a very old... thing. What history can Harry have after this? What history can he make?

#+begin_quote
  Lily is prepared to do anything to save her son, so with her dying breath she finishes the ritual to cast her wish to the Wishmaster, asking to send Harry back into the past. Years before that fateful event, a green-eyed toddler is found by Salazar Slytherin, who decides to take him in as an heir. But the child has dreams much greater than simply being Slytherin's heir.
