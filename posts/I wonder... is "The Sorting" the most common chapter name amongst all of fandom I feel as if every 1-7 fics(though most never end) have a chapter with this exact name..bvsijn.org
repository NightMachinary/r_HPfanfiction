#+TITLE: I wonder... is "The Sorting" the most common chapter name amongst all of fandom? I feel as if every 1-7 fics(though most never end) have a chapter with this exact name.

What other chapter's names are common? "The Hogwarts Express" - "The Troll" - "Chamber of Secrets" ? Oh, "Yule Ball"


** I actually like the fact its called the sorting, because sometimes there is a very long arc of just childhood and this chapter name in the distant future gives me that clue that there is an end to it.

** Not everyone is original. Lots of people just name the chapters after the events that take place within them.

** I chose to put mine under "Beginning of a Journey" for the train ride, "Hoggy Warty Hogwarts", for the sorting and the Halloween one as "Trolled"

My story will visit the chamber twice, so the first time it'll be "Tom Marvolo Riddle" and the second time (almost a decade later) "The Chamber of Secrets"

"Yule Ball" will still likely remain the same.

** It is probably but I like it when title are short and in relation with the text. I remember an amazing fic (sadly abandoned) called "Forging the Sword" where the title of the chapter where interesting, but gave absolutely no indication of what happened inside.

If you are in a 1-7 fic, the sorting is an important part of the story, and unless you make 20k chapter, I doubt anything more important would happen during the chapter so it's normal the chapter is named like this.

​

I am more annoyed by author who make a full chapter of it when it has no interest for their story. (Guys, who all have read canon, we already know about the Houses, or about the Phantom, we even know where Hagrid will find Trevor, no to mention we know the song of the Hat. If your character is not completely different than canon, and especially if you write a redo fic, you can just gloss everything and write something like

Later, in front of the whole school, the Hat yelled "/Gryffindor/". (Hell, you can even make him change house as long as you explain it either with a conversation or internal monologue during the train ride.

​

PS : In very comon name, you can add "The cemetery" and "The Department of Mystery"

*** Don't forget the number of fics that just re-use the same song the hat sang in canon. I don't know why people think we need to re-read the same song in every fic.

**** Especially when the character doesn't "care" about it and just wait for his sorting after it. But I don't know what is worse after this, when Harry has "accidents" stopping him from being present in years 2 and 3, or when the author writes his own song (often of discutable quality).

** Some things are fairly immutable if you're going to have Harry going to Hogwarts. No one knows about the sorting. The philosophers stone is going to be at Hogwarts unless your Dumbledore is a more responsible. The chamber of secrets depends on whether Arthur is raiding houses. The triwizard is obviously in negioations regardless of what goes on.

** I mean, the point of chapter names is to give you a hint or tell you what's going on within the chapter. I don't want to read a chapter about them getting sorted, but it be titled "Darth Revan dropped a nuke on Hogwarts". Chapters get numbered if you don't want to want to name them.
