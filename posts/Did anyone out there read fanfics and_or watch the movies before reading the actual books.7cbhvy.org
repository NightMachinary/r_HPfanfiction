If so, what misconceptions about canon did you develop as a result?


** This happened to me with the hunger games series. I was too cheap to buy the books and didn't think of going to a library so I read a fanfiction where someone had rewritten all of the books. I eventually watched the movies / read the actual books and it was the weirdest thing. Like reading a better fanfiction of a real shitty book.

** I saw the four first movies, then read the three first books, then some fanfiction, then I went back and finished the official media. I never did get any real misconceptions through copious use of the wiki to get by while I was catching up.

** - I read a fanfiction where the Deathly Hallows and Horcruxes were introduced a lot earlier (like, Harry's first year). Then I read canon and wondered why Dumbledore was not getting to the point sooner.
- Dynamics within non-Gryffindor houses being virtually non-existent in canon. Some fanfic authors like to fill the gap which set my expectations.
- I expected the righthand men of the villains would play a larger role and maybe there would be a bit more illustration of their backgrounds (e.g. Lucius and Bellatrix), while in canon it's basically all about Voldemort.
- Non-Harry POV being extremely limited in canon. It felt ... stoic compared to fanfics where authors tend to take more liberty. (I think the movies do it to some extent.)

I think influence to my misconceptions (or rather undue expectations) was mostly from Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. I like to think I was fairly good at separating out HPMoR-specific concepts while reading it, but it appears that some things sneaked into my mind.

*** Given that we see the first of the Hallows in PS / SS and the first Horcrux in CoS, I do agree that it's odd that the concepts aren't introduced until much later.

Although, to be fair, I'm not sure Dumbledore actually knew for sure that Voldemort had made Horcruxes yet when Harry gave him Tom's diary. He was probably starting to speculate about it, though. It's strange that he didn't tell Harry he had one of the Hallows.

If only Luna had been a year higher. She could have told Harry about the Deathly Hallows /much/ sooner.

** A confession: I never read the PS Book.

I watched PS movie several times as it's my favorite one.

I finished other Books a few times, including audio version.

*** To be fair, if you're going to skip one (and only one) book in the series, that's probably the one that you can gloss over the most without missing out on too much. The heavier symbolism and more philosophically deep themes don't really start to emerge until a couple more books in, some of the most important characters (such as Sirius, Remus, Lucius, etc.) haven't entered the story yet, and the movie adaptation is faithful enough that you can watch it and be up to speed before reading CoS.

**** The only things they really changed was the times, which seemed more like judicious use of time skips.

***** If you can settle for a paperback set instead of a hardback one, it's only like $100 in a box set. You can choose between the original Mary Grandpre covers and the recent re-releases (which I personally don't like as much, although the spines combine to form a pretty cool image of Hogwarts).

****** i live with my family. i'm from turkey and the cheapest i could find here is 200 turkish lira, about 50 usd. we aren't exactly wealthy, making about 40000 lira a year, so i have limit my spendings.

i found some pdf's online, but i don't want to pirate it. so i decided to wait until i had my own source of income to buy the books.

******* My apologies. Since you said "bucks", I assumed I was talking to a fellow American. That means the books probably have different cover designs in your country than what we have here...

** When the sixth movie had first come out I had only read the first 4 books so I skipped number 5 to read 6 the night before the movie came out (a futile attempt I know, I only got through the first few chapters and was so confused about Lucius being in Azkaban). Eventually I finished 6 after I saw the movie and didn't end up reading 5 until after I had finished the book series and reread them again.

** Ya. I knew nothing and was confused over what was AU and not so I paused reading the fanfiction and ended up reading the entire series in a day from before a flight and until the end of that day right before I slept haha

Helped clear things up in a jiffy I'm sure I had plenty of misconceptions but I can't really recall any I was baffled by after reading the books other than the sense of ah, that makes much more sense than what I thought lol

** Me. I saw the movies,then read fanfics before getting a book. Though I did watch the Cinemasins and did wonder on about the inconsistencies. My first book was PoA and now I fully understand the whole Lumps, underage magic at the beginning along with the others inconsistencies or unexplained things in the movie.
