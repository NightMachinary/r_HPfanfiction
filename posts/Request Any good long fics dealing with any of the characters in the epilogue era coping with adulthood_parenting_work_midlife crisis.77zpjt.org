I read a partially complete fic a few months ago where Harry and Ginny were dealing with balancing work-family. The author was kind of all over the place with the plot and delving into the story of other characters "adult life" but what really struck me was how the author explored Ginny's feeling "trapped" with a new baby (and frustration at the expectation everyone had that she would be giving up her career and her mother's constant disapproval that Ginny wasn't being a good house-witch)

I have looked for the story since but can't find it. I'm currently on maternity leave and if one more person asks me if I'll be quitting my job to be home with the baby, I am going to scream. I'd like to read about the crew facing adulthood and how they handle the implicit expectations that we do or act a certain way for success in our personal and professional lives.

So what have you got? Hermione interviewing prospective nannies? Draco and Astoria getting marriage counseling? Harry teaching his kids to play Quiddich? It doesn't need to be about marriage or babies or parenting, Neville having a midlife crisis and, I don't know--selling out his herbology business to go buy a bar? Chasing dragons for sport?--would be equally entertaining I think.

So hit me up. What are your best "the crew is adulting"'fics?


** “Strangers at Drakeshaugh” by Northumbrian started off really interesting. It's worth a few hours and the party scene is imaginative and intriguing. But...it has gone off onto a tangent about the main muggle character constantly cleaning a house in preparations for people to come over. Write what you know, I suppose? Like most fanfics, it loses focus and steam. But the early chapters are good.

*** I was going to mention this fic, but I have to strongly disagree with your characterization of Jacqui. Yes, one of her character tics is that she likes a clean house when guests are over, but this is far from something that consumes the fic. I just reviewed the last five chapters of the fic and cleaning doesn't enter into it.

It's a very different kind of fic; it's almost a novel of manners (like Jane Austin) at the beginning, with the conflict revolving around Mom schoolyard drama, but you eventually get sucked into the mystery that Harry is trying to solve.

Northumbrian is famously spotty updater, but we've gotten three updates in as many months recently (the most recent on the 20th) and we're nearing the end, so hopefully they'll push through to the end soon.

*** I read a bunch of this and then took a break and read a few summaries of her other works... and got completely spoiled by what was going to happen in the plot of Strangers at Drakeshaugh (its a prequel apparently). Once I was completely spoiled I dildn't want to read any more. It also showed me that it wasn't building to anything. No one gets killed by a werewolf despite that whole plot seeming like a slow burn smoking gun and none of Jacqui's kids even end up being muggleborn (I thought the reason why she was able to bypass the muggle repellent charms was that she always took one of her kids with her) .

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6435092/1/Turn][Turn]] and other stories by Saras_girl kind of have that, and are well-written. Harry Potter/Draco Malfoy though, as a heads-up.

** I wish I had specific fics to recommend but I can't think of any off hand! That being said, there are loads of fics like that if you filter by Draco and Scorpius. I would try adding in the Genre: Family on ff.net too, that should help narrow them down. Good luck!
