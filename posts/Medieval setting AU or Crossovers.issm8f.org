I just recently finished ffn(The Swallow and the Dragon by Flameraiser) and have developed a taste for fics that feature Harry on a Medieval setting. It does not have to be a magical setting, just as long it has that medieval feeling.

It could be either time travel, or crossover (if the story can be easily followed without prior knowledge the better).

No slash or Harry/Ginny pairing.

Thank you!


** Definitely [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11078427][Serpentine Moves]] by betagere on ao3, is Tomione, but Harry is an important character still. For sure has that Olde Timesâ„¢ feel to it with castles and betrothals and everything.

It's for people with pretty specific...tastes. Read /ALL/ the tags before you start reading.

  I got sick of seeing the same old shit, done the same old way, in Harry Potter Fan-fiction.So I decided to take as many new ideas as i could think of, while mixing in things that I have seen before in ways I haven't seen before.That means that while there will be graphic sex, among other things in this story, it won't be for a few chapters. Also there is an excessive number of content tags, but I want to be through, and rest assured anything tagged will be in the story at some point.
