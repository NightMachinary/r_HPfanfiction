Looking for stories where Harry becomes an Obscurial either during his time at the Dursleys or during the school year or even in Azkaban.


** Is it possible for Harry to be an obscurial? In canon terms, I mean, obviously do what you want with a fictional AU. But I was under the impression that an obscurial was created by the person consciously repressing their magic to avoid punishment or alienation? Harry didn't know he had magic, and wasn't aware that his accidental magic was happening until after the weird event had happened - and he understands his accidental magic in terms of "why does this weird shit always happen to me" rather than "how am I causing this weird shit." So for Harry, there's no way he can be conscious of it and repressing it. Even when Vernon punishes him for AM, he doesn't know why he's being punished, he just puts it down to Vernon being a bastard who hates him - would that have the potential to turn him into an obscurial?

I could be wrong and I like the idea though. It would serve the Dursleys right to have that unleashed on them.

*** The point of divergence would probably have to be him realizing that he is somehow the cause of things happening on his own, or the Dursleys informing him.

**** Do bear in mind that at the point of recieving his first hogwarts letter Harry was sarcastic, willful ("Make dudley get it") and rather proud of his own uniqueness. Being informed alone wouldn't create an obscurus (obscurial? I get the host and the parasite confused), there would have to be another point of divergence in terms of either harry's personality or a major increase from the beginning of the Dursley's level of abuse, and probably both unless you want to take the dursleys to worse-than-voldemort levels.

***** I think it would fit with fanon Dursley behaviour, as many fics make them worse and more physically abusive than canon did.

You're right, Harry likes being different from the Dursleys. And in fairness, who wouldn't want to be different from the Dursleys?!

*** Basically Credence from fantastic beasts and where to find them.

A “dark creature” that is a result of a powerful magical child suppressing its magic due to abuse until it practically erupts in a massive display of accidental magic.

At least I think, I'm not entirely sure what the hell the one on the movie was and how accurate it was to pre-established lore.
