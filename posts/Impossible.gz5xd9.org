Any fics where Harry can do impossible things as long as he doesn't know it's impossible?


** In linkffn(Albus and Harry's World Trip), it's a recurring theme.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** In /The Shock of It All,/ by Fairywm, Harry loses his memory, and when they bring him back to Hogwarts, Luna gets ahold of him and won't let anyone tell him the rules of magic, which only hamper his abilities. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12011689/1/The-Shock-of-it-All]])

  A freak potion accident renders our hero without memory of who he is. Watch as the new Harry takes Hogwarts by storm. No one is going to tell him what to do. AU 4th year. Super!Unfettered!Cussing!Harry. Some bashing, but not stupidly so. Not a crossover, but with a lot of Sci-fi references. Harry's a bit of an ass.
