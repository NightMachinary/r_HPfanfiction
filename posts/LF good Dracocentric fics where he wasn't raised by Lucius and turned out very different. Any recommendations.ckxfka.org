  "In the glow of the fires, her unkempt hair was a halo, her eyes were Baltic amber, and he was panicking." Born and raised in France, Draco Malfoy attends Beauxbatons and leads a privileged, well-ordered existence. He meets Hermione Granger for the first time at the Triwizard Tournament, and that's when things get... strange. But kind of wonderful, too.

** l feel bad that I keep rec'ing linkffn(Living With Danger) but it fits the request. It isn't exactly Draco centric especially as he doesn't come to his new family for a bit, but he does have a major role once the Hogwarts Years start and I think the author does a good job of balancing the storylines of Harry, Hermione, and Draco in the sequels.

**** I love this series and think it has aged pretty well though it has been a while since I have done a full reread. I'm much more familiar with the first two books than the later works because when I started reading them those were not finished.
