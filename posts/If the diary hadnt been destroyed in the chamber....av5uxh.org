What if the diary wasn't destroyed, and had actually been able to rise again, would sixteen year old voldemort be the one Harry had to fight for the rest of the series. Prompt for Yall or any fics that go into this?


** Ginny never survived. The destruction of the Diary merely forced the soul fragment into Ginny. The Ginny we see in the Books is the resulting merger of the Diary Tom and the original Ginny. She (he?) has the memories and powers of both, and this secret might be the reason why canon Ginny suddenly becomes so awesome.

Later, her (his?) skills are very much responsible for their lucky escape from the DoM; her airtight magical contract is the key to DA's safety during Year 7; and her killing of large number of Death Eaters during the Final Battle prevents a collapse of the defenders. During her duel with Bellatrix, she holds back a little too much and is almost hit by a killing curse. But alas, Molly takes over and finishes the job just fine.

After the war, she continues to use (guide) the Trio to advance her cause, while playing the role of a popular athlete herself. From time to time though, she needs to kill and torture some pesky enemies just for stress relief. Twenty years later, the Trio does indeed make it to the top, and she can happily rule behind the scene. Both Tom and Ginny should be proud of her achievements.

Luckily, the Imperius Curse s/he had previously cast was powerful enough to guide her movements in proper dueling form. Even that would likely have proved insufficient, had Bellatrix not recognized telltale flourishes and stances that reminded her of her beloved Dark Lord.

** Oddly enough, almost all of the fics in which the Diary gets a body have him team up with Harry rather than try to kill him.

The plots typically go a couple different ways:

- The Diary intuitively understands that There Can Be Only One™ Voldemort, so he tries to hide from the main soul with the knowledge that attempting to fight for dominance would be futile.

- The Diary fails to realize that There Can Be Only One™ Voldemort, so he helps the main soul to resurrect. He soon learns, to his chagrin, that the main soul is a massive berk who wants to stick his horcrux back in a safe (disembodied) place where it belongs. Inevitably the horcrux rebels and coerces/persuades Harry to help him take down the main soul.

  - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15873207/chapters/36982095][Ink]] linkao3(15873207)

- The Diary tries to take over where the main soul left off, but he soon wises up to the fact that at 16 years of age he lacks the requisite power boost from obscure magical lore and the leverage to keep his evil minions in line. He eventually forms an uneasy alliance of necessity with the main soul to achieve their common goals.

- Through a freak accident the Diary winds up stuck in Ginny's body. Horror and/or comedy ensues.

  Things go differently, down in the Chamber. Instead of pouring herself into the diary, Ginny opened her heart to it, her heart and her mind, and that means a different path for Tom Riddle to take. No message saying Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever; instead Tom takes Ginny down to the Chamber one empty afternoon and waits for the last of her to die. When it is all over Tom flicks long red hair over her shoulders, picks up Ginny's wand (not a perfect match, but better than nothing, better than fifty years without a wand) and leaves the Chamber. Saunters out of Myrtle's bathroom looking like nothing more than a little eleven year old girl.

  Tom thought that perhaps fifty years of utter isolation and stagnation in a diary was a small price to pay to gain the advantages of being a living Horcrux, even if he was probably a bit mad from the experience. After all, being mad was no impediment to a Dark Lord.

  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark... Warning: Deals with Stockholm Syndrome and dark themes.
