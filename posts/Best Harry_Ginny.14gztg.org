Or anything canon, really. I don't know much about Fan Fiction yet, but it seems fun!


** - The Awakening Power [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1709027/1/:]] "Challenges fill Harry's 6th year: growing powers, Snape as defense teacher, new Potions teacher, a new crush on him, Voldemort, Ginny, Goblins? Lots of humor, drama, action and romance!"\\
- Unintended Consequences [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6365342/1/Unintended-Consequences:]] "When Ron and Harry got into their fight while out hunting Horcruxes, Hermione ran after Ron leading to some unintended consequences. Even with the best of intentions, things can still go wrong."
- The Order of the Phoenix [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/826742/1/:]] "Harry's fifth year and he's just been chosen by the Order. Kinda strange, especially since the only living member in the Order is Harry! New powers, new friendships, new relationships and old enemies. H/G and R/Hr."
- Harry Potter and the Death Hallows Do Over! [[http://m.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/harry_ginny/dho/a:]] "Fidelius? Fixed. Camping? Cut. Elder Wand? Eliminated. A rational Lupin. Hedwig lives! Slytherin redeemed! Snape doesn't die in such a lame way! The seventh book as I'd have written it. Canon ships."
- The Hero Trilogy: Part 1: Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/.../HPATSOTH.html]] "A thousand-year-old oath stands to be fulfilled. The war between Good and Evil has been raging on for a millennium. It has a chance to end, but has the hero of the side of good lost the will to live...``Harry Potter returns to the Dursleys care for the summer, but he finds the loss of Sirius hard to bear. He blames himself for his death. Voldemort doesn't let him rest though, and soon Harry is flung back into his world. The war escalates, and more people die or join Voldemort. The fear of the Dark Lord reaches beyond the wizarding world and into the Muggle one. Both worlds will collide, as Harry will have to make the ultimate choice between what is right and what is easy. For in this war, some things are more important than life or death..."
- Part 2: Harry Potter and the Defiance of the Hero Link: [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/.../HPATDOTH.html]]
- Part 3: Harry Potter and the Soul of the Hero Link: [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/...PATSOTH2_.html]]

*** YES! I fucking /love/ the Hero trilogy. Just thinking about it gives me chills; the Dark Tower was/is one of my favorite series of all time. The way the Hero series was written though, was fucking brilliant. The (de)characterization, the settings, the Ways of Twilight, and the very end... my god. I have to reread this series again, for the fourth time... good thing it's break.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][Literally anything on this author's page]].

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4195338/1/Pink-Peppermint-Other-Tales-of-Harry-and-Ginny][Pink Peppermint]] for romance.

I don't know if you want specifically romantic things or just fics that happen to involve the pair of them in a romantic relationship.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose]] is a time travel fic with a Harry/Ginny pairing.
