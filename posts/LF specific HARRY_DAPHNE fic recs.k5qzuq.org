Im in the mood for some fics wherein Harry sees Daphne for the first time and falls in love instantly (like James did with Lily) and sets about learning all he can about wizarding culture as well as how loving relationships actually work having never felt love himself. Just doing anything he can to impress her and recieve her affection. Anything along these lines would be great, or even any general haphne goodness anyone wants to share.


** Harry black: book 1 the hero's return, by authork on ffn, it has a few sequels as well, I remember enjoying the first book, for some reason or another I didn't read the second one but, if you havent checked it out I certainly would.
