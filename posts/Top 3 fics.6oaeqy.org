*** Okay so I read each one, and I'm gonna give a quick opinion on each

DP&SW: I loved this fic in a guilty pleasure sort of sense, even though some of the characters were very overpowered for their age, namely Luna and Ginny. Even with this it was still pretty fantastic.

Stages of Hope is possibly my favourite fanfiction ever, and I hate that because the amount of times I've skipped over this fic in the past because of its summary makes me feel angry toward myself. The different versions of Snape, Sirius, Lucius and most of all, Draco were incredibly interesting to read and enjoy, and the cracks in the broken four were even more interesting, especially Luna.

Vox Corporis is my least favourite of the three due to the sheer obviousness of the Ron hate, however I do like how it shows the natural growth of character from Harry and Hermione. However, this is the only fic out of the three that I struggled to finish.

**** Whoa, you're a fast reader. I'm impressed.

I'm glad you enjoyed the recs. Stages of Hope is probably a perfect fic, there's nothing I would change about it.

If I'd known you were very fond of Ron I'd have chosen a different 3rd rec, but I had to throw an HHr story in there and most of them feature a not so... charitable... outlook on the guy. I don't even remember Vox Corporis being so bad about him...

Stages of Hope was utterly brilliant so tysm for opening my eyes to it.

And hey, I asked for your top 3 fics, not your top 3 fics that revolve around my interests. If anything I'm glad you posted a fic I didn't enjoy that much bc I was worried we were actually the same person after reading the first two :P
