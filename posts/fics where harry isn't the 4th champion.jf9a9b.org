** Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)

Harry has six relatively normal years, given he's a dragon (and that's okay).

His involvement with the TWT is limited to being a camera-dragon and helping to "wrangle" the dragon for the first task (read: Explain the rules of the task to it since Harry speaks its language).

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** the only one good fan fiction i know where harry isn't a triwizard champion, is some kind of book series on wattpad. each book represents 1 schoolyear (just like the normal books). The main character in the book is Harry's older brother. in part 4 he takes the place of harry in the election of the school champions.

I think it is really well written, and i really like the story! If you are planning to read it, i strongly advise to just start with the first book, since the main character experiences much more than 'just being Harry Potter's brother'. It might help you understand the whole story.
