I was wondering if anyone could help me find this old fic I read forever ago. It's a HGxSS time travel fic where she is fixing up his house after his death, but keeps traveling back and forth through time and changes things in the Marauders era. Idk if anyone can help, but I appreciate anything!


** It's on the tip of my tongue! Great now I'm going to explode!
