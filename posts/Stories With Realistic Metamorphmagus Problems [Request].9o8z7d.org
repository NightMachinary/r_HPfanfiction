This came to mind when I was writing a scene where McGonagall (who I've written as Harry's guardian) and Tonks are warning Harry about people who might try to take advantage of his Metamorphmagus powers for illicit means (make of this what you will).

And that got me thinking. Are there any decent stories where, say, Tonks has to fend off people (in school or in work, but preferably the former) who are only interested in her simply because she could become anyone they wanted in order to fulfill whatever fantasies they have? I'd prefer them not to be successful (not "onscreen" anyway), but maybe she had a bad experience with it before and so she knows to be on guard for it. Because let's be real, that's exactly what a lot of people would be interested in her for.


** I'm not at my computer right now so I can't really search through a bunch of fics, but I've seen this I pretty much every Harry/Tonks fic I've encountered. "Tonks likes Harry because Harry likes Tonks for Tonks rather than her ability."

*** Well let's exclude those because, as you said, they're pretty common. I was thinking more of a Tonks-centric story, unrelated to Harry.

** Well, there's a fic where all metamorphs are catalogued and have their "serial number" in something called Conscription Act, handled by the DoM as a way to control them. Its also in that list where other special magical beings like Heliopaths and Animagi are recorded. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

Here's an excerpt about it:

#+begin_quote
  "A very old and obscure law of the Wizengamot," said Augusta. "One which requires wizards and witches who possess certain rare magical gifts, whether innately or acquired, to register them with the Ministry or risk imprisonment. Depending on the nature of the gifts in question, the person may also be compelled to act as an agent of the Ministry."\\
  "In my case," said Tonks, "the Metamorphmagus gift is on the Conscription List, so when my powers manifested when I was a baby, my parents had to register me. I was always going to end up working in the Ministry in some capacity after that, but my grades plus my gift made me qualified for the Academy no matter how grudging some people are about it."

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
