So, every so often, a post pops up regarding religion in the wizarding world. I won't get into the intricacies of that beyond saying that I think most modern religions are represented proportionally to their presence in the muggle world. The topic of conversation /here/ is regarding religions among other magical sapients.

Goblins, for example, are usually represented primarily as bloodthirsty bankers. Everyone knows about the Indy!Harry Goblin inheritance tests, magical refilling bag from vaults, chequebook, magical!debit card, etc. But I've never seen anything that focuses on their religious beliefs. Personally, I think they likely have a primarily polytheistic religion featuring deities of wealth, smithing, and battle, with some other aspects thrown in for good measure. Some goblins who live amongst humans have likely converted to other various religions present on the surface though. I also think they likely have a form of ancestor worship, due to their concept of ownership. So my idea of their beliefs would be that their primary religion is overseen by three gods (or goddesses) of Wealth, Smithing, and War, then below those three are the most famous heroes of each domain having been incarnated as lesser gods after their deaths, then each individual family reveres their own ancestors.

Then we come to centaurs. We know that the ones by Hogwarts at least tend to obsess over the stars and divination, so I consider it likely that they have a non-theistic religion focusing on the cosmos, knowledge, and possibly enlightenment. They likely have revered figures they consider to have achieved this state (Chiron, anyone?) There are likely regional variations on this of course, but their populations are potentially small enough to maintain a fairly unified belief system overall.

Merfolk are likely the most diverse in terms of religious, due to the varying types of them (assuming that the multiple depictions of them throughout historical myths and legends are all true of /that/ regions' Merfolk.) In general, I expect elemental deities, spirits, and a smattering of whatever the local human religions historically were. The selkies near Hogwarts for example would have some similarities to Scottish Celt beliefs for example.

House elves practice ancestor worship and whatever the primary religion of their household/master is, the Hogwarts elves are a melting pot of belief systems, and Dobby is a free-market capitalist who if he'd survived would have eventually discovered Ayn Rand and become a purist Libertarian (who would spread the secular gospel of the Great Liberator, Harry Potter, and accidentally start a genuine religion in the process.) Okay, that last one is a bit cracky, but I stand by it!

What are your thoughts, headcanons, additions, etc?


** I mostly just relate their religions to their mythology/cultural origins. The centaur gets their divination from hellenistic myth and astrological practices, as well as their creation being a greek myth, so they follow a type of that tradition. House elves (brownies)and boggarts come from Scottish folklore, so they follow that ancient tradition of pseudo-Celtic. Etc etc....

** Acromantula: given that Aragog was able to speak English, it's reasonable to conclude that they are a sentient species. If they were to have a religion, I believe it would probably be a warrior-like one, focused on the strong surviving and the Glorious Hunt or something. Maybe also have them view patience and preparation as the highest virtues because of the way they build their webs.

Or, if you want to go in a slightly less serious direction, they see the universe as all being interconnected by the Great Web, and they must do whatever they can to follow the plan set forward when the First Spider set to weaving it, because everyone is a strand with a place in the web. (Whether Dumbledore's Greater Good was inspired by these tales of the Great Web is a secret only known to him and Grindelwald, who left Dumbledore the moment he found out their plans were based on a giant spider religion and set about making his own, better, cooler interpretation of the Greater Good, with dark arts, and warcrimes. Yes that is a schism in a church of only two humans)
