Vaguely like linkffn(6963092) I suppose, but that's not a great fic.

I don't need an abusive dumbledore - manipulative, yes. I don't need abusive dursleys - though I don't mind that). I just want a fic where what Harry is told about the other side is at least partially wrong. Its fascinating. By no means necessary should the other side be great and good and all that crap. I expect them to have actually done SOME bad things, but the idea of some of it being propaganda is interesting.

I believe I've read the most recced one of this genre, though I can't remember its name, so skip that, I guess. Its the one where Harry gets a letters or something at the beginning.

I don't mind slash, but please no Harry/Voldy or Harry/Tom, I hate it. I mean I guess it would work if it was a time travel fic, but not any other way.


** If you're willing to slog through a million words linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom) or you can go with half to a quarter of that (circular reasoning;lesser evils;)

** linkffn(on the wings of a phoenix by makoyi) is probably the one you're talking about with the letters. I'm probably the only one that recs the story, but I do guess I tend to do it at least once a day since it fits so many story requests.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.
