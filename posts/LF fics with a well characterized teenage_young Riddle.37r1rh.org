Doesn't matter if it's canon or AU. I just want ones where he's particularly well done. Bonus points for the inclusion of Dumbledore or Grindelwald as well.

Would prefer not to have slash or any romance in general.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6031176/1/Tied-for-Last][Tied for Last]]. The author initially intended it to be a romantic story and didn't realize until after finishing that it describes an abusive relationship. A common mistake given today's media, as absurd as that should be.

*** I can't really imagine a Tom Riddle based on canon who isn't at least somewhat abusive. I very much enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite][Fate's Favorite]] but part of what makes it work is that Tom is abusive, and cruel, and possessive of his friend, and of course still very compelling.

**** Fate's Favourite was fantastic :0

I put off reading it for so long cos everyone described it as Harry being under Tom's control and so abusive and unhealthy and scary and psychopathic, and the first few chapters were a little disjointed and confusing, and between those things and the constant "THIS IS NOT SLASH" rants by the author I put it off for like a year and a half.

But when I finally read it, it was like... The best fic ever? It was more fulfilling than ten romances put together, despite the author's 'this is not slash', it had a good ending despite all odds, and the two of them were absolutely beautiful together.

** Witchcraft by a Picture is pretty interesting, though it does have a romance. Non-conventional (yes I mean non-conventional not non-consensual), since it's Tom Riddle after all.

Looks like Tom/OFC, in which the OC lives at his orphanage and justifies staying over the summer in order to "protect the other orphans" (from /Tom/)

**** That's how it starts yeah, I just think the characterization is pretty good as you go on. Also, its canon-compliant which I find neat for these kind of "other side" stories.

** Super AU with Tom as an adult. Abandoned(?)WIP (2/3 chapters posted) by gyzym. Bonus for D/G inclusion!

I cry about once a year that this isn't finished yet, but it's so wonderfully written.
