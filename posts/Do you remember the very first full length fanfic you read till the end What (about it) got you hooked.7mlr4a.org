** Rise if the wizards.

I liked how for once, the author wasn't convinced that Hermione was a flawless godess. And it was the first Independant!Harry where he isn't a arrogant 11 years old boy that I read.

** Nightmares of Futures Past is novel length but not technically complete. I still read it to end because the writing and premise sucked me in.

** Not 100% certain which one it was -- either The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville or Gabriel by Shikatanai (unfortunately unfinished).

Both were the 'Harry is rescued from the Dursleys' premise, and were written very well. Gabriel had a totally different take on the trope, while The Best Revenge introduced several new plot ideas.

** Psychic Serpent by Barb. Very well written, don't know how it holds up today. I thought it went OOC and disappointing at the very end.

It came out when everyone was waiting for the next book.

** I didn't start reading fics until after HBP because I needed something to get me through until the next book. The first real Fic I really remember is a Fic where Severus and Dumbledore faked his death and Dumbledore was like a bumblebee. I'm not sure it was even ever finished. It was on like mugglenet I think way back when it was a forum based place people posted fics at. You had to scroll through comments to get to next update.

** I've read Fanfiction for years before, but never really looked into HP FF. That was until I stumbled upon this Subreddit and was recommended A Black Comedy. I personally enjoyed the humor. For some reason it just clicked. It seemed to fit perfectly for me and I loved it. Read through the entire thing over the course of the same night I found it

** For Harry Potter, it was Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run. I wanted to try out the pairing and thought the premise was hilarious.

My first fic in general was an Artemis Fowl fic: Holly's Diary. I was 10 and wanted more of the series.

** R trilogy by greengecko. The third story was only like 30 or so chapters in at the time, and I never really did go back to it. The story had a lot of interesting concepts at the time, some of which are still pretty neat today. That being said, my opinion on these that type of story hasn't changed, as I think it would be much better without any of the Snape stuff.

** Complete or are incomplete but abandoned fine too?

Because if they are fine too then mine was “Realizations”. As to what got me hooked, well ... a tale of Harry finding a true place for himself, I don't think I need ot elaborate on that.

And if those don't count then “Oh God Not Again!”, and the reason I got through it is because it's an over-the-top comedy.

** On the Harry Potter FanFiction site, called ‘They Did It Better'.

I don't know how to make the bot link to it, but I enjoyed it so much. It's short, just over 9k and set out like snippets from Harry and Hermione's life.

** There were three fics I read in the beginning - Hermione Granger and the goblet of fire, Dumbledore's army and the year of Darkness and then an old do-over fic, although I can't remember which one. Backwards with a purpose? I dunno, can't remember.

** Mine was Fourier's Flaw by SiriusBlacksGodDaughter. I found it by Google searching "Who would win in a duel: Tom Riddle or Hermione Granger?" which popped into my head when I was reading The Half-Blood Prince during a study abroad. It's a Tom Riddle/Hermione Granger romance. Even though I'm not into that pairing, it remains my favorite story I ever read on FF.

** "Geheimnisse der Vergangenheit" by Rikki-Tikki-Tavi. Its the first in a trilogy (just checked... he finished the third one a few years ago? I think I have to read the whole series again now!) of fan fics. The main characters are OCs one year younger than Harry who are in Slytherin and Ravenclaw. What pulled me in was that I wanted a story with a "good" Slytherin, but did not want Harry/somebody else romance. Then I fell in love with the characters.

First English language fan fic? "Living with Danger" by whydoyouneedtoknow. I wanted a story where Harry was rescued from the Dursleys and got a happy family. I think I read a lot of those stories at this point, but most others just did never get finished.

** Ugh I had to look up the title but, as embarrassed as I am to say, it was "The Greatest Scandal in Hogwarts History" the big clusterf/@/ where Harry gets Ginny pregnant at Hogwarts and it becomes this epic journey with unconditional support from all the professors, parents and other adults who are 110% on-board with teenage pregnancy for some crazy reason. I can't believe I'm still a fan of H/G and Ginny overall today, after subjecting myself to trollop like this, and worse convincing myself I liked it.

In my defense it was first posted back in 2001. Canon was only up to Book 4, which had been released the summer before, and the first movie premiered right after the fic had started to be posted. I shared an old desktop with my entire family and our rural area still only had 24k dialup. It could take a good 30 minutes just to get online and upload the newest chapter. There wasn't much in the world of HP fan fic, the fandom had yet to really develop. I was also still in middle school and still wrote SI fics of my own, so my taste left something to be desired.
