I believe it was HP & the Methods of Rationality which has one of its subplots observation that Slytherin got so much tangled with the Dark Magic, Deatheaters, Pureblood supremacy, that even people who should be Slytherins rather try to avoid it and talk the Sorting Hat into sorting them in some other house (Harry is a canonical example, but this story mentioned also Padma Patil, I believe). In this story Harry and Draco I believe started some kind of movement for renaissance of Slytherin to recover honour of the house (after all, there is nothing dark or dishonest per se about ambitions, cunning, etc.). However, if I recall correctly, this movement somehow evaporated in the middle of fighting Voldemort.

Does anybody know about a story which would take this idea seriously and run away with it? Somebody (Draco? Daphne? Snape?) trying to recover public image of the Slytherin house?


** That person would be Tobias Grey in the OC-centric stories linkffn(Latet Anguis In Herba) and linkffn(Shade to Shade by Slide)

The stories have the same timeline as the books.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  The sequel to 'Latet Anguis in Herba', set during HBP. The Slytherins return to Hogwarts under the shadow of the war and their own demons. But with the wizarding world embroiled in conflict, how are they supposed to cope with their seventh and final year? MASSIVELY RE-EDITED.
