  There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad that wasn't in Slytherin... well at least according to Hagrid. A chance meeting with Professor Slughorn changes Harry's outlook just in time for the sorting.

** There was a story, where Harry hides for longer period of time (couple of months at least) in Grimmauld Place and Slughorn is there and he teaches him Potions. Very intense teaching, but very lovely working teacher-student relationship. I am not even sure whether it was male!Harry or female!Harry. Anybody?

** Hellstrike yes! :) I did always like Slughorn! He's one of my favorite adult characters. He's smart and talented and friendly, but he has his own faults and goals too. Like the Hagrid stuff and Aragog. :) I would LOVE to read a whole mentor Slughorn story, like those mentor Snape stories all the time. Also he says HARRY MAH BOY for real, not like fanon Dumbledore. :)

*** Slughorn is generally one of my favorite characters.Despite manipulating his students to get what he wants(which could literally just be candy or sports tickets) he generally cares for them and acts friendly around his students.The 3 major teachers to Harry are Snape,McGonnogal and Snape.Dumbledore cares for Harry,but isn't a teacher so doesn't interact with him daily.McGonnogal is fair-ish But is still stern.Snape is well... Snape.Admittedly,it shouldn't have take J.K. 5 books to make a good Slytherin but better late then 9 years later in a horrible stage play where the only good thing is the homoeroticism.

He pretty much kickstarts their careers - asking for things like candy or sports tickets is a non-issue after that. As someone who's had a hard time finding an opening job, a teacher like Slughorn would have been a godsend.
