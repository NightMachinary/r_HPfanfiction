It has to be at least 4-5 years old I think. It mostly centered around Hermoine and I believe Harry who went to Voldemort's side because the females in the ho universe were being abused by their husbands/so's. I remember Arthur abusing Molly and maybe Luna was assaulted by her father? A friend brought the fic up the other day but neither of us can remember the title or who wrote it.


** Still no luck finding it
