I have discussed this with a lot of other fans and it seems like it might be a good theory. It is canon that the majority of purebloods in England are related in some way by blood, and many intermarry distance cousins to ensure the blood line is pure.

I think that it has reach a point where it has begun to effect fertility, because it seems like a lot of the pureblood families only have one child. And for a group that seems determined to outnumber the blood traitors and 'mudbloods' you would think they would have more children.

Does anyone else think that it might take a few more generations before the pureblood either stop being able to have children, or start producing more squibs?


** Weasleys disagree.

Also the latest Blacks had three and two children respectively. Even Marvolo Gaunt whose family pushed the limits of inbreeding had two children. The only family of the sacred 28 specifically said to have one child is Malfoy, which ironically is the only family that is specifically said to have managed to avoid inbreeding while keeping their bloods pure.

There's also:

- The Longbottoms, but they also didn't really have a chance to have more kids, whether they were willing and able to have more or not.

- The Crouches only had one kid.

- The previous generation of Lestranges had two kids, but the generation we see had between zero and one kids, depending on how/if Delphini counts. But it's also possible that they were planning to have kids once they won the war.

- While the previous generation of Blacks did have five kids in two families, none of those kids had more than one child of their own, and at least two had no children. But again, extenuating circumstances were involved.

Basically, I think that the low birthrate is probably mostly a side effect of the war that was going on.

**** I think they were referring to the fact the the Malfoys only ever had one child, even when other families were having the 'heir and spare' to help continue. The Malfoys have something of a family pact to keep the fortune in the family and that means no division of assets to multiple children.

** This naturally presupposes that fertility (and for that matter, genetics as a whole) works the same for wizards as it does for Muggles. Additionally, it assumes squibs are one outcome of inbreeding.

I am not sure this is the case.

The most we get on inbreeding is the Gaunts in HBP:

#+begin_quote
  “Marvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter.”
#+end_quote

This is interesting and has to be read carefully. What it *doesn't* say is that "instability and violence" is a result of inbreeding. What it /does/ say is that the Gaunts /always/ had a tendency for "instability and violence", and because they married within their own family, they refined that trait.

This, by the way, is one of the reason historically for rulers obsessed with bloodlines (e.g., Ancient Egyptian Pharaohs) to marry in the family, they thought it would preserve and refine its traits. Now I have no idea why you wanted to preserve instability and violence, but that's the Gaunts for you. The point here is, with magic, that apparently works very well, and that's not even accounting for magical heritable traits like speaking Parseltongue.

And of course, notably absent in that quote is also any reference to Merope's lack of talent. And this makes sense: Far more than inbreeding, the #1 predictor of whether you produce a Muggle or a wizard offspring is whether you yourself are a Muggle or a wizard. Wizards and witches produce wizards and witches, Muggles produce Muggles (100% true, in fact, if you subscribe to "all Muggleborns descend from Squibs").

That their numbers will dwindle if they all have only one child is obvious, but there's no evidence to link that to inbreeding. Not least, because we see lots non-pureblood single children (Tonks, Lupin, Snape etc.). If we treat the Weasleys as an exception, you could make a better case for witches not being able carry many children (perhaps it's very taxing on the mother's magic?), or wizards and witches just being less fertile in toto.

.

So what we have is A) no clear indication that inbreeding has effects on the quality and the number of offspring, and B) a clear indication that it can be used to refine heritable traits. Given all that, I'm not surprised purebloods would marry cousins.

Tbh, with those odds, if I were a pureblood, /I/ would certainly look for a partner with a nice long magical family history, and also look at whatever nice heritable traits they have. It just seems to make a ton of sense?

*** You are probably right about the inbreeding not being the cause of the families having so few children. But I find it very odd that so many families would have so few children, especially considering it would lead to depopulation of the wizarding race over the generations. It might be exactly what you said, and having children is taxing on a witch's magic. Considering Molly Weasley is able to go toe to toe with a witch like Bellatrix after decades of raising children rather than dueling and fighting, she must have strong enough magic to allow her to carry so many children with risking her health.

**** We also know that Molly has a very... "motherly" figure. What if a lot of the standards of feminine beauty among the Pureblood aristocracy include narrow hips and low body fat? The former would make childbirth more difficult (especially if there's no magical equivalent to a C-section) while the latter would reduce fertility.

EDIT: Alternatively, there's the explanation given by "Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood" - the old families have their own secret/proprietary spells, and the Weasley magics are largely based around fertility.
