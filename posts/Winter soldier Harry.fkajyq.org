Looking for a fanfic where I'm pretty sure he was pronounced a squib and someway somehow ended up in a super soldier program and was paired up with the Black Widow


** I found linkffn(Treading Dangerous Waters) Dummo if it's what you wanted. Looks a little trash tbh, no offense to the writer.

  "Harry Potter is dead. He died when you left him at an orphanage. You are a terrible mother, Liliana Mae Potter and I am glad Harry Potter died. I am James Buchanan Barnes Jr. I am the Soldier. Understand?"Bucky Barnes Jr. is kidnapped by his old family and is forced to go to Hogwarts.Let's just hope he can get through irritating sisters, jealous redheads and manipulating bastards

******* I would although there is a level of "Hey times a wasting, what's going on" that happens it isn't to bad. Near the end it does introduce a number of heroes many people will not recognize even though they are Canonical Marvel Heroes. Don't feel alienated these heroes are Extremely Obscure and amazing pulls
