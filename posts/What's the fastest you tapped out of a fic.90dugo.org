Because Hermione has to be the most perfectest person in the fic and Harry has to be overpowered thanks to her help so yes, since I can't think of an original way to show how awesome Hermione and Harry are, I have to bash every single character I don't like by making them caricatures of the caricatures of themselves!

*** This post, or simply put the name, reminded me of something I did.

I have only ever changed ‘Harry' into ‘Harrison' /once/. Lily would call Harry Harrison whenever he misbehaved because she /knew/ he hated it. It was pretty AU, as a whole, but it just reminded me of something happening IRL and full names coming out.

Someone I knew was called John, not Johnathon, or anything like that, his name on his birth certificate was ‘John'. Anyway, he was, misbehaving in a store and his father just shouted, “For Fuck's sake, Johnathon! You /always/ do this!”

And John, God bless him, just went as still as a statue and whispered, angrily, “I don't like that name!”

It stuck in my head for such a long time. I don't mind changing names, honestly, but there's times where it can work. It's better when he goes incognito and sues Lily's surname. Like, for fuck, Harry. Harry Evans is obvious as hell and too much of a coincidence after Harry Potter vanishes.

**** I don't mind the name changing itself, but most of the time when the story is not time travel or isn't required a fake identity, the name Harrison and Hadrian and something along that line is used to make Harry sounds more...noble?

The problem is that it didn't have that effect. Harrison is not a noble name. Hadrian is not even a British name (and so is Harrison, really), and the way it was written made it sound so pretentious. If it's something like Ron being called Ronald whenever Molly is mad then it's not a problem.

I guess it's a case of non-British author who didn't do his research about names, and the trend just caught on.

*** Probably for the same reason that changing Harry to Henry, Harold, or Harrison drives me nuts: because that's not his name. Harry is Harry, as evidenced by "Harry" being used for Dumbledore's Last Will and Testament (for comparison, he uses Ron's full name when willing Ron the Deluminator), "Harry" being used as what we would have to assume is the legal version of his name in the trial/disciplinary hearing before his 5th year, and the family tree on Pottermore, which can be compared to his namesake Henry Potter who is listed as such.

In the same manner, Tom Riddle Jr, is named after his father, Tom Riddle Sr, who is named after /his/ father Thomas Riddle. But LV is a Jr, not a Third which means there's a legal and literal difference between his and his father's names compared to his grandfather's name.

If you can't bother to double-check your summary and at least your first couple of paragraphs, why are you writing in the first place?

Also when people use words they clearly don't actually know the meaning of. There's been a few fics where the storytelling was pretty good, and I really /wanted/ to like it, but then Snape or Dumbledore start taking and it's, like, WTF? Did the author just randomly pick words out of a thesaurus? Sometimes I couldn't even figure out what they were trying to say, because what they /did/ say made no sense at all.

*** The pace slows down as the fic goes on. The fast initial pacing is primarily to avoid canon rehash since the premise doesn't really change the plot considerably until OotP, at which point the pace slows down considerably, although it already did so in GoF.

It's definitely worth it if the pace is the only thing putting you off. Also the sequels are /much/ slower. I think it's a cumulative 180k words in 2 parts so far that only covers about 13 months from the end of the deathly hallows.

For example, I saw some time ago linkffn(Harry Potter and the Daft Morons), and some person was praising it. First thing I saw in the summary was a massive harem pairing, then bashing, then an implied smart!Harry. Noped right out. But then I glanced at the author, saw that it was Sinyk, who wrote linkffn(Angry Harry and the Seven), which is super bad and edgy, so I gave it a go out of sheer curiosity of whether he had changed. He had not, so I dropped it about half a chapter in.

**** I don't mind them as antagonists, even if they rarely pose a threat (they didn't in canon after all). But since you can only use 4 character tags on FFN (Harry, Love interest, so basically there are just two left), wasting them on the "speedbump" seems rather pointless. They don't make good antagonists because they lack the bite and they are not badass enough to be a good antihero IMO (like for example a defected Bellatrix Lestrange, who kills Death Eaters and has a drinking problem).

Also, you could very easily kill them off in a potion accident or a failed bdsm act in chapter one without going AU.

And while my suspension of disbelief can handle Magic, it doesn't work on that pairing, especially since it is usually "we fight all the time, so clearly we love each other".

****** Interesting information. I did not know they changed names. Thank you for informing me. But what I meaned as super-aristocratic was a type of naming useb by Noble House heirs in England.

******* They don't change names as such, his name is Henry Charles Albert David and his surname is what changes depending on his title. Harry is just his casual name.

******** I think the disconnect is Americans don't see "Harry" as a shortened version of "Henry". So we look for alternatives.

***** Harry is also a nickname for Henry, and is much preferred in the UK over modern and Americanized names like Harrison. Henry is a royal name and Harry is common as a name throughout British society. Hadrian you could maybe get away with as a Roman name but it sounds very odd in the context of British aristocratic society.

***** Harrison is an American name. It just doesn't happen here. It's a real cultural difference. We also never name children 'Randy' or 'Duke'.

***** Harrison is a *sur*name. It means 'son of Harry'. Harry, in turn, originated as a nickname for Henry (specifically as an English adaptation of the French /Henri/)

Harry may be a nickname for Harrison /now/ but their origins go Henry>Harry>Harrison.

Guess which of those has had multiple kings (8 English, 5 French, 7 HRE, 1 Portugese and 3 Navarrese) and innumerable dukes, earls, barons and other nobility dating back a millennia or so.

N.B - Harold has an entirely different genesis despite also having Harry as a nickname.

N.B 2 - Jameson, again, means son of James. Ergo, James came first and is a name which dates back much further. Again, of the two, James is the name which has been used by kings. Jameson has more twiddly bits but that doesn't make it more aristocratic.
