I'm always looking for good Snamione fics. The longer the better. I've read most of the well-known epics, but the more the merrier, so throw some at me! :) - Good quality smut most welcome, but while power play is alright, I don't like any of that D/s stuff, thanks - Good writing. I am currently reading a really good story, but the punctuation is so bad that I'm very tempted to poke my eyes out. With a fish fork. - Angsty fics are fine, as long as there's a happy ending. It's a must! - Please no young pregnant Hermione. I hate the very idea. - I'm a complete sucker for Lily bashing as well.

Thanks a lot. :)


** I'd look at [[https://sshgreview.wordpress.com/][SS HG Review]]. Her rankings are pretty good and the reviews are always useful if you want to find a particular type of SSHG fics.

** Chasing the Sun by Loten is great - I found the sex scenes to be well written although perhaps a bit overdone

The Phoenix series by Grangerous is great - it's a trilogy. Lots of unrequited lust and they don't get together until quite late, drawing out the sexual tension. A lot of same sex couples which I find a bit gratuitous - it's her fic, not mine however

Beyond 84 Charing Cross Road is great

Enjoy! I have wasted many hours recently reading these

** Linkffn(Where Your Treasure Is) is quite possibly my hands down favorite SSHG fic. The emotional depth is amazing.
