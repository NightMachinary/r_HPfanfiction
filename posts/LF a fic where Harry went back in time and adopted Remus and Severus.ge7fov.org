:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Its a time travel fic where he adopts Severus then Remus. I remember this because Severus was jealous about it. I know its in FFNet but I cant remember the title. I remember some scenes where Remus transforms and Harry would join by transforming into his wolf animangus form. Both Severus and Remus are 8 or 9 years old.

I remember that the reason why Harry adopted Severus is that his mother, Eileen, begged him to. Because his father is abusive to Severus. I think at that point, Harry already adopted Remus. Then I remembered that Severus changed his name to Severus Damien (last name) I can't remember the name Harry used. Either its Potter or Black or Peverell. Then Remus also has to change his name so Remus and Severus became brothers.

I also remember when Severus found out that Remus is a werewolf, he said that he will be looking for a cure. This also prompted for Harry to create a potions lab for Severus for his 9th(?) or 10th(?) birthday.

I tried to seach this via google and FFnet, as I only read in FFnet for convinence but I really cannot find it.


** Oooh I remember this story but sorry I don't remember the title. I hope someone comments with it, would love to read it again.

*** Yass! I thought I'm the only one to who read this! I wanna read it again too! I have used all of my knowledge of google-fu finding but I really cannot find this. I know that I added it to my FFNET faves and follows (because I remember its WIP) but I checked each and every one of the HP fics I have there and I turn up with nothing.

I'm beginning to think that the author must have deleted it already. I'm hoping that its on a different website or someone downloaded it and is willing to share.
