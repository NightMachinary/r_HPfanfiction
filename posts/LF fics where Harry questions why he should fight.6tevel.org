I read a fic recently where harry questions why he should fight voldy, Lily and James was part of a war, and got killed, in real life, kids dont grow up to be soldiers to fight the one that killed your family specifically.

So im looking for fics where harry goes "but im a kid? Why should i fight? Thats what we have hit wizards and aurors for" and the chaos of that.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5265558/1/][What If? ... An Alternative to Order Of The Phoenix]], linkffn(5265558): Ignore the stupid title, this story is actually pretty fun. After the Dementor incident, Harry, the Grangers, and Sirius fled Britain. Dumbledore had no choice but to step up his game, he and Amelia Bones eventually managed to pull out the win. Harry found the solution to his scar somewhere else.

  What if Harry had reacted more strongly to the Ministry's threat to expel him and snap his wand? What if he had fled the country rather than submit to the trial?

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

** There's a decent Dresden Files x-over that asks exactly this question.

It's not necessarily Harry himself asking it, but rather Dresden in his role as a tutor/father figure.

It's technically slash but it doesn't really come up (ever). It fact there's barely any relationship stuff, the main focus is on Harry Potter growing up with Marcone and Dresden.

linkao3(Of Wands and Staves by Nahiel)

I originally found this because I was looking for Potter/Molly fics, of which way too few exist (by which i mean, this is literally the only one I could find) and I'd like to take this chance implore any and all writers in both fandoms to please write some!

  Gentleman Johnny Marcone is used to doing favors for friends and family. When a distant relation in England asks him to handle the problem of a small six-year-old boy, John chooses to adopt him rather than kill him. As it happens, the child in question is an untrained wizard and needs a tutor. Enter Harry Dresden, stage left.

I think this one fits the bill of what you're looking for pretty nicely. In fact, it may even be the one you read.

  Oneshot, for now. Harry explains to the Headmasster why he won't fight Voldemort. Set in Book 5.
