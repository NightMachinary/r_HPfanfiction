While writing my outlining my latest project I realised that I hit a point in my story where a sex scene was called for. Up until now in my writing I have always implied sex, used the power of suggestion - have the camera pan away from the kiss as it were however this town around that seems to lack courage so I have taken the bit between my teeth and decided to accept the challenge. I am not a shrinking violet, but I am finding it confronting (not embarrassing) to write - I can't help but feel the result will probably say more about me than my characters.

I was reading an article by Beth Miller who suggests that "Each genre has certain conventions when it comes to sex, and you need to know your genre well" and I wondered what the accepted "rules" were in Fan Fic? Are there in fact any? Do they elevate or stymie?

Are there specific conventions to Harry Potter universe fan fic?


** Make sure to go heavily into detail and make it as completely unrealistic as you can. Make sure to use descriptive words that will make your reader go "Um... that just doesn't make any sense" or "Well... that's... kind of gross and not true." The more uncomfortable the reader, the better the writing experience. For ideas, watch the scenes from 10 Things I hate about you where that counselor lady was speaking aloud her adult-erotica fanfiction she was writing. Remember, when describing body parts, never use the actual names of the party parts in question. Use vague and semi-connected nouns that you would never use to describe the particular body part but, in this singular case, totally make sense..... kind of.

*** Also make sure that every character is constantly "thrumming" with excitement. Only refer to genitals as "manhood" or "her sex".

At each step in the escalation of sexual events, one character must ask if the other really DOES want this, because they don't want to put pressure on them or move too fast, then the other (if female) character has to assure the first that, "I really DO want you to put your hand on my breast over my clothing, I just didn't want to be too forward in case you thought I was a dirty whore and lost interest in me." Allow both characters to argue with each other for roughly the length of this whole comment about how they really want the same thing but are afraid of putting-off one another, in an epic battle of consent-giving which will surely leave readers' hearts thrumming with excitement.

** If there is a standard to sex in fanfiction, it resembles the application of law in the Wild West. Fanfiction is unedited anonymous publication, which gives the writer permission to indulge their imagination.

There are maybe a handful of sex scene types, and it depends on your writing style and the purpose of the scene as to which works best for you.

[Keep in mind this is a personal, arbitrary list of my own assessment]

- porn-smut - scene is primarily concerned with the exaltation of the viewpoint character as a divine avatar of sexuality. Logistics is somewhat considered, but mostly to lay claim to 'inventiveness' on the part of the writer, since they may cobble together a number of such scenes between the hero and any number of conquests (often identified by a helpful guide to which model/actor is representing which name in the tangle)

- romantic - scene skips discussing the logistics of intercourse to describe the emotional state of the viewpoint character (though that viewpoint may shift to other participants, sometimes within the same paragraph). While there will be mention of erotic actions taken to some body parts, for the most part the fun is in the process of decision and how it impacts the participants emotionally

- erotica - centering the focus on the sensations of the act, the scene is meant to draw the reader into the experience to heighten the sense of titillation. Believable logistics are a key consideration, as immersion is the highest priority.

- 'real'sex - often drawn upon real life experience, the scene is a smoothed-over version of events that illustrate the fun, or at least memorable parts of the experience, or to point out the logistical pitfalls of certain scenarios. It can be embarrassing, hilarious and/or harrowing, but when done well will leave an emotional impact on the reader.

Edit- thought of another

- plot complication - the scene is integral to the plot by illustrating a change in behavior or the nature of a relationship that may have been presented differently in 'public' scenes. The description usually isn't long, as the point of the scene isn't how they react to specific moves so much as what they did and how it impacts them and others. If you put in too much detail, the reader gets confused about why these details might be important later.

There are probably others, but that covers the field in my mind.

** Be sure to include extensive spellwork in the middle of the act.

Basically you should start googling latin translations now, for words such as:

- Enlarge
- Stiffen
- Spank
- Moist
- Blind
- Entangle
- Vibrate

Also be sure to look up some Norse runes to be placed on a paddle. Bonus points if the protagonist has scored with a veela for simply not succumbing to her charms. (Veela apparently love that.)

Not really restricted to HP but magic is involved so your characters should at some point find themselves defying gravity, either floating above the bed or flying a broom/horse/motorbike.

edit: Oh and I just remembered one of the worst fictions i ever read. Be sure to have the protagonist cast a derivative of Morsmordre in the sky afterwards to celebrate his conquest.

** Most writers make it extremely unrealistic. They use stupid words for the human anatomy and they use redundant cliches. If you want to do a sex scene, have some source material. I say that because people either have or have not had sex. If you have, pull from that experience. If not, find a quality erotica (porn and 50 Shades are not good source material) and read how they convey the scene. Make it appropriate. A virgin most likely will not be able to do a ton of stuff and absolutely will not be a sex god. Sex scenes can be done well and they can be appropriately handled in HP fanfic, but gods help me if I have to read another sentence about his mast being eased into her warm cave....

But are all sex scenes smut in your opinion? I tend to think not. I know people looking for quick fap material are unlikely to wade through the rest of the plot for the one scene in my story just as we break into act 3. The sex is intended to be sexy but it says more about the emotional context of the characters than I tend to think of "smut" as doing which to mind exists purely for titilation.

I guess that goes to the question. Is "smut" the predominant convention in the presentation of sex in FF?

**** What I have found, and it might be different in other's experience, that "sex" and "smut" are terms that can be used interchangeably. In my opinion, sex and smut are different, like you said, but a good chunk of authors don't recognize that difference.

It is good to hear that there are authors out there that have knowledge. My experience with sex scenes is they are written by those with no experience or knowledge of how this really goes. In general, I think these scenes are one of the hardest to do well. Some can, but not many unfortunately.

** I'd say ignore the idea that you need to understand fanfic conventions when it comes to writing sex - or writing anything, for that matter. None of that is going to help you when you're facing the keyboard and trying to imagine how to describe an erotic experience from a given character's POV. Write what pleases or titillates you and forget about fannish expectations. This is /your/ fic, and IMO anything you write should be first and foremost for your own entertainment.

When I got into fandom 10 years ago, I was startled and pleased by the exuberance of the smut-writing community that existed around my ship. They were so sex-positive and having so much fun. Granted, most of them were over 30 and had a wry, humorous self-awareness that they were being self-indulgent and playing with unlikely fictional characters from a children's series. But the lack of shame and the /joie de vivre/ made it a great place to post my first attempts at writing sex - none of the sarcasm or borderline contempt you see in this sub, none of the tendency to judge authors and assume the worst.

So all I can tell you is how I go about it, with the caveat that I mostly write slash (my main ship is Snape/Harry) and that no single approach will satisfy everybody's id.

First, I agree with Wordhammer's addendum to their comment - my favorite kind of sex scene is integral to character development or plot in some way. Rather than having everything stop while our characters shag, the sexual attraction is actually a connecting link in the ongoing plot. It furthers the story and helps move it along.

By now, I've read hundreds of fics, and I've completely lost interest in tacked-on porn, especially the kind that happens after the story ends and which is only there as a bonus or HEA. At that point, there's no tension in the narrative anymore - so for me, there's no pressure, no necessity, for the sex scene to occur. I suspect I'm in the minority here. But if the sex happens when, for example, they still don't trust each other, or because there's a misunderstanding or a ritual or a drunken moment or a dominance struggle or a surrender or as a revenge fuck - something that pushes the plot forward, even if it's the emotional content and not the action - it's so much more interesting. It has a reason to be there. It presumably has consequences. It can reveal things the reader doesn't expect - something the /characters/ don't expect. It can change the mood of the story. It can be a disaster, at which point the overcoming of that disaster becomes part of the plot. It can be the beginning of a constant erotic tension that hums and occasionally detonates throughout the fic. It can be a red herring - the reader /thinks/ things are okay, but they're not. It can set the tone of every sex scene that follows, or become the source of the struggle between the two characters, rather than an automatic sign of "meant for each other."

One thing to consider is POV. Apologies for grossing out any straight blokes reading this, but I'll tell you upfront that the focus of erotic tension in my fics is on Snape. Whoever partners him tends to be the viewpoint character because that enables me, as author, to see him from the outside. To describe him in sexual terms, to linger on and enhance the things I find erotic and do my best to translate them into Harry's (or Albus's or Minerva's or Aberforth's) terms. The division in my fics is between, say, Harry's physical sensations, his emotional confusion or intensity, and the window he provides onto Snape, who suffers the bulk of my descriptive impulses. He's the object of desire, and Harry's the one who catalogues what makes him desirable. The descriptive lens is rarely turned on Harry himself. But Harry - or whoever your POV character is - has to express him/herself in language and for reasons that are true to them. Their emotional/sexual journey /is/ the story, especially if you're writing a shipfic.

Of course, I tend to write the kind of fic that requires UST to the bitter end - no resolving the sexual tension, regardless of the number of sex scenes in the fic, until it's over, and maybe not even then (I've only written one unambiguously happy ending). There are other ways to do it - to punctuate the narrative with smutty interludes that chart the characters' relationship or allow commentary on what they're living through. Established relationship fics, essentially. I'm not good at those, but some people are excellent, and you can learn from them just by reading their work.

You ship Snape/Hermione, yes? Have you read TeddyRadiator? If so, I don't know whether her style of Snanger appeals to you, but you might check out her LiveJournal. She likes to talk about the process and aggravations of writing and about her favorite pairing, and she's very kind and approachable. You can sign up for a free LJ (ack, I sound like a shill for them, sorry) and "friend" her journal without any obligation to interact. But it might be a nice sort of contact to have, and she might enjoy discussing Snape/Granger with another fan.

*** I take your point about going with what works for me - it is a valid point and as fan generated content it is perhaps /more/ valid here than in other forms.

However, I'm a perennial student. I love learning and understanding what makes things tick. I can love a piece of writing for how it makes me feel but when I can take it apart and understand how and why it evokes that response not only do I love the work my mind is blown by the author's understanding of the human condition.

I'm all for subverting the rules, or bending the genre or turning establishment on its head - I just think its better to understand the rule book before you throw it out the window. Sometimes rules are simply a handy framework for building something lasting. IMO. I have however concluded that beyond tagging correctly there seems to be little in the way of convention in FF. As I have said a few times already "Fan Generated Content" is really The Wild West - a prospect I find both exhilarating and terrifying in equal measure.

No caveats needed, the lessons hold true regardless of the participants genders. (Or species... I suppose.Lol) I'm a straight woman who loves reading m/m slash as long its well written with a plot (Story is king).

I also found a lot of value in [[/u/Wordhammer][u/Wordhammer]] 's post re the "types" of sex scene, and the one I'm struggling with is definitely integral to character (it does impact plot also, but not so critically as it does character). When I initially outlined I found the third act just wouldn't lie straight. Something wasn't working - something wasn't /truthful/ in my characters experience and it took me a while to realise what. I re-wrote my outline and sent it back to my Betas and the consensus was the scene would make all the difference, it is too fraught not to leave a lasting impact on the characters. Hence my desire to do it justice.

I find as a reader I have a "lemon tolerance threshold", a ratio of sex to story that if out of balance I start skipping the sex scenes. If once the characters are in a sexual relationship they seem to do little else I lose all interest.

POV. Yes. My narrative POV swings back and forth between my lead characters during the story and so trying to choose whose eyes I'm seeing this through is an exquisite agony. I'm quite some way into my first draft of the scene now and I'm not sure I've chosen. Ugh. Hopefully I'll get substantial notes which will help me unravel the Gordian's Knot I seem to be tying myself into. Your thoughts on it are brilliant - I hadn't thought about it in those terms. That the person whose POV it is actually ends up saying more about the other party. Hmm. I'm not sure if that complicates or simplifies things. I guess I need to commit to who I think is more effected by the encounter.

I can't say I've come across the term Shipfic before but I gather from the context it means a fic specifically in service to a particular ship. "Ship: a romance" so to speak. I don't really do those. I prefer the romance to be a subplot rather than the whole show. The current WIP is a murder mystery first and foremost.

I write all sorts of endings to all sorts of stories. I haven't fallen in love with one to the exclusion of all others. I think it depends how I feel. The worse my head space the happier my characters - a self created counterweight to reality.

Yeah, I ship Snape/Hermione - what gave me away? *Laughs* I'm certain my comment history is full of me defending the pairing. I haven't read TeddyRadiator (never been near LJ to be honest) but I'll give it a crack.

Having my Snanger friends is a bonus. Thanks-for taking the time to give me such a well thought out and useful response. I really appreciate it.

Cheers.

**** Oh, I agree about analyzing stories or scenes, although I generally do that when leaving feedback, less so when considering what lessons to incorporate into my own writing. I don't use fandom as a writer's workshop, generally speaking. The opposite, in fact: I come here to loosen up and place fewer strictures on my style and content than in my original fic.

Ah, you outline! Some of the most brilliant writers I know use outlines. I can't; it feels like homework to me and kills the storytelling impulse. I do take copious notes throughout the writing process, inventing as I go along - and sometimes having to cut thousands of words because I take a wrong turn. I've never brought in betas at that stage of the process. I imagine it's interesting testing out the direction and roughing out your scenes under scrutiny.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Hah! Yes, exactly. Unless it's a PWP, sex scenes are a condiment to the main meal. Besides, there's a limit to the number of ways you can describe people having sex, and it's bound to become repetitive.

Yeah, 'shipfic' describes the genre in which the pairing itself is a priority. Sometimes the only point, sometimes not, but it's never just background. It's often the B plot woven throughout whatever A plot you're constructing, or the terms can be reversed. Most commonly, it's the whole show. So, not necessarily romantic, but it does emphasize the relationship over other plot elements. If that doesn't appeal to you, then TeddyRadiator may not be your cuppa. You can check her out here if you'd like, along with a lot of other Snape/Hermione writers (there are other pairings represented as well, but Snanger seems to be the central pairing): [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/index.php][The Petulant Poetess]].

And I knew you shipped Snape/Hermione because I was in the post entitled /Why do you ship Snape/Hermione or Snape/Harry?/ trying to explain my reasons at the same time you were trying to explain yours.

Anyway, good luck with your story, and may you enjoy the novel experience of writing sex scenes. After the first blush, so to speak, it's very much like any other kind of writing and employs the same techniques: word choice, pacing, motivation, character development, placement within a pattern or structure.

Also, thanks for letting me natter at you. It was a bit tl;dr, but I reckoned you'd just skip it if you weren't in the mood. :)

** I've only read one fic that has good steamy scenes: [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600025401][Folie a Deux]]. 99.9% of the other NC-17 stories in the fandom are pretty awful by comparison. It's also the only first person story I like /and/ the only one featuring infidelity that doesn't make me sick.

What makes Salon_Kitty's story so good?

It focuses on emotions, not just the physical act. The author goes to great length to describe how /each/ development in the protagonist's new extramarital physical relationship makes her feel. Hermione is proud of some of her feelings, ashamed of others, but the focus is on the character's emotional state, not just her body's reaction to stimuli.

I think that no matter what your protagonist is doing or who they're doing it with, it's important to not separate intimacy from the rest of your story. Find a way to set plot hooks in the sex scene that makes sense to your readers or it will stick out like a sore thumb as PWP.

tl'dr: Subverted tropes are memorable, doubly so in smut.

**** No problem. There's a lot of build-up as the author establishes the AU, so if you'd rather skip that part and get right into it, the affair starts in [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600025401&chapter=5][Chapter Five]].

I think the #1 thing that makes it such a strong piece of writing is the pacing. All too often, authors simply write smut /as it happens/. In this work, the author slows the story's development down at crucial times by using

1. vivid imagery unrelated to the scene at hand to describe Hermione's feelings,

2. short, declarative sentences highlighting Hermione's actions/physical responses and

3. marries each verbal queue to an underlying emotional trigger, giving the reader insight into the protagonist's thought processes and unspoken desires.

If you know of any other examples of fics that do this, I'd love to read them. This is a great topic, by the way. Thank you for making it.

** Like everyone already said here, fanfiction sex scenes are usually garbage. But that doesn't mean that what you want to write will be bad as well. You just have to look at it from a few points: does it help in progressing the story? Does it fit within the themes? Sex scenes are very, very intense if done well, and it stirs up many emotions for the reader. I've read books where sex was used so well that the entire book became so much more memorable to me, I felt more attatched to the characters, more like I've gone on a journey with them.

In the end, you can always delete something afterwards. Nothing's set in stone. Just write it, see where it takes you :)

** Im going to assume your writing het so heres the absolute musts for sex in hp fanfiction: You MUST never refer to any part of human anatomy with any normal term (for an acceptable list of terms see bottom of post) The male character MUST magically enlarge the boobs or ass of the female partner The male character MUST magically duplicate his penis The male character MUST magically enlarge his penis The male character MUST do most of anything The female character MUST basically just be on the receiving end of every action The male character MUST have an overly large penis, to the point of being unrealistic

Acceptable list of terms for penis: "Manhood" "Member" "Rod"

Acceptable list of terms for a vagina: "Her Sex"

Acceptable terms for boobs: "Orbs"

Acceptable terms for ass: "Backside" "Posterior"

Acceptable terms for asshole: "Backdoor"

/s

Any help with the list of acceptable terms? I haven't read enough smut to properly fill it put yet.

*** Yes. I get it. So much tedious poorly written smut. I. Get. It.

But you know what? I'm a writer who has posed a question in an effort to /learn/.

So rather than simply listing a half dozen examples of tired euphemisms for body parts how about suggesting alternatives you think are better?

I'm sure a lot of readers who agree with you would love to see writers improve. Lots of writers want the same. Only it isn't helpful to simply restate an obvious problem and make no effort toward providing a solution.

Here's your chance - I *want* to avoid tired language, I *want* to give readers a better experience and I'm happy to revisit my available lexicon.

It's easy to find fault but harder to correct it.

**** Yeah, sorry bout that I was sort of ranting there and being a sarcastic ass. But honestly, if you're trying to write a good sex scene it might be just as helpful to know what to avoid. Honestly, I'm not much of a writer so I don't have any deep, insightful help but I do know what I hate and what kills sex scenes in fanfiction. So well my post is basically just sarcastic ranting I think there is value in at the very least trying to avoid the things I was ranting about. On a totally separate note, it is amazing that you want to improve and better this lacking part of fanfiction. It's amazing that you're willing to put up with sarcastic assholes like me just to better your writing. So sorry. I turned a very serious post into a place where I vented my frustration over one of the most annoying things in fanfiction.

*** Have to disagree with that, sorry.

This story which inspired my question is set firmly in the HP universe but is the better part of a decade after the events of Deathly Hallows. It revolves around adults and sexuality is (generally) part of the adult experience. The sex is crucial to emotional truth of the characters. It is not present as titilation nor smut. Even if it were, you cannot (I feel) make a sweeping statement invalidating a massive number off pieces, based presumably upon personal preference .

*All of which is besides the point.* Sex /does/ (frequently) appear in HP fanfiction (even if you wish it didn't) my question is regarding what convention or tropes if you rather, are applicable. Just telling authors not to write it is probably as effective as abstinence only sex education. And about as useful.

**** u/Kazeto:
#+begin_quote
  Sex does (frequently) appear in HP fanfiction
#+end_quote

With most authors writing this stuff, the only sex that appears is the author raping physics, and the actual scene is not sex but a showcase of anatomical nonsense.

So I agree with the “probably”: there are exceptions, but most people who write this kind of stuff think about neither the “how” nor about the “why”, and their stories generally just have self-insert and other-insert characters carrying names of characters from whatever series it's supposed to be. And you seem to have missed that “probably” and taken that as something absolute.

***** Badly written or not I fail to see how including sex scenes means your fan fiction stops being Harry Potter related. I suppose if a "story" is absolutely gonzo sex scenes from start to finish with no attempt to link with plot then choosing to label them as belonging to this that fandom seems pointless.

While I've struck a handful which do this it certainly is not the majority or the "more often than not" implied by "probably".

You may not like self inserts but they are a recognized form. There is plenty of fan fiction without sex where the characters behave in a OOC way. It's why we tag that... if your argument is that those things mean you shouldn't be connecting those fictions with the HP fandom that's really a separate issue because as it stands /we do/

****** I think you might /kind of/ be missing the point here; although it might just be that it was hard to understand what I meant in my previous reply, as this kind of thing sometimes happens with me.

I do agree that the reply you first got from the other commenter wasn't really necessary, since if they disagreed with the cross-post they could have just downvoted it and thus their comment isn't really necessary.

I also do agree with you that including sex scenes does not stop a story from being about this-or-that thing; that /should have/ been a given, and I did not write otherwise.

My point was that many of the authors who do it, and believe me that it indeed is most of them and you simply had the luck to not run into the many badly tagged smut fictions placed on sites that do not actually allow smut but do not have the time to manually go through it to find the stink (sites like fanfiction.net, for one example), write stories the quality level of which is deep beneath the surface and which are related to the work they are supposed to be derived from only due to name choices and not with anything else; which does, effectively, make them not actually fan fiction but original stories with plagiarised names, really, and this is a point you actually can sometimes find people discussing when you get a story where every character is acting out-of-character. In the greater scheme of things it doesn't really matter because people will label whatever they want however they want, but that's how it is and that's what I meant in my previous reply; not like original stories are in any way worse than fan fiction, though, so it matters even less.

That being said, that most of the fan fiction with smut you'd stumbled across was actually of some quality is something I can only comment with “good for you”. And I really mean it, for that way you'd avoided much of the mental scarring that is possible to get by finding the worst of the worst of this type of work. It might be a matter of the entry point, as sometimes what kind of stories you get into and what you find can heavily depends on how exactly and from where you got into stories in general in the first place.

But I'm starting to ramble which in my case can lead to walls of text only tangentially related to whatever I started talking about, so I'll end it here (short version: I wasn't trying to put you down or anything, what I was speaking about in the previous comment is basically a heavily-discussed-by-some technicality). I'll just add this, for I've yet to comment on this in general: If you want canon compatibility then please stick to the books as far as the universe of the story is concerned, as movies do add quite some things that don't make much sense (in addition to what the books have) and it's easy to slip on the whole mess and write something decidedly inelegant. Outside of that, just make sure that the sex is anatomically possible (which should not be an issue for you considering what you disclosed) and that the situation leading to it is also not nonsense (which, again, should not be an issue for you). There aren't really any conventions that have to be followed or anything, if you just remember that in certain regards the wizards are stuck about 200 years in the past, so knowledge of courtship rituals and stuff like that from 17th, 18th, and maybe early 19th centuries, might come in handy.

******* That all makes sense and your points are well taken.

I think I miss a lot of the worst offenders because if the general writing is bad or there is nothing in the way of plot except servicing a ship I stop reading and start scrolling to the next thing. I'm not interested in wasting time reading something which will only end up irritating me.

I also only tend to accept the books as canon. My tastes run to things which skirt canon rather than that which throws it out the window. (Although works which are EWE are not something I mind).

The OOC thing is so difficult - I mean sometimes it's thoroughly blatant and intentional, but it's often thrown around simply as a way of saying "my interpretation of the character is different to yours. I disagree with your choices".

I accept I will end up tagging my current piece as "probably OOC" because the intervening years between the end of canon and the start of my story will have shaped the characters differently in my mind than in the minds of others.
