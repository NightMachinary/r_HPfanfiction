i was reading "Restless Leg Syndrome" which has Harry/Tonks and the way, she teases him under the table, while Harry talks to his former Quidditch Teammates and imagining wild things he could do to them....it was hot to read, especially because their facial expressions and ambiguous questions or answer were feeding his and the Readers imagination.

I would like to know similar fics as that, no matter if they are affair fics or not. If possible, it should keep Harrys Persona, so he is reluctant at first, but the more turned on he gets the more eager he might be.


** Harry Potter and the metamorph. Is about Harry and Tonks if your interested.

  Full title: The One Where The Entire Gryffindor Common Room Lusts After Harry Wearing Quidditch Pants and Hermione is Persuasive. That's rather self-explanatory, I think. Really, it's just best to move on. Equally pointless second chapter now added.
