** I can't remember the name of it, but there was one where Harry spontaneously turned into a girl and through therapy realized she was trans and he'd repressed it because of the Dursleys. She ended up taking the name Melanie, I think, and dates Susan Bones. Also Voldy isn't quite so evil and Snape's a bit nicer. Unfortunately, that's all I can remember about it it. It was okay, and an interesting idea, but not my cup of tea.

*** Yeah, "To Reach Without" was just okay in my book. I liked the Sane!Voldemort and the past!Lily, and there was a new and fresh take on Wizengamot politics by defining 'dark' as Magicentric and 'light' as humancentric.

However, there were so many changes from canon that it basically wasn't a Harry Potter story anymore, more like a fanfic set in fanfic-world. It was also incredibly long winded in some parts, with huge passages of detailed description that the author didn't give a compelling reason to care about.

Also for some reason Susan Bones has amazing technicolor red hair that ranges from magenta to orange? Idk that was just kind of out of nowhere.

** !linkffn(Magical Metamorphosis)

This one's not bad, though it is a tad cliched in how it approaches the trans issue.

!linkffn(A Fair Life)

Not /technically/ trans, but close enough. Dumbledore used a ritual to make Harry a boy (to help Harry avoid the sexism of the Wizarding World) and hid knowledge of Harry's birth sex under fidelius. When the Goblet of fire restores Harry's birth sex, she's got a lot to adapt to. It's been a really good read so far

*** I'm hopping in real quick as a transfem person to comment on this, because I think the fic - and by extension, the person who recc'd it - is getting a bit of an unfair rap.

This fic starts out somewhat sketch, not going to lie, but a dominant part of the fic is about Harry coming to realize she /likes/ being a girl and feels considerably more comfortable as it. It absolutely exudes trans feelings, and has an ending that made me /considerably/ more pleased with the fic than I should've been.

Seriously, it's honestly pretty good and even if it's not precisely a fic that is built off of Harry knowing they're trans and transitioning, it is one that nails the aspect of finally settling into the gender you identify as /super/ well and is just generally a really happy fic all things considered.

So, uh, yeah. Give it a shot if you feel the urge to, I'll honestly recommend it.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

  “I think we've got a lot to figure out. But together we'll get it sorted.”Harry kissed her forehead.“Together. Sure.”It didn't sound any less impossible when Harry said it. But then, impossible was their speciality, wasn't it? Or, the one where Harry is a trans woman, and she and Ginny are still in love.

************** Where did I do that?

Must I share someone's inability to empathise with characters outside of their sexual/racial/gender category?

Would it be wrong for someone to ask me why I only read fics starring straight white men? (I don't, but for argument's sake imagine). And would it not suggest something...strange if not outright bad, about me if that were the case?

Just strikes me as odd that "I read straight white men because I am one" would be considered a prejudice and lack of empathy, but "I want to read trans people because I am one" is an unquestionable and morally just opinion.

*************** None of this was about what you want to read, it was you criticizing what other people want to read.

And you have no idea how fucking sick I am of straight, cis dudes feigning oppression when told to stop making this sub a hostile place for people who are into slash, or in this case fics including trans people.

Cut. It. Out.

**************** Why is it illegitimate for me to ask why someone is incapable of empathising with people who don't have the same gender/sex/race etc?

Would you apply that standard if it wasn't your pet political interest group being asked the question?
