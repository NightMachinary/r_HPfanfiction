‘Harry' is already a royal name, ‘Pansy' sounds like someone who whines a lot. I am not telling you should do this to any character (please don't, it's super cringe), but if you want to have more noble-sounding names, then please use logic and start with Pansy Parkinson.


** If someone in the UK was called Pansy, I'd assume she was at least upper middle class.

The alliteration on her name doesn't help to make it sound fancy though, but JKR is super fond of that (Dudley Dursley, Piers Polkiss, Filius Flitwick, Severus Snape, Pansy Parkinson, Peter Pettigrew, Minerva McGonagall, Bellatrix Black, Gregory Goyle, Parvati and Padma Patil, William Weasely AND SO ON)
