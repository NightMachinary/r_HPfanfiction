I want a crack fic where a dyslexic character in Hogwarts tries to do magic but being dyslexic struggles, they always cast a spell but it's never the one they meant to so the result are completely different. So the character was going to cast Wingardium Leviosa and instead does something like Leviumso Ardiowing. Just butchers it.

We say that if you get the spell wrong enough it will cause an explosion. So this person could develop a new branch of magic just by screwing up enough spells.

***** The real beauty is that later when Harry and Hermione are together she teaches him a spell that just is one of those book reader programs that read them out loud for you and it's explicitly stated that it's only a fourth year spell.

So I think it was kind of dumb to add that in but not have this grand manipulator not make an attempt to see how Harry thrives in the magical world being blind.

I can never really make it much further than about halfway before it just becomes too wordy of a story. At some point I might as well pick up MoR again or Daft Morons with how they hammer the rules and stuff over peoples heads.

  It would have been romantic to say their courtship began with their divorce but Hermione had to admit the ending of their marriage had been more about tidying paperwork than pathos. She stopped being Madam Flint with a handshake and a nice Italian dinner. But Marcus was not a man to give up on what, or who, he wanted. * Alternate Ending to 'a Disarranged Marriage' *

** All The Young Dudes on AO3 is a Marauders-era fic that heavily features dyslexic!Lupin. It's really long and Remus/Sirius is the main pairing so if that's not your cup of tea, you likely won't enjoy it, but I thought it did a great job of finding him workarounds outside of traditional education methods.

** Stand Tall by Red_headed_juilet on Harrypotterfanfiction.com. It's a next gen fic where the main character is Albus Potter's Friend. She is a muggleborn with a severe physical disability and magic can only do so much. Everyday is a struggle for her physically. She gets selected to be the Triwizard champion for Hogwarts.

It's really well written and really explores what it's like to suffer from a physical disability and not in vague terms, the author goes into detail while maintaing the character's indivuality. She is not her disability, she's a person and she thrives as a witch. I cannot recommend it enough.

Edit: changed wording about disability that seemed demeaning to me.
