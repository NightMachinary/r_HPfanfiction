Hey there, I am looking for a more realistic type of fic. I have grown tired of reading over-hyped fics, where harry is a god level wizard, Dumbledore is a meddling fool and Voldy-Moldy is an idiot. I mean, Dumbledore has always been a manipulator but it is necessary as he hold so much attention and power over the Wizarding world. Also Voldemort is not a dark wizard for nothing. So, I hope you can share a fic meeting the above criterions. Would be great if it is completed.

Thanks.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** Linkffn(11191235) is a really good fic that fits the details. It features an incredibly scary Voldemort, and a Dumbledore who makes mistakes, but tries his best and is reasonable. Fair warning: it uses a lot of tropes but in a subversive way, and the author doesn't hit full stride until around halloween but it's still very good and I highly recommend it.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** It's not really one to read just for fun, but Methods of Rationality does fit your criteria; Harry is precocious but makes plenty of mistakes, Dumbledore acts barmy but is actually extremely competent, and Voldemort is very dangerous indeed.

The thing is, it's first and foremost a showcase of, as the name says, methods of rationality; how to examine the way you think and make better decisions. Distinguishing between people's enduring personalities vs the specific circumstances they're in, testing theories properly and rigorously, solving problems within tight constraints, properly weighing costs and even lives in the balance. It does tell a dramatic and humorous story, but that's just the delivery mechanism for the lesson. So, opinions on it are quite divided.

I generally recommend the alternate/expanded introduction, linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR), as a starting point.

  Fan edit of the first few chapters of LessWrong's Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality to smooth out tone/characterization, and make it more accessible to those not familiar with Harry Potter canon.
