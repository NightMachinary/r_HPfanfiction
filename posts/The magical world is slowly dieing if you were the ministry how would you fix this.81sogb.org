Apart from the Weaslys I don't think we see a single wizarding family with more that two children. Meaning they are not reproduceing fast enough to sustain there population.

So say the ministry of magic does the math and works it out and they put you in charge of fixing this problem how would you do it ?

I would have the wizarding government offer all muggle women that go to a sprem banks the chance to have a magical child, if they reject the offer just wipe there minds of the knowledge of magic. And let them continue on to pick a muggle sperm donor.

It's a bit underhanded but I would also have the wizarding world go to all couples that are haveing problems haveing children and offer them magical help but as part of the deal for the magical healing they would have to agree to have a magical child as payment for being healed.(although that seems a bit to much like blackmail to me so I would probably just keep it to offering the chance to have a magical child to women that go to sperm banks).

Wizards like Malfoy would probably not participate but I could see Sirus black doing it to stick it to his family who would be horrified.

*** If you count there partners then between 16 people they only had 10 children. Seven of which can be attributed to Molly and Auther alone.

And I think the only reason the weaslys even had that many children was because They wanted a Daughter.

I would say that out side of the wars the main reason for the low numbers of magicals is there high standard of living.

** We really only see one generation of children, most of whom were born at the tail end of a war, where people were likely trying to be more careful.

For the main generation- we don't know who has siblings just out of Hogwarts, or too young to go- how many 1st-4th years did Harry pay attention to in 5-6th year? How many 6-7th years when he was a first year?

This assumption that they aren't reproducing fast enough is based on flawed information and an imperfect narrator. But for tackling this hypothetical problem, why not just start with incentives for family growth? Special scholarship set aside for school costs (books, uniforms), monetary bonus, things like that.

*** Depends when they do it

If they do it just after world war two then maybe it would work.but I have my doubts.

If they do it after Voldemort first down fall I don't think it would be enough voldemort had been wiping out whole family's not to mention the Muggleborns.

After harry' seventh year its way to late Voldemort had Control of the ministry for a whole year the Casualties among the muggleborns from this would have been just two much they would have lost whole generation of muggleborns. they might have even been able to find the muggleborn children that had not even started Hogwarts year.

**** How would they have found those children? The Ministry wasn't the one with the school records, only Hogwarts had them, which includes the list of what students are slated to come to Hogwarts. The Book & Quill are kept secure, and Snape and McGonagall were the ones still running the school during the height of the second war.

****** It's implied through minor details that the trace isn't applied until after they reach Hogwarts. Hermione specifically said that she tried out some small spells prior to getting to Hogwarts in the first book, but did not get a letter home regarding underage magic. Harry never got letters from the Ministry regarding his accidental magic (hair growth, apparition...) either.

An extra year without being at Hogwarts shouldn't affect too much. I mean, if your birthday is 09/02, you're stuck waiting almost an entire extra year under normal circumstances anyway.

What do you mean "Fleur and Gaby"? Unless a third sibling is mentioned, they don't break OP's statement that we don't see a wizarding family with "more than two children".

** Well the British Wizarding world dying slowly is the problem so I would do exactly as in canon under Bagnold/Fudge: Restrictive Laws, Disespect to Other Races, Blood Discrimination, Hogwarts House System Biases, Letting Murderers Walk Free etc.

That way we can fix the problem and get the British Wizarding World to die /quickly/.
