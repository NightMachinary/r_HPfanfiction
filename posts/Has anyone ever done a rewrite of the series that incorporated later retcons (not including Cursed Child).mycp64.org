What I mean by retcons is things that hadn't been established until later.


** Like you said, there are quite a few things that are missed by authors that came from the later books' narrative and not Pottermore, Cursed Shite, or Rowling Retcons -- when Harry first came to Hogwarts, Lucius admitted that he kept an eye on Harry from a distance, hoping that he'd be another powerful figurehead for anyone pureblood to rally behind.

He lost interest quickly because the boy was, IIRC, "unremarkable" and "average".

If in a story Harry shows a lot of talent or magical strength, something is bound to come of this, even if Lucius fails to get in contact with Harry due to a third-party (i.e. Dumbledore) interfering.

It'd be interesting to see these elements written in "from the ground up", so-to-speak.

*** Seriously, that'd be great. Mentions of Professor Kettleburn in Harry's first two years. Things that had supposedly always been there but Harry was too unobservant to notice.

*** Like in /Deathly Hallows/, it is revealed that the Ministry tracks underage wizards using the Trace.
