*Heavily inspired by Flashpoint (2011) by DC Comics.*

The story begins at the Ministry, on May 2nd 2030 - exactly 32 years since Voldemort's fall. Like every anniversary, all those who played pivotal roles in the second war must attend the Ministry Victory celebration. Unbeknownst to the Ministry, someone has infiltrated the deep underground levels of the Ministry, with only one goal: rewriting the timeline.

Now, you're probably thinking: it /must/ be one of Voldemort's followers, right? You'd be wrong. Although, the man is connected to Voldemort, albeit indirectly. In late 1997, when he was only a child, his mother and father - both muggle-borns - were killed by Death Eaters, while his older brother and sister were tortured to insanity. Eight-year-old Jonathan Diggory was forever changed that day.

To say that John was gifted would be an insult to his magical prowess. Wandless magic thought to be impossible for a grown witch/wizard, let alone a child, was literally child's play for him. After the death of his parents, John was sent to live in New York, until the war ended in Britain. He returned to England and eventually attended Hogwarts, where he was sorted into Hufflepuff. Even with Voldemort's death, prejudice was still rife in the Wizarding World, and so purebloods saw John as an easy target. John, on the other hand, saw them as easy target practice.

He had no need for a wand, and by the time he was in fourth year, was arguably more powerful and smarter than Voldemort. John travelled the world after graduation, learning all he could about muggle technology and magic - successfully integrating the two. He had gathered devoted followers, mostly muggle-borns, in order to achieve their main goal: the revampment of the Wizarding World and eradication of purebloods everywhere. After hearing rumours of a Unspeakable time-travel project by some of his Ministry informants, the destruction of the Wizarding World began.

But all does not go as planned, when Harry directly intervenes and sabotages John's plans, just as the latter is about to rewrite the timeline. What occurs is time itself - past and future - is forever altered, with no way to return them to the way they were and no memories of what used to be.

"Shatterpoint"

In the year 2000 of this new reality, 20-year-old Harry Potter does not use a wand - not like he /could/ use it. Instead, unlike Prime!Harry, Shatter!Harry is an alien with amazing semi-magically-derived powers. Back in 1978, the new Mr and Mrs Potter were accidentally killed by a spaceship containing an alien couple, who had both escaped an intergalactic war, to survive. Feeling guilt at the accidental murder of the innocent human couple because of their cowardice, and finding out about the bravery they had in life, the alien couple masqueraded themselves as James and Lily to every detail - rewriting their biology to become human. Voldemort still kills the two on Halloween 1981, but Shatter!Harry had inherited their alien physiology which had strengthened itself with magic, and considerably weakened the Dark Lord. Even when Voldemort soon regains his full power, John - having been further empowered by Shatterpoint, destroys Voldemort with little effort and begins implementing his plan over several years. Long story short: Muggle-borns reign supreme, while purebloods are executed and hunted, as well as anyone who opposes the new regine.

Harry grows up with Sirius as his guardian, who must deal with a super-powered godson. It starts off with feats that could easily be accidental magic, before things like smashing concrete, to being invulnerable to practically every spell and generating electricity from his body whilst flying through the skies. Sirius is killed by actions of the Anti-magus forces (John's army), leaving Harry to accidentally come across the spaceship his parents came in, buried under Godric's Hollow, which begins to guide and train him via an AI hologram of Sirius. By the time that Harry is twenty, he has Superman-level strength and speed, flight, nigh-invulnerability, electrokinesis, and super (magical) senses. Even with a hyper-intelligent AI and god-like powers, Harry Potter is lost.

This is just /one/ example of how things are vastly different in Shatterpoint; I have plenty more fleshed out. Some characters are similar to their Prime counterparts, but many have been changed. If you have any questions and critiques, please feel free to give them. Thanks.


** Um. I didn't know this was even a subreddit. But I would absolutely LOVE to work with you on this if you want to write it. I'm sure I'd even be a great beta.

My FF.Net library is mostly HP alternate universes. And I'm a big fan of Flashpoint.
