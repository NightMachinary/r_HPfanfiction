** "Vlad the Impaler!" Hermione practically squeaked the name. "You're related to Vlad the 'shove-pikes-up-people's-bottoms' Impaler?"

Harry blinked and looked down at the parchment, biting his lip in thought. "Apparently so. Maybe mum's side of the family came from a bastard that moved to England? I wonder if green eyes came from him?" He suddenly smirked, a strangely vicious sight that made the back of Hermione's neck tingle with discomfort. "Oh, I can just imagine Aunt Petunia's face if she ever learns of this!"

"What about you, Neville?"

Neville frowned as the scanned the pages with a critical eye. "Aside from every pureblood and half-blood from a pureblood family in this room? Nothing too exciting." His frowned deepened. "Who was Erik the Red?"

"No idea," Hermione said after a moment's thought. "I don't recall him from any of our books."

"What about you, Luna?" Ginny peered over her friend's shoulder.

Luna, however, was looking visibly sickened, and was trying her best to swallow the gorge at the back of her throat. "Countess Elizabeth Bathory. She's listed as being a distant, maternal ancestor."

She felt Harry's hand on her shoulder. "Ancestry means nothing, Luna. I mean, Merlin, you're as far from that monster as Voldemort" --everyone within earshot bar Harry himself twitched a little at the name-- "is to the Pope!"

She nodded, eyes downcast, and quietly said, "Thank you, Harry,"

Or "It's been three hundred years since our family married into the black's"

And given the black family tree knocking around, Harry Potter's def. a distant cousin of Draco Malfoy's. Harry's great-aunt Dorea was a black before marrying his great uncle Charlus.

And Tom Riddle, jr is Harry's distant uncle. They're both Peverells, as the Gaunts inherited the stone from one brother and the Potters from another. They visit Uncle Toms cabin. Talk about hidden easter eggs.
