Currently writing a Lavender Brown/ Ron Weasley fanfiction where her name is pulled from the Goblet of Fire, instead of Harry's. Just passed 50,000 words and still going strong!

** Lavender as a triwizard champion? I always like a unique idea and will make sure to check your story out.

*** You betcha. It's actually on track to being about that length. I've got the ending mapped out about thirteen chapters from where it's at right now.

** Haven't yet read it, but I've left a follow. Intriguing idea and I desperately need more Lavender/Ron content.

*** Amen. Ron/Lavender is one of my favorite pairings, right alongside canon compliant Severus Snape/Nagini and Harry/Obliviation.

** Lavender does deserve more than canon. I'll probably check this out later.

*** Thank you so much! This warms my heart. :3

And I really appreciate the tip. I love any and all feedback! I'll try to go back and add some more place/time markers when I do my next edit.

** I just finished reading your work so far. This is wonderful! I love the time and care you are taking to really expand upon minor characters in a realistic and interesting way. I love the interesting backgrounds you give to the characters (Astoria having Hemophilia (or something similar), Pansy and Parvati being friends, Pansy's family magic spider connection) and I can't wait to read more! The voice you give everyone (specifically Lavender- she is just written perfectly) is perfectly tuned to their age and their personalities. This is my favorite fanfiction right now and I can't wait to see how the story develops! Keep at it!
