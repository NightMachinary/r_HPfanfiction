I'd prefer them to be complete, or at least 30k words and actively updating, but if it's on hiatus/abandoned, I'd prefer for the fic to stop around fourth or fifth year.

Thanks!

  It all went wrong. Harry was locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond, unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him when Harry is sent back in time with one mission, to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.
