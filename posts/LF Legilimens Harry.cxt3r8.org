Anyone know any stories where Harry regularly uses Legilimency? Other than The Mind Arts.

Can be any genre, just looking for something I'd quite like to read.


** Sadly abandoned but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4936921/2/Unconscious-Confessions][Unconscious Confession]] linkffn(4936921) has Harry (post war) learning Legilimency for his work as an Auror and having the unexpected consequence of passive Legilimency each time he meets someone's eye.

  The Minster feels that Harry Potter is the perfect candidate to do Legilimency for his elite Auror task force. But what happens when being able to see inside of the mind of his best mate reveals a lot more than expected?... About her AND about him? H/Hr- Story Discontinued...

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.

** Focus on looking at Snape and Harry fanfic. Because Snape is often the one training Harry in Legilimency.\\
My Snape list is here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cdkuzu/my_severus_snape_fanfic_library_list_please_help/]]

Many of these fanfic have Harry learning and becoming a master in Legilimency to defeat Voldemort with actual skill, not just love crap.

*Nothing but Legilimency stuff:*\\
Harry Potter and the Enemy Within (and its sequel Chained Souls)\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3389525/1/Stronger-Than-Hope]]

If you just want more Legilimency in general, and not specifically Harry, Hermione is the next most popular candidate learning it from Snape in fanfics. Many of my listed fics have that as well.
