I would like something that feels episodic like a wizarding version of Law And Order

Bonus if Luna is the coroner

Extra bonus if the murders get more outlandish as the fic goes on


** I hope you find this! I know there's a wizarding grey's anatomy hospital fic so a law & order one feels pretty reasonable!

** I feel like the closest is Midnight Blues - are bounty hunters acceptable?

** There's a good one where they hunt down a group of escaped Death Eaters and on the side investigate a chain of robberies. Hermione's the robber. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** You'd like Murder Most Horrid. It's not Ron and Harry but Bellatrix who's not a purist and she works in the Magical Homicide Division of the DMLE and dates Hermione. It's pretty good. I'd watch it if it were a TV show.
