So the idea for this is that Death Eaters are suddenly turning traitor and Voldemort can't work out why. Meanwhile, Dark! Harry is kidnapping DE relatives to force compliance or risk their families. I just thought of this as a darker application of love.


** Pretty original and stays true to the word of "love is the power the Dark Lord knows not" while completely subverting the spirit of it.

An interpretation that doesn't strictly follow the prompt would be that Voldemort and the DEs target the people important to Harry, so he, in turn, targets the families of Death Eaters. Once presented with the question of what he could live with (losing loved ones or breaking his morals), Harry finds that he's not such a good guy after all. The Death Eaters start wondering if they should be more scared of the monster at their back or the monster in front of them.

** "Good evening Nott. Please don't be alarmed, I'm not here to fight."

Nott Sr flinched as Harry Potter sat across from him, signalling for Tom for an order of Firewhiskey. His arm reached instinctively for his wand before Harry cleared his throat.

"Relax Nott. I'm just to talk. There's no need to draw extra attention to us now is there."

Nott relaxed, but his eyes continued to scan the room for other potential watchers. He knew it was useless though. From what the Death Eaters know, the Order had a Metamorphmagus amongst them, and talented as he was at duelling, he knew his counter-surveillance skills weren't good enough to detect an Auror amongst the crowd at the Leaky Cauldron.

"What do you want?" asked Nott, taking a sip of firewhiskey.

"Your cooperation," said Harry. "I want the Lestrange estate's location to be exact, although any additional intelligence on Death Eater whereabouts would be greatly appreciated."

Nott snorted. "why would I give you that information. You must have taken too many Bludgers to the head if you think I'll give you that information."

Harry leaned back into his chair, a gleam in his eye that made Nott's stomach turn.

"Tell me Nott, how's you're son Theodore doing these days. Has he recovered from his Potions accident yet?"

Nott blanched. "You're bluffing. You wouldn't dare move against my son."

"Not how I operate Nott. Bluffing leaves too much to chance. I don't even have to move against your son. The survivors of the Bones family, well, they want revenge for what happened to Amelia."

"They would-"

"I know what Voldemort feels about love. He feels that there's nothing more pathetic than love. But love makes us do things that we wouldn't normally do. Tell me, if I killed your son, what would you do? You'd want revenge, but Voldemort isn't going to have his most valuable assets not obeying his command. I have no doubt he'd tell you to stand down, and remind you who you really serve. But are you really going to be listening to him at that point?"

Nott' breathing became laboured, his chest heaving as Harry continued.

"So you'd try to kill me. But who else is going to help you? Voldemort isn't going to have his other Death Eaters help you given that he likely has other plans for them. And he isn't going to let you go as well. Skilled as you are Voldemort knows that you have a considerable amount of knowledge on what he's planning to do and he can't risk you being captured and having whatever knowledge you have wrung out by the Order. So he'll likely have you killed, most likely given his track record. It doesn't matter to me, while you'd be dead and we wouldn't have intelligence what he's planning it saves the Order the trouble of having to track and kill you if Voldemort does it for us."

Nott fought desperately to maintain some sense of control as he stared at Harry, fighting the urge to kill him. He could do it and Disapparate before anyone could stop him, but if what he said was true about the Bones wanting revenge killing Harry wouldn't accomplish anything.

Bastard planned this all along, seethed Nott.

"Help me," said Harry. "Help me and I'll guarantee your son's safety."

Nott swallowed. He didn't want to betray the cause but from where he stood he had no leverage at all. He knew that if what he did was discovered he would be killed by the Dark Lord, but he also knew that in Hogwarts the Order had easy access to his son. He didn't know for sure that Harry would honour his agreement, but it was his only choice if he wanted to protect his son.

"Ok," said Nott, his voice shaking. "I'll give you what you want."

** So it's just Harry using standard espionage tactics of finding point of weakness and exerting a pressure on it until the target foils.

It's good for one-off, but not for long-term cooperation. Look at MICE reasons for spying - Money, Ideology, Coercion or Compromise, and Ego or Excitement. Not every Death Eater is a zealot, some are in it for the above reasons and those reasons can be exploited and turned against them. But it takes time and a significant amount of work. It would be easier just to cast the Imperious Curse on said individuals, equip them with suicide vests, and order them to detonate it during their next meeting with Voldemort.

*** I thought it would work slightly better on DE's due to their whole ideology being basically making sure their families end up on top, so them not having families at the end of it makes the whole struggle pointless. You have a point though, at some point the DE's would rebel against the hostage taking. Maybe force them into contracts or unbreakable vows?

**** I understand people not liking it. I don't understand why people ship snarry or tomarry or so many other ships. It's just the ship that feels right to so many people especially someone who loves the trope enemies to lovers. In real life it has no way of working I'm sure but i can be happy about the fantasy of it because i know that's what it is. Kust fantasy and fiction. There's nothing romantic about falling in love with your bully. But every now and again, in the books, harry has addressed draco as hair gleaming in the sunlight and pale glittery eyes and has been so obsessed with draco to a level that jk didn't actually put any build up in harry and Ginny's relationship. And she's been building up romione since 4th year. So when harry and ginny was happening in some awkward weird way, draco was constantly in his mind. So maybe that's why.

***** Look, if this was Draco maybe a couple years after Voldemort, sure. Canon Draco between years 1-5 at least would never really work, or be healthy. I hate how few Ron/Harry or Neville/Harry fics there are. Those relationships I could actually see. But Drarry would be unhealthy on a lot of levels considering Draco's views, and ideaology at that point.

****** Oh i completely agree. Canon draco would never work. But after the war he left his parents and their believes to be with Astoria who was a muggle lover and his parents were against the marriage. And as I've read cursed child, i can say that he raised Scorpius very well and not at all prejudiced or cruel like Lucius raised Draco. So 99% pf the fics i read of drarry are post war. As i said, pre war drarry would've been completely toxic and unhealthy and would never work. I myself wouldn't agree with that relationship. But, there's no declining that harry couldn't have let draco go even in an enemy form and draco was the same. Which is also why most of the drarry fics are either during the war while Draco's views were changing in canon and he saved Harry's life or after the war when he re-evaluated everything and turned his life amd believes around. Harry and ron, now that's ruining the beautiful friendship they have for me. Even harry and Hermione. I love the fact they are best friends. Showing how a girl and giy can be friends without having to fall in love. Neville and Harry... I guess. Maybe. They did have a lot in common to go on.
