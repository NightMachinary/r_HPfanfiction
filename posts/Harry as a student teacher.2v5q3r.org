Here I am once again asking for a new breed of stories from all you nice Potterheads. Today I request stories in which Harry is a student teacher or something similar.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] has him teach Potions for a bit (as part of a time-travel thing). He's not very good at it. This story is long, and complete, and has its moments.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/][C'est La Vie]] has him doing some Ancient Runes teaching. This story is quite good but incomplete.

** I suppose [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/C-est-La-Vie][this]] counts, after a fashion.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3129767/1/The-New-Defense-Professor][The New Defense Professor]] is slightly AU, it follows a time travelling Harry, who teaches his parents Defense in their 7th year.
