any pairings are fine except ginny/harry! tomarrymort, snape/harry, regulus/harry or any strong female lead are all preferred. there doesn't have to be a pairing.

i'm more interested in fics where neville is the bwl and still grows up in the wizarding world, but the fic is still very harry-centric.

i've read a lot of similar tropes, and tbh i know what i like and don't like. please be well written! thank you :)


** linkffn(the art of self fashioning) he isnt the bwl and is a transfiguration prodigy. its an amazing fic if a bit uncomfortable, but its complete.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.
