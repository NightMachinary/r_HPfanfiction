**** Well whatever the championship is in Britain then. I'm sure there is one. The sequel can be when Ron makes the national team, and loses his way due to fame (Hermione: You've changed Ron! You're not the same person I fell in love with!). Then at his lowest one of his other team mates dies tragically (it was his last Quidditch match before retirement!) and he has to relearn the meaning of friendship and teamwork.

Also, I think the first story would have a subplot about Ron's games helping drag George from the edge he'd be on since Fred's death).

Full rapid integration of not just wizards, but goblins, centaurs, etc. into a world already reeling from atrocity, horror, and bloodshed. I would open the fic on a scene where a a plucky young commander (young Mazer Rackham) meets the Wizard assigned to his squadron (Ronald Weasley).

Like she would *not* wear nothing but Dudley's castoffs (cheap second hand dresses bought just for her, frickin' underwear), and him and a gang of other boys would not be aloud to chaste and beat her all the time at school. That alone would change her personality.

Plus, at least in my experience, girls are required to do most of the inside chores he canonically had, and all Petunia would just have to put in a token showing when Harry's weeding the flowerbeds to make a chore into a mother/daughter bonding time. Not that that's what it would be, be it's what the neighbors would think. I think the term tomboy would be thrown around the neighborhood more than delinquent, and then promiscuous as she gets older.

Then all of the Hogwarts' teachers would treat her differently. Dumbledore would try harder to do right by her because of his sister. Snape, assuming Fem!Harry is not a redhead, would be less harsh and more indifferent as a Fem!Harry would look less like either of her parents. Ron wouldn't try as hard to be her friend, girls are spoiled. The dynamic with Hermione would be radically different. A Fem!Harry might even form a trio with Lavender and Parvati.

Injuries between boys is 'boys rough house it's how they play'. *Injuries* from a group of boys to a single girl would be another thing entirely. The bullying would be less physical, crying would garner more sympathy and retreating to a safe space, like the library would be more likely, and more socially acceptable. Bullying and gang beatings aren't the same thing. Harry got chased and beat regularly enough for them to name the 'game'. At a school targeting a girl that way, too often would cause a stir. But to be clear I never said the bullying wouldn't be there, just that boys would not be aloud to chaste and beat her *all the time at school*.

Plus a cute girl (and Fem!Harry would be adorable) would get more sympathy than a boy. A boy is expected to fight back and man up, a girl is just a victim. Unless it's a case of 'he hit you because he likes you' which wouldn't go down well as Dudley is her cousin.

Girls can (and do) get bullied, even by boys, but the constant and systematic bullying Fem!Harry faced would be less physical in nature. 'Over reacting' would still be comforted, unlike with a boy who is just told he's 100% in the wrong. And a less then eleven year old girl won't be labeled as a delinquent as easily as a boy.

Shit is different, just by virtue of boys and girls getting treated different by society at large! I don't know why fic writers can't get that. A girl is treated differently than a boy and that *will* effect personality!

*** I literally think, out of all the possible fanfiction ideas, Rowling would hate the most the one about Hermione rising to power. Doing so would invariably depict Hermione in a similar vein to how Hilary Clinton was depicted up to the election in the United States 2 years ago. She would have to connive and back-deal, more like a mafia boss than anything else (it would still be awesome).

Rowling would hate the idea that her self-insert in the HP series ended up in canon by making deals, politicking, and hiding the dead bodies where necessary. She made her the freaking Minister of Magic in her late-thirties (maybe forty, I can't be sure), combined with the fact that the last books ramp on the perfect muggleborn portrayal. Just a thought.

IMO, Hermione the politician would be a lot more competent and ruthless than Hillary Clinton, since I don't remember Clinton had to fight for her own life against sadistic genocidal maniacs and been brutally tortured herself.

That being said, I have made a similar case that Hermione, out of all three of them, has the most potential to fall into a truly dark spiral. She doesn't always rely on rules and books and authority per se, but she defers to them almost all the time and argues their veracity even when its unlikely. She relies on structure and authority to view the world, and if her idea of the "way things are" collapsed (i.e. it turns out all these teachers and government official are no more competent than anyone else, and serve there own interests and not necessarily the public good), then she would begin to wonder question *everything*.

If your reason for believing something is this way is that someone you thought knew what they were talking about told you, what happens to that view when that person screws up or does something immoral or evil?

Frankly, lots of younger revolutionary and rebellion fodder end up going through exactly what I just described. The difference? Hermione is a once in a generation intellect and has access to the ability to instantly kill, mind control, read minds, conjure nearly anything, teleport instantly in multiple ways, and assume numerous different forms of disguise with ease.

That's correct. Rowling's canon timeline has Hermione becoming Minister of Magic (MoM) by age 40.

To quote [[https://www.quora.com/Since-Hermione-was-such-a-talented-witch-do-you-think-if-she-was-evil-she-could-have-been-as-bad-as-Voldemort/answer/Amber-Goldsmith][one Quora answer]] on the following:

#+begin_quote
  Even more importantly, especially in Hermione's case, if we consider what Slughorn said to Tom Riddle in "Half-Blood Prince":

  /“ - I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years...”/

  In "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child", by the year 2019, Hermione *did* “rise to Minister of Magic within twenty (20) years” - the most powerful political position in, and the “leader of”, the British wizarding world. She succeeded Kingsley Shacklebolt, the previous Minister, in the role.

  Not only that, but her rise to power was achieved within only 10 years - in *half* the time that Slughorn cited for Tom Riddle.

  By the age of 40 (b. 1979), she had become Minister for Magic.

  Compare this to David Cameron, who became “the youngest Prime Minister of the UK in 200 years” in 2010. He was the youngest British leader since Lord Liverpool in 1812.

  Cameron, age 42, was two (2) years older than Hermione than when she assumed her role as Minister.

  She also became even more [politically] powerful than Harry Potter, the “Boy-Who-Lived”, “Defeater of Lord Voldemort”, in the long run - and, essentially, served as Harry's boss, as Harry was the head of the Auror Department of the Ministry's Department of Magical Law Enforcement (DMLE).

  This was after Hermione's “relatively swift” ascent to power within the Ministry, working her way up quickly from her original, entry-level role.

  /"Hermione began her post-Hogwarts career [in 1998--1999] at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, where she was instrumental in greatly improving life for house-elves and their ilk. She then moved (despite her jibe to [then-Minister] Scrimgeour) to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, where she was a progressive voice who ensured the eradication of oppressive, pro-pureblood laws."/ - J.K. Rowling

*** I don't know about a redemption fic for Grindelwald (I know who you are talking about...), but I have considered writing a fic with a somewhat similar idea.

- Grindelwald and Dumbledore duel in Berlin. However, a muggle (or anything really) shoots Dumbledore from a distance or something to that effect (surprise is very effective after all, no matter how powerful the wizard). Grindelwald used the momentary advantage to smash Dumbledore.
- When he moved to finish Albus, he felt a moment of pity. And he realized that he couldn't run away really. He had lost the war, and his only path forward would be to run and hide, or take on the role of someone with his level of ability to remain hidden. He grabs Dumbledore, stashes him in Nurmengard to keep a supply of Polyjuice, puts him in a coma, then hightails it back to Britain as the conquering hero.
- With all the powers heaped on him as a result, he focuses on manipulating the longterm events of both Britain and magical Europe towards his ideological beliefs. He slowly builds power and accumulates resources. Additionally, he lacks Dumbledore's memories, so when Riddle asks for the DADA job in '45, he says nothing and lets him take the position.
- Eventually Grindelwald cottons on to Riddle, and duels him in secret (maybe in the Chamber of Secrets). Grindelwald overpowers him, but Riddle convinces him that if he dies, the facade of Dumbledore would be revealed (everyone sort of knew Albus did not trust him). Grindelwald agrees to keep his dark practices a secret, and Riddle agrees to say nothing of the disguise or what he knows. They bind themselves with an Unbreakable Bond (which I don't know what would happen with someone having a Horcrux...)
- Eventually, Riddle retires to go exploring world-wide, and Grindelwald revives Dumbledore while restraining him (he eventually develops a more permanent method to disguise himself) so that they can talk to one another (they did love to debate on things after all). Albus reveals the information about Tom that he knows about Riddle, and Grindelwald maneuvers the government to make him a wanted man.
- All the while, Grindelwald is pushing an agenda of greater magical inclusion. He argues that he learned a great deal from the war, and that Magic is Might was not wrong, but should not be forced upon others. Incorporating muggleborns and half-bloods more into society, removing blood related privileges, and pushing greater interconnection of the various magical nations (partly as a way to search for the still missing Riddle).
- Eventually Voldemort reappears. Not in Britain though. He has been named the Minister of Magic...in Albania. He pushes the propaganda that Dumbledore (Gellert) is actually trying to implement Magic is Might again, and champions that they should not let another Grindelwald rise again (heh heh heh).
- Several magical nations jump on board (this is sometime in the 1980s) and assault Britain. Eventually Voldemort joins the battle and attacks Britain. He attempts to purge people who are the strongest supporters of Dumbledore personally. He kills James and leaves Lily Potter in a coma, but Dumbledore (Gellert) arrives and fights him off. You see, Grindelwald did learn of the prophecy, but when someone (lets say Snape) heard about it, he was quietly killed and no one but the unspeakables knew about it.
- Harry is raised by his grandparents (Fleamont and Euphemia are still alive here) and Grindelwald serves as something of a mentor to Harry growing up, all while keeping the prophecy unknown to everyone, including Voldemort.

That's what I have so far. Obviously it needs some work.

As far as we know, Grindelwald was on the brink of /winning/ when Dumbledore finally decided to stop playing around and confronted him directly. That the Nazis were losing on the Muggle side of things is of no relevance; there was /some/ relationship between Grindelwald and the rise of fascist regimes, but not nearly as direct, most likely, as fanfiction sometimes portray. It would have barely hindered Grindelwald if his temporary Muggle puppets had been slaughtered, he'd just have, say, hopped to Russia and Imperiused Stalin, if he truly /needed/ a puppet Muggle dictatorship --- which I don't think he really did.

***** Probably. At least, I imagine that he felt his IDEALS were being rejected due to his more violent tendencies (the Dark Arts don't make you look good to most of your audience), and what he needed was a new image for himself (Dumbledore, defeater of Grindelwald, etc.). He COULD possibly take over by force, but now he has the opportunity to control everyone in a much more subtle way. It would not be impossible to see that his past methods tainted the ideals he wanted practiced in the minds of most of the world, and thus felt he needed to reorient his image. Ergo, impersonate someone with a better reputation but a similar magical skill. Apparently nobody cared about him changing wands so that would not be a big deal.

The only two issues I see to such a move are Aberforth and Fawkes. Now Aberforth was on the outs with Dumbledore, so that may not even matter, but at worst he would have to be disposed of or imperiused in some manner. Fawkes, I could not find any information one way or the other, but it may be that he had not been "tamed" (whatever that means) yet so it might not matter. If he was, he would probably notice disguise (or Dumbledore might be able to call him but I am not sure whether he can do that), so something would need to be done about him beyond the norm.

****** Concerning Fawkes, a popular prediction is that Newt will find Fawkes and give him to Dumbledore at some point in the future /Fantastic Beasts/ films, so if this is right (and it'd be a darn shame if it wasn't) then we should get a pretty definitive answer about the timeline soon enough.

At any rate, if he can Imperius or Memory-Charm Aberforth, there's no reason he couldn't do the same with Fawkes, I think.

******* Its kind unclear what wizards/witches can actually DO to a phoenix. You can kill them obviously. You may be able to tame them to a degree. But whether you can actually control them is something on the fence from what I can see.

Phoenixes appear to belong to a small category of creatures (like dementors and lethifolds for example) where their exact capabilities are not known or well established even by experts in the magical world. Are they truly immortal, or do they simply choose when to, as Harry put it, "leave this world?" So that is somewhat hard to say one way or the other.

On the other hand, the Weasley clan was huge and they had plenty people working part time or at home: Molly, Fleur, Ginny, Ron, and several more could jump in at any time.

In fact, I suspect Hermione to be distant to most Weasley children, including her own. That distance and her successes could have fueled ASP's fascination and reverence of her. For her, ASP's strong physical resemblance to Harry might have awakened her fantasy of what could have beens (with Harry).

As long as Ron was around, she felt happy and didn't bother with those outrageous fantasies. But after Ron died, she quickly became emotionally unbalanced...

** Two things:

1. You know those stories where Harry has Voldemort (or Dumbledore) in his head and this guides him to make different decisions than canon? Well what if James and/or Lily were in his head. And no, I don't mean like the Lie I've Lived where he is fused with James, I mean they talk and banter back and forth. Harry is still Harry. The two of them were reasonably talented mages, but they were only 21 or 22 at the time, so their advice would not make him all that strong, just with a noticeable leg up. Better yet, the two of them are arguing in his head kind of like those cartoons where you see the angel and the devil figure on his shoulders, and he has to decide which one to listen to, if at all. And this doesn't need to be a crack fic, I would honestly prefer if this were serious. Serious teacher/mentor James and Lily guiding Harry.
2. You know those stories where the Order of the Phoenix calls a hero from another dimension? I have two ideas for this. #1 You call Tom Riddle or young Gellert Grindelwald from another dimension (maybe the past?) and they take the war in an entirely different direction, or even a younger Dumbledore who is apparently appalled by how his future self has behaved and curb stomps his way to victory. #2 The Order calls Harry...along with Ron and Hermione from the future/alternate dimension (take your pick, neither of them make sense anyway). The spell only lets them return "Once Voldemort has been truly Defeated." Now imagine these three are older Harry, Ron and Hermione, more talented and experienced than a bunch of teenagers, and are thus something like a team Spartans in magic form. Show off the dynamic of the trio as adults, and make ALL THREE OF THEM awesome. The closest I found to this was We are the Golden Trio!, which is close but not quite what I wanted.

Edit: Regarding number 1, it has been pointed out that their IS something like this, though not quite what I wanted (thanks [[/u/bluerandome][u/bluerandome]]) called Three's Company linkffn(Three's Company by ThefourthHallow).

By contrast, Lily and James would essentially remain in their early twenties. This works too because despite their abilities, the level of knowledge they possess on important mysteries in the story (the Hallows, the Department of Mysteries, what's a Horcrux) are no greater than his own. It would be a family-centered fic, but only Harry realizes it.

Imagine all sorts of people coming to him and thanking him, and treating him like a celebrity. Simultaneously, James and Lily are in his head making fun of or insulting these people and getting angry about treating their son like that. All the staring and whatnot, and they are telling these people to go jump in a lake in his head.

In like 4th, 5th, 6th or 7th year, Harry decides that he needs to get his shit together. How does he do that? Well for any reason (doesn't matter to me), he discovers that there are parallel alternate dimensions where he can learn magic quickly from other versions of himself. The catch? The other versions of himself are actually the AU dimensions in a lot of popular HP fanfics.

Thus you see what this fic really is: the ultimate meta crossover of hp fanfiction. Harry visits alternate versions of himself, for example: Harrymort in Seventh Horcrux, time traveler Harry from Wastelands of Time, Austro-Hungarian soldier Harry from The Skitterleap, the weird aether version of Harry in the Firebird Trilogy. And you make it a multiple author work with each author contributing a chapter in their universe. Then Harry comes back and shows off his unique powers...which neatly fits into the "Power He Knows Not" bs in the prophecy.

This one has the greatest premise, but he doesn't have to meet Emperor Harry. In fact, he's better off not meeting the Emperor, who most likely will use his counterpart in some nefarious schemes.

I have this idea: the Trio stumbled into this universe after getting the Locket from Umbridge. Instead of making into the Ministry Atrium as in canon, they were forced into the DoM, chased by Yaxley and Rookwood. Then it happened, all five of them were catapulted into the Emperor universe and 25 years into the future (exact date 9/1/2022), right outside Ginny's ranch near Hogwarts.

Hermione and Ron made through her ward, but Harry and the two Death Eaters were all knocked out by it. Although surprised, Ginny easily subdued Hermione and Ron, and tied them all up in her dungeon. There, she awakened the Trio and brutally interrogated the two Death Eaters in front of them. Through a combination of Cruciatus and Legilimency, she basically turned the two Death Eaters into vegetables, and utterly terrified the Trio. Then she turned her attention to them.

Ginny soon figured what was going on. By comparing the magical signatures of the Locket and Harry's scar, she deduced that Harry was a Horcrux. The Trio's tales also greatly moved her and earned her respect, so she decided to help them out. Harry, however, recognized her as Ginny when she told them the date. Despite her rather evil performance so far, Harry insisted that he still felt the good in her....

Your second idea is good too, but I feel like you just want one of the canon uber-wizards to stomp Voldemort. I think it would be good because these wizards are strong enough to be a real threat to Voldemort and at the same time independent enough to do things their own way.

They are either somewhat fluffy Harry has an easy time, slice-of-life fics or WBWL-style "Harry is not treated properly/neglected/forgotten/abused/etc." fics. Sometimes things break the mold, but they are rare.

This fic would have good parents, but when they died they were just reaching adult status. They had only been married a couple of years (two or three at most) and they had disparate personalities and tastes. I want to see how Harry's parents would help him when they don't have any real power other than to speak with their son. Did you ever read the Hero Trilogy? Ethan from that fic becomes something like what I mean for this fic. And with two people, with different opinions and skillsets, have different ideas, their son will have to decide what is right and who to listen too. And they can't leave, so if he makes them mad he has to deal with it.

A family fic with only one person.

This can go in a lot of different ways, depending on who they are, how old, and what their individual experiences were prior to the events. Its about forcing a strong wizard to realize they can't pay the check, so they find another way to settle the bill.

**** Honestly, either.

Like either Snape (who is a potions master) rescues himself or someone rescues him in the first place, and the fic describes his reaction and the reaction of society to his spying and the end of the war. However, I really doubt that the entire society would just accept him, but I don't think that he deserves prison. His mental psyche must also be fucked up, serving two masters and being tortured by both. I also don't think that Snape could have only been spying for Lily, and I'd like to see a fic that addresses that.

Or... he ends the war in a different way and tries to survive, maybe defecting from both sides? I mean, he's a badass Potion master and legilimens who can make absolutely lethal spells, take a beating, and deliver one two.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  It should have been a simple task. Escort Ginny Weasley to her Quidditch match. But it all changes when Harry Potter rents the wrong car. What started out as a simple road trip between two friends and past lovers quickly turns into a hellish game of cat and mouse, and Harry and Ginny find themselves running away from a mysterious and deadly group of mercenaries.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** I'd like to see an alternative school. Preferably the creation of one. Hogwarts when you get down to it is a truly crappy school. I'd like to see a new school with high standards. For example, security, safety, education standards, class sizes, available classes, parent interaction, bullying, etc.

I recall one fic where two teachers from Hogwarts visited a muggleborn run school, and were baffled that to visit they had to sign in and wear guest lanyards.

The kind of story I'd like would have a lot of nitty gritty stuff. Lots of details about how the school got established, how it was run, its policies, the politics (maybe the Purebloods tried to shut it down?), etc.

The one I'm thinking of had Quirrell release the Basilisk at Halloween, not a troll... which led to a goldmine of butterfly effects.

I can only imagine e.g. Sirius trying to break into the school at the same time as the Triwizard tournament, or the Basilisk getting loose at that same time; and the resulting Harry learning certain aspects or character developing parts of himself at different times. Fifteen year old Harry discovering his Parselmouth ability AFTER Voldemort returns and starts sending him visions might have dramatically different effects on his psyche and how those around him react.

On another note, another favorite kind of fics of mine is Hermione-centric fics with no pairing. I just find her such a compelling character on her own, and pairing fics have a tendency to over-prioritise romance to her or have her care about it more, whereas canon Hermione seemed to have it pretty low down her priority list most of the time.

Gomez crawled on his knees, glass shards and wood chips tearing at his suit and skin. He wrapped his arms around his beloved's legs and kissed her exposed thigh.“Such rage, such passion,” he agreed breathlessly as the baby's cries got louder and louder. “We must take it with us.” Morticia decided, swathed in black rags and moonlight, “he reeks of death, and darkness.

One example is a scenario I wrote where Sirius is a time-travelled Harry's little brother. Harry mellows him out a bunch. First by killing the source of his violent tendencies, his father Orion, and second by being the role-model Sirius needed. He ends up being years ahead of James in terms of maturity, and eventually Lily falls for him instead of James.

Because the characterizations of all marauders & Lily are flimsy as fuck and in fanfiction you can change it anyway you want them to be regardless. Going by that argument you might as well invalidate 90% of pairings in the fandom, canon ones included. Why did Lily actually pick James anyway? We don't fucking know.

From a drama point of view, you can create a ton out of the situation: You can have them bond over their alienation from family, you can have Lily pursue Sirius out of spite for James, etc.

***** It was just a question.

If you want to write a pairing - any pairing - you usually have to establish some reason they'd be attracted to each other, right? We don't get a /lot/ of material on those people, but the little we get strongly suggest that James Potter and Sirius Black have a lot of traits in common. If Lily finds James unappealing, but is drawn to Sirius, then the two boys have a lot in common but /also/ differ significantly enough for Lily to overlook the bits where they're alike and overlook that spending time with the one she likes will also mean time around/with the one she doesn't.

I'm not saying it can't be done. It probably can. Most pairings can, with the right set up. Even so, asking /how would you establish that appeal without completely ignoring the information we already have/? is fair.

If you ignore what we already have, then that's not Sirius any more - that's an original character with Sirius' name on it.

Now see here this is a problem. I don't wanna write it, I wanna read it. Don't expect me to actually pull good justifications for plot out of my ass, I'm just answering about a thread on 'crazy specific or super unusual subjects that fanfiction just doesn't seem to cover yet', which certainly includes Sirius/Lily romance fics. I can try to give you a few examples, but they're gonna reflect the fact that my creative writing skills are non-existent.

The way I'd do it would be for the two of them actually getting to know each other without the stalkerish pressure and consequent irritation brought by James, like by Lily directing a few detentions for Sirius, and then you can have them bond over Sirius being alienated from his family for being a blood traitor while Lily is a witch in a family of muggles that won't ever really understand what her life is like. Being that Lily actually appears to be compatible with James (and consequently with Sirius, since they're so similar), it wouldn't be unrealistic for them to hit it off platonically at first and develop into romance in time. The difference between James and Sirius might very well just be that the first's approach to courting Lily would basically be seen as very disrespectful and pushy. You don't fucking bother a girl for years if she keeps shutting you down hard, unless you don't respect her. Change that scenario into a gradual and pressure free growth of the relationship, and you might very well have a reason for Lily to like one but not the other in spite of the two being very similar.

#+begin_quote

Yeah see the issue here is that all we have here is their names and a few vague details about their relationships rather than their character. Any marauder story is necessarily 98% OC anyway. What do we actually know about Lily? Nothing. What do we know about James and Sirius? They pranked people and were 'good people' in spite of being really mean bullies. That's it. Everything else is headcanon or speculation.

A fic could very well be set before the 'prank' and avoid it outright. There's no obligation to follow stations of canon afterall.

It's a good point otherwise, although I get the feeling that the sticking point for Lily would be more the unrepented attempted murder than the actual victim.

It would make an excellent plot point in a fic where the romance is already ongoing tho: Sirius baiting Snape out of jealousy, Sirius baiting Snape out of rage over his treatment of Lily, Sirius not actually giving a shit about Lupin being outed because James took Sirius and Lily dating as betrayal and the other marauders took his side against Sirius, etc.

Same way she did for James? He's the one who instigated all the Snape hatred in the first place, the one we see do the pantsing and all the public stuff, and the one who specifically does it because Snape is a slytherin at first, and Lily's best friend after. Yet she didn't care and still married him. I also think you're overstating the amount of actual hatred on Sirius's part, because he admitted he didn't even realize how dangerous that was for Lupin, and with his upbringing his moral compass oughta be looser than the average teen anyway. It's strongly implied that for Sirius it was just being a mean bully and backign up James, he didn't really give a shit about Snape. If he had a counter influence telling him Snape is off limits he might well have forgotten about him.

And let's not forget, Lily wouldn't know shit, at all. Nobody knows nothing at all about the accident aside from Dumbledore, Snape (sworn to secrecy), and the marauders. It might make for an interesting plot point to have James snitch to her to make them fight, or maybe Peter as foreshadowing of his treacherous tendencies (let's throw Sirius and Remus under the bus so I can suck up to James!).

I think there's a chance for a good OC character, either one of Remus's parents or another member of the Order either lives with or close to Remus to take care of Harry during the full moon.

Harry grows up on the fringes of the magical world, not quite out there but definitely not how it was with the Dursleys. He knows all about Sirius and his parents and Voldemort. He'll likely get some magical tutoring as a younger child, not leading to super!Harry by any means but maybe just a more-prepared Harry.

** This may already be a thing, but I'd like to read something decent where the second Wizarding War has already begun (DH or post) and a larger threat to both sides forces them to join together. Preferably including lots of interaction between key players on both sides and power struggles.

** Fanfiction with fights written like a good action movie. On the rare occasion that fanfiction does focus on the action it's very arcane magic with flashy spells and elegant robe whirling.

I want magic fights that are more hitting eachother with nail covered bats and chains and less formalized fencing.

Also grim fantasy or creature!Harry without it being a shitty romance/drama.

Harry and Draco or Neville with an epic bromance with the healthy amount of antagonism that goes with that kind of friendship.
