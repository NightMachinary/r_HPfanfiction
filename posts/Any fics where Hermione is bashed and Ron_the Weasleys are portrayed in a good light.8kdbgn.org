** Treating Hermione like a goddess is bashing her. The one defining character trait of Hermione was her undying loyalty to Harry, to the point where she set teachers aflame, led Umbridge in a Centaur gang rape and punched Malfoy for being a little shit. Past book one, she broke almost every rule and countless laws for Harry. Taking that away and leaving her an attractive, goody two shoes lexicon or submissive sex on legs is just as bad as taking Ron's positive qualities away.

**** She was at the headquarters of a paramilitary organisation, which is not the best place to throw a fit against authority. Given the amount of "adult" oversight from +chief hypocrite No 1+ Molly Weasley, mail screening is a realistic conclusion. And no one else wrote Harry either, following Dumbledore's orders as well. Not Sirius, not Ron, no other Weasley...

**** Hermione is rarely written as genius (or even a character on her own and not just a plot device) and more often than not what the average joe thinks intelligent people are like (much like The Big Bang Theory and their depiction of intelligence and science).

And twisting one of the best characters in the series into onedimensional arm candy while completely disregarding most of what makes her character (loyalty, hard work for her knowledge, a willingness to cross lines to get things done) is just as twisting one into an exaggeration of his weaknesses. The difference is that with Ron the author outright says what he thinks about it while in the other they merely imply things, like that Hermione is a price to be won or a damsel in distress for the Hero to rescue.

Welcome to the world of fanfiction! It's rare to find here a really good writer who is on the similar level with best professional authors.

In your answers you describe Hermione as just Harry's Bellatrix.

****** Bellatrix had lost her sanity and her conscience(if she ever had them) whilst she served Voldemort. Hermione still has those, though one of her defining traits is her pragmatism. She bowed to authority when it seemed like it would help, and when she was disappointed or didn't have the time to she took matters into her own hands. Obliviating her parents and sending them to Australia was her elimination of a weakness that could bring them down while at the same time protecting them. Though there are parallels between them, the differences make it moot. Though I do occasionally wonder "what if Harry had stayed dead..."

*** I don't know if loyalty is the right word. I'm not sure what is but to me her actions in the third book aren't loyal, well intentioned yes, but not loyal. Her going behind Harry's back to the teachers about the firebolt was motivated by her concern, it was for a good reason and Harry wasn't listening to her but I think her actions could be seen as a personal betrayal. She sticks with Harry through anything, she does all she can to help him (outside of the odd bit character assassination in the 6th book) but I don't know if loyalty is what I'd call that. Dedication maybe? Concern?

**** You wouldn't follow someone through hell and back because you are simply concerned. Neither would (platonic) love fit here, given that love alone won't stop you from abandoning others (see Lupin).

Dedication, well, maybe. But isn't dedication just another form of loyalty?

Also, the firebolt business had them aged 13 and 14, so not really the best time for mature decisions. And really, the whole mess was a lose lose situation. It is obvious that Harry is dismissive of her arguments/theory so trying to tell him beforehand would not have changed much. I mean, he barely got used to the concept of Christmas presents and now Hermione asks him to give away the best one he ever received (the cloak doesn't count as gift). That would not end well either way.

In Greek mythology, yes; they are an unruly bunch and are written off as a race that pick up women and whatnot. In the PotterVerse, however, they're portrayed as wise and proud creatures and highly territorial.
