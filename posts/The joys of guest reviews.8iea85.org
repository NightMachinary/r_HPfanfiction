Thankfully I have moderate guest reviews on because I just got this:

:U f*** prostitute b*** how you question me a man go back to the kitchen stupid s*** all women are good for is reproduction I will plagiarise every one of your fics.

I'm rather baffled because it was on my one shot exploring grief, it had nothing to do with women, though I have had light feminist themes in some of my other fics. I'm also not sure who I have questioned lately.

It is my first full out abusive review though, so I sort of feel I have made it as a writer.

Edit: ah, never mind. I know who it is. It's our very own Man With a Hundred Accounts. I told him to go away.

Mods, please can we reinstate the minimum karma to post rule for a bit? Please? [[/u/Denarii]]?

I thought the same thing when one of my stories was plagiarised.

*** Hah, right good point - they don't like me being a woman but clearly they feel my writing is of an acceptable standard.

Is there any good way to monitor people plagiarizing your fics? I've never really thought about it.

*** The weirdest part of getting plagiarized is when you stumble on it in the wild, unaware and undirected. It's happened once or twice to me - usually they pad my work out and maybe change characters to try and obscure it. Very intense form of deja vu...

** That sucks. Usually my guest reviews are “great chapter!” which is all right, I guess. I don't understand why people take the time to be nasty like that. At least you are able to delete it, but sucks that you even had to deal with it in the first place.

** Posting an acknowledgement here (and believe me I do understand the desire to share these things) is giving him pecisely the attention his sad little soul craves. There will probably be a whole spate of these now, and each time someone will come on here to tell us about it and the thing will go on and on. I've seen it many times on different forums. The only thing that will have any effect is to ignore him.

I feel everyone knows this, yet many people don't seem able to stop themselves having a public reaction. Please don't feed him.

***** To be a certified cry baby, an individual must meet at least four of the following criteria:

1. Does the individual hold such severe grudges that they stalk people across multiple platforms?
2. Does the individual send abuse they recognise as nasty/cringey/pathetic? I.e, do they do it anonymously?
3. Does the individual spend an unusual amount of time in their perusal of ineffective trolling or abuse?
4. Does the individual get their feelings hurt when their trolling is uncovered?
5. Does the individual generally seem like someone with too much time on their hands?

** Don't let it bother you. In fact, think of it like this: if you wrote something that offended someone /so much/ that they went and typed out a whole mini-paragraph review with passion and feeling -- then you impacted /them/ a whole lot more than they impacted /you/. So, reviews like that just serve to prove how good a story is, often.

What bothers me more, personally, it one-word reviews like 'thanks', because why can't you elaborate a little? :(

Edit: just wanted to add that I /never/ delete negative reviews (not that I have many, but still); I wear them like a badge of pride. I made someone care.

If women are only good for reproduction, then how come he is all miffed at women for alleged “plagiarism,” when is that just the very essence of reproduction? It's re-producing the same work 😂
