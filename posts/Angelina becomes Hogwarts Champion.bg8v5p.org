This may be a forlorn hope but I always wanted to read a fic where Angelina is the official Hogwarts champion, and how Gryffindor House would then react to Harry being chosen also. Anyone know if there are fics like that out there?


** I'm subscribed to [[/r/survivor][r/survivor]] and at first I thought this was about Angelina, the David vs. Goliath contestant. And.... Now I want to read HP / Survivor crossover fanfiction.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
