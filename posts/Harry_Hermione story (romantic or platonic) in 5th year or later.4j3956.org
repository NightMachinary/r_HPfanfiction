I, like so many others, ship HHr, but most stories either start the romance very early on (1st year or even pre-Hogwarts, which is just weird) or use the incredibly obvious opening of the yule ball to get them together.

So I was wondering if there are any good stories where they spend a lot of time in the 5th year or after (canon storyline or divergent, doesn't really matter).

As stated in the title it doesn't even have to be romantic, it can also be a sibling-like or best-friendship closeness, it's only important that they get closer and closer, and open up to each other a bit more.

Suggestions?

Complete. Post DH. Slightly AU but mostly canon compliant. Also one of my favourites. One of the best HHr wedding scenes I've ever read.

"Vox Corporis" by MissAnnThropic is a really good one. My favorite aspect of the story is the development of Harry and Hermione's relationship--I think the author really nailed it. It can be a bit slow at times, but the pacing is consistent and it's very well-written.

** Arguably the best series I ever read was a 3 part one that goes well into the future called The Paradigm of Uncertainty. I swear you could ignore the canon stories entirely except for the fact that they were best friends at hogwarts. The third book never finished but the author put a summary of what would have happened to wrap it up anyway. Seriously, if you want a story, Google this one. It's on Shnoogle. I can't tell you how much you won't be disappointed.
