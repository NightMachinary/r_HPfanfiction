** The Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs is a bit of a controversial series, but by the time I've read the entire thing through I've always cried at least three times. I've also cried at The-Boy-Who-Lived by Gatalicious, Just Bearable by jstrat01, and A Dreary Tale of Katelyn Potter by FenneHP.

Unfortunately, I can't directly link the first rec (goes against Reddit policy), but I'll link the others with the linkffn bot.

  What if when Voldemort heard the prophecy, he decided that not only would he go after Neville and Harry, but every child born in that year? What if he decided to kill all children born the year before and the year after as well, just to be on the safe side? Harry Potter is the only boy who lived through the Purge, no one knows why. How will a young Harry Potter now cope? No romance

  Just when fourth year couldn't get any worse, Harry must make revelations that could bring his entire world tumbling around his ears. With his friends being less than supportive, who will he turn to to make it through the toughest year of his life? Contains Mpreg. Abused!Harry. Severitus-ish. Contains mentions of rape and child abuse, but no details. Contains OC. I own nothing!

  Katelyn Potter, the 'Girl Who Lived', is miserable at Hogwarts. She's ignored, or despised and looked down on - so she decides to leave it all behind and join the only two people who ever loved her. However, her attempt to take her own life fails, and she's left to pick up the pieces. TW: Suicide attempt in 1st chapter. Mentions of abuse. !femharry

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417][Saving Harry]] by The Seeker

Summary: What if JKR had never intended the Harry Potter series to be for children? How would Harry's time at the Dursleys been written? This story focuses on the years Harry lived in the cupboard under the stairs at number four Privet Drive, as well as his first appearance at Hogwarts. The treatment he receives during his decade there is not described in fairy tale terms. The boy who initially develops is not the Harry Potter we know. The story is liberally AU, with different personality traits, events, and relationships used to reflect the changes in this very different Harry and the environment in which he grew up. In the end, through the assistance of a certain redheaded young lady, Harry ultimately finds the life he should have had and rediscovers the qualities he always had inside of him. While I am not a psychologist or child development expert, the symptoms, actions, and behaviors portrayed reflect the realities of child abuse. Appropriate disclosures will be contained in the Author's Notes above the chapter when warranted.

** Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7

WBWL, Slytherin Harry and very depressing. It's a bit hard to get through if you get emotionally tired easily, a lot of bad things happen to Harry so read if you want to go through that.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.
