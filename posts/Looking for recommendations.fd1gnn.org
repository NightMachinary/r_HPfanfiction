I'm looking for something similar to the fic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6099036/1/Caf%C3%A9][Café]]. I would prefer a fic with less sex. Sex scenes make me kinda uncomfortable but if a good fic has sex scenes I'm not opposed to reading it. I will just skip over the sex part like I did when I was reading café. Café made me kinda uncomputable with how it handed sex. I liked the idea of the fic, just not the execution. I'm looking for something that has Harry interacting with other creatures or maybe him running away over the summer. I'm even cool with something that's a crossover. Just no Twilight plz. I just want a good Harry fic. It's also cool if Harry keeps going to Hogwarts during the school year but avoids going to the Dursley's over the summer. Totally independent Harry is cool too.

I'm not trying to throw shade at the author of Café. If it comes across that way I'm sorry [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1348553/][Pleasedial123]], that was not my intention.
