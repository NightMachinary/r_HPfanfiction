I wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13280024/1/A-Curious-Thing][A Curious Thing]] last year and released it on ffnet and a03 and BOY OH BOY do I regret it! (I can't even say it was because I was young or in high school, I wrote the bloody thing last year). The first version is smutty for the sake of smut. It was decently well received but I got a review (from a guest so I can't reach out to them, unfortunately) that essentially called me out on being able to do better. It was the most invigorated I've ever felt about my writing!

I spent the last year doing rewrites and added about 20,000 words. I would love some feedback/critique on how they differ and how I can further improve my writing. I'm currently working on a longer fic and I don't want to repeat the same mistakes I made with the first fic.

In the wise words of wisdom from Michael Gary Scott: "I do some of my best work when no one believes in me." If you have the time, please hit me with hard-hitting, constructive critiques. I will send you a personalized thank you PM for your reviews (very enticing, I know)! I was very creative with the new title: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13518508/1/A-Curious-Thing-Update][A Curious Thing (Update)]]
