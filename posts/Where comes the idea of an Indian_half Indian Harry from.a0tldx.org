At first I thought the author added that for the plot. But until then I came across many more stories with a Harry with Indian heritage.

And I'm wondering where it came from, Potter isn't a name that you think originates from India.


** I'm so confused...

I've never seen a story where Harry is Indian, or half Indian.

The others I can't recall without checking my history at home later. But there was one where the Dursleys where extra mean because of his darker skin colour.

And the one where Harry travels to an alternative reality where his parents are alive and Voldemort was defeated in the first war. That was the first I read, his heritage was involved in the plot.

There were others, but I don't believe I'll can find them all. Sometimes I figured it out way into the story, because it was mentioned somewhat at the side.

*** The fandom is considerably factionalized, and the factions have local tropes which you are unlikely to encounter unless you read an author whose heritage is from that faction.

The main division is the primarily male DLP-adjacents vs the primarily female AO3-adjacents, but there are lots of others which are more or less legible. For example, the "severitus challenge" spawned a whole bunch of fics which may or may not include various elements of the original prompt. And before the rise of fanfiction.net, Harry/Ginny vs Harry/Hermione shipping wars were a Real Big Deal, and a lot of fics were posted on ship-specific communities with draconian rules and petit-dictator "moderators".

Indian!Harry seems to be from a Tumblr-influenced subfaction of the AO3 side. (I think I may have actually seen the original post arguing for it on Tumblr, a long time ago.) Tumblr ideology holds that non-white characters are superior to white characters, and if you can race-bend an existing white or presumptively-white character, that's all the better.

** Because the British Empire ruled India for a really, /really/ long time, and I'd be amazed if the magical world wasn't somehow part of that peak imperial thing.

They ruled about half the planet at one stage. What might that have meant? There are loads of really interesting possibilities.

Personally, a headcanon I often use is that Fleamont Potter (James Potter's father) met his wife in Singapore. Her name before her marriage was Euphemia Lau. It lets me make the wizarding world feel a bit bigger if I can draw from parts of it we've never seen.

*** I always see people insist any non-English ancestry absolutely had to come from Harry's paternal grandparent's side and it really frustrates me because the most common argument for writing Harry as only white comes from people who say "Potter isn't an Indian/Arabian/African/etc name". It's like people completely forget that he has /two/ grandparents on his Dad's side, one of whom gave up her maiden name when she married. There's a lot of opportunity there to change his ancestry while letting him remain a Potter.

As for making him specifically Indian: there's loads recorded immigration to the UK by Indian people since they first colonized the area, and it actually increased after WW1 and WW2, right around the time that his grandparents' generation would be attending Hogwarts. There's plenty of interesting historical evidence to play with when making a backstory for his family without recycling the same ideas over and over.

Frix said: "it's not outside the realm of possibility for harry to be non-white; other stories have gone so far as to make him non-human."

They're saying that changing the skin tone of the character (assuming HP is canonically white) is not as major a change. But - /assuming he's canonically white -/ it is still a change. Frix isn't even giving their opinion on whether or not it's a good change, you're just taking the observation itself as confirmation that Frix thinks it's bad.

It's not even unreasonable to assume that he's canonically white. JK Rowling herself picked out Daniel Radcliffe to play HP; you can't really argue against the fact that he has pale skin.

****** I don't recall anywhere in the books where JKR specifically said Harry was white, so this is a rather ironic argument.

We all know the reason people make Harry Indian or Hermione black is because they want to see characters like themselves. And maybe the books don't 100% support that, but who cares? It's not hurting anyone, and if it helps someone find representation in a series and genre that's rather devoid of it, cool.

Fanfiction and headcanons don't need to make perfect sense alongside canon. If you don't like the changes a specific fanfic/headcanon made, dont read it. That's kinda the cardinal rule of fanfic, and I think it's been somewhat forgotten in recent years.

No disrespect towards those who like it, but I can't jump on that bandwagon at all.

*** Plays have POC play different roles all the time; it's not unusual for there to be Black, East Asian, Latino, etc. Shakespeare characters, among others. The authors intent doesn't mean people can't re imagine.

I don't get why it bothers people to simply race bend characters, especially in things like HP where race isn't a defining part of their character, By defining, I mean something like Black Panther, the Godfather (they have to be Italian), or Elektra (where her Greek heritage is a huge part of her character, but even in the TV series they have her played by a woman who is half French/half Cambodian). There's so little diversity in literature, why not play around with HP? As a WOC myself, I like imaging characters to be more like me or my city. Black Hermione adds even more depth, as the muggleborns are oppressed and she has to deal with being a minority both in the wizarding world and the real world.

But that doesn't mean you can't add them now. In fact, you have to.

**** Yes they are, and they have Indian sounding names too! That was kind of my point, if Harry was meant to be an Indian character, wouldn't his name reflect that?

** I thought it was just an AO3 quirk, like the over-representation of slash.

EDIT: Not saying that we can rule it out or anything, since the books didn't protray any racism towards the Patil sisters, Dean Thomas or Angelina Johnson and Kingsley Shacklebolt was a member of the Sacred 28, along with the very foreign sounding Shafiq.

** Both Harry and Hermione are described as "white-faced" in the books, so they're definitely on the fairer side of skin tones. Regardless, it's entirely possible they have other, non-European heritage (if you count Euphemia as James' mother, which I don't; I use Dorea Euphemia Black). Skin tone is a hard thing to predict for people of mixed race.

Side note: we need more stories about Fred 2 and his sister Roxanne. They're the only two characters we know for certain /are/ of mixed-race, and I bet they have a hard time in a family like the Weasleys.

*** Yes, sometimes I think people forget that POC can sometimes be very fair and/or have light hair/eyes (some Persians, Parsi Indians, some Afghanis, etc.), too, or that 'white' people can come from regions due to ancient migration where non-white people are dominate (Circassians, Greeks, and Armenians in Turkey, Syria, etc.). Amazigh people, for example, often have light eyes and can have a range of skin tones but generally wouldn't be considered 'white' in the United States and/or the UK becasue of the region from which they originate.

I have dark skin, and light eyes/hair and white people are often puzzled by it and I've had people ask me how do I get my hair color to look so natural/why do my roots never show (to which I often reply, it looks natural because the color is natural and no roots grow out cause this is my damn hair). Malcolm X very famously had red hair; Rebecca Hall's mother is clearly Black (mixed race) and yet Rebecca looks like a white woman; Alexa Chung looks white for the most part, but her dad is either Chinese or 3/4 Chinese. A lot of people of mixed East Asian descent can look or pas for white, too.

A good example would be the Evans family in HP. There are a fair amount of Welsh people, or people of mixed Welsh descent in Argentina, but also Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil due to immigration in the 1800s. Quite a few went back to Wales for work or escape the dirty wars. It'd be perfectly possibly to write Lily and Petunia as white Latinas, or mestizo Latinas, and that could be mined for Petunia's desire to seem 'normal' and blend in in fan fic stories.

**** Don't forget Meghan Markle, new wife to Prince Harry :)

I didn't even know her mother was black until I saw a photo. To be honest, I didn't even notice that Meghan Markle had tanner skin than most people in the British Royal family. But maybe that's because I have half-black cousins, and my cousin has adorable half-Latino children, so it doesn't really occur to me to make a big deal about skin color.

*** Why would they have a hard time among the Weasleys?

They might have some troubles in society in general, because sometimes people are dickheads, but if there's one thing you could say about the Weasleys it's that they have a huge capacity to love anyone they see as their own.

**** Just because the family is accepting doesn't mean Fred and Roxanne wouldn't feel out of place among them. I come from a large family of predominantly white people. Despite our best efforts, my two half-black cousins still have some insecurities crop up from time-to-time. It was especially evident at a recent wedding, when someone refused to believe that I, a person who is the definition of white, could ever be related to a person with such dark skin. For the rest of the day my cousin refused to be a part of family photos.

***** True.

But if anyone can make a child feel included in the family, it's Molly. For all her faults and flaws, she would set herself /on fire/ before she let a situation where someone caused her grandchildren pain stand unchallenged.

** I don't mind if an author interprets the race of any character that isn't 100% told what their skin color/ race is.

I just won't read the story.

Personally, Lavender, Harry, Hermione, and a few other ambigious characters are European White in my mind.
