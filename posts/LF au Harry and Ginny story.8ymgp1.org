I read this story about a few months back and now I can't find it. Basically harry was being trained as a soldier and raised by Sirius and defeated Voldemort, but he doesn't know how to be a person, only a soldier. I think he was a dragon animagus as well sorry if thats much to go on.


** Maybe this one. Fits pretty well. Can't remember if Harry was an dragon animagus though. linkffn(2559745)

*** Yes. Its probably the best part of that story, along with a handful of notably entertaining points.
