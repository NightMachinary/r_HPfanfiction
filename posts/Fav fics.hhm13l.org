What's your favorite MOD fics? Can be crossovers, one shots, or series. I really enjoy the concept and would like to read more!


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1358209/chapters/2836213][Master of Death]] has Harry choose to travel to a parallel dimension in King's Cross. It's incomplete but doesn't end in a hanging way.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6122017][Outsiders and Other Eldritch Entities]] has the OotP of a different universe summon Harry the MOD to defeat Voldemort.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255/chapters/2292768][Whispers in Corners]] is a HP/Sherlock crossover where Harry uses his MOD powers to make money as a medium. I didn't even watch Sherlock but I really enjoyed it.

*** I'm super interested in the third! I think I've read the second, if it's the one where he meets his mother in that universe. I may have read the first bi t I'm going to check it out anyway!

**** In the second one, he's summoned to a dimension where he never existed but James and Lily have a daughter called Abigail instead. They were very wary of Harry at first and only at the end does he reveal his real identity.

Hope you like them!

***** Hey on the sherlock crossover, is he super old/immortal or something to that effect? I got confused because he doesn't have birth records in the story and there's no mention of his friends yet

****** It's kind of complicated. Do you want me to spoil it? They explain it in the story in Chapter 8.

  When Harry finally accepted the fact that he had stopped aging, ten years had passed and he knew it was time to leave. AU.

** Linkffn(Brother in Arms by SteamGeek01) It's a creepypasta crossover but it's got 93 chapters of good writing and characters.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Underground's Savior) Another crossover but it's pretty amazing. It's also a series :D

I'd list more but I'm tired so I'll do it tomorrow.
