Like Harry in linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) who fights demons and shit, or Tom in linkffn(The Imposter Complex) who uses a magic railgun to assassinate a dark lord. I just want to see some cool shit go down.

  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

** Harry in this one, fights demons, meets gods, visits lots of cool places, and learns of and interacts with some very interesting characters. He's also quite powerful without being overpowering, his fights are always very entertaining and this one has one of the coolest Albus Dumbledore I have ever seen.

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, Real Magic, & The TWT in a way you have never seen.

Also got lasers, magic chemistry, programming a Marauders Map v2, spellcrafting, and publishing academic papers about everything!

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy

** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

So, Malfoy's hosting a Death Eater recruitment ball? Plastic explosives are easily duplicated, so let's blow it up! Brutal war with plenty of cool explosions.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Harry and Ron are aurors, catching escaped Death Eaters and trying to figure out who the mysterious thieves are. Meanwhile Hermione and Sirius do politics to reduce corruption, and on occasion they break into the manors of their political opponents and steal everything they can. Every heist a new challenge, a new strategy, a new action scene.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
