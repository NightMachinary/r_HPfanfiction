And what, some may ask, about the times she was seen in public? Why that was Sybil Trelawney of course. Just helping out her cousins at the Quibbler.


** honestly would totally read the fic of this, already have read ones were Luna is Rita's favorite niece, being the sister of Luna's mother of course. not much of a jump for Rita to be a pseudonym of Luna.
