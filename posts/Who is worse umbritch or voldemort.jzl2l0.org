I know many people hate umbritch more than voldy, why do you think that? I want to know what you think.


** Objectively... Voldemort is worse, that shouldn't be argued (unless you are an idiot).

Subjectively... I think Umbridge is the most successful villain Rowling wrote in the series. She is genuinely evil and attacks Harry (and to a lesser extent, the rest of the class) on a personal level. In OotP she has a much greater presence than Voldemort and is a far more active, menacing and overbearing antagonist who somehow manages to effect Harry far more effectively than he does (e.g: Quidditch ban and 'I must not tell lies').

She does more to establish herself as a genuinely menacing and effective villain in one book than Voldemort does in the entire series. Mostly (to me) because it both feels like she's /actually/ going to do something to Harry and it will /actually/ work.

And if you want further proof that Umbridge is the better antagonist of the series than Voldemort... look at the title of this post. How often do you see "Umbitch" as opposed to any slur on Voldie's name? Voldemort is just there for most readers but people actively HATE Umbridge, and the former is the guy who killed Harry's parents and is the */MAIN VILLAIN/*

Case Closed

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

** Umbridge is written as more hatable. Voldemort is like a goal a bad guy who you will eventually have to beat who causes complications. But Voldemort most of the time isn't actively doing things to make Harry miserable on a daily basis. Umbridge is. So her actions are going to be so much more frustrating to a reader than Voldemort.

And its the way they are awful. Umbridge feels more real. You know a Umbridge equivalent in your day to say life. And you probably hate them. But you probably don't know a Voldemort equivalent.

** Voldemort is evil, but it's not personal. Sure, he used a message of blood purity to gather his followers, but I don't think he cares too much about it himself. He really only hates and attacks people because they oppose him.

Umbridge's evil, on the other hand, is much more personal. She hates people purely because of what they are and what they believe.

Voldemort is easy to understand, and you can kind of respect his power, cunning, practicality, etc. Umbridge is just sadistic, and her only vaguely redeeming quality is her fondness for cats.

Finally, Voldemort at least has a tragic backstory. It doesn't excuse his actions, but realizing that he was ultimately a product of a bad environment makes slightly more of a tragic character. Umbridge doesn't have anything like that, which makes it seem like she's just evil without any reason beyond being a terrible person.

** I think because Umbridge hits closer to home for a lot more people than Voldemort. Everyone had that teacher who made your life miserable or a person in general. Voldemort only came around to kill Harry, not vilify him in the eyes of his peers, or make a whole nation of wizards think he was crazy.

** Umbridge was a more personal threat, which for the people affected is worse. While Voldemort was a national threat like the IRA was. So it's important but for most people it's a very abstract thing.

*** Voldemort himself wasn't that big of a threat. Sure, he could kill you. But his followers are where the threat was. Their actions gave Voldemort more power. Voldemort would go "I want X" and then his followers sit down and have a roundtable discussion and make it so. Lucius would whisper into the Minister's ear. Other followers were in the aurors or wizengamot. Or the floo authority.

Umbridge, not even a follower of Voldemort effectively set up the stage for Voldemort and rolled out the red carpet for him.

Hell, her legislation and actions alone have lead to enough death and suffering to make her at least #3 most lethal character. Werewolf legislation? Oh, Voldemort has the Werewolves now. Muggleborn Legislation act? Oh, now every person killed in those camps or the snatchers have done it on her orders and say so.

**** Voldemort was the big threat because he was the face and the titan of the Death Eaters. If he wasn't there the death eaters would have been more easily dealt with in the first war. But as it stood, the only wizard strong enough to stand against him was Dumbledore. Everyone else needed to fight to escape.

** I said it in a comment reply. But Umbridge was at least the third most lethal character in the series. Grindelwald takes the #1 for being an international Dark Lord. And it's honestly a tossup between Umbridge or Voldemort for #2 since they played off each other so well. Umbridge was no Death Eater, but she sure helped Voldemort along just fine. And her actions and legislation have more far reaching consequences than what Voldemort ever did. He just killed or tortured you. Umbridge? She effectively tore the country apart and killed thousands of people with her Muggleborn registration act which enabled the Snatchers to work.

She's the hidden Dark Lady of the books.

** Voldemort is kind of scary-evil. It's a guy shanking you from behind in a dark alleyway when you go back home at night. Something evil, but the kind of evil to be scared of, not one to actively hate - you can't hate something you're afraid of. Think Hitler, or something along those lines. Ultimate evil, one beyond your ability to reach, yet one that can come and do anything to you without justification.

Umbridge is not that kind of evil. She's a condescending, petty bitch, the kind of a person that makes you want to commit violent acts when you interact with them. Think along the lines of politician from <political option you deeply disagree with> that you know will inconvenience you, and you disagree with them, but can't do shit because they're the ones in positions of power and violence against others is a no-no.

** Voldemort is an existential threat to most magicals. He is a fascist, a magical nazi (or he at least pays lip service to his anti Muggle stance to get support from that faction). Best case scenario, if he won you get something like a magical version of North Korea. The worst case would be genocide.

Umbridge seems worse because she is Lawful Evil. She works within and with the support of the System. Most people hate Umbridge more than Voldemort because most of us has experienced an Umbridge in their lives. She is a petty tyrant who uses whatever power she has access to to get her way.

Objectively speaking Voldemort is unquestionably worse than Umbridge in basically every way. However it's likely that Umbridge could do at least as much damage has Voldemort could do.

After all, being a dark lord doesn't seem to be a long term position of authority. Eventually someone will off them, which ultimately should limit the overall scope of damage that they are able to do.

Umbridge on the other hand works with the system, eventually getting into a position where she can affect legislation. Making it legal to be, at least to begin with, anti human. Eventually those non humans will get sick of how they're treated. Except they would be fighting against magical humans as a whole, not a specific faction of them as in the case with a dark lord and their followers.

tldr Voldemort is objectively worse and his and any other dark lord present an immediate and comparatively short term existential threat.

Umbridge is a type of evil most of us have actually experienced with her threat being more long term.
