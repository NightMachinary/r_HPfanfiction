Basically, Sirius saved her from the brothel, she gets sorted into Slytherin, I think she has a brother (maybe named Harry). She was a Triwizard "junior-champion", and in cos she let one of the Weasley twins (the one that wasn't petrified) live in the Slytherin common rooms.

***** It's not so much weird as it contains maybe three characters from beginning to end that aren't at least morally compromised if not outright evil. It's a brilliantly built and realised world, in which is told a compelling story, but you have to catch yourself on regular when you realise what utterly repugnant individuals you're starting to feel sympathy for.
