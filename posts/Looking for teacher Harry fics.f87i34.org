Specifically fics where he becomes a teacher while still a student (accidentally or intentionally). Anything with him as a teacher though is welcome


** If I remember correctly, he becomes an assistant runes professor while still at Hogwarts in linkao3(3390668).

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

*** He isn't given a lot of choice about it either. Teacher spots he's good at it, more or less conscripts him. It's kind of adorable.

I do wish cywscross would go back to that story, it was all kinds of fun.
