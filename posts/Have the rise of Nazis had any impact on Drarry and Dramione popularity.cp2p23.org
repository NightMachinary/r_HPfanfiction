I started getting into HPFF since 2016 and have a visceral disgusted reaction when I see that Drarry and Dramione fics exist.

It occurred to me today that my reaction might be less strong if I didn't have an emotional response to people fraternizing with Nazis and I probably wouldn't have such a response before things like Charlottesville happened and Nazis moved from history books to newspapers in my mind, and most fics were written prior to that.

Have any of you noticed a change in those fandoms since 2016?


** As someone who's about as ideologically opposed to nazis as it's possible to be.. this is a bad comparison and it always annoys me when people make it. At most Draco and the other children of Death Eaters are comparable to Hitler Youth. They're brainwashed children. Draco in particular is forced to work for Voldemort while his family is held hostage. Was it the moral thing to do? No, but it was an understandable and very human thing to do. And, again, he was a /child/.

All of the Drarry or Dramione stories I've read has involved some form of redemption arc for Draco or were completely AU. I don't think I've ready any that were started after 2016, but I don't see how it would make much difference.

*** Yes but the problem still remains. Draco is an irredeemable little shit for 90% of the series. However, if the fic is AU and contains one of these pairings I have nothing against it and may still read it.

***** No, I most certainly am not saying that his character couldn't change. What I am saying is that he had done so much wrong and harmed so many people, largely through bullying the muggleborn populace of Hogwarts. So sure, he could become a better person (as he does in so many if these fics) but that alone wouldn't redeem him or make right what he had done wrong and fix the damage he had caused.

***** There are certain things that stem from being raised a certain way. There are other things that you just genuinely have to be a bad person to say. Take the end of GoF, for example:

#+begin_quote
  "Too late now, Potter! They'll be the first to go, now the Dark Lord's back! Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers first! Well - second - Diggory was the f-"
#+end_quote

I can understand that he was raised to hate muggles and muggleborns, but to raise the point of Cedric's death only a few days after it happened, in a way like that, takes a bad person, not just someone raised badly. If your morals are that bad at age 15, when most people have an at least somewhat mature outlook on the world, then you will never be a good person.

Sorry, but Draco is completely irredeemable.

****** At that point, he hasn't actually /done/ anything. Sure, after the amulet and the vanishing cabinet, he's pretty much irredeemable without a massive redemption arc featuring actual remorse and atonement, but at the point you mentioned?

Sure, he's a massive asshole, but a change in ways is always possible as long as all you've done is talk.

*** I agree. Draco is such a great character for fan fic. He's young and we saw his struggle in the last two books. He's also smart and while he's a piece of shit a lot in the books it's always as an entitled spoiled brat racist thing. It's clearly what he was taught and learned growing up in a racist household. He wasn't born that way - he was brought up that way. Which is why redemption fics are great. It would be a sad world if we didn't believe people could change. If we didn't believe that racism could be untaught.

**** Jkr did a really bad job trying to redeem him imo. Voldemort turned on his family before he really got involved, so the easiest interpretation of his character is realizing he's fucked whoever wins and tries to jump ship out of self interest. There's never a sign of him engaging with the idea that muggleborns are just as good as he is, no apology, no real firm commitment to the good guys that he couldn't have wriggled out of if Voldemort won. The epilogue implies he must have been redeemed sometime over the next 19 years but we don't have any means of seeing how that might have happened.

***** First of all you don't know me. So you don't know my mothers side is Jewish and that her family was persecuted in Russia and then in Germany. That I grew up with stories of the holocaust. You also don't know that I am Hispanic from my father's side.So as someone who has grown up as a Hispanic Jewish woman I can tell you right now that when someone does say something like this and when I have been assaulted and scared I do know that it's because it's what they are taught. And I feel sorry for them and that they have been brought up in a hateful environment while I grew up in one that taught kindness and compassion. If I hated every person who ever wronged me I would live my life hating people. People are not born evil, people are made evil. And I believe whole heartedly that people have the ability to change. So don't tell me I wouldn't apply this standard because I have and I do. I can stand my ground and be proud of my heritage and not go so low as to think people are not redeemable.

***** Also, Draco spent 10 out 12 months every year at Hogwarts from the age if 11 on. Surrounded by muggleborns and people like Dumbledore. He wasn't isolated and bereft of alternatives to bigotry and Death Eater ideology - he stuck with them despite the circumstances.

*** The Charlottesville marchers are also brainwashed children. Lucius was also a brainwashed child and if Voldemort had won or even if he never existed Draco would have ended up just like him. The point is, in canon, being sympathetic to a clear Nazi analagous cause is virtually his only character trait.

There is nothing sympathetic about real world spoiled rich racist brats and that is definitely a category in my mind much more now than it was four years ago.

** It's fanfiction, and people want to read what we want to see. We /want/ for bad people to be redeemable instead of heartless monsters. And there's something compelling in a character like Draco. Someone so privileged and ignorantly hateful, he mirrors the kind of mindless bigotry we see from people irl (they don't even need to be actual nazis) every single day. Yet we get to see, even from Harry's admittedly biased view, that you can still be a shitty person in some ways without necessarily being evil overall. We see that his beliefs get tested /really/ hard when he sees the brutality and evil involved in actually carrying out and acting on his sides ideology. He mirrors the average bigot like him that is super racist in the way that they “really don't like [insert cultural group here]” but don't want to /actually/ kill them or see them dead because “woah, isn't that a bit extreme?” That make sense? So in that way, he's someone we could have met irl, someone we probably have met. Someone we see as redeemable. You can do shitty horrible things under duress, should you suffer consequences for it? Absolutely, but do you deserve as harsh as a punishment as the one who did it willingly, gladly? No. I don't think so. Because we are literally genetically programmed for survival. It's much easier to die for someone you know and care about, (or do something awful to ensure the lives of those you love), than to die for a stranger or some cause you don't really believe in anymore.

And seeing those bits of humanity shine through, I think is like fodder for fanfic authors who want to see “what if”. What if, he was separated from his family hateful ideology early on? What if he learned to question his beliefs and actually thought for himself while he still had the chance? What if he never had to follow in his father's footsteps, because he was shown a better way?

Fanfic is all about what people wish they could've seen in canon. And people want to believe that not all Slytherin are evil, because no child is born evil. Draco also happens to be the most well-known Slytherin character, so he gets written about the most. It's that simple.

*** Another thing that makes Draco interesting to fanfiction author is that Draco is the most well-off within the main character. We know he's pureblood, rich, and (according to the movie) good looking. He's basically the dream boyfriend of a teenage girls (and some boys). Because who want to read or write the redemption story of the poor and ugly Mundungus Fletcher or the boring and poor Percy Weasley?

We can't deny that most fanfiction is a wish fulfillment in one form or another. Draco already has a soon-to-be redemption plot, an interesting backstory, and a dream background. It's not hard for a teenage girl to write a story based on that. Of course you get an amazing story once in a while. This is also why Sirius-centric story is popular in the Marauders era. Draco and Sirius are similar, their difference is Sirius gets his redemption early on his school year while Draco's only started at his sixth year.

We get less Draco centric fanfiction nowadays because most of the teenage girls that write Draco centric fanfiction in the early days grow up. They either stop writing fanfiction, move to write on another fandom, or move to a more sympathetic character because they realize there is more to Harry Potter than the classic prince of Slytherin.

** You're getting a lot of hate for this (I think unnecessarily so) but I agree with you that these pairings should exist in canon compliant or canon divergent fics, only AU fics. Whilst people may object to Draco being compared to a NAZI, no one should be able to deny that he was still a horrible and largely irredeemable person for 95% of the series. I find this pairings disgusting and unrealistic outside of AU.

*** Well the Death Eaters are kinda comparable to Nazis. The death eaters are proud of their pureblood heritage, the nazis were proud of their aryan heritage. The death eaters looked down on (and killed/tortured) those of muggle heritage, the nazis looked down (and killed/tortured) those of Jewish heritage. Voldemort is not a pureblood, Hitler was not an aryan.

*** The Hitler youth were absolutely Nazis and saying the death eater : Nazi comparison is questionable is bizarre and obviously incorrect. It's almost explicit in canon and is explicit in interviews.

I actually did read a good Drarry fic because I didn't pay attention to the tags. It involved Draco being tortured pretty horribly and I admit I might have dropped it if it were any other character receiving that treatment. Do a lot of Draco pairings have him getting punished properly?
