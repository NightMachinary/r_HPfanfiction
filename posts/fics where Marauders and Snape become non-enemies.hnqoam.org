looking for fics in the marauder's era or first war, where the marauders become friends, or at least make peace with Snape. and then maybe conquer the evil together (if it's in the first war). if it's in their school years, then just becoming friends over something.

Please no pathetic Snape and/or too evil marauders.

it can be time travel, however, if so, they need to be already enemies, so no first year Snape getting sorted in Gryffindor. I just like, in fiction, when bullies become friends with bullied. idk why, I'm just weird.

it needs to have a happy ending, or at least happy-ish. therefore, it can't be the canon marauder ending, as in, James and Lily death, with Sirius in Azkaban etc.

I'm ok with pairing Snape/Sirius, Lupin/Snape, wolfstar, James/Sirius, even James/Snape (... maybe), but please, no harem. there are fics with Snape being their ... lover, and it being an orgy. not what I want. I would prefer no romance at all, but if it's at side or if the lot becoming non-enemies is still more important than the relationship, that's fine. canon Lily/James is ok, but if the story is not about them. a lot of Snape/XXX fics end with the lot being ok with each other, but it's just like, the last chapter so... nope.

I think the closest thing I can think of is A storm across time linkao3(12576408). it is Snarry (time travel), but the relationship between the marauders and Snape has enough of the plot that it fits.

I love Snape's character (not saying he is a good person, lol), so a lot of him would be great. saving Regulus has plus points. and Regulus and Sirius bros. A storm across time really fits everything...

** *Reboot* - linkffn(9552519)Modified Reptillia28 challenge.\\
Harry, Hermione, and Snape go back. The first half of the fic is Snape, he went back to his pre-Hogwarts age. Changed things a lot. Went to Ravenclaw. Ended up a secret marauder.

There are fixed points in time (Halloween '81, the prophecy,etc), but Snape changes a lot of the timeline. Like no Vernon Dursley. Or Dudley. Hell, when Harry/Hermione wake up, everything is different.

#+begin_quote
  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

** I think linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) ticks pretty much all your boxes.

#+begin_quote
  in the marauder's era or first war,
#+end_quote

Check. After Snape's canonical death, he's offered a chance to go back to sixth year (after his breakup with Lily) and try again.

#+begin_quote
  where the marauders become friends, or at least make peace with Snape. and then maybe conquer the evil together (if it's in the first war). if it's in their school years, then just becoming friends over something.
#+end_quote

Check. It's a slow process, but they do eventually set aside hostilities. Severus and James are tentatively on first-name terms as of recent chapters, and are working together in the Order of the Phoenix; James is also his teaching assistant.

#+begin_quote
  Please no pathetic Snape and/or too evil marauders.
#+end_quote

Check. Severus isn't pathetic at all; he has decades of experience in magic and espionage. And the Marauders actually extend the olive branch first (several times; they're quicker to forgive than Severus is).

#+begin_quote
  it can be time travel, however, if so, they need to be already enemies, so no first year Snape getting sorted in Gryffindor.
#+end_quote

Check. They have a lot of nasty history by sixth year.

#+begin_quote
  it needs to have a happy ending, or at least happy-ish. therefore, it can't be the canon marauder ending, as in, James and Lily death, with Sirius in Azkaban etc.
#+end_quote

Mostly check. It's regularly updating (the author has drafts several months in advance), but not finished yet. However, based on the story's arc, it's clearly headed for a happy ending of some sort, and Severus has already found greater peace and happiness in life than he's ever had before, albeit with difficulties along the way. He and Lily are happily married, as are James and Marlene.

#+begin_quote
  I'm ok with pairing Snape/Sirius, Lupin/Snape, wolfstar, James/Sirius, even James/Snape (... maybe), but please, no harem. there are fics with Snape being their ... lover, and it being an orgy. not what I want. I would prefer no romance at all, but if it's at side or if the lot becoming non-enemies is still more important than the relationship, that's fine.
#+end_quote

Is Severus/Lily romance ok? There's quite a bit of that. But definitely none between Severus and the Marauders. He eventually grows to /tolerate/ them. Eventually. No way there's any romance brewing. Quite apart from the fact that he has had exactly one love interest, Lily, in his two lives; that hasn't changed.

#+begin_quote
  I love Snape's character (not saying he is a good person, lol), so a lot of him would be great.
#+end_quote

Check. Getting inside his head is the biggest part of the plot, with Lily's point of view being the second.

#+begin_quote
  saving Regulus has plus points.
#+end_quote

Check. Severus' increased influence within Slytherin House, and his avowed split with the Death Eaters, results in Regulus approaching him after the locket is placed, instead of just charging off by himself.

#+begin_quote
  and Regulus and Sirius bros.
#+end_quote

Ok, it doesn't really have this. Sirius is present but is slower to warm to Severus than the other Marauders are, so we don't see a lot of his point of view once they stop actively hexing each other.

#+begin_quote
  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

But downvoting the bot? It was just doing its job!
