#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter and Tom Riddle have a lot in common. Both of them are Half-bloods raised by abusive muggles. Both of them are Parselmouths. Both are sorted into the house of snakes. What sets them apart is that one had friends, true, loyal friends, and the other did not. The story of a cold and calculating Harry. Slytherin!Harry. Grey!Harry. OC is the son of Sirius. No slash
