Ok so I read this quite some time ago and I remember that Ron was sorted in Slytherin and he was a chess genius who entered competition and his mentor was Daphne's dad? If anyone knows I'd really be thankful if you can link it here.


** There are two I kinda mix up, but this sounds like Linkffn(red knight). If not, probably linkffn(fate)

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.
