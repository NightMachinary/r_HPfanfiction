Hi, I've been trying to locate the fic: Watching Me by Avirati. So far I can only find it hosted on checkmated and thebroomcupboard - both of which are websites that require registration approval, but seem to have been abandoned by the mods. Anyone know of another source or can someone with an account send me the story? My current SO has been searching through all her old account infos trying to get this story that she had been obsessed with years ago, I thought reddit might be able to help us out :)


** PMs on the way with the text. Hope it was everything she remembered.

** Hello, sounds like you found the fic, but as the author, I would have sent it to you had I seen this sooner. :) I found this post just from random Googling to see if anyone referenced it.

And just wanted to say "thank you!" to your SO for not only actually remembering a fic I wrote so long ago, but apparently liking it a lot. :)

That was a long time ago in my "Harry Potter" obsession phase... sad that it's only available on semi-dead sites. I should probably upload it to ff.net, since they seem to take NSFW fics these days.

Interesting that someone translated it...

** Sorry, but the close that I could get was this fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3150143/1/Vi%C3%A9ndome][Vi√©ndome]], in the reviews one person said "it is a good translation but the author should give the credits to the real fanfic, Watching Me by Avirati"

I didn't read this fanfic, so I can't said if it really is a translation, and it has 7 chapters and it is not marked as complete. Probably the author stopped after being discovered. Hope you can find it.
