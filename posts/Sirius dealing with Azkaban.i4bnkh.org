I would really appreciate any story that shows Sirius actually addressing his mental health and getting better after Azkaban. Most of the time his wellbeing is ignored because of the war and I would really love to see him happy. I don't mind if it's an AU and he runs away sooner or he gets rescued by someone else.


** He gets the professional help he needs here:

*** I adore his characterisation here, especially the inner turmoil he's facing; it really makes you think about his wasted potential.

  AU. In an institute to help children with mental and psychological problems, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.
