With the treaty of Maastricht and the Single European Act, the EU common market started on January 1, 1993. Given the complicated relationship between magical and nonmagical government, it's quite possible that this impacted international trade in magical Europe too, with magical governments probably being a bit underprepared. Given this context, it's quite possible that free trade across Europe caused some issues with dangerously badly made goods entering the market.

So it makes perfect sense for Percy Weasley, working in international magical cooperation, to be dealing with international standards for cauldron bottom thickness in 1994. A bit late to the party since at that point EU wide free trade had already been around for one and a half years.


** I have an irrational fondness for Percy. He's not the most likable character in canon, but I feel like it's because we don't get to know him enough. But also I have done the exact same thing he did in that scene. Prattling on about some subject that I find fascinating only to watch the person's eyes glaze over with boredom. I've always understood why he was passionate about it. It's his job, he's excited, it is an important safety issue, but he really should've realized no one else would care. The poor little dork.

*** I don't know if I would agree w/ your last point. I think canon-Percy /does/ realize that no one else cares; he's just---rightfully---aggrieved and irritated that no one in his family seems to appreciate that he's working on an important issue that affects a large number of people. What's come to being one of my big pet peeves in /Harry Potter/ fanfiction are those "Percy, [having taken]/taking a level in self-awareness, realizes how /boring/ cauldron bottoms are and shuts up about them"-type moments, especially when they're treated as some sort of character defining/affirming moment.

**** I want to see a moment where harry takes an interest in metallurgy/potions or something and happily talks to Percy for hours about cauldron bottom thickness.

That being said I accidentally got captured by the quality guy from a powdered metal factory at a career fair for a whole hour and couldn't tactfully escape. So I see both sides.

***** I'm not sure if cauldron bottom thickness is really that much of a defining trait for Percy. It was his project at a certain point in time, and he's passionate about the work, but I suspect after the regulation gets passed he'd move on to a different policy issue. If anything, Percy's character traits should be that he's passionate about his job and wants to make the world a better place with diplomatic means because that's what he's good at. It seems a bit disrespectful to reduce that to "obsessed with cauldron bottoms" just because that was one of his successes.

**** Any Muggle counterpart of Percy would be thrilled to be doing his job too.

He's a diplomat. A minor one, given how young he is, but still. The Foreign Office (State Department for you Americans!) is one of the most competitive, highly sought after civil service roles there is in a Muggle context, and he's slotted in as an assistant to the boss /straight out of school/.

That's genuinely impressive. Percy's done brilliantly well for himself...and no one seems to value it.

***** Now that I think of it, it's kind of odd that the position that Barty Crouch Sr is shunted off to in disgrace is Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation. I know it's not the same thing as "demoting" the Attorney General to Secretary of State (I guess for the UK it'd be Justice Secretary to Foreign Secretary?---I don't know UK government positions nearly as well as US ones), but still.

I wonder if that's why ^{⟨spoilers for summer of Year 3 of The Sinister Man's} /^{Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin}/^{, ie} /^{Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace}/^{⟩} The Sinister Man decided to deviate f/ canon regarding Barty Crouch Sr's fall f/ grace the way that he did, reframing the post of Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation as a political concession f/ a newly-elected longshot-candidate "considered green, but at least better than the authoritarian-ish guy whose son turned out to be a Death Eater" Minister of Magic Fudge to his considered-more-experienced opponent.

**** I can see that as well, and he certainly had a right to be annoyed at the way they acted about his new job. They should've been pleased he was trying to do what he could to make their world a better place, but instead they treated him like a traitor.

And I know exactly what you mean about the way some authors treat him as having some kind of revelation about it. That drives me mad as well. Whether he knew that they didn't care, or was oblivious to the fact they were uninterested, he didn't need to change that part of himself to be likable.

Exactly. It was boring to his family, but he was /right/; many people could be hurt, even killed, if action isn't taken. But it's a Ravenclaw style of heroism, rather than Gryffindor, and his family are a bunch of bigots when it comes to that kind of thing.

*** When I first read the book, Percy was like my fictional avatar. He really resonated with me.

Just like Percy, I tried to discourage my siblings from following my non conventional parents and pretend to be conventional instead just because a Dark Lord was rising.

And just like Percy, when the Dark Lord rose and we were in a Deathly Hallows-type situation, I realized I was wrong and my parents were actually right.

Every ref to him makes me LOL. Remember in COS, when they are visiting Diagonal Alley and Percy is holed up in Florish and Botts reading "a perfectly boring book called Prefects who made it"? LOL.

**** I always wished Harry had been friends with Percy. I think Percy would've been the perfect friend for him. He'd have helped him learn everything there was to know about the wizarding world without simply assuming that Harry knew already. I feel like he would've avoided getting into so many dangerous situations though, might've made for a boring series of books.

It seemed rather ridiculous to me that Percy would even consider reading that book, but for all we know that was a fascinating read. I doubt it though.

  Harry had never really properly planned anything before. The fact that his first ever plan was risky and filled with assorted dangers was not actually deterring him as much as it should.

  In other words, this story explores how Harry's third year at Hogwarts might have played out differently if a little project management and an ambitious plan had been thrown into the mix.
#+end_quote

Harry forms a team of himself, Hermione and Percy. The three of them construct a plan for The Project and move with it. Percy is an important character there and can be regarded as Harry's friend. The culmination of the first project is actually very sweet and emotional, and everyone in the school finally acknowledges Percy.

******* I agree. He doesn't ever display as much fondness for Hermione as for Ron or Ginny either. Even in book 7 he is always quite annoyed by her but he keeps it in him. He only expresses awe in her when she does something unconventional. My best guess is that Harry doesn't like "proper" people that much because of the fact that he had to grow up with the Dursleys who were proper normal people.

**** I can see it that way if I try, and that type of Percy isn't someone I would enjoy being around very much, but I automatically slide back into thinking of him as being fascinated by the subject. Partly because I like him better that way, but mostly because I have more in common with him that way.

His wearing the badge at home could easily be viewed as him being boastful and wanting to rub it in, but I always saw it as him simply being proud of himself. I took it as him wearing it for his own sake. It made more sense to me that way because it's not like he didn't get flack for it. But that's just the way I saw it and I'll be the first to admit that it's just as likely that he was being a jerk.

***** Honestly, out of all the head canons out there I rather like this one. I wouldn't mind reading a fic with this type of Percy as a side character or storyline.

That said, I think Percy's biggest flaw is that he's bigheaded. He wanted to be important, and wanted others to recognize him as such. He was constantly dropping names of people he viewed as important and talked about how he was fighting against his father's and family's bad reputation. He abandoned the magical regulation job for one as Fudge's assistant, publicly denouncing his family for a career boost. I don't think Percy is a bad guy, I think he was a bit full of himself and ambitious and that all went to his head.

****** I agree wholeheartedly, on both counts. I would love to read a fic exploring a more nuanced portrayal of him. But I agree he has his flaws, but everyone does. I've seen so many fics which act like his dissatisfaction with his family's reputation is unforgivable. He was a jerk to them, and he did behave like a pompous idiot, but he was also a teenager at the time. People do stupid things at that age and he regretted it in the end. I find him weirdly compelling.

** Linkffn(Inspector No.13) uses this as a minor plot point. In the terms of how cauldron bottoms are about to be standardised for safety purposes.

I remember another fic that talks about weaponising badly made cauldrons. I think it's linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter).

But I've always been interested in this topic.

** Percy gets shafted a lot, even by canon. Sure, he has his heroic moment there at the end, but JK Rowling really went out of her way to make him as unlikeable as possible. It wouldn't have taken much to correct that; a single line from Hermione about how dangerous bad cauldrons can be, a blurb about him looking uncomfortable at Harry's trial, Mrs. Wesley mentioning a letter from Percy apologizing for his actions. Something, anything that wouldn't have added more than seven words to the word county of each book.
