I have this weird fascination with illusion magic as of late.

Over 70k+ words!


** Sounds like an interesting premise! Do you know any fanfiction that does exist with it?

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six-year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

I haven't gotten around to re-reading this one yet either, but as I recall it's a story where Tom Riddle is a completely fake person created by someone called William Cartwright.

It's more about trickery and misdirection rather than awesome holograms and phantasms and invisibility and whatnot, but it's fairly funny from what I recall, you might like it all the same.

  A tale of illusion and deception - what better bedtime story could a magician tell his son than when he managed to pull one over on the entire wizarding world?

  A sequel to Dangerous and Deadly Lord Voldemort. William Cartwright Sr. - decent wizard and extraordinary *magician* - has finished telling his son the story of the biggest lie foisted on the wizarding world: Voldemort never existed. And now the son wants to get in on the showmanship...
