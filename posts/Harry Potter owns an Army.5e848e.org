Preferably getting into tactics instead of just "I have more troops, your dead now."

Yes, I've read Emperor.

Over 70k+ words.


** there's a HHr where he gets pulled to a new dimension. He has an army. the army eventually joins him. Lav is a warg rider, Susan is his XO and uses a battleax.. Daphne is Potions/medicine.. has a good scene between Pansy, Draco, Snape, some trolls and ..Daphne?

and I don't know the name or author. which is terrible of me. sorry I can't help more.

  When things go wrong in one world, wizards seek help from another. Unfortunately what you want and what you get can sometimes be entirely different things. A tale featuring Harry, Hermione, Luna, Susan, Neville and a whole host of others. Loosely inspired by "The Meaning of Fear" by Rorschach's Blot. Rating for highly probable violence, and likely bad language.

** It's somewhere between sci-fi and fantasy, and generally quite different from most stories, but linkffn(The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig) has large-scale combat between wizards and [[/spoiler][more technologically advanced muggles]] as well as some inter-wizard fighting, iirc. There's also a fair amount of literal as well as metaphorical worldbuilding.

  Just before her death Sybill Trelawney makes one last prophecy: to prevent a magical genocide Harry Potter must leave the Earth, and find a new home for his people around a distant star.

** Hmm...it's not Harry Potter, and the first few chapters of setup probably wouldn't be to your liking (they aren't to mine), but perhaps you'd be interested in Dungeon Keeper Ami?

Dungeon Keeper Ami is a crossover between Dungeon Keeper & Sailor Moon, though it does enough worldbuilding that you don't need to be familiar with either series.

Besides the basic plot of 'Ami Mizuno accidentally becomes a Dungeon Keeper and has to try and find a way back to her own world while battling both Light and Dark', there's a lot of fluff about resource management, invention, and unconventional battle tactics.

*** Sailor Moon is a big turn-off for me because it seems like the first version of Powerpuff girls.
