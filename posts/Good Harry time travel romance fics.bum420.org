  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** I like this one: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/266699][The Love of a Good Wizard by SweetSorcery]] (Harry/Tom)

And this one isn't bad: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120][Time Turned Back by TaraSoleil]] (Harry/Sirius)

This one is lovely (Draco goes back in time, but it's a Harry/Draco fic) but be warned it's very sad: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/393118][The Eighth Tale by lettered]]\\
This one is pretty much a romantic comedy: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7769080][Don't Fuck With Florists (They'll Fuck You Up) by MayMarlow]] (Harry/Tom)

​

I have these ones saved, so even though I don't remember them 100% I must have thought them worth reading: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/463038][In Time, Once Again by avioleta]] (Harry/Severus)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2060][Escaping the Paradox by Meri]] (Harry/Severus)

​

These two are less traditional time travel fics: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/621717][Waiting to Divide by emynn]] (Harry/Severus)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2039154][At the Crossroads There We'll Meet by firethesound]] (Harry/Draco - Potter keeps dying; Draco keeps saving him.)

​

And I'm going to suggest this one just for giggles (well-written, but contains incest). [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/434586][Memories in Future Tense by Eriador117]] (Harry/Severus - Harry travelled back in time to get Severus to befriend the Marauders and Lily in hopes that it will prevent Voldemort's attack. It does, but it has other consequences... When he suddenly returns to his own time, he finds out that Severus is now his father.)

**** Well part of it is the theme was time travel and there aren't that many older characters that aren't married (or dead in the present time which presents its own complications) to pair Harry with.

Part of it is that if they start off hating each other there can be much more tension between them more easily which makes for good reading.

Part of it is personal preference - they're my recs and I like Harry/Severus for example (I don't read much Harry/Voldemort but they're over represented here because of the temptation for authors to write fix-it fic involving them and time travel).

But not all slash involves those pairings. I've read plenty of good fic that's Harry/Ron, Harry/Remus etc. And there's plenty of post-Hogwarts Harry/Draco which has Draco as a decent character - some of it even explains why which is to my preference.

Also the request was Harry time-travelling so I didn't include for example the lovely Percy/Oliver slash I've read or Remus/Sirius.

If you search by pairing in archive of our own I'm sure you'll find lots of slash to suit your preferences.

***** I'd say this is a mischaracterisation actually. Yes there are plenty of young people writing both slash and het and yes the quality of fan fiction can be variable, however I've read lots of very thoughtful fanfic involving pairings I'd never even thought of or fresh takes on old favourites. As I replied to nouseforausernam, part of the reason some of these pairings are popular is that if they start off hating each other there can be much more tension between them more easily which makes for good reading, and part of it was the request which was Harry, romance and time travel.

But not all slash involves those pairings. I've read plenty of good fic that's Harry/Ron, Harry/Remus etc. And there's plenty of post-Hogwarts Harry/Draco which has Draco as a decent character - some of it even explains why which is to my preference.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
