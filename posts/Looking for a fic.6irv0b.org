I am looking for a fic that I lost track off awhile ago. It was alternative universe fic, where the diversion happened at the gravesite. As usual Voldemort and Harry were fighting but Harry lost the fight. Voldemort then carved a parseltongue ritual on Harry to send him to another world. Harry ended up in a world where there never was a wizarding wars ,where the Potter family managed to thrive and grow. In this world muggleborns do not exist. The moment they show accidental mangic there were taken and adopted my wizarding family. There are two wizarding schools with hogwarts being reserved for the best and richest students. Harry is quickly taken by the potter family and they help him recover from his ordeal. Tom riddle becomes a black and helps Harry translate the ritual on him. The black family gets involved because they found out they have a new black relative that popped out of nowhere. That is all I can remember from the plot. I hope someone recognized it


** I've seen all those individual ideas, but I'm not sure if I've seen them all in the same fic, especially the Riddle being a Black part.

*** It was what I liked about this fic. The author put a bit of effort into building this different world within the Harry potter one.

** I can remember reading a fiction like this including the Riddle being Black but it was abandoned.

  Harry is thrown out of his dimension and into the past of another like his own, but very different at the same time. Given a chance to have something he'd never had before, a caring family, will Harry still try to find a way home to a world that wants a child to fight for them? Or decide he is home? M for language and violence. And eventual Slash.
