where Dumbledore finds out that he has less than a year left to live thanks to the ring so he endeavours to do as much damage as possible to the death eaters and Tom as he can while still preparing Harry for his role


** There was a fic where Harry says the prophecy only needs him to land the killing blow against Voldemort, so Dumbledore has to do everything else. Dumbledore goes and kills all the death eaters, including Voldemort in disguise.

May have been "The power he know not"

Included -harry studied in the us, his wand was a pencil -dumbledore gets cursed and ends up powerless in a muggle old age home with Alzheimer's

Details may be a bit off
