I'm mentally exhausted from writing my HP fic, I'm thinking I might take a break after I do the hard editing.

It honestly feels like my stuff is underappreciated.

God, I think I got writer's depression again.


** Hang in there. Don't kill yourself trying to write too much fanfiction. If you need a break, take one. You deserve it. And if you feel like your stuff is under appreciated, try and think about the positive feedback you have received.

** it can be hard, bruh. Writing is hard af.

I always tell myself it's supposed to be fun and healing, so when it's making me cry or whatever, I know it's time for a break, or try something else for a little while. The creative process has its ups and downs, there will be times you hate your work and question why you thought it was worth doing it in every project, often several times.

For me it helps to go through my initial notes, and remember why I thought it was a good idea and wanted to put it into the world, and then I'll read some positive responses from my most enthusiastic readers who also thought my ideas were solid and liked that I made it, and it helps, but even then I still need a bit of breathing space to just let it be, and I'll come back to it when I actually /want/ to be doing the work

** It can be hard. I decided on how I wanted to begin this latest chapter of my fic. I sat down, stared at the empty page, and just closed the program and played some Baldur's Gate.

I finally got it going some weeks after, when I had some time. I wrote alot, but now I'm at a point where I'm going to writing Voldemort quite a bit and I find it hard to keep going...

Hang in there!

**** I'm dealing with a procrastination monkey that lives in my brain. It has a particular liking for YouTube videos. And everything you're not supposed to be doing...

Sometimes, it sleeps and I can get things done!

** If you're feeling stressed go do something that relaxes you. I open up games on my PC; but do whatever works for you. I don't know about anyone else, but I can't write or edit well when I'm feeling stressed.

Leaving your fic alone for a few days (or longer) and coming back to it helps too.

** If you write to be appreciated, then I would strongly recommend reevaluating your plans: there are 629,000 HP fanfiction stories on FFnet alone (another hundreds of thousand on AO3 and elsewhere). Being discovered and appreciated is just matter of sheer luck and relying on that is a way to madness. If you want to be appreciated do something else, almost anything else is more secure way to it.
