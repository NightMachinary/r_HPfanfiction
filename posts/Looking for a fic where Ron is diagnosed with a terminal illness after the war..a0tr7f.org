I have totally forgotten the name of the fic, but I am 80% sure I read it on ffn, not ao3. Other details, as much as I can remember them, include:

1. Ron feeling like he is not appreciated by his family or friends.
2. Ron moves away from his family house, takes up a job somewhere else while dealing with his sickness.
3. Family are initially in the dark about Ron's illness, they think he has /betrayed/ them, or something similar.
4. Family learns the truth about halfway through the fic, by which time Ron's condition has considerably worsened, he is in near constant pain, and they almost drag him back to the Burrow.
5. I think there was a chapter from Ginny's perspective, her going into Ron's memories to try and understand why he went away from home, why he never told anyone about his illness, and realizing how much Ron loved her, and feeling guilty that she apparently never cared for him as much in return.

Thanks in advance for any help.
