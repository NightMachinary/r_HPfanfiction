Will it be unethical if I write a fanfic about how JKR has misrepresented the story of Harry Potter to muggles?

*** i was thinking of writing a fic from the pov of one of the characters. i plan to make this character dislike JKR, confirm the head canon that she is indeed Rita Skeeter (or a variation of that), and proceed to tell the real story.

**** I don't think it's particularly unethical, though I personally don't care for the idea.

For what it's worth, it's already been done, though it wasn't actually mentioned in any great detail, only in passing.(the Dursleys were strict, but not abusive, for example).

****** OK. I found the fanfic where Dudley turns out to be gay, but it's /not/ the same fanfic as the one where the Harry Potter books were an exaggeration of Harry's life.

I think I have a headache now..

****** I'm sorry. I /would/ recommend it, but I can't find it. I don't even remember the title. I'm not even sure I remember all the /correct/ details, as I think this is the same fanfic where Dudley turns out to be gay /and/ to have adopted a girl who turns out to be a witch.

**** No, I don't think it's unethical. It could be at risk of author bashing, which I would avoid myself., but it depends on your goals.
