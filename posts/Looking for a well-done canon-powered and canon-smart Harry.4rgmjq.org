I'm not talking about underpowered or not intelligent really, I'm thinking about the book 4 Harry who was panicking night before the second task because he honestly had no idea how to survive underwater, felt ridiculous and out of place throughout the tournament, and really only made it through with Barty's help. I want to read a Harry whose magical abilities are decent but those of a teenager, like Harry vs. Bellatrix in OotP, and vastly outstripped by Dumbledore and Voldemort.

And when he runs into difficult situations I wish he didn't immediately know what to do. Or like Book 7 that argument when Ron and Hermione are like "We thought you would have a plan," and Harry's like "No sorry it's just to wander around in the woods and hope we think of something and try not to die." Kinda reminds me of graduating from college, haha.

I enjoy slightly-overpowered Harry well enough but realized rereading GOF that I really missed this kind of characterization. Any well-written fics recommendations?

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

*** It's a great fic, but I'm pretty sure this Harry became very very powerful and scary toward the end.

**** He became more knowledgeable about higher power spells--something harry shows he has an affinity for[adults can barely cast a patronus and his can run off a hundred dementors? That's POWER, not just Power or power.]--and makes use of those spells after studying them, he doesn't just know how to do amazing spells in the story.

***** The thing is, given how DA went in OotP, casting and sustaining a Patronus isn't actually that difficult. The reason most adults can't cast it is that it's not taught until NEWT level in DADA, and most adults don't take it. (And, there really isn't a point to teaching it any earlier, because it's utterly useless unless one expects to deal with Dementors or knows Dumbledore's Patronus message trick.)

The hard part is casting and sustaining one in the face of a Dementor, because Dementors drain the very thoughts and feelings needed to cast it (to say nothing of a hundred of them). Harry's "wearing his emotions on his sleeve", and his resilience and stubbornness to the point of recklessness, lets him do that better than almost everyone else they meet; but it also gets him into a lot of trouble throughout the books. Just like Lockhart's proficiency with Memory Charms, it's integrated with is personality.

The notion that there exists a special category of "higher power spells" that Harry has an affinity for while showing no special affinity for normal spells strikes me as yet another attempt to shoehorn an InnatelyPowerful!Harry into canon.

***** Good point wrt Patronus as evidence he was just not taught strong spells! For what I'm looking for, it's less about whether its believable that he could be that powerful, but that I want to read him without the superpowers. Regardless I've been meaning to read this fic so I'll check it out

** Here is my favorite. Linkffn(weasley girl by hyaroo) I think is the best cannon rework fic ever. The only change is that Ron weasley was born a day early and is a girl and I love it. It's only book one, sadly.

Linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7) has a harry that's fairly close. He does become an animagus fairly early, but he's being looked after by Sirius in this one so I don't think its out of bounds. It's VERY long, though.

Linkffn(amplitude, frequency and resistance of the soul bond) is pretty good about power level too. Also a fic I love.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore!

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED
