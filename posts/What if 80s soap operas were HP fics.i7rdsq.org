Ok, so I'm bored out of my mind right now - humour me for a second please and give me your best plot points/outlines for "what would happen if 80s soap opera (you know, those long and convoluded ones where everyone marries each other at some point) writers were into HP fics?". Make it as funny and as complicated as you like!

My idea: Harry is into Hermione (nobody knows, because everyone assumes he is gay for some reason), but Hermione is into Ron. So, to spite Ron (and also because she is the "next best thing" and kind of reminds him of Hermione) Harry decides to date Ginny - obviously, everyone is shocked, because Harry is supposed to be gay. Ginny finds out that Harry doesn't actually want her and decides to get revenge - enter Malfoy, who would be your essential arch enemy to the main character (Harry, duh!). Together, Ginny and Malfoy decide that the best course of action would be for Ginny to pretend she doesn't know anything, marry Harry, then divorce him, take half of his money and live comfortably with Malfoy. Only Malfoy doesn't know he's just being used as a pawn in Ginny's revenge - when he finds out that she doesn't want him, he starts plotting behind her back with Harry to somehow get his own revenge. In the process, obviously, they somehow end up together (because I'm a complete sucker for Drarry); but obviously that doesn't work out because things cannot be that easy in a 80s soap opera - Malfoy starts realizing he's into Ron, but Ron is by now married to Hermione. And Hermione is freaking out, because she is convinced there's something between Ron and Malfoy and divorces Ron, who blames everything on Harry and Ginny (insert big fight and possible duel). Through that, Harry and Ginny grow closer and Ginny starts falling in love with Harry, but Harry had already realized he's actually into guys and he's really confused about everything, so he decides to go to therapy to sort everything out and ends up with his therapist living in the Muggle world.

*I'm sorry, I know it's totally random and pointless, but Netflix suggested Dynasty and the results are... well, you can see for yourselves.


** Main thing I'd pull out from your idea is that in an 80s soap opera it'd unlikely be the main character that everyone assumed was gay. I could definitely see that being a sub plot about a secondary character - everyone assuming Neville was gay because he's shy, clumsy, and never dated anyone at Hogwarts, or assuming Ginny is gay because she's better at sports than all her brothers. Spend a season or two building up that assumption, quiet comments, stereotypical behaviours etc, only for them to suddenly become the love interest of the main character and the rest of the cast doing a massive double take over it. And if the show wanted to be /really/ progressive they'd have a background character bravely come out as gay, someone who'd never really had any camera time and it'd be the plot for an episode or two then promptly be forgotten.

*** Yeah, you're right. I forgot for a moment that 80s was THAT long ago. But I could definitely see Neville being the supposedly-gay character.

** Yup. With the way some writers drag out their fics with no point and no end in sight, may as well go full soap! Could actually be better that way. Commit to the soapy content every week or two. Use two or three main characters we know are set for life (say, HP and DM) who don't /have/ to work so they have time for drama. Or, go with some healers at St Mungo's to get that General Hospital feel.

*** I kind of wish someone wrote a full-blown satire soap opera fic - complete with multiple seasons, murder plotting, ALL of the unnecessary drama and multiple weddings between the same characters (Brooke and Ridge style :D). As much as I hate 100-chapter fics, I'd totally get invested in that!

** Idk, the 90s were pretty fun for soaps too. Anyone remember [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHvw8B7fexQ][this happening?]]

And yes, that character is possessed by the devil. Which would've been even more hilarious in retrospect if it had happened two years later. You know, when Jensen Ackles (Dean Winchester) was playing her son.

**** Because its awful, and you didn't have a mom that was glued to the TV every day from 1-2 in the afternoon. Days of our Lives had a few crazy plotlines back then, the other one being the "island one". Lemme see if I get this right: there was a serial killer in town, and it was killing off all the main characters. But wait! They weren't actually dead, they just got shipped off to some island somewhere. And the killer? It's Marlena, that woman that got possessed. But wait! It's actually some other dude that somehow convinced her that she was the killer.

Then there's the "bad dude" that died a billion times over the years but was never actually dead (I just googled him - Stefano apparently faked his own death thirteen times, and the only reason that death #14 took is because the actor died).

****** Exactly! Your plotline in the OP is great, but it really isn't absurd enough for daytime TV :P
