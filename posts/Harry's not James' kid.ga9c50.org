:END:
Snape resuces Harry for the summer and takes him home, upon exploring the attic he finds a diary that claims Snapes his dad. To hide this they change his name to Dylan and resort him into Slytherin. He dates Draco and eventually let's him in on the secret. I repeat some point they have a dance in the room of requirements.


** I believe that the story you are looking for is Malfoy Flavor by Vorabiza...although his name isn't Dylan, it's Dustin?
