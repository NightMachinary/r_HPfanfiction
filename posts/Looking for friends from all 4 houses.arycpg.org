Read one with Teddy Lupin recently where he had a friend group made up of one of each house, I didn't love the story (can't pinpoint why to be honest) but loved the concept!

I'm looking for any story where a friend group is made up of one student from each house for whatever reason (a next-gen fic would be ideal but any is great)!


** linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb) revolves around a Slytherin!Ginny. It takes awhile, but eventually the DA is led by Ginny, Neville, Hannah Abbott, and Luna, with special emphasis on the fact that they need traits from /all/ houses to survive in Hogwarts during the 7th year. The story also has house prejudice as a major theme. Not quite your criteria, but the only fic I could think of that has exactly one student from each house in a group.

If it doesn't need to be only one student, linkffn(C'est La Vie by cywscross) has a very diverse friend group, and is generally very friendship heavy.

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** No next gen, but I recently read and liked [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15068012/chapters/34933661][The Child of Azkaban]] linkao3(15068012) in which the "main quartet" (aka "The Quiet Ones") consist of one student per house. I guess one must be fine with the premise to enjoy it, but I quite like how things (like certain seemingly ooc moments) are explained later.\\
Though currently only this story is finished, with the first chapter of a second having recently been published.

​

Also, an older fic I read ages ago, but believe I rather liked would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] linkffn(4912291), plus sequel. It's a bit lengthy at times (and mentor!Snape is not everyone's cup of tea), but certainly features students from all houses working together with lots of inter house friendships. (If I haven't gotten it wrong, I'm reading too many FFs these days...)

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.
