Does anyone have a good marauders fic? Right now I'm pretty into either Hermione time travelling and then staying in that time or there being a fifth marauder that's a girl, but any marauders fanfic is good with me :) x


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13362125/1/Shifting-Lines-Book-One][Shifting Lines Book One]]

Long haul Remus Lupin story. Book 1 covers his 1st Year at Hogwarts, and all its ups and downs. Making friends, keeping his secret, and trying to cope with being in the real world for the first time in his life. The world of Shifting Lines will eventually have Wolfstar. Mostly canon with a few exceptions. COMPLETE; Book Two Out Now

This is the best marauder fanfic I've ever read it hints at wolfstar a bit in coming books but it just Realy explores everyday life and brotherhood of the Marauders

** I'm sure you've already read it but Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie (explicit on ao3 and edited on ffnnet) is an epic. 4 books, 5th marauder thing. Incredible. Join us in the fbook group Firewhisky and Honey when you've read it üò¨‚ù§Ô∏è
