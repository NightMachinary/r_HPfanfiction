:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was a fanfiction where Harry could transmute metals? or gems? something like that. He eventually did this in exchange for Gringotts helping him make a staff/stave. It helped make Harry more powerful than usual. The last chapter I think had Harry living in a cave thousands of years in the future and a Potter descendent came to claim the staff to defeat another dark lord.

I have Googled every combo of words I can think of and haven't been able to find it, hopefully someone out there read this fic as well!

*** I agree with you it's Runemaster by Tigerman. It's where Harry discovers how to distill the essence of plants (magical and mundane) and then learns to do the same thing with various ores. He also enhances the wards at Gringotts. They help him make a staff/scythe.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.
