Because I haven't seen a thread that invites our fellow board members to put forth their respective favourites. And because I'm tired of looking around the board/internet for excellent fic recommendations!

Anything from Novels to One-shot's are welcome. Harry/Ginny to Ginny/Hermione to Hermione/Hermione to Harry/Dumbledore... you get the point. The only requirement is that you think it is excellent!

Come! Lay down thy favourite fics!

Edit: Should have trusted the spell checker...


** All right, let's do this.

** The [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A_Difference_in_the_Family_The_Snape_Chronicles][Snape Chronicles]] is an excellent story. I highly recommend it.

From the author's summary - "This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view."

Although, I don't feel that summary does the work justice. This fanfic is a beautifully vivid look into what Snape's life /must/ have been like. It is extremely canon-compatible, a fact of which I'm dearly fond. Essentially, it is Snape's life from birth until death, like the books were written from Snape's point of view - except that it starts far before Harry is born. Naturally, the author took some liberties with his childhood, since we don't know much from JKR about his childhood, but it is well written. I would go as far to say that this story /becomes/ Snape's canon childhood for me. This is a wonderful, wonderful piece of literature. I laughed and cried, and learned more than I ever knew there was to know about Snape.

It is completed.

I'm a fan of a really powerful Harry, so that's what all of these are. I also gravitate toward epically long stories with lots of canon-compliant magic and well developed plot; every one is definitely in the adventure category. As for pairings and ratings, these are all over the map - I figure Harry deserves to get some lovin' and as long as he's happy, I'm happy.

These are not obscure fics, they've been around awhile and are mostly well-known in the fandom, but I figure there might be some newcomers who are still having withdrawl from recently finishing the series and haven't read them yet.

#+end_quote

- My absolute favorite fic of all time - I cannot recommend it enough! It's not finished, but the author updates every few months (it is taking her a very long time, but this is the only story that I've actually kept up with since the beginning - it's worth it!). The two things that makes this story SO good are: 1) She does such an amazing job at keeping the characters canon - it's very easy to believe that this is the way they would have been; and 2) It's edited perfectly. She makes sure each chapter is perfect (or at least as perfect as it can be) before she posts it. Makes for a verrryyy easy read in that sense.

I also agree that [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/649528/][nonjon]] is amazing and absolutely hilarious.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][Some Kind of Beauty]] Next-gen Weasley family story. I'm a big fan of both slice-of-life and coming-of-age sorts of stories.

#+begin_quote
  My family was never one for normality nor did we ever try to label ourselves that way. Through the years, we lived through our shares of fights and laughter and chaos. I didn't know much about living, but they taught me all I knew about loving. In the end, there didn't seem to be one without the other.

** Well, I came here to thank whoever recced this story, but apparently I didn't get that rec from here. Not sure where it was that I found this link, but nevertheless, I'm reccing it here, because why not?

I read this story yesterday and I really liked it. In fact I remember whining more than once to people about how I wanted stories like this, where we got to see Snape use some of his skills and get shit done, where we got to see cool variations and things that can be done with magic other than just wave the wand and /poof/ (especially cool Dark magic related things, because we didn't get to really see all they can do in canon), basically, yeah.

So this is my rec, it's a post-DH where Snape lived but is hiding from Wizarding Britain in America, under another name. It's kind of a detective type of story, and as for warnings, it has some profanity and some gore, mostly concerning the House Elves.

After I read it, it turns out it's the sequel to another story, which I haven't read yet. I don't think not having read it got in the way of my enjoying it. The first couple of chapters I guess were a little confusing, but after that, it picked up.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6355336/1/The_Clear_Cut]]

Summary: After managing to survive the end of the war, Snape is beginning a new life for himself when called on to return a favor. In a search to track down the missing he is drawn deep into a criminal conspiracy. DH compliant. Rated for T language, some violence.

** A warning: this was written in 2005, but has always easily been my favorite HP fanfic of all time. It feels more real to me. Harry is genuinely depressed, Draco obviously has some hidden problems of his own, but he's grown up quite a bit. It becomes apparent when seeing him take care of Harry and the way he approaches and handles every situation. While it has a wonderful sense of reality, it also has a dreamy cast to it for the last leg of it that is fitting. It blends into that lull naturally, and in my opinion, perfectly. The ending fits. It isn't outrageously cliched, but rather a quiet period that is so satisfying it's incredible.
