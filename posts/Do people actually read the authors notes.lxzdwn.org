** I think some do and some don't. I try to assume people don't and include all the really important information in the chapters themselves. I use the Author's Notes for extra stuff mostly. That being said, I couldn't agree more about hate reviews. Especially ones that just say that they don't like the premise of the story. Constructive criticism is fine, but if your comment is rude and/or about something the author definitely isn't going to change (like the main pairing or the plot) then...just don't read it. (Sorry, I also needed to rant a bit)

Just ignore the haters. Write what you want to write.

** Mixed. There's been some author's notes that have really interesting information about character design or plot, and I'll even return to past chapters to make sure I'm not missing anything interesting. A majority of the time I glance, skim, and skip. I'll read forewords and afterwords, but keeping things simple is my preference. I do like some definitions at the end of the chapter if you're using another language or referencing something really obscure.

What I used to like, but have grown out of, is characters talking to the audience for a disclaimer. It was "the thing" but kind of a relief to lose, even if I did it in the beginning!

** Personally, always. I enjoy the little peeks into personalities that author notes give. It's nice to get insights into the headspace of the author as they're writing, even if the fact that they've recently graduated or been having family issues is completely irrelevant to the fic itself.

I know a LOT of people don't. It's kind of a thing in the fandom. Understandably irritating from a writer's perspective, but also understandably done from a reader's perspective.

** I personally don't, but I don't really go off on people for writing what they want to write, I came here to read, not to be a Karen- but if it's something one of my friends wrote, I'm definitely reading every single word and helping out with spelling (by googling words I'm not sure on how to spell) and if I'm actually going to leave criticism, I make sure to read it again, because I honestly don't want the author to get that /“oh-no-I-fucked-up-on-the-internet”/ and then be wrong, lol- I try to only give pointers and criticism, but only if I pretty much know that they are true and/or helpful!

** Depends. I would suggest you don't explain your stories in the author's note but try to contain all necessary information within the body of the story.

As for haters... sorry. It's just how it is when you put yourself out there. Just pat yourself on the back that you actually have the balls to put yourself out there with something creative and original while they just leave hateful comments under the pretense of anonymity. Good luck!

** Just a fact of everyday life: Many people are stupid and have poor reading comprehension skills. I know we're all grateful to have people interested in our writing, but do remember that not all followers are smart.

** I think they shouldn't. Don't write your story in author notes, but put everything to the main story itself.

Of course, hate reviews are stupid, there is no discussion about that.

** No, never. they're either:

1) a dedication or thank you to a beta, which is fine but irrelevant to me, or they're

2) the author telling us about their busy life, which is fine but not what I'm reading the fic for, or

3) the author answering criticism/giving explanations, which is annoying and detracts from the story so i actively avoid these

** Some do, some don't. That's really all you can say.

I typically keep mine to a minimum, but I have been told that my 'extra-canon-context' authors notes, which I employ in some of my stories in order to explain aspects of lore which are not fundamental to understanding the story, but which could be considered easter eggs for people with more knowledge.

For example, if I introduce a character who is mentioned in a minor role in some ancillary content I will not explain that in story text, as it's irrelevant, but I do mention it in the AN just so people who are aware of these things can make the connection. I also will explain some aspects of setting metaphysics in order to explain crossover mechanics. Again, these are not fundamentally important to the story, but fanfic readers like to understand and even feel like a participant in the fan construction, so including that stuff is liked by many.

However, many also simply do not read ANs. This is especially true of people who hold strong views as to the way things /should/ be. They are unlikely to care for your reasoning, and will instead start composing their angry review at the very moment you fall afoul of their closely held beliefs. There is really nothing you can do to placate these people, so I'd suggest you don't bother.

Others, of course, will engage with the story purely as a story. Many of these people also will not read ANs as they're simply not part of the story. These people usually don't leave the angry reviews, though, because part of engaging with a story on its own merits is accepting author autonomy and mastery within the bounds of their story. These people might have closely held beliefs, but they're typically willing to take a live and let live approach to things that don't conform to their expectations.

** I always read them...and when I write, I often include them but with the idea that you don't need to read them to get the chapter (mostly that's where I thank people and ramble about why I am late finishing the chapter, LOL).

** I read forewords and afterwords. Anything beyond that is a distraction from the story. I might occasionally skim a short AN, but if I see one that's more than a paragraph or two I just glare & swear as I scroll past it.

** As a general rule, IMO the best A/Ns are those that elaborate on extra stuff that isn't relevant for the story per se, but that could enhance the reading experience for those people who are interested. The only fic where I actually read the A/Ns religiously was a fic where the notes placed various story events into historical context. It was a fic set in the 70s, and the A/Ns elaborated on anything from an especially bad storm or a music concert, to historical monuments encountered in the story, and were always a treat to read IMO.

However, never should an A/N substitute a critical story detail. It should always be possible to fully enjoy a story without paying attention to author notes whatsoever.

** Some do, some don't. I'm one of those people who write long author's note at the beginning, but even then, I'm fully aware that most people are just going to skip over it. So, I do whatever I can to grab their attention before they try to skip: I put it in FAQ form. In *bold letters*, if I have to.

For example:

*Why did Sirius forgive Dumbledore?*

Because Sirius blah blah blah. Etc.

Or, if it's just a minor detail like pairings, etc., I put it in the summary if it fits. Even then, there will still be people who don't read it.

For your case, though, it would be best if you try to work that explanation into your story somehow (preferably right around the time Sirius meets Dumbledore. Try to insert Sirius' thoughts here so your readers know /why/ Sirius decided not to bring up the Dursleys). Because I can almost guarantee that if you put it anywhere else, people aren't going to read it.

** Nope. I used to when I was starting to read fanfiction, and now I just flat out ignore them as they detract from the story. I don't want to read the author's opinion of the fic, I want the fic and /only/ the fic. If it's important, work it into the text. If not? Who the fuck cares.
