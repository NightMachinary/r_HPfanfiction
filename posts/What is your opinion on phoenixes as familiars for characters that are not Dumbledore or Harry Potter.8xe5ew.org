I have a story where Dumbledore still put on the horcrux and got cursed, but he didn't take a swan dive off a tower. He lived to see the end of the war though it was not finished on his terms. After the war, Rita's book was still written, and public opinion of him tanked. As a consequence of this, he was removed from Hogwarts as headmaster and went off to do whatever disgraced former headmasters with cursed arms do in these types of situations.

In this case some months later, he dies due to the curse in his arm. So far, so sad.

The hero of this tale, who is not Harry Potter, is informed that Dumbledore is now an ex-parrot and goes to his house to confirm the news for himself. There he does indeed find one dead wizard and as a passing thought on exiting the house goes to look for the Phoenix. He finds an egg in a pile of ash instead.

Our plucky hero presumes that wizard and bird cooked this plan up together so the bird could burn and stay in its egg until it chooses to hatch again. (please note I have done zero research on phoenixes so far, so this might not be a thing.)

The hero tries to give the egg to Aberforth as the sole surviving relation, but he refuses. Options are now; hand it over to the creature's department at the ministry, keep it as instructed by Aberforth or find some friendly magizoologist type to take it on.

There is no chance that in this story the egg will hatch for my hero. It's not going to happen, but what I was considering is what if it hatched for one of his children?

So far in the timeline, the child in question is some six to eight years off. Long enough for the bird to fall out of the public perception and long enough for the egg to become nothing more than something the hero happens to have.

My question really is, does having a phoenix as a familiar ‘mean' something? Is it a thing of note? Do I have to make this child into the next best thing since sliced bread or can having a rare magical bird as a familiar be just one of those things?

I really don't want to write the adventures of a magical child and their bird- the Hogwarts years. I don't want to use this as a set up for another story. I was just considering giving a kid a cool pet.

I know the answer to this is ‘do whatever you want' but, I have the very great fortune to have a group of chatty reviewers. They mostly came over from the first story I wrote of which this is a spin-off/sequel. They will notice my hero has the egg. They will want to know what I'm going to do with it. I don't really want to do nothing with it now its joined the story, I do so dislike loose ends, but I never planned it to be in the story. It just fell out of my fingers when I was writing the chapter.

So, what do you think? Can it be a cool pet or is it too much a portent?


** Having a phoenix will make the writing much harder for you with regards to direct conflict. Obviously balance isn't a concept in fiction the way it is in video games and I and many others would really rather not put magic in quantifiable terms but there is still a measure of balance needed in fiction. If the main character is too strong there is no struggle, if the villain is too strong then any eventual victory often comes across as contrived. What ever skills, friends and trinkets you add to the story need to be balanced out by a corresponding often seemingly greater set of strengths for the villain. Phoenixes can make this hard to manage. We see Fawkes facetank a killing curse for Dumbledore. We see Fawkes save Harry from one of the deadliest venoms known to wizard kind. We see Fawkes cripple a basilisk's greatest strength. We see Fawkes travel through Hogwarts famous protections. Having a phoenix can give so many easy outs to situations, there is a reason Fawkes doesn't appear too much, same as Dumbledore. If they were used to their fullest potential then it would be a very different series. If you have the phoenix but don't use it then your protagonist comes across as an idiot. Dumbledore having the only phoenix we see in the series is another thing to consider. You give someone a phoenix and then we can make comparisons to Dumbledore, one of the greatest wizards of all time. Its a possible road to go down but you don't get plucky underdog vibes if you have a phoenix.

** Having a Phoenix in general is not something that would grant you hero status. It may be enough for a curio article in the Daily Prophet, you know, and people who pay close attention to rumors might recognize you in the street as "that bloke with the Phoenix", but it's not fundamentally different from having, say, a pet anaconda. Unusual, but it happens, and it doesn't make you a superstar. Note that in canon, A, "familiars" aren't a thing (Fawkes is just a pet-slash-friend to Dumbledore, there's nothing inherently magical to their relationship), and B, there's a foreign Quidditch team who have a Phoenix named Sparky as their /team mascot/.

*** I don't know if I'd compare it with an anaconda. Phoenixes are immortal beings that have likely lived for millions of years, are likely much more uncommon, and are associated with all kinds of things. Immortality, the good of life, rebirth, Albus Dumbledore, Quidditch, etc.

If you had a pet anaconda, you'd be that weird dude with an anaconda. If you had a phoenix, people would consider you much more special. Not an instant hero, perhaps, but /something/. At least something more than just a weirdo with a weird pet.

**** I'm not entirely convinced. Phoenixes are more interesting creatures than anacondas, sure, but owning one says very little about the person who owns it at the end of the day, in my opinion --- certainly not as much as some fanfictions would have you believe.

***** I agree. But I feel as though it's like comparing seeing a Ferrari in your normal neighborhood vs a Nascar racecar. Both are unusual to see, sure, but one is going to be bringing up more questions than the other.

I'm just being a little pedantic, though.

** It conveys a sense of "this person is different" rather than "this person is the most powerful person ever," in my opinion at least.
