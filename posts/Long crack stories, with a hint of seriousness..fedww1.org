Looking for newer, complete or long, stories on ff.net, since I recently started using the app to have stories read to me.

Stories I've read and enjoyed:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4145459/1/The-Horror-The-Horror][The Horror! The Horror!]]

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4036037/1/Two-Weeks-in-the-Alley][Two Weeks in the Alley]]

#+begin_quote
  13 years old, a vault full of gold, and two unsupervised weeks in Diagon Alley -- What's a boy to do? Summer before PoA AU, some adult themes.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11572455/1/If-Looks-Could-Kill][If Looks COuld Kill]]

#+begin_quote
  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

** *Saying No* linkffn(7274734)

Year 6. Harry gets pissed off at the Order, gets control of his life, solves a problem, and then goes back to Hogwarts (more because he's forced to than anything) and then drops living hell upon Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.
