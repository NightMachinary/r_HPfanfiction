Hello!

I have been wanting to find stories that explored the world of Harry Potter, in expanding on exposing or otherwise exploring into pureblood culture/society.

Wizards dress different than muggles. They have a whole different economy, lifestyles, and even mindsets. Roles and jobs in society are completely different than muggle society. It could be a culture shock story, a muggle bashing story, or just a study. It would be interesting to find fics that explore into this further.

Any ideas?


** Beside *Patron* mentioned before, I think following fics did a decent job describing a very different wizard society:

*Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw*, linkffn(11574569)

*Firebird Trilogy*, linkffn(8629685;9646669;10373959)

*The Pureblood Pretense*, linkffn(7613196)

--------------

*The Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(9863146), is heavy into pureblood politics, but its magical society was even closer entwined with Muggle world than in canon. For example, Fudge consulted with John Major about the site for Quidditch World Cup, and Major would seal off large areas in the name of 'Military Exercise'.

  Hard times lead to hard choices. What's more important? Freedom, or fate? Love, or death? Harry Potter stands on the edge of a precipice, and he is not sure if the right move is to turn and fight, or fall.

  They had a plan, formulated from before they were even born. That plan died. From its ashes rises a Harry Potter no longer willing, or able, to let others fight his battles for him. Outgunned, outclassed, outmatched, nonetheless Harry will take up the sword to change not only Britain, but the world.

  Harry doesn't want to learn magic or go to Hogwarts -- he just wants to be normal, like the Dursleys. But a meddling, crazy old wizard won't take "no" for an answer. Harry might have to learn how to be a normal wizard instead - but will he learn from Light wizards or pure-blood friends? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore. Complete. Part 2 of "Perfectly Normal".

** I've written "Patron", an AU where the pureblood culture is more different than "Old England, with some spells". Different Religion, different clothes, different mores. In some areas it's far more progressive than muggle Britain - they consider muggles to be prudes - in others it's far more archaic or alien (laws are often outdated, although the actual laws are usually checked by social pressure and habit, and so what was stated in a law might not actually be enforced anymore.). Also, there's more than one culture in Britain, and France and other countries (Bulgaria, Ottoman Empire, Jamaica, Scandinavia) have different cultures as well.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
