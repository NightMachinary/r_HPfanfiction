The man reportedly held his own in a duel with Dumbledore and Grindelwald - maybe not in their prime, but they were definitely of age. I want the secret life of Aberforth where he fights off world ending eldritch abominations on the weekends, or is a DoM agent called in for special consultations, or even some context about the quip with the goat. There's a potential untapped fan fic gold mine sitting there and apparently no one has written anything.


** linkffn(13010260) features Aberforth heavily.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. A new perspective on the 1970s time travel genre. Updates weekly on Saturdays. Some slash much later.

** Aberforth is one of the main characters in my story "Patron", though he only starts appearing in Chapter 16. He does special missions for Albus, whom he still loathes, and deals with his and his brother's past during the story as his missions take him all over Europe and Britain.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
