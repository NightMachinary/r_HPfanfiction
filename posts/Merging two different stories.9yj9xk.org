Two of my absolute favorite stories arr Magicks of the Arcane and 0800-Rent-A-Hero. I love the magical structure, exploration of more complex magic, and most importantly a competant Harry. I like the idea of Rent a Hero even though it was abandoned. I've had the idea of writing a story that is similar to the plot of Rent A Hero, but with a Harry that is similar to the one written in Magicks of the Arcane. What would be rules and guidelines surrounding this?


** If it's just the general idea, e.g. Harry gets summoned into another world to deal with their shit, I'd say you're good to go. An acknowledgment of what inspired it would be nice, but not a requirement IMHO.

** AFAIK same as for asking to continue a story that's abandoned/ on long term hiatus, would suffice. Ask the author for permission first. Though that's truly just decorum, and there's no need to do it. One thing you should do either way is tell the readers in Chapter 1 what inspired parts of it.

** "Competent Harry" is rather generic - unless you copy signature moves or such, you don't need to acknowledge or ask anyone (though an "Inspired by" is polite, of course). Same for more complex magic structures - unless you copy stuff, it's normal fanfiction.
