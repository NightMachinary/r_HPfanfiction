I'm good with any fic as long as it's high fantasy. I would like it to be 100K+, but I feel like it's kind of a niche area so whatever you can find I would appreciate it. I want LOTR feels or magic that's deeper than original HP. I don't mind slash or really any ship as long as it's not the main focus. For references, I enjoyed "The Shadow of Angmar", and "Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone".

- Thanks


** I'm a pretty big fan of the elvenqueen. No matter how much you might raise an eyebrow at it in the beginning, the ending is phenomenal. linkao3(7239202)

  One person can make a difference: sometimes large, sometimes small. This is the story of a young witch who died under mysterious circumstances and woke up in a completely different world - a world she would change just by existing. Follow the journey of Hermione Granger as she walks the path to becoming Hermione Thranduiliel, the Elvenqueen.

** By the Divining Light and Conlaodh's Song, by enembee. Fantastic high, old, deep, mysterious magic, and one of my favorite Dumbledores in all fanfiction- possibly the best wise!mentor!Dumbledore /ever/.\\

** The sacrifice arc is epic (more than 2 million words) and with a deep magic system and magical culture.

Linkffn(saving Connor)

And the Firebird trilogy! About 450k words, very unique magic and culture, but very dark.

*** Strongly dis-recommend Firebird. Too many of its story themes are gleefully vile misogyny, and the rest are gleefully awful misandry. And it's a harem fic, and not in a good way. It actively disgusted me on so many levels I can't even

**** I would disagree with you on this, it's the only harem fic I could ever enjoy, because the harems are a dystopian element, as opposed to the source of all of Harry's power. I wouldn't describe its themes as misogyny or misandry, because it's all just a part of the dystopian AU that the main characters are trying to fix. It's certainly not for everyone, because it's very dark, but the active dislike for the opposite gender that most characters have comes from the universe itself, not because of the author's beliefs.

***** I agree. While it's full of terrible things - it's internal to the story, it's an important part of the world building and plot.

It's like hating Cloud Atlas because of what they did to Sonmi and her people. It's like hating the Hunger Games because the Capital is making teenagers compete to their deaths. And so forth... (The maze runner, the man in the high castle, the giver, etc...)

It makes no sense to hate a dystopian story because the world/government/people is/are dystopian...

You have to play with the cards you're dealt, and when the cards are awful, the players would have to act accordingly, for good and bad.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

** Hell Eyes. So little to do with Harry Potter that could be its own fantasy novel, but I enjoyed it. Takes place in another world, Harry gets transported there and later finds out he's a descendant of a god.

  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.
