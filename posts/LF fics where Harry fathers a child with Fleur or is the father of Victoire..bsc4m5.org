**** Unfortunately, I have not come across any fics that really fit what you want. I was just trying to clarify your request for others. The ONLY fics I have seen that might qualify are either Harem oriented where he is fathering kids with nearly every major female character, or smut fics where he is sleeping with Fleur and its somewhat implied he might be the father of her kids. The main one in each category isn't a one-shot are already linked/spoken of in this thread.

I wasn't even aware of Beyond the Curtain which seems to be the only non-smut/harem one linked.

Sounds like this is an opportunity for some author to fulfill an area of interest judging by the activity on the thread.

--------------

I am now imagining a story where...

Harry gets with Fleur after the 2nd task and gets her pregnant and it changes his outlook on life. After finding out a few months before the 3rd task he trains like never before, determined to both survive and help protect Fleur and his unborn child. This has the interesting side effect of him ending up preventing Voldemorts rise in the graveyard and killing Pettigrew and later Barty Crouch Jr when he ports back much to the shock of the crowd who now see him in a different light. He determines to prevent Voldemort from rising again, but also take more control of both his life and the direction Wizarding Britain is heading in. He marries Fleur and becomes much more grey leaning and focused, training hard so that he can protect his child and wife, and attempting to make a better world, balancing the light and the dark as he plays both sides politically and financially in an attempt to quash out Voldemorts continued influence even from the grave, but also Dumbledores influence who he feels was leading him astray.

This was going great but then you wrote this, which makes me feel as though you're one of those that loves to make a "manipulative old goat" Dumbledore, which just ruins most fanfics with this trope. Rarely have I ever enjoyed a quality fic where this was a prominent feature, and its never well done for any good reason except hatred for Dumbledore as a character. It doesn't add to the story, it doesn't show that the author knows the character, it doesn't make the character relatable nor is it canon-like. Its just a stupid trope that ruins promising fanfics.

For clarification, I'm not saying an actual GG Dumbledore is a bad thing, which it isn't, its actually impressive to read a well-written one. I'm saying that the tropy "Dumbles" is stupid and a disease in this fanon. OFC, everything I say is my opinion and you don't have to agree, and I'm sorry if I offended you, but your idea was just so good, even though its not original (there's a fic with this premise but its Daphne instead of Fleur and it happens after the 3rd Task, not 2nd) it is really interesting, and that line about Dumbledore just turned me off. So, sorry.

As for that specific "trope", I actually don't care. If something is good I will usually read it. But I will say that if you are going to write a more grey leaning Harry, you have to separate him from Dumbledore somehow, OR... rewrite who Dumbledore is. That's a fact plain and simple.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
