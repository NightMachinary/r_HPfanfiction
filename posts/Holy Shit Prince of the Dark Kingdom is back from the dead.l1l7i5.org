This is legitimately wild to me. I had long given up on this tory ever updating, and not only is Mizuni-sama back, but they're announcing several related projects as well!


** I am cautiously optimistic. I'm always wary of "remaster/rewrite" attempts after a long hiatus, it never seems to go more than a few chapters before being abandoned again. Not to mention the author will be splitting their efforts between the remaster, an adaptation, and another project. All that being said: it's back baby. Holy crap.

*** The only thing that is annoying to me but absolutely understanding is that the author has grown a lot as a person. And the world, too. Things that were perfectly fine back then in a fic, may it be cultural, social or just plain fanfic common trope, might now be insensitive, wrong or overdone. And sometimes the real world bleeds too much into it.

**** Yeah, I agree. It's their story at the end of the day, we're just cheerleaders on the sidelines. Beggars can't be choosers and all that.

And yeah, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed that they weren't just continuing from where they left off. Even in the best case scenario where they don't bounce off the remaster after 5 chapters, and their other projects don't slow it down too much, it's still going to take a long /long/ time for the remaster to make it back to this point 147 chapters in. And then you still have to hope that it continues past this point and eventually gets the satisfying ending that it deserves too.

I'm still here for it, but I'm going to temper my expectations because I don't think I can bear the worst case scenario of yet another "hype-lull-abandoned again" rewrite cycle for one of my all-time favourites.

***** You're absolutely right. It's a free product and I'm gonna love the remaster

Yeah it's gonna take a long time but TBH from the 1.2m words you can cut out a TON. Especially the faerie parts please. Or even little stuff like Harry drawing.

I found this fic to be amazing because of the world it built without the need to add another layer of magic on top of the already utilized magic in this universe. It was a great political piece with a sound story

** Was shocked as well! Thinking back on it, some of the storylines and aspects of the plot are questionable but I still love the fic a lot. It is easily the most detailed - and my favorite - scenario of what would happen if Voldemort won. Where the story left off has been set in my mind as the end for so long it's unbelievable to imagine anything beyond that point. I'm not sure what a remaster would have in store but only fixing the grammatical errors would do wonders.

*** I tried to make this brief but even brief explanations made this way way too long... but this is still shorter than reading a million words I suppose.

Year 1- James and Lily managed to escape to Germany with Harry and Harry grew up there as a muggle. His parents still die during some sort of burglary. Harry befriends two muggleborn ocs (Natalie and Clyde) and Hermione. Ron is a Slytherin and the Weasley children are separated. The Malfoys are forced to adopt a muggleborn who ends up being Hermione, she and Draco are close. Snape picked up Harry from the Dursleys. Harry speaks to Nagini and doesn't realize it, catches Voldemort's attention. Quidditch rivalry results in him being stranded in the woods and somehow meeting Remus. He writes in the diary and over the summer and Voldemort somehow gives it a different body so it doesn't kill Harry.

Year 2- Tom Riddle attends as a fifth year named Thomas Rook, tries very hard to befriend Harry, and opens the chamber of secrets. Quirrel steps down and the new DADA teacher is nasty. Umbridge is brought in to help teach the course (for some reason). Tom gives Umbridge a device that lets her be understood by the basilisk and she takes over so Tom has plausible deniability. The staff claim its an Acromantula but Harry and co. figure out it isn't. Hermione and Harry get close but Snape modifies her memory and forces Harry to sign a contract so he can't speak about the truth. Harry is taken along by Voldemort for some PR thing, figures out its a Basilisk by finding a book in his library, and they do a weird pagan thing and Voldemort decides to 'mentor' Harry or whatever. Harry makes his way down to the chamber and confronts Umbridge, Umbridge is crazy and tries to kill him, Harry still kills the basilisk. Umbridge manages to escape but doesn't last long - Tom finds out she tried to kill Harry and screwed everything up and kills her. Voldemort knew it was Tom but waits until the end of the year to kill him and lock his soul away in a different artifact.

Year 3- Harry meets Remus and Sirius over the summer and is. Weird werewolf stuff but the way Voldemort managed all the werewolves is interesting. Harry is also stuck living with Snape. Moody is the crazy escaped convict instead of Sirius, and Moody actually wants to kill both Voldemort and Harry (because they're affiliated? This makes more sense when reading). Bad stuff happens to Harry all year. New DADA teacher is a former sentinel, Larousse, with a vendetta against werewolves. She comes in with a plan to marry Snape and then adopt Harry. She's moderately crazy but it actually works. Voldemort announces construction on the castle and - this is really stupid - Moody manages to keep infiltrating the place by disguising as one of the construction workers. The Order of the Phoenix is still a thing off in Germany but doesn't actually want to kill Harry, but Voldemort takes advantage of their relation to Moody and makes it seem like Dumbledore wants Harry dead and is an evil child murderer. Year ends with Moody about to blow up the castle, Voldemort getting hit by an Avada Kedavra and coming back to life (this part is kind of badass), and Larousse going to marry Snape but dying.

Year 4- Harry's been set up to be a really likable public figure and some sort of success story (child of two rebels), and Voldemort decides to have him work in the mailroom or something for German ambassadors because Harry grew up in Germany. Here he finds out the Triwizard cup is happening. Also over the summer Harry kind of gives up any chance of seeing his parents in heaven (apparently that's canonical) to save Sirius by becoming pagan, and this whole thing was kind of set up by Voldemort. The French are friendly (they're a monarchy in the story so they're cool with Voldemort's whole "absolute power" thing) while the Germans' intentions are pretty dubious. Same champions, Harry is never chosen, but the tasks are different (Bellatrix is the headmistress of Hogwarts, which is pretty entertaining, and she makes the tasks). From Viktor's pov we find out a few things - Snape is known as an assassin, nobody really knows what Voldemort's been up to outside of Britain due to them locking down, and Viktor is part of the Order. During the first task someone working for Germany releases these magical spying bugs (literal bugs) that attach themselves to important British officials. One of them is Lucius Malfoy, who is the highest ranking military official (and actually competent). Voldemort has Lucius set up a thinly disguised army. Then in the second task shit goes down and Cedric is out of commission. Cedric (again, for some reason) made Harry his second. I assume this is because Harry's known to be pretty good in the dueling club Snape runs. Then Harry does some sort of pagan ritual in an attempt to make Voldemort a bit less of a prick (mend his soul) but this ends up making Voldemort very ill and very angry for a few days. It actually almost kills him because Voldemort's immortality comes from him - get this - murdering pagan gods and then eating them, and so he absorbs a certain part of their essence (??????) - and the ritual involved the same sort of power. Harry flips out upon finding out he almost killed his "mentor" and the Celtic Studies professor that helped him imperiuses him to spare him from Voldemort's rage and escape with the fleeing Durmstrang students (who were accused of attacking Voldemort, which they didn't but they were certainly up to no good).

And before all of this Harry keeps writing letters to Tom and eventually an owl finds where Voldemort hid him. Tom possesses the owl, witnessed the magical bugs released during the first task, possesses a student, decides he wants to kill Voldemort and take his place, and writes an anonymous letter to Lucius about the German infiltration so he can watch hell break loose. Harry is in a weird limbo in Germany, attends Durmstrang, meets Dumbledore, and the German minister tries to use him as some sort of political tool to get re-elected. Voldemort viciously murders the Celtic Studies teacher and considers killing Harry before deciding to just find a way to guarantee his loyalty instead.

Year 5- Harry spends the summer with Dumbledore, Dumbledore makes some weird remarks and is pretty in character, and then the German minister stages some sort of death eater attack (which is pretty incompetent considering death eaters haven't been a thing for years) to steal Harry back from Dumbledore (the minister and Dumbledore are at odds but united in the effort to handle the Voldemort problem). Voldemort gives an ultimatum that the minister be given up to Britain for execution if Harry isn't returned (or something like that). Harry escapes during the fake death eater attack and has this crazy return trip to Britain using a dwarven tunnel. He meets a talking raven named Bobby. Snape discovers the student Tom possessed and is injured. Harry throws a rock at Voldemort and breaks his nose, Voldemort kind of tortures Harry, then they make up or whatever. Sirius kills Fenrir Greyback and becomes the leader of the werewolves, Greyback is kind of reincarnated as this wolf god / spirit of war. It looks like there's going to be war with Germany, or there already is one. Harry becomes even more of a public figure and proposes Britain take German werewolf refugees (long story). People start seeing Harry as a prince while Voldemort kind of a king. Harry is really stressed all year and has these panic attacks, but takes this pagan thing (basically some drug) that relaxes him. Slughorn is the potions professor, Snape is the defense professor. Somewhere in all of this Harry is taken along to France to watch Voldemort negotiate taking werewolf refugees and for Britain to get some military bases on the French-German border. Meets the French queen, who is cool. Then it turns out the drugs Harry were taking made it easier for him to be possessed by a Celtic spirit, so Fenrir possesses him and leads some sort of werewolf march on Germany in a tunnel. Also, surprise, the prophecy is still a thing. Neville was killed and Harry's parents lied and had his birthday officially be August 1. Snape finds out Harry was actually born the 31st (weird astrology thing with centaurs that showed up last year, then a potion). This is probably my favorite part, in which Snape is conflicted over whether he should kill Harry to ensure the reign of the regime he is loyal to, or spare the person he's grown close to. During the werewolf march / battle, Snape gets the opportunity to slip Harry a potion that will kill him painlessly, but backs out last second. Germans show up and there's even more of a battle. War officially breaks out and shit really hits the fan.

I could not tell you where year 5 ends and year 6 begins, I just know the events that happen, so this is going to be very off. And I also need another comment. Uh oh.

**** Year 6- So way back after Snape discovered Tom, Tom booked it to Germany and somehow managed to get safety in a group of vampires in Berlin. But then Britain invades Berlin and manages to hold it, and they're all trapped. Tom possesses a British soldier during this and climbs the ranks. Some time during this Lucius has had enough of Hermione being smart and independent, so he decides to marry her off to.. Barty Crouch Jr. (who leads the foreign intelligence department and is an omnipotent bastard). Crouch takes the deal so Lucius forgives some debt. Harry becomes some sort of werewolf ambassador and Germany actually does some shit - they attack some Irish villages that uphold protective wards over the British isles. Germany invades London. And remember Ron? Ron finds out that Lucius Malfoy was the reason his father was thrown into Azkaban for so long, and Arthur dies in Azkaban from illness. So Ron.. get this.. uses a pagan ritual spell (inspired by Harry) he doesn't understand to curse Lucius, the most important general, while Britain is at war. But Ron screws up and is slowly dying as well and Harry has to fix everything. In the mean time, this curse is being carried out by Tom (possessing a man named Reginald Strattus) who is slowly poisoning Lucius as his assistant in hopes of taking his place. This makes little sense but Tom certainly has drive. At some point Germany attacks Hogwarts but the castle prevails and it fails miserably. At some other point Germany gets some Italian aid. Interesting tid bit is that Italians despise Britain and Spain ignores them.

And this is kind of where the fever dream begins. At some point Harry travels to Ireland to talk to some werewolves, takes a bunch of sentinels (soldiers) with him, then they all get kidnapped by fae? Elves? Something like that. Yep. It's actually really cool though and we discover some really really important information but I can't really get into it. Tom (as Strattus) is here too and is the only one who really knows about the elves but it doesn't help much. Bobby the raven (remember him?) helps Harry escape. And here we are at perhaps the most badass part in which Voldemort shows up after returning from the frontline of the war (I think somewhere in Poland), burns down the elven city, and kind of leaves the soldiers to die but says he won't punish them if they escape by themselves. Snape and Lucius show up as well. The motive for kidnapping Harry was so Harry could fulfill the prophecy and kill Voldemort so the (fae? elves?) could resurrect him and have them be their king. This is because the king (Gulandri) can't rule forever and can't think of anyone he'd approve of to take his place. Turns out the king and Voldemort have some history and they have this insane battle. Voldemort probably would've won if he hadn't been seriously poisoned by the king's daughter, but instead they stalemate when Gulandri stabs him with a sword and Voldemort spits his blood at him (which is poisonous, by the way). Then Voldemort makes Harry chop off his poisoned / dead arm using Gulandri's sword. Yikes. The arm comes back though after he steals an arm from some prisoner, and then eventually grows his own back using like all of Harry's magic (??)

Ok rapid fire, Harry and his friends try to emancipate Hermione so she doesn't marry Crouch Jr., Lucius and Harry end up having this kind of cold war in which they definitely aren't allowed to hurt each other but still try to undermine each other. Lucius is going insane from the curse until Ron asks Harry to help him reverse it. Because Harry saved Lucius, he's forced to take back making Hermione marry Crouch. But Lucius is still really angry so instead he has Hermione marry Strattus. Tom (possessing Strattus) isn't happy but takes the offer. Then at a party the Malfoys host over winter break all hell breaks loose - Crouch Jr. tells Lucius Hermione was going to emancipate herself, Lucius freaks the fuck out (Hermione outsmarted him), Harry blackmails Rita Skeeter into helping Hermione escape (again, long story), Lucius flips out on Harry and nearly breaks his arm, Harry breaks Lucius's nose, and then the house gains sentience and makes Harry fall down the stairs. Harry is seriously injured and Tom is watching the whole thing. So Tom briefly possesses Crouch Jr, has him cast the killing curse at Lucius (he wanted him dead anyways), and the house makes a chandelier fall on Crouch, killing him instantly.

So naturally this is pretty bad during war. Nobody knows what happened, including Voldemort. Voldemort pins the murder of Lucius on Hermione but know it wasn't her. Hermione is forced to flee to France. Harry told Snape it was Ron who cursed Lucius and Voldemort thinks the curse is involved, but Snape never told him. The story instead was that Harry did the curse but underestimated it. Back at Hogwarts Voldemort smells bs and tortures Snape to find out who really did it. Meanwhile, Harry is detained at one of the Hogwarts towers and soon to be interrogated. And while all of this is going down, Germans invade Hogwarts again but now with Dumbledore's knowledge of the castle. Bad news is that Snape is really rattled, good news is that Voldemort is there and kind of sweeps the floor with them. Except it isn't nearly enough, and I can't really explain what happens but Harry and Voldemort summon a really nasty storm and the Germans have to surrender.

Year 7- ok ok this is short. Hogwarts is destroyed but they plan on rebuilding, a seventh year is up in the air. Britain is negotiating the terms of Germany's surrender in France and basically gains control over Germany. Voldemort is in some sort of relationship with the Queen (it's very much a means to an end). During the negotiations a woman attacks Voldemort (who is very much being a jerk and rubbing it in their faces). Snape is trying to win back Voldemort's favor after lying to his face and is trying to track down Dumbledore, who was spotted in France. And the entire story ends on a cliffhanger in which Harry challenges some military person from Germany who hates werewolves to a duel and Harry sort of wins the duel but is dying? And yep. That's it. I remember way too much.

** A rewrite/remaster of over a million words? Yeah ... chances are that'll lose its steam after awhile. The author will definitely have to enlist the help of others for that, otherwise what tends to happen is that they get all excited and motivated for redoing the first ten or so chapters, and then lose their drive once the fixes and backtracking become too much.

It's like suffering through one loooooong flashback that you're trying to patch up. Then starts the dreaded cycle of fix, see something else to fix, doesn't quite feel as perfect as it could be, and then fix again ... over and over. And that goes for both the grammar and the plot in most rewrites.

** I saw the notification in my email and my jaw dropped when I read the title of the fic. I really thought that this fic was going to be one of those abandoned works that has an insane amount of words but no conclusion with the author gone with no trace. It's still one of my favorite works of fanfiction I have read.

I have no idea how they plan to turn it into an original work though. The plot is original but it still relies a lot on Harry Potter worldbuilding. The characters are written so well some of them I like better than their canon counterparts but they are still very recognizable as HP characters.

I can't imagine how much work it will be to edit a 1.2 million word fic. Even if nothing comes of this I am glad to know that the author is still around and seems to be doing fine. I did wonder what happened to them.
