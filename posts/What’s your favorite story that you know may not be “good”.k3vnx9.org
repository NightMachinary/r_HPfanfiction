Throughout my time reading fan fiction I've read some really great stories with amazing characters, interesting plots, and fun new perspectives on canon, but I know I've really enjoyed stories that lack at least some of those things. Personally I've always really enjoyed Harry Potter and the Summer of Change. Objectively I know that it's rather a standard power fantasy that's only a couple degrees away from your standard “lord Potter-Black-Prevell-Gryfindor-Slytherin” story. I just want to know what stories other people like that, while they may not be the best the fandom has to offer, are still a lot of fun for you to read.


** For me "Harry Crow" comes to mind. It is kind of a guilty pleasure fic for me, I read it every once in a while and enjoy it a lot, but would never recc it. Unless if someone is actually looking for a trope-y, clichee-riddled power trip of a story.

And in a broader sense, Harry/Multi fics. I like a lot of fics from that genre, but I am fully aware that finding good ones is very rare.

*** To be fair though, Harry Crow was the OG Goblin Friend Fic. That guy started the trope.

**** Mhh, I don't think so. Harry Crow was started in 2012. I have stumbled upon the occasional "goblin friend" fic when I started getting into HP fanfiction back in 2002 or 2003. And I remember there being a big wave of fics using the trope in 2007/2008 after Deathly Hallows was released.

But I agree that Harry Crow certainly revived the trope and spawned a ton of fics in the years after it was released.

** I have two candidates for this, both for different reasons.

A Black Comedy is the first one. The main reason I'm not as enthusiastic about it now as I was back when I first read it is because the humor is of a /very/ specific style (fratbro slapstick, basically), and things like the midget detentions and the Potter house elf literally singing an antebellum-era slavery song have /not/ aged well. That said, the overall premise is good, the plot is engaging, and there's an honest-to-god twist near the end that I didn't see coming the first time I read it, which is like finding a unicorn since this is still, at the end of the day, a fanfic comedy.

The Lone Traveler series is the second one. Harry is /hilariously/ OP (or ends up that way over time, at least) and the writing itself is...not all that spectacular, and it doesn't do a lot of showing instead of telling, and the narration gets kind of preachy regarding the virtues of free will. But sometimes I just want a mindless "OP Harry fixes all the things" and it fits the bill nicely for that, especially since it's very episodic and generally gets to the point rather quickly.

*** My first thought was Black Comedy! I mean plot works nicely and I Iike the humor as long as I sprinkle a looot of "this is not real" on top. At the same time if you look at themes at least a bit more seriously and understand what is shown as acceptable / normal you get creeped out

** for me it's Harry's new home.

Snape mentor is ok and actually fics I look for but... that one is so bad. Harry behaves like five year old (and he isn't the only one), Snape is mushy, even though not as mushy as in other fics, hufflepuffs are disliked, Slytherins are liked, and to get the two houses together, Ravenclaw was used as the villain. Harry was beaten by the Dursleys and yet Snape swats him for things that just aren't his fault at all (like the troll... come one, it was unfair enough in the canon), Snape gets two girlfriends (as if one wasn't enough), slytherins be like, he is a Snake because he is Snape's. so he is one of us. blah blah. ... and lots of other stuff but I still like it.

and then the one with OP Harry time travel where he is called Hurricane. nothing bad about it but the usual OP Harry cliches.

**** so that one that Sirius introduced him to, but then in the epilogue there was some female potions mistress in New Zealand mentioned. I had to check it, but it looks like it's only Molly and Minerva who are planning to introduce them... but it looks like he didn't really start anything with Brunhilde either. still, it could have just ended with him getting together with Brunhilde and not write anything else about a potential other one. I mean, they were on enough dates. it annoys me even more since it was just like an addendum and it really didn't have to be there in the epilogue.

** *Pendant of Slytherin* and the *Cupboard Series.*

They're both really tropey guilty pleasures with a more-than-fair share of manipulative Dumbledore, but they're hit-or-miss in a way that some of the hits are really, really good. Pendant is like a slightly less angsty version of A Cadmean Victory. But I found quite a bit better, partly because of one extremely, extremely good chapter where Harry and Draco go on a rampage through the world of the Hogwarts paintings. I don't know where the author found that writing, because nothing else in the fic comes close. It's a good story though.

Cupboard is a really generic, over the top manipulative Dumbledore H/Hr story, but the cohesiveness is actually fine, and like everything by Stargon1 it's super addictive.

** Wow, am I surprised that nobody has said HPMoR yet. It was my first fanfic, and I was particularly engaged by the podcast audio version. In hindsight of course, the beginning was a train wreck. +2 spoons, Harry being a whiny bitch, Draco's future plans for Luna, all of those are cringey at best. However, once the story starts gaining some momentum, there are some really good bits of dialogue, and some great action scenes. It's not the best, it's not the worst, but it is one of the most controversial.
