In a different recommendation post ([[https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b60p64/looking_for_any_fics_with_harry_hermione_or_ginny/]])

Someone gave this description for a fic:

There's one fic I don't remember the name of where Hermione's parents think Sirius is grooming Hermione (he wasn't) so they do the worst possible thing if it was actually a grooming situation and give her a "us or them" Ultimatum. She picks "them" and basically gets adopted by Remus

And I like the sound of it enough to try and find it, anyone recognise it?
