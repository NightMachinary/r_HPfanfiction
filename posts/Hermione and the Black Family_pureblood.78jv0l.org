Just finished reading linkffn(Presque Toujurs Pur) and want to read more stories where Hermione is a part of the Black family or other pureblood families. Either discovering that she is actually a Black or another pure blood/halfblood or just traveling through time and ending up dating a Black/other purebloods (not Sirius, have read 90% of those stories). As long as the story focuses somewhat on the pureblood family and Hermiones part in it

Thank you!


** A bit different from what you mentioned, but in linkffn(Desperate Measures) by MaryRoyale, Hermione is blood-adopted as an infant by Cassiopeia Black. The story is very much focused on Hermione and the Black family.

  Cassiopeia Black wasn't the sort who was willing to just sit idly by while her House fell down around her. When Cassiopeia is given a Muggleborn witch orphaned by Death Eaters, she uses magical adoption to make the baby a true Black. Pureblood!Hermione. Slytherin!Hermione.

** "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12304702/1/Red-Right-Hand][Red Right Hand]]" by Nautical Paramour is a bit different: Hermione goes back in time to raise Tom Riddle and marries into the Black family. She herself is not pureblood but it's a really interesting plot and well written. It's a very interesting look at the pureblood family as well.
