** Story unfortunately suffers from what most Gamer stories do: information overload. It's quite unnecessary and very jarring to have the story interrupted by his stats.

*** Sorry about that. That was a one time thing. For readers who haven't read Gamer fics before. There will be far less system info in the future updates.

**** I guess this one [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11950816/1/]] , but I wasn't really talking about fics in the Harry Potter fandom.
