I'm looking for stories where Lily is a social climber.

Perhaps she only stayed friends with Snape to use him for better grades.

Perhaps she got married to James for higher status

Etc.

BUT I do NOT want stories where she is the devil or queen of hell or other crap like that. Just a powerful witch looking to get ahead.


** That's in the Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs.

** Well, it's a fic with decent ideas, but poor execution and it didn't age well, but /To Fight the Coming Darkness/ by jbern implies that

#+begin_quote
  she got married to James for higher status
#+end_quote

is true.

** If she were that way, she would probably not sacrifice herself for Harry, but let Voldemort kill Harry.

Or maybe she would be paranoid and distrusting enough that they added more nasty traps and escape routes on top of the Fidelius.

Or maybe she would ask Dumbledore to cast Fidelius on a second property to protect Sirius, with James being the secret keeper.

Anyway, a highly utilitarian Lily would most likely derail the canon Halloween 1981 event.

*** People can want to climb the social made and still love their children. In fact both are encouraged for women, like in all the stories where women marry a Prince Charming type.

** Then what would be the use of Harry in this fic?

**** Oh, I see. So the reason you want to read about Lily is for storyline possibilities? (Seeing as not much about her personality is revealed in the books, except for that she sacrifices herself).
