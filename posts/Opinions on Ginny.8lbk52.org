Everyone has characters they like or dislike, and I often find people disliking Ginny as a character. If you don't like her, what are your reasons? My only regret is that she isn't as fleshed out as she should have been, what with pairing with the main character, but I don't see any reason to dislike her. Personally, that is.


** I don't dislike her. I just find that she lacks scope. She's the ultimate safe choice. Her and Harry getting together wraps up the series in a neat little self contained bow. The series could have finished with a 'and they lived happily ever after, The END.' I don't want that. I didn't like the epilogue, its too clean, too stifling. I want more of Harry's world not less. The Harry/Ginny epilogue closed off so many paths.

** I love Ginny, but do understand and agree with some of the criticism of how she was handled in the books. I personally feel she was a really interesting and complex character who was given a good backstory and a lot of interesting traits, but Rowling chose not to do anything with it. I especially think she missed some great opportunities of character development by not having her play a larger role in the Deathly Hallows. Rowling basically created this great character and just shuffled her to the background way too often, only bringing her to the forefront to build up the romance.

**** Hell JKR could've included her in PoA/GoF as she was recovering from Tom's possession, and had her help out in an attempt to clear her conscience of what she "did". Molly could've asked Ron and Harry to keep an eye on her and make sure she's not going off the deep end or what-have-you. Maybe have her grow tired or the attention and blow up at them saying that she's fine, that she doesn't need to be coddled. I don't know, maybe it would've been forced, but it would be better than having a ham-fisted romance and epilogue.

**** You know, she didn't even elevate Ginny to Neville's level. I would've almost taken that!

Consider that both Neville and Ginny have a right to fight in the last battle and have personal grudges against Voldemort/Death Eaters. Yet Neville is heroic and gets his redemption by killing Nagini. He has fully assumed the role of leader of the DA and a badass.

Whereas Ginny has to be told to stay behind, and she sorta throws a bit of a tantrum arguing to fight. But then she acquiesces. Then she sneaks out and tries to fight Bellatrix but needs to be saved by her mother. She never gets to get her revenge against Voldemort, never destroys a Horcrux, and proves everyone right who said she was not strong enough to fight by needing to be rescued by Molly.

**** Yeah, Ginny seems downgraded during /Deathly Hallows/, particularly during the battle. For example: Ginny should definitely have destroyed one of the Horcruxes (Nagini or the Diadem most likely). I mean why Crabbe, of all people, rather than Ginny? That's a missed opportunity! Think of it, she avenges her possession by Tom Riddle through a Horcrux by destroying one herself. It is made clear to everyone, both to the characters and the fans of the series that "size is no guarantee of power" and that "anything's possible if you've got enough nerve" by explicitly showing, not only telling. Character arc resolved. Easy!

** I think she kind of ended up being a caricature of a character rather than a believable, three-dimensional one. I think a lot of people who felt she was more than that were filling in the blanks of her personality with traits in which fan-fiction fleshed out further, and forgot that the books didn't really do a good job of that. In book six she reminded me of a character from a poorly written YA fiction. When an author is super on the nose about what a character is like without leading you to that conclusion yourself. "Hey everyone it's Ginny! She's a sporty independent girl who is sassy with a temper. If I write about her getting mad enough and having a 'blazing' look, you'll believe me!"

** Movie Ginny slightly irritates me because she kind of comes out of nowhere, since she is never shown interacting with Harry and is kind of just brushed off. I actually forgot about her completely in 3, 4, and sadly for most of 5 (yes, despite her being part of DA). So when Harry starts crushing on her in HBP, I was really confused about where it came from.

I agree with you though- I really wish she was fleshed out more. She had a lot of good potential that was never tapped into (in the books. Movie version just needs a total overhaul imho).

** We had several surveys done here and results show teenage girls hate her most and adult women like her best.

My theory is that those girls who put themselves in Hermione's role and want to be paired with Harry make up the largest Ginny hating group.

Of course, there are other reasons too, a major one being that she had red hairs and thus resembled Harry's mum, even though there was ZERO EVIDENCE of that in the Books.

There was one sub member I had a lengthy conversation about that issue. That person finally admitted that red haired people are extremely rare in their place and that he/she thought that they must look all alike. Well, up to 10% of British population have red hairs.

Finally, the Movies trashed her character. Screenwriter Steve Kloves publicly admitted being an Emma Watson fan and pushed for a Harry/Hermione outcome. He worked very hard to bash Ron and Ginny, by giving half of Ron's lines to Hermione and cutting ALL Ginny's best moments in the Books.

It's true that Hollywood writers often subvert the canon, such as the bashing of Denethor II in the Lord of the Rings. But that guy was only a minor character with a few lines. HP Series is pretty much an exception in which the second most important character (Ron had more appearances than Hermione in Books) was bashed.

Either way she wasn't a bad guy, just because the marauders were sometimes dicks doesn't mean they weren't good natured. Gryffindor is just that, a thing they had in common. And motherly can be interpreted however, considering everyone's mother is different. Is giving your life to protect your child not motherly? Lily did.

Oh jeez, don't get your knickers in a twist. Cursing isn't a sign of being upset. I just needed the best way to put my absolute amazement for that statement into words. Sure, motherly can mean anything, but usually that phrasing implies earthy types like Molly. It doesn't fit either Lily or Ginny at all. You would have had a better argument if you claimed they were similar because they both appear to lack motherly qualities. Martyrdom (Lily) isn't usually associated with nurturing - at the very least it's a huge stretch. She's presented as a warrior.

#+begin_quote
  were sometimes dicks doesn't mean they weren't good natured
#+end_quote

Sure whatever. With that type of effort good natured becomes completely meaningless and just refers to anyone who isn't a literal Death Eater. I'm not in the mood for semantics though: We know that the marauders pulled mean spirited pranks, it's the opposite of good natured. Neville is good natured.

#+begin_quote
  Gryffindor is just that
#+end_quote

I know you said that they weren't great similarities, but why even bring that up? More similarities: They both drank pumpkin juice, ate bread on occasion and went to Hogwarts. They also enjoyed to sleep at night and be busy during the day. So what?

********* Martyr is just one example for Lily that, while also painting her as warrior, is undeniably motherly. Being the one to keep the Marauders in check some of the time is another simple example. Good natured isn't as black and white as the marauders being mean spirited some of the time and Neville being a pussy most of the time. There's a rather large gray area of who would stand up at which moment, like Neville in DH after getting over being a puss. As for being a Gryffindor, while there are certainly exceptions to the traits such as those you mentioned, which house you're sorted into is taken much more seriously in the verse. Such as blatant discrimination against slytherins who aren't all bad, and so on. I do apologize for my knickers in a twist, as I assumed yours were lol. Although, from the rest of your replying, I believe you're more than capable of putting your amazement into less snide words.

Also I really like the idea of her getting over her crush and getting to know Harry as a friend, but I really didn't see that actually happening in canon. She's just dating around and her only interactions with Harry seem to center around quidditch Then she's conveniently available when he becomes interested in her and BAM back in love.

****** Respectfully I disagree to an extent. Rowling was not overt about Ginny but she did get a significantly increased role in book 5. Rowling set it up so we start seeing Ginny as an actual friend of Harry's, someone who can stand up to him as a true friend would (Christmas at Grimmauld Place), but also be there to help him in a time of need (library scene and Battle of Dept. of Mysteries).

Then in the summer before his 6th year, he genuinely spends a lot of time with Ginny and that's when the feelings become more obvious. I remember reading this at the time of its release and felt that when Ginny became the clear love interest, it didn't actually surprise me. And realistically, I have no issue with how his feelings developed.

I think it's just wrong to say he had no interactions with Ginny prior to winding up with her. He did have a couple moments with Luna where she provided comfort after Sirius' death, but it seems disingenuous to argue against Ginny because she came out of nowhere, but then argue that he should be paired with her when she quite literally came out of nowhere in book 5.

******* Totally agree with you. Ginny did not come out of nowhere. She was one of the first magical people Harry meets and is a secondary character in every book except for the first. JKR makes it clear from the very beginning that Ginny had a crush on Harry so it's not even like their eventual romance comes out of nowhere. I fully believe JKR when she says that she had always planned for Harry and Ginny to be together.

When I was 11 and the books were coming out it was obvious to almost everyone that this was the case, I feel like people only started to really question it when the movies started coming out.

As for Luna/Harry, he meets her in the 5th book, describes her as weird and strange and while he eventually becomes her friend and helps her out shes almost a non entity in the last two books. Luna was placed there so that Harry would have a connection to her dad, both for the Quibbler and for the Hallows later on.

My point is Luna appears in book 5, gets a lot of screen time, is well developped (more than most side-characters in the books, wether you include Ginny or not), and doesn't have much of an impact on the plot or a function in the story. I mean, she's vastly overcharacterized considering her objective part in the story and the way other characters are treated (I'd have to reread the books, but I think we know more about Luna than about Cho Chang, who's Harry's love interest in book 4. I'd say she's on par with Neville, whom we know from book 1).\\
So I think either Rowling liked the character and wanted to use it, or she had something else planned for her but didn't go through with it for some reason (or a little bit of both).

************ I disagree that Luna is a significantly developed character. She is presented to us fully formed. She has a dynamic character and lots of fun and quirky traits but that's not really development.

Ginny is more developed in that we see her exist in one form at the beginning of the book, and then when she returns to us she has developed into a different character. Of course, the big problem here is that specific development is off page. So it feels really lacking. But she is a fully formed and complex character by book 6.

As to the meaningful moments between Harry and Ginny prior to book 6, I can give you three:

- Harry rescuing her from the chamber
- Ginny telling Harry off in OOTP
- Ginny providing comfort to Harry in the library (OOTP) when he is worried about Sirius.

Yes, if they never got together, these moments don't seem so big and meaningful, but they do play a role in Harry seeing Ginny as more than just Ron's sister and someone who he can care about. Then you just add the frequent moments they have together in book 6 to solidfy the friendship and include the fact that Ginny is older and objectively attractive and there ya go.

That whole thing is completely idiocy anyway. Maybe I have some major malfunction, but I have zero squick about brother/sister incest, because I don't have a sister.

But maybe today I will learn something about human sexuality or myself. Is there anyone who didn't grow up with a female sibling (or sibling-like) relationship, who is grossed out by brother/sister incest on a physical (instead of on a intellectual/ration) level?

Putting aside all the sex stuff for a moment: Harry doesn't have *any* normal familial relations. He has no idea what it's like to have a mother or father or anyone who loves him on a familial level. Least of all a sister.

I completely eliminated Ron/Hermione after he abandoned them in the tent and Hermione had some kind of nervous breakdown and depression because of it. "Yup, there's no coming back from this."

That was the point I distinctly remember as losing all faith in character-relationship stuff and just finishing the book to see how it ends (plot-wise).

I think after HBP I still thought JKR had something clever planned in regards to relationships (similar as with the whole Snape thing). After the camping trip bullshit I was sure that I was wrong and that H/G would be similarly stupid - at least that one was just /nothing/ instead of actively bad.

She just brought doom upon herself by printing the epilogue, giving the whole pairing stuff much bigger significance than it should have (some people claim that fanfiction is solely at fault for taking that stuff way too serious, but JKR paved the way).

Edit: Earlier today we had a thread here where someone complained that he doesn't like tagged pairings in fanfiction.

** I dislike her, mostly because she is pretty empty as far as characterization goes. Her singularly significant experience is possession by Voldemort but it has absolutely no effect on the story. Harry suddenly developing the monster in his chest for her came way out of left field, so I just can't find what I'm supposed to think about her other than "She was a person who was there", like everyone else. That aside, she has a temper and be kinda bitchy (being angry at Fleur felt totally fake), can do a good Bat-Bogey Hex and likes Quidditch? It's like a checklist, she didn't feel like a cohesive person who developed the way Harry and Hermione did.

The end of HBP was particularly bad for her character. She says she knew Harry wouldn't be happy unless he was out fighting Voldemort, which is like the pinnacle of not understanding who Harry is. Everyone and their mother knew Harry had to fight Voldemort as it was all over the papers about him being the "chosen one", but it wasn't because he liked it. It was because Riddle needed to be stopped and Harry had the ability to do it. Harry was always driven by that sort of thing, helping because he could help, but the series (OoTP especially) makes it clear he didn't want to be the one to fight Voldemort in the end out of glory or happiness, even though he sort of knew that it would have to be him.

He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was seventeen... he had become Hogwarts champion... he was standing on the grounds, his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were applauding and screaming... he had just won the Triwizard Tournament.

  Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.

It's the sort of "wanting" that everyone has but they recognize it's practically non-existent because they aren't going to do the required work.

There's no indication that Harry wouldn't be willing to do the required work. In fact, after he found himself in the tournament, he did do the required work. Your example doesn't make sense because the fantasy part of this is largely driven by the fact that Harry is supposed to be /ineligible/ for the tournament.

****** The obligation I was talking about was the moral obligation, not the prophecy. Harry wanted to kill Voldemort even without the prophecy basically because of revenge. I mean, you can read the above quote for yourself:

#+begin_quote
  Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. /He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done./ A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.

  “I'd want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I'd want to do it.”
#+end_quote

That's essentially motivation for revenge, which we're told is because of the horrible.things Voldemort has done, particularly to those he cares about. He feels compelled to be the one to do it to get even, which is understandable. But the previous user saying a desire for greatness is involved is just unfoundedm

***** The whole purpose of that discourse is that Dumbledore is leading Harry through a journey of self-discovery. At the start Harry /thinks/ he wants to finish Voldemort out of obligation, but Dumbledore challenges him to think further on the issue, which results in Harry coming to the conclusion that even in the absence of obligation, he would want to kill Voldemort. Not to help - anyone killing Voldemort would achieve that goal - but because it would give him personal satisfaction: "I'd want to do it."

We see the same character trait coming through at the end of HBP, when Harry expresses a personal desire to be the one to kill Snape.

I already said it elsewhere, but I want to say it here too: Harry may tell himself that, but if he truly believes it he's completely delusional. It's like he's trying to indoctrinate himself into being a soldier.

You can of course claim that this isn't out of character and part of his character development, that he becomes someone who takes pride in being a warrior and taking down the bad guys, but it feels (thematically) wrong, since the whole resolution hinges on sacrificial love and protectiveness. It just doesn't gel with the theme IMHO.

I don't have a problem with that, but that's always in the heat of the moment. He's not after Draco because he hates the guy, but because he thinks that he's up to something and feels responsible to protect the school. Him blowing his top in the bathroom is a perfect example - he probably would have been embarrassed about himself even if he had chosen a less lethal spell in that scenario. IMHO this and a reluctance to take that role goes all the way back to Year 1.

In my head-canon The only reason that the hat offered Harry Slytherin is either the Horcrux in his head or that it would do Harry good to cultivate Slytherin qualities (self-interest, cunning, calculated revenge) which he lacks. These kind of Slytherin qualities resemble Harry the least of all the houses.

Edit: In any case, the whole thing - to me - implies that he wouldn't be happy if magically someone elsee popped up who defeated Voldemort for him. The notion is completely absurd to me. IMHO he would be overjoyed!

I think we do learn a lot about Ginny, both her actual physical and personality traits, as well as her inner motivations and a decent backstory. Again, problem is we really didn't see that backstory develop on-page as part of the overall story.

People like to point of the "out-of-nowhere" aspect of this but again I disagree. Rowling clearly built the relationship in Harry's mind on a subconscious level through how Harry described Ginny from book 1 onward. In book 5, we genuinely see them become friends and they share several one-on-one interactions in the book. Then the relationship explodes in his mind, and a crush develops after he spends a significant amount of time with Ginny during the summer.

Part of the problem is romance takes a back seat for most of the series, perhaps moreso than most YA fics. So we expect more from Rowling on this front. Keep in mind she did spend a lot of time over the whole series of the Ron/Hermione romance so perhaps she felt it redundant to do the same for Harry and Ginny.

  Mary sue as she can be spiteful, jealous, and not a decent human being at times and has a temper
#+end_quote

A typical sign of a Mary Sue are "token" negative traits... which are extremely minor or actually good things. It's like answering in a job interview to the question "What's your biggest flaw?" with "Sometimes I work too hard".

Her spitefulness is usually shown as cool and admirable. You really have to divorce yourself from the text to reflect on it as something not super great (in the text everyone is in awe of her and her bat-bogey hex). Jealousy falls into the same category. We even have precedent with the awful Ron/Hermione relationship, where jealousy is used to show how deeply Hermione loves Ron (and not as some kind of moral about how she's acting out of character and behaves in an awful way, because of irrational jealousy). JKR really doesn't seem to consider jealousy as a negative trait and in fact seems to view it as something that legitimises a couple. Ginny having a temper is also shown in mostly a positive light... it's one of the most often cited points in regards to how she is perfect for Harry, because she's not afraid to yell at him.

Really none of these things are suited to reduce her Mary Sue-ness and Ginny's complete 180 in characterization in order to be perfect for Harry (demurring to his wishes when he wants to break up and being 100% agreeable) puts the final nail in the coffin.

  I like Fanfiction Ginny.. for a while I accepted Movie/Book Canon Ginny, until I read fanfiction and realized how many other girls had better connections to Harry, and how ANY girl in HP could be linked to him in a single school year with only the slightest bit of actually trying.
#+end_quote

Actually canon pretty much lays it out that there really aren't any other women who have an equal connection to Harry, save Hermione who is also blatantly shown to not have that type of relationship with Harry. And this makes sense as why would Rowling write other female characters to be better matches than Ginny? Ginny simply checks off all the boxes for the ideal woman for Harry. Now, one could easily argue that Rowling did a poor job of showing this, rather than just telling, but the facts are the facts.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I'd only agree that perhaps Rowling didn't realize when writing how messed up love potions actually are. But there is no evidence to support this theory. For one, it would go against Ginny's character and Rowling's desires. Why would Rowling deliberately pair the hero with a girl who was drugging her? She wants the reader to see Ginny as perfect for Harry, and she wants Harry to have a happy life. So again, why? Second, logistically a love potion wouldn't work. Harry was gone the following year and there is no way he'd still be under the affects of the love potion. Face it, even if you don't like it, Harry genuinely loved Ginny.

#+begin_quote
  In general... I think Harry/Hermione would make a much better, stronger couple.
#+end_quote

Canon disagrees with you. In the few times we see Harry and Hermione alone together, it is described by Harry as not fun. When Hermione is distraught over Ron leaving during DH, Harry provides no comfort to her. He is awkward around her. When Harry almost kills Draco in HBP, Hermione does not provide him with comfort (Ginny does, btw) which is what he needs. She continues to scold him and make him feel even worse about what he did. Hermione is a great platonic friend, almost like a big sister. She nags Harry and scolds him out of love, and for him to be better. But it is not romantic in any sense, nor would they work romantically. Harry needs someone who is fun and shares his sense of humor, someone who can handle his moods and knows when to push him or back off. Ginny fills these roles and the book is quite clear on that.

#+begin_quote
  But if it wasn't going to be Hermione, based purely on his relationships and scenes with other girls, I would have chosen Luna for him.

I think people sort of misconstrue how Harry feels about Luna. He first finds her very odd. They don't really share much in common and Harry has a dry, sarcastic sense of humor, while Luna is quite literal. Harry appreciates her bluntness and loyalty and ability to just be herself. But he is not an eccentric character and people like Luna need equally eccentric people to make a relationship work. Plus he simply is not attracted to her. I think people pair them together because she provided comfort after he lost Sirius and they both have a death of a parent in their past. Most relationship experts would dispel the notion that a shared tragedy makes for a healthy relationship. And I think that is literally all that shippers of Harry/Luna can go on to support the ship. A real relationship works because the pair work on the day-to-day level that connects them, not the big stuff.

***** Eh, actually if I really think about it, a lot of the traits that make Ginny great for Harry are shown, not told. I know, I always thought the opposite was the case too but once you really think about it...

1) Sense of humor. A sense of humor is very important to Harry and Ginny is shown multiple times to be funny and share jokes and laughs with Harry. From their eye contact before cracking up moments to Ginny's Umbridge impression, this trait is definitely shown in the text.

2) Attractiveness: It's hard to show it I guess but Harry notices her attractive features, and other boys comment on how attractive she is.

3) Comfort: Ginny provides exactly what Harry needs in terms of comfort in many scenes. In the OOTP scene at Grimmauld Place, what Harry needs is a kick in the ass, and Ginny is shown doing so, which works. In HBP, Harry needs someone to support him at his lowest moment following his incident with Draco, and Ginny provides that by defending Harry to Hermione.

4) Normalcy: Harry needs to feel like a normal kid from time to time to keep his sanity. After they get together, there is a scene in the common room where Ginny is leaning up against Harry and they are joking around. It is a very typical, normal thing for teens to do and Ginny provides that for Harry before he needs to complete his mission.

5) Understanding: Harry is a tough boyfriend to have and he has a dangerous task ahead of him. He needs someone who understands the role he needs to play, and also understands his desire to be the one to fight evil. During the breakup scene, Ginny provides him with that understanding. She doesn't fight his decision; she accepts it to make it easier on him to accomplish what he needs to.

So the reasons why Ginny and Harry work together /are/ shown.

That's not true, to my recollection.

There's only a few girls Harry's on a friendly basis with in canon, and of them, only Ginny makes him laugh regularly.

I can't remember a single scene where Hermione is the one who actually makes him laugh, as opposed to them laughing at a joke Ron made.

I don't think Luna ever made him laugh at all, in canon.

The only other girls I could consider Harry friends with are the Quidditch Chasers, and of those, only Katie is ever really his equal--Alicia and Angelina are too old, and Demelza too young. And while she gives some excellent advice on his Captaincy, Katie doesn't make him laugh.

#+begin_quote
  other girls are attractive and Harry didn't find her attractive until suddenly in 6th year, leading me back to potions)
#+end_quote

While the idea that he found other girls pretty is a fair one, it's also worth noting that Harry didn't even start thinking girls were pretty until his third year, when Cho was the Ravenclaw Seeker.

But to think that he only thought Ginny was pretty because of love potions is ridiculous. We saw what kind of obsessive, *lustful* imitation of "love" was created by love potions, when Romilda Vane dosed the Cauldron Cakes and Ron ate them. It doesn't even come close to Harry's desire to be with Ginny.

#+begin_quote
  Luna and Hermione have both provided comfort at times...
#+end_quote

To your first point, Luna comforts Harry twice, in very specific circumstances:

After the death of Sirius, she simply says "I'm sorry about your friend, Harry. He was your godfather, right? Ginny told me." She doesn't try to force the issue. She doesn't do what Hagrid did, saying that Sirius going out in a battle was how Sirius would have wanted to go. She simply says "Sorry," and then raises the idea that she thinks that she and Harry may be reunited with their loved ones in an afterlife.

The second time that Luna comforts Harry is during the Battle of Hogwarts, when she encourages him to think of something happy to fight Dementors. "We're all still here. We're all still fighting." Considering Luna's own trauma, and her belief in life after death, Dementors must terrify her to no end. To see her reach out to comfort a loved one speaks volumes for her character.

But it isn't romantic. Luna would have said the same to any other person in the same situation.

As for Hermione--she is *dreadful* at comforting others. Absolutely, positively dreadful. And that includes Harry.

When Cedric dies, Harry's memories are kind of a mess, so we don't see much of Hermione does.

When Sirius dies, Hermione repeatedly tries to bring the subject up, despite Harry making it abundantly clear that he doesn't want to talk about it.

When Dumbledore dies, Hermione, unprompted, tells Harry that she "was kind of right" about Eileen Prince being /the Half-Blood Prince/ as she was Snape's mother. Harry's mentor died and Hermione can't stop herself from saying "I told you so."

******* I don't recall any other girl making him laugh, let alone as much as Ginny. But regardless, its fine if there are other girls that might check off one or two boxes, but Ginny checks off almost all of them.

The fangirl argument is well overblown. She is no more obsessed with the BWL than anyone else in the wizarding world, and even in Chamber she sticks up for him to Draco, saying he didn't want any of the fame. Her crush really develops after he saves her, but in general I think it is totally normal for her to be a bit awed in his presence even before then.

Ginny actually is able to share a joke or two as early as Chamber and PoA. In Goblet of Fire, she actually chides Harry over the Yule Ball when Harry laughs at (I believe) Neville's expense, so this idea that Ginny was a blubbering fangirl until book 6 is completely without merit. I think what is actually happening is Ginny does have a crush on Harry (and why not, there is a lot about him Ginny appreciates besides being the hero) but recognizes that it isn't good for either of them so she tries to move on. And based on how she interacts with Harry and when she starts dating other boys, it is clear she has accomplished this by the end of GoF.

And doesn't that actually make for a good romantic story. She stopped being the shy girl with a crush, became her own person who Harry might actually want, but then did the mature thing and didn't pine after him. Even when she probably knew he fancied her, she didn't just ditch Dean. By the time they got together, Ginny was fully deserving of Harry and he was deserving of her.

Regarding normalcy, Harry basically admits as much in the break up scene. His life is not a normal boy's life, but Ginny gave him that. And also, again, look to the scene in the common room. Why would Rowling put that in there? Because it showed Harry just being normal, hanging out with his girlfriend, not worrying about the prophecy and Voldemort.

******** One of the few scenes that was not in the movie that cemented them as a couple in my mind. When she beats Cho to the Snitch in the match vs Ravenclaw she proves to herself that she is good enough for him. I think its a huge meta character moment and without it.. movie Ginny is even worse...

** She has an arguably low scene time, she appears to be a sort of bland character, to me it appears that her prevailing character traits are being in love with a fictional character, an unnatural shyness that just suddenly up and vanishes and apparent promiscuity. Also im not entirely sure how to feel about her getting around more in what, 500-600words than Harry did in 7 books. I also feel that the whole "Harry marries the-boy-who-lives biggest fan" thing seems kind of off-character for Harry "im just Harry" Potter.

Ginny dating two guys in two years is not "promiscuous". Hell, in RL, for her age this would definitely be considered on the conservative side of the spectrum. So if you're implying that she is "the school bicycle", that is utter nonsense.

But that didn't happen. Ginny has seen Harry as being "just Harry" since /Chamber of Secrets/ (check out the Flourish and Blotts scene, for example). Don't conflate her attitude in the first book with her attitude in the other books. Also, as far as I'm aware, Harry never wanted a relationship with Colin and Romilda, two people who are either confirmed or implied to be "superfans".

** I remember the exact moment I decided I didn't like her much. It was when she told off Ron for being nosey about her dating life and implying Ron was a loser because he hadn't had a girlfriend yet. At the time I was about 20 and had never had a boyfriend and rather took it personally.

I now realize rationally she was right to tell Ron off, but in the back of my mind she still feels like the mean popular girl. It doesn't help that she wasn't fleshed out very well.

** She's what I call a checkbox girlfriend. Take all the stuff Harry likes, put it in a girl, that's Ginny. That's essentially ALL that Ginny is. She doesn't really have her own story or development, she doesn't challenge Harry except by having other boyfriends so we know she's really attractive, but we also know she's had a crush on Harry since 2nd year so there's zero possibility that she's gonna pick Gryffindor #3 instead of him.

It's just boring.

** The valentines scene in Chamber of Secrets, In the words of the yaoi fanfic I'm currently writing:

"For all the jubilations amongst the female half of the student body, Harry found himself not only embarrassed by their carrying on, but for lack of a better word, repelled by it. High pitched squeals and twittering amongst one and other had given the boy a day long headache, not to mention the unsettling display Ginny had arranged for him. He questioned long and hard how anyone, boy or girl could find that anything but nauseating and very much deserving of the cringes the memory brought over him."

Yeah compared to Hinata Ginny is great. At least Harry was really into her.

And Ginny did have some "featz", she was involved with Dumbledor's Army (offscreen), and she stepped up in the department of mysteries. I don't think anyone but Harry or Dumbledore had a moment against Voldemort, it wouldn't make any sense would it.

She could have had a moment like Neville with Nagini, but honestly her biggest problem is she doesn't have her own character development, a fight wouldn't fix that.
