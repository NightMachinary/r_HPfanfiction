Hello, everyone,

I was skiing up in Mount Shasta last weekend, but I'm back home now, I had intended to spend this weekend recording and editing, however, I have fallen sick.

I have a very bad sore throat and cold, which inhibits my speaking capabilities.

I sincerely apologize, I will have to delay this another week (or a few days at most).

EDIT: Just an update on my health, I now have a really bad fever (I can barely type this right now) and I probably won't be better tomorrow.


** Where will these audiobooks be available?

*** The audiobooks will be available on YouTube, setting it up now. I'll post a link to the channel tomorrow, I'm pretty tired now (It's 10:50 where I am)
