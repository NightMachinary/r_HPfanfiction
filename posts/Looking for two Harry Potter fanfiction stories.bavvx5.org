There are two stories I am looking for that I have read recently. One of them is that Harry goes back in time to His trail to take over guardianship of his younger self. He is bitter and angry with a lot of people like Sirius, Weasleys (with the exception of the other boys and twins), Hermione (He gets her in trouble for taking her parents memories away which she did early). The pairing is Harry/Severus but I think it uses his fake name. I am pretty sure he is Lord Slytherin or Peverell. He gets Umbridge to back off at the trial by mentioning her brother.

â€‹

The second one I am looking for is one where the Dursleys are good to Harry, he knows about the wizarding world and blackmails Albus but what he really wants is to be expelled from Hogwarts. Harry is in Slytherin. It is a story bashing Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Albus etc. The riddle from Rain man is featured in it too.

â€‹

Please help.

  Thirty-Four year old Harry Potter travels back in time, adopting the name of Blake Slytherin - he interferes with his own trial and messes with Dumbledore's perfectly laid plans. What happens afterwards? will Blake have bitten off more than he can chew? Will it be left to Harry to do what needs to be done? SLASH HP/? BS/SS
