I'm searching for fanfiction to read. I've searched Google and found that most of the good fanfiction suggestions come from this reddit community rather than me stumping upon it myself. I tend to read fanfiction that center around a pairing however a general fanfiction is good too. To give you some context I'll put in some of the pairings/plot that I tend to read (* is most common/favorite) however feel free to share stories that aren't anything I usually read. Recently I've found some of my favorite stories are completely different from what I'd normally read.

Pairings: Harry/Fleur*, Harry/Angelina, Harry/Susan, Harry/Hermione, Harry/Narcissa, Harry/Bellatrix, Harry/Rowena R., Harry/Amelia B.

Storylines: Time Travel/Dimension Travel* (Especially to founding of Hogwarts), Evil!Dumbledore/Manipulative!Dumbledore, MOD! Harry, WBWL!Neville/WBWL!Harry's Sibling, Powerful!Harry*, Immortal!Harry

Crossovers: Harry Potter & Avengers crossover*, Harry Potter & Avatar crossovers

Stories I won't personally read: Harry/Male pairing, Harry/Ginny pairing, Harry Potter & Star Wars crossover, Harry Potter & Twilight crossovers

Like I said above, please post anything here you think is something either I, or someone else will find interesting to read. I know from using Google that these reddit posts end up a significant part of any Google search for specific fanfiction types. Even if your fanfiction doesn't fall into any of my pairings/storylines/crossovers it might for someone else that stumbles along this post. Thanks


** I really like this story:

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26577358/chapters/64795174]])

It has Harry/OC as the pairing, however the story is not finished yet and the pairing is developing itself. You will see. Just look at the tags and see if this story speaks to you.

** If you like Harry/Fleur then I'll toss out my personal favorites of that pairing even though not all of them contain the storylines you referenced.

The Purpose of Wings; Hope and Healing; A Different Kind of War; A Cadmean Victory; A Court of Flowers; Half-Blood Romantic (unfinished sadly); His Angel; and When a Veela Cries.

These are all great but I'd particularly urge you to read The Purpose of Wings for uniqueness, A Cadmean Victory for Powerful!Harry, and When a Veela Cries for some interesting worldbuilding.

**** Hmm, A Flower for the Soul; In Bloom; A Much Needed Holiday (Unfinished); Edelweiss; Harry Potter and a Flower; and Beauty Beneath. You've probably read all these too but I think I'm out of H/F fics to recommend at this point lol. Maybe try the Harry/Fleur subreddit too? The people there probably know more than me.

***** I think I have lol, I dont recognize the beauty beneath off the top of my head but I'll look into it. I am on the Harry/Fleur subreddit and flowerpot discord so I get recommendations from those two sources as well
