* Harry Gets a Shard in his Home Universe?

I'm going to cross-post this between [[/r/HPfanfiction]] and [[/r/WormFanfic]].

Looking for any fic that has Harry trigger as any sort of parahuman from Worm, while in his original world.

Trigger Points:

- First Year - Facing Quirrelmort.
- Second Year - Facing the Basikisk.
- Third Year - Pick one... there are several that all include Dementors.
- Fourth Year - Dragon, Hostage Hunt, Facing Resurrected Voldemort.
- Fifth Year - Losing Sirius.
- Sixth Year - Watching Dumbledore be killed by Snape while frozen.
- Seventh Year - Too Many to count, and most likely late as hell.

Now obviously, the power/powers he triggers with shouldn't completely overpower the thing into a wankfest (although those can be fun*), but something like Browbeat, who is underplayed and underestimated... Hell, even a Tattletale Power would wake Harry the fuck up to be proactive, and call bullshit on the crap that happens around him.

^{\}OP could be an Alexandria Package, or Eidolon, or what have you.)


** I dont read worm fanfiction so I dont have a recommendation, but I think you should know that [[/r/worm][r/worm]] has nothing to do with the story Worm.

That would rather belong to [[/r/WormFanfic][r/WormFanfic]], with [[/r/Parahumans][r/Parahumans]] being the main sub(but fanficiton doesn't belong there)

** I'd probably do it either first, fifth, or sixth year, because he'd be killed before getting through the shard vision in second, third, or fourth years. First is iffy, cuz it's still Voldemort, but could be worked around by Quirrell going to grab Harry only to undergo an involuntary exorcism, killing him.
