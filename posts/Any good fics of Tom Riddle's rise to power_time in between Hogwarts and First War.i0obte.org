Would prefer no time travel and not a significant focus on romance (unless it is consistent with Tom's manipulative/abusive personality).


** I'm writing something like this right now. No time travel, but it does have a significant focus on romance. Though most of that romance involves him being obsessed with someone and manipulating her and others to try to gain her affections, the manipulation is not that overt in certain chapters so not sure if it will be to your liking. I am planning to focus more on the rise to power in future chapters, though. linkao3(23621569)

  Between Hogwarts and the First Wizarding War, there is a time in Tom Riddle's life that no one talks about. There are plots and lies that not even Dumbledore knows. And there is a woman. When Tom meets her, there is a familiar feeling that runs through him right away. The desire to possess something very rare and powerful. He had felt it for the basilisk, for the ring, and now for her. She is a woman as mysterious and deadly as Tom himself, and he cannot wait to wrap her around his finger and use her to further his plans. Instead, she will alter them - and him - forever.

**** Thank you :) Feel free to let me know if you have any feedback or questions! I literally got into the fandom again just to have some human interaction after my school went remote, so love to hear anything (even if its critical) from readers.
