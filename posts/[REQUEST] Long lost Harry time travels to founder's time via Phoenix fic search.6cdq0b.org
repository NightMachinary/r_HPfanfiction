I read this story a long, long time ago and have tried to find it many times. It might be off the internet by now, but I thought this was worth a shot. It was definitely published between Order of the Phoenix & Half Blood Prince on FFN. I remember some parts very vividly-- but not enough to find it. After the war & his seventh year, a Phoenix shows up and takes Harry back to the founder's time. I think he is/becomes Slytherin's brother or some other relation. Sirius is there, having been transported there when he fell through the veil. Harry invents Quidditch and names Hogsmeade. He is able to communicate with Severus Snape and Draco and brings them back ?? I think it might have been slash at that point or hinted that it was. There's also a little girl named Canis Majoris Lupin (I believe) who is supposed to be Remus's ancestor.

I'd be so grateful if anyone had some idea of what I was talking about. Thanks!
