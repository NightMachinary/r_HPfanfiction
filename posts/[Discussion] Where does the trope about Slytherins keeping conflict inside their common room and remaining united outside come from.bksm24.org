I swear I've seen this trope in every single Slytherin fic I have ever read. Even in the subverted-trope ones, this single rule is bound to be featured. It's also never been mentioned by any fanfic authors and they never credit the idea to someone else. Does this trope have /any/ basis in canon? Are there any Slytherin fics that /don't/ have it?


** Well, I'll admit for my own fiction, I realize that the fact that no Slytherins turn Draco into a smear on the ground or disagree with him... EVER, means either they all are as sycophantic as Crabbe and Goyle... or there's another reason. I simply surmise the reason is conflict stays within Slytherin.

Now granted, it pretty much goes to JKR wanting all Slytherin's to be stereo-typically antagonistic, and there are practically no character development angles for anyone outside the core three, Dumbledore and a little on a handful of others. Certainly no one in Slytherin beyond Draco and Narcissa. And I can't entirely blame her for that, given that she could have spun off books and books if she gave development to all the characters that deserved it. Especially since the only female character she developed was Hermione. /endminirant.

*** Another thing that I will add to this

Alot of slytherins have wealthy and important families

So why get in a fight with draco malfoy as it might harm your future options

** People might be taking the Sorting Hat's promise of "you'll make your real friends" in Slytherin a little too literally. I also think the fact that Slytherin has a strained relationship with all the other Houses could play a role:

#+begin_quote
  “Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, “we need a little change of decoration.” (PS, Chapter 17)
#+end_quote

If Slytherins feel that the rest of the school is against them, then I don't think it's much of a stretch to assume they'd react by uniting internally - having a common enemy is very good at bringing people together.

*** It could also be because at the time Slytherin had been winning the cup for 7(?) years in a row. Meaning that every student at Hogwarts at the time never saw a different house win. Teenagers being teenagers, loads of Slytherins were probably being smug about it. Honestly I can see why the other houses would celebrate.

I always saw the Slytherin vs other houses as following. We see the events from Harry's perspective. He moslty interacts with Draco and Friends. (No redeming factors here) Also he is part of Gryffindor house AND a star member of Gryffindor Quidditch team. With the Gryffindor/Slytherin rivalry being what it is, it makes sence that he would not have positive interactions with Slytherins.

However we never see what is going on outside of what Harry does. We know there are different clubs going on, like gobstones. It is very unlikely that not a single member of Slytherin would take part in any club. There they would meet students from other houses.

I can see a Ravenclaw becomming friends with a Slytherin at debate club or a Hufflepuff bonding with a Slytherin during a match of gobstones.

** I abandoned a WIP many moons ago, where it was less keeping the conflict internal and more keeping it hidden entirely, even within the House. Cunning little bastards gotta keep their potential scandals under wraps to pursue their ambitions. Trouble was that 11-year-olds are not realistically good at it. As a writer I couldn't come up with something authentic enough.

Maybe I should revisit that little murder-mystery plot bunny...

** I /think/, given how they are nearly the winners of the house cup almost every year, they choose to settle arguments between themselves rather than have a teacher find out, deduct points, and keep the whole house from that shared glory.

Kids tend to band together and try to sort things out for themselves before involving an adult. The whole "don't tell mom and everything will be okay?" I think that's Slytherin's thing, with a little "we got ourselves into this, we can get ourselves out of it". Whereas with the other houses, Gryffindor would be the house that's too wrapped up in its own destruction to hide their tracks, Hufflepuff would sensibly know when the right time for an adult to step in, and Ravenclaw would /kindly/ turn on each other with a "we need adult guidance, how else would we learn?"

** It's a fanon thing born partly from the fact that absolutely nobody oppose Draco when he is a jerk in canon, though, considering the fact that Harry never talk to any Slytherin except Malfoy, people may talk to Draco while he doesn't know about it, at first anyways. And starting year 5 it's easy, you have the Chosen One that says that the Dark Lord is back, pretty much at the same time you have entitled little shit son of a supposed "Imperius Victim" who become even more smug at the same time than other children of "victims". Either you are with this guy or you make sure to not cross this guy.

Also, I can totally see Snape ordering his Slytherins to either deal their problem between themselves or to get to him so he can make sure they do not loose points, just for the House Cup.

** I think it started as fanon, but when I did the original pottermore house sorting I was put into Slytherin and that was one of the things that you were told as your introduction to Slytherin on the site (I think by Snape? idk it's been a while). I was surprised because I had been wondering where it had come from too and figured it was one of those fandom head-cannons that just caught on but I guess as one point it was technically canon? Or still is? idk man, it's just one of those things people don't really think about anymore

*** I'd forgotten about that. You can read the old welcome message [[https://pottermore.fandom.com/wiki/Slytherin][here]]. I think the part you're thinking of is this:

#+begin_quote
  For instance, we Slytherins look after our own -- which is more than you can say for Ravenclaw. Apart from being the biggest bunch of swots you ever met, Ravenclaws are famous for clambering over each other to get good marks, whereas we Slytherins are brothers. The corridors of Hogwarts can throw up surprises for the unwary, and you'll be glad you've got the Serpents on your side as you move around the school. As far as we're concerned, once you've become a snake, you're one of ours -- one of the elite.

**** Yeah, that sounds about right! I remember reading that and thinking this new slytherin fanon idea I'd seem floating around suddenly made sense, since for me personally that was around the time I saw it cropping up more and more. Reading the other replies though I can see how the idea popped up in fanon before this.

** Probably because we never see them fighting and because the other Professors aren't kind to them (Snape my favour them, but McGonagall, Flitwick, Sprout, Vector etc. do NOT), not to mention that the other students generally don't like them!

Hell, it would fit Snape to institute such a policy (if there wasn't one already!) because of his experiences being bullied (without the teachers stepping in!) by James Potter and the other Marauders - note: It's just funny that Snape did never realise that he kind of turned into (a young) James Potter!

** Well, pureblood fanboysim and Slytherin apologism. "Draco has to be the exception, so there has to be a rule that keeps all the good people in the house from stomping him" instead of "Well, I guess they're like the usual groups that form and perpetuate toxic attitudes".

*** I think it's not so much "Draco has to be the exception" as it is "there have to /be/ exceptions" because people take issue with the idea that there are no good Slytherins, so they include a few standard fanon characters who don't like Draco, but can't say so in public.

**** Well, why can't they say so in public? Especially in the early years, when Dumbledore is still the most respected wizard in Britain? "House unity" vs. angering the most powerful wizard in Britain?

Why can't they say anything in private? Especially when Draco's using slurs like "mudblood"?

If you want good Slytherins, you're better off not trying to preserve canon. Make them known, make them stand up, oppose Draco publically - from Harry's first year on.

Don't introduce Daphne Greengrass and her friends as the totally good, not evil Slytherins who simply couldn't say anything until 5th year, when Harry Potter discovers the truth about pureblood culture.

**** That doesn't matter. Once they're in Slytherin, the vast majority will quickly adapt to the culture of the house: They're 11 years old, far from their family, and surrounded by older students in "their group" to serve as examples to emulate.

That's why toxic group cultures and attitudes are so dangerous: They self-perpetuate by taking in new members. Just look at hazing traditions, and similar vile stuff.
