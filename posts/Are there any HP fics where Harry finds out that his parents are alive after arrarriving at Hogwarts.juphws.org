In Who Dares Wins, something like this happens after Fifth Year. This is a different Harry, but he does find out his parents were alive and he has sibling(s). I find it pretty good in general.

#+begin_quote
  A Harry Potter who grew up studying military tactics and strategy uses the attack on the Ministry as an opportunity to lay an ambush of his own - only to learn that his parents are still alive, as well as a twin brother whom Dumbledore calls the true boy-who-lived. And then, things get complicated. Military!Harry. A subversion of DZ2's Prodigal Son Challenge.
