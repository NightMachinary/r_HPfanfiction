I really enjoy the relationship development between Harry and Calypso. Can anybody think of any similar stories?


** Yes, there are six or seven more chapters available only on the DLP forums. It's not completed.

If you want to read those chapters, you can become a member of DLP and contribute to the reviews on the Review Board; once you've made two or three quality posts, you should be able to view the Work by Author forums where those chapters are hosted.

***** Oh, hey. I forgot I had a DLP account...

I can tell you that it's somewhere around 300k-600k words, and runs up to Chapter 17 across 44 posts, as a sort of insentive to go and get an Account, if you want..
