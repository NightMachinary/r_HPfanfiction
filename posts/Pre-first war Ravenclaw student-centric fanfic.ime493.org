:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So last year I read a fic on ffnet, it was 80 chapters I think, and from what I can remember:

The cover was a boy and a girl siting on a bench with yellow flowers around it.

-a shy ravenclaw girl with a name from a Jane Austen book(it's not random there's a reason for it) befriends another ravenclaw boy in the common room but he's a bit rowdy.

-It was post marauders and pre-first war, they are already adults by that time

-The boys last name is Pritchard He has two or three older brother who always pick on him.

-Think Ron Weasley and the Twins except remove all the traumatizing stuff and bump the sibling teasing up a notch.

-They actually had a really good friendship btw

-The girl had a sister who dated sirius in the past, and was very close with

-The girl dated one guy before realizing her feelings for pritchard (yes it's one of those love stories)

-I remember that after they have been dating the girl told Pritchard that after their newts they are going to shag but then she was afraid and couldn't so -Pritchard told her that they won't shag if she doesn't want to and that he'll wait until she's ready

-There was also this part where prit's brother married the girl who used to like Prit. Her name was along the lines of Olive, and she also in Gryffindor. She a very girly girl and was actually one of my favorite characters after the drama with her and prit.

Oh and the girl's sister actually had a journal and when she died was made into a journal about defense I believe

It's a really good fic and I just miss it. Honestly the characters where so fun to read it never got boring Please try to help me find it! I'll edit this if I find is


** I read the title of this and thought, I am writing this story. Then I read the rest and I realised what I am writing is completely different from this and way darker

**** My fanfiction.net username is MickeysFandoms so if you want to follow me there my Ravenclaw story should be the the first thing that I post. I do have other ideas for stories but nothing that I plan to write anytime soon.

I have an personal issue with procrastination so to ensure I plan to have most of the story written before I start publishing to keep a regular schedule with little pressure on me to meet deadlines
