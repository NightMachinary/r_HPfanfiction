I think this is a one shot or a very short multi-chapter. Tom Riddle is in Hufflepuff and used them to gain power. I believe the summary has something like 'show what the house of loyalty is about'.

I never actually read it, but I saw this fanfiction recommended a few times here and never bothered to read it before. I'm just in the mood for some rising Dark Lord type fanfiction right now and I somehow remember this fanfiction.

  Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that.

  In the end, it didn't really matter what road he took. Tom Riddle's destiny was, is and will always be in the form of Lord Voldemort.

*** Interestingly, Ravenclaw Tom seemed by far the most ruthless and violent. There didn't seem much difference to pick between the other three, but Ravenclaw was brutal.
