** Zacharias Smith wasn't aware, but he was cursed.

As the current Heir of Hufflepuff, he was part of a long line of failures, disappointments and ill-fated Smiths who had to suffer for the crimes of their ancestor Helga, who had in a fit of hard working diligence, cleaned the entire castle. Unbeknownst to her, she had thrown away a few of Salazar Slytherin's spell books.

He didn't leave Hogwarts because of the blood purity rants, he left because of a few sentient trash bins

But that wasn't Zacharias's concern. Right now he was focusing on the situation at hand.

“So, you need me to represent the wizard delegation?”

“Yes, that's the point,” Minister Granger replied, tight lipped.

“To the Dementors to negotiate their work rights?”

“Someone has to Zach, and you're the best delegate in the Ministry.”

“They're Dementors, Hermione! Can they even speak?”

“If Voldemort could get them on his side surely you could.”

“Voldemort could just feed them a few Muggleborns souls and he'd have them. Sorry.” Zacharias frowned when he saw Hermione's increasing frown.

“You're talking to the Dementors and you're not leaving until you get them to call off the strike. And you're bringing Edgecombe with you”

**** I just went for the low hanging mpreg fruit. But thank you for the prompt :) For without it we wouldn't have gotten [[/u/Redhotlipstik][u/Redhotlipstik]]'s glorious punchline about Edgecombe. Had me laughing for minutes.

***** Thanks! Mine wasn't that original I stole the idea of a Dementors strike from Robot Chicken. But Marietta will never stop being good fodder for jokes. And I love a good pastiche on mpreg
