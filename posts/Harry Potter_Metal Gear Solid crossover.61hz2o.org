Hear me out, okay? I just had a really good idea, but I'm not attached enough to it to write it myself.

The circumstances of Moody obtaining his eye were never elaborated on in canon. I'm assuming the eye itself is a magical artifact that isn't easily reproducible, and thus isn't common enough for anyone not aware of its existence to know that Moody has one.

The general gist of the idea is that once Moody obtains the eye, instead of openly displaying it, he hides it beneath an eye patch and tells people that "An Auror with no depth perception ain't much of a fighter, boy" and "retires". I wouldn't put it past Moody to have cultivated some Muggle connections that could help him fix his face up a little so half his nose isn't missing and he isn't so ridiculously scarred up, and to help replace his wooden leg with an enchanted prosthesis made out of more modern materials (like red-painted steel). He can then go off and establish the magical equivalent of the Diamond Dogs mercenary company, and proceeds to become magical Big Boss.

I have no idea how the story would go from then on, but I thought I'd share. If anyone wants to write this, it's free.


** Interesting idea. Would have thought that Master Miller would have been a more appropriate Moody analogue personally. Trying to think of some other character crossovers:

Snape - Ocelot: triple agent, no one quite sure of his motives until the very end. Weird relationship with the protagonist.

Lucius - Sniper Wolf: Of very little use outside of being sexy.

Tonks - Decoy Octopus: Surely self-explanatory

Dumbledore - Campbell: Mentor of the protagonist; keeps the protagonist in the dark about what is /actually/ going on behind the scenes until the very end.

Some very, very loose ones:

Hermione - Otacon: Nerdy support to the protagonist; not really made for war but sticks it out until the bitter end nonetheless.

Harry's horcrux - Grey Fox: Speaks to all the weird "I'm a prisoner of death" stuff... I dunno.

Malfoy - whoever the shittest boss is: self-explanatory. Actually maybe he can be Johnny Sasaki [I was tempted to say Raiden for Malfoy but while Raiden is almost universally hated, a lot of people love Malfoy for some reason].

Trelawney - Psycho Mantis: They're both weird and take you by surprise at first but are ultimately easy to brush aside. Both have vague premonitions of the future and delusions of grandeur.

Ginny - Meryl: I guess? Starts off as a fangirl, becomes harder, then the protagonist realises he's attracted to her. I doubt I would have made this connection if they weren't both red-heads.

A few for whom I can't find direct analogues: - Ron - Sirius - Lupin

*** I don't actually know too much about the MGS universe, since I've not played the games and had a hard time wrapping my mind around its needlessly convoluted plot. I was just inspired a little bit when thinking about how Moody could've been a little more vigilant than he was in canon.

**** A possibly amusing note for you: the reason the plot of the games is so confounding is because after every MGS game the person behind it wanted out but wasn't allowed to and made the games' plots weirder and weirder so that they'd at some point say “no, this is just too nonsensical, we pull you out of this project” but it never actually happened.

*** I can see Lupin-SIGINT(Donald Anderson). He was discriminated against, extremely knowledgeable in defensive equipment (weapons/DADA), and doesn't ever do anything useful.

I can sorta see Sirius-Drebin 893. Kind of a goofy guy, likes animals especially rare/extinct ones (buckbeak?). Has ethics unlike the majority of his fellows, and a rocky relationship with his leaders (Patriots) A stretch, but oh well.

I'm at a lost for Ron, I'm going to just say Fatman for him. Because it amuses me.

**** Drebin would be Fred/George, surely?

- Goofiness/parlour tricks
- Hint that there's more than one of them (my interpretation of this may be wrong)
- Business mind

***** There is explicitly a group of Drebins, of which the one we see is a bit of a black sheep. I could see it going either way though, really.
