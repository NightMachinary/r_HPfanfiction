  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher.
