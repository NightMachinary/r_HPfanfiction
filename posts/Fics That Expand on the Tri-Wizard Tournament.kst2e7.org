Specifically, I'm looking for fics that expand on the relationships between the Champions. I understand that they're all competing, but I feel like it's an excellent dynamic that both canon and most fics drop the ball on. The Tournament's entire public purpose is to foster good relations between schools and countries, but canon doesn't really give us any of that. Do you have any that do?

Also, I'm fine with pairings but no slash please
