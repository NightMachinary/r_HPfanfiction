So a long time ago I was reading a book on either ff or ao3 where Hermione is offered to be an apprentice for the arithamancy professor but she passed away and Severus takes over the master spot. Hermione has a really bad fear of knives and they end up taking care of a young orphan gryff named Emily and her younger sister. I can't remember the title. Please help.
