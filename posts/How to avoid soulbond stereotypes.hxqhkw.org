There are a lot of soulbond fics out there, but they usually follow the same tropes; touch is necessary, love at first sight, underage, Harry with a saving-people complex and a damsel in distress etc. I find it overused and boring by now, and I'd like some new, fresh ideas on how to tackle a soulbond concept.

I understand a lot of people dislike soulbond fics because of these stereotypes. What stereotypes annoy you the most? Have you encountered any fics that have soulbonds, but do them differently? Can you think of ways to avoid soulbond stereotypes?


** Don't be paedophile (or don't make your readers ones) ... the fact they are soul-bond doesn't mean they should sleep with each other at thirteen, and people don't date at twelve (“Ginny, thirteen years old, had an orgasm.” from one story which shall not be named here). Let them be natural and for the first couple of years they can be just awesome friends, who in appropriate time decide that she is a girl and he is a boy, and they should do something about it, and some couple of years more they can decide on sex and/or marriage. There is something awesome about just pure friendship, and sex doesn't have to be rushed on the top of it.

Don't go overboard with the closeness unless you really meant it ... either you write linkffn(Error of Soul by Materia-Blade) or you don't, but if you don't, don't make them completely integrated, that's just the uncanny valley for you.

** I mean, it's not really the soulbond trope that comes with these cliches, more like the author already wanted to write these cliches and uses soulbond as an easy tool for it.

But onto the real suggestions:

-Don't make them able to automatically read each other's thoughts. Just don't. It's going to suck no matter how you want to write it. Maybe they can learn it later by working on it and developing their unique communication channel. But it shouldn't be automatic.

-Make it more like they can feel other's /emotions,/ and that too, vaguely.

-Them having to be in the near vicinity of each other isn't a bad trope. Just don't go to the extreme with it. They don't have to be in touching distance. Just being in the same house would be enough. They can even be very further apart, just not for a long period of time. And for god's sake no "X amount of sex is required in X period of time".

-A twist that I've personally never seen. Make the bond one-sided. Like, say, because it was Harry that saved Ginny from certain death, Ginny's soul is literally anchored to Harry, but not the other way around. So, Ginny's life is ENTIRELY dependent on Harry. It's Ginny who can feel Harry's emotions, it's Ginny who feels the pain when Harry gets hurt, it's Ginny who has to be nearby Harry most of the time. But Harry doesn't have to do any of those things. That's ripe for drama. Just imagine Harry's self-sacrificing and kind of reckless nature. Well, he can't put himself in grave danger at a moment's notice because there's Ginny's life to consider. What would he do when he realizes he himself is a Horcrux and has to die?

So . . . just like Harry with Voldemort?

Now that I think about it, Harry's situation in canon could be used for Soul Bonds. Vague sense of each other feeling, and some "visions" when one feel a very deep emotion.

** I'm personally taking a different then traditional approach to soulbonds. I really don't like the idea of traditional trope soulbonds, because it makes the romance feel empty and frankly quite creepy. Like an enforced marriage contract, but it also changes you to fit each other.

Basically, I have soulbonds as something that isn't completely natural, but rather forms off a traditional (and barely legal) wizarding marriage ceremony. The couple getting married exchanges a part of their souls, which gets assimilated by the rest, but it doesn't work for every couple. It's like a spectrum of compatibility, for example, Voldemort and Bellatrix gain a decent awareness of the other and some traits from each other, with Voldemort gaining a bit of emotion off Bella, while Bella becomes a parselmouth and gains a clearer mind. On the other hand, a pairing of complete opposites, for example, canon Harry and canon Draco, would react violently and potentially permanently damage both of them due to how ridiculously different they are - like pouring oil into water and somehow forcing the two to mix.

I feel like this cuts down on the creepy aspect while still keeping the "destined lovers" aspect, as you're not /forced/ to be with one person, but you still know when you find the right one for you.

** Stupid little idea I got but Double Soul Bond.

For simplicity sake, let's use the character of Ginny, and the events of the CoS since they are already there from canon, though it could work with any character.

In the days following the destruction of the diary, Harry and Ginny remark that something changed in them, they both can feel a strange, foreign feeling in them. After some research, they discover that they can in fact "feel" each other. This connection does not seem dangerous, and they can easily discern the foreign feeling from their own, so they don't about it to anyone else (fear or being strange).

With time, they discover that this connection is in fact more complex than they first thought. Usually, they can only have a sense of each other mood, but, when one of them feel a very deep emotion (both of happiness, anger or distress), this connection can also transmit sounds and images. In the train leading them to Hogwarts in PoA, Ginny can also hear a woman scream, and during the 1st Hogwarts Week End, she can see herself yell at Ron and Hermione even though she is in her Common Room.

Because of these events, they both decide that they have to learn more about this connection (if only to not peep at each other secrets). After spending a lot of time trying to control their mind (unknowingly learning the bases of Occlumency), they manage to control their connection, being able to ease it or cutting it off. They even manage to "talk" to each other through it. They use it daily and become very close, being each other confident.

​

Then, Voldemort comes back and the heros understand something, they were never directly connected. While sucking his life force, a little part of the diary soul went into her. With the destruction of its vessel, the soul was stuck in her mind and was too weak to do anything to her. Yet, this soul shard was still connected to Voldemort, just like the Scarecrux of Harry was. All of their previous connections used Voldemort as a relay.\\
Now knowing the dangers of this soul bond, Harry and Ginny try to cut all contact off, but all habits die hard.

*** Would be funny as hell if it made Voldemort be forced to hear/feel everything they passed to each other (important info about the enemy is one thing, two children's inane chat though would drive him even madder). OrHarry and Ginny together actively using the bond with Voldemort at the intersection while having some rudimentary and knowledge of occlumency -of the trial and error variety- have a deeper effect on him, maybe the dementors affect him because of Harry, or their combined love for Quadrich transmit making him have random bouts of obsession (in fact, new HC, Voldemort didn't know how to fly broomless previously to ‘81, he only invented it because Harry's love of flying rubbed off on him), or even Ginny's feelings of disgust for the diary ends passing to him making him eventually regret making Horcruxies.

** I like the idea that soulbond =/= romantic relationship. More like a pearson who will understand you well / have their magic more powerful with the bond than without.

** I don't think that it should necessarily mean they fall in love. I read a fic where Harry and Draco have a soil bond but it was completely non romantic, for the most part, the only time Harry's personal relationship comes up odds on the epilogue. Ask it meant was that they knew when the other was in trouble and they had the same abilities, i.e. both parselmouths etc. However weird if warning: Voldemort memories and strange sequences Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3655940/1/]])

** What annoys me the most is the idea of two (or more) people being made in a way as to perfectly complete each other. It goes against free-will and disregards entirely that people can change, the fact that one person can get along with other while they are 16 don't mean they will get along at 20, or 40 or any other age really.

If you feel that you absolutely must do a soul-bond my advice is to not make it permanent if it is romantic, just something like being so in tune with each other that their souls interact, this way it can be a slow process of two people getting closer for it to happen and then end when they grow apart.

If it isn't used in a romantic context there are some more possibilities, like twins managing to feel each other and knowing if the other is alright or not or even people choosing to make a soul-bond, like aurors using it to be better in sync with each other.

Other than that I guess the best advice is don't make it Harry/Voldemort, the Horcrux forming a soul-bond with is kind of annoying. Hell, cross-generation in general would be unwise.
