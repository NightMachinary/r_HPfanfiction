** Just finished publishing Chapter 2 of The Lost Ones, a HP fanfic where JK's "19 year later" never takes place.

FYI: Teddy Lupin does not exist in this AU, unfortunately. Harry needed to be alone for this to work, and I figured he would never abandon him. And I didn't want to kill him.

As mentioned, nothing in JK's "19 years later" exists in this AU either, as I change the events right after Voldemort's demise, as explained in the fanfic-summary.
