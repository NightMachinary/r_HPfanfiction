I think the secondary school setting works for canon because JK is a fantastic author and the whole growing up with it and it being definitively a kids book means it works well for the setting.

I'm yet to read any fanfiction that comes anywhere close, and that's fine, it'd be a bit insufferable constantly reading realistic 11 year olds, and the plots etc wouldn't work as well or would require multiple years of setup.

I just think I'd be so much more comfortable with the terrible politics and relationship issues if everyone was actually old enough to understand what they were talking about. Also Harry getting married at 14 after the triwizard is ridiculous, at 20 it's much more reasonable. Also not pedophilic. Which is a bonus.

HP fans already know what happened in canon - why include more of it in your fanfic than you have to? If you want to write about the characters as teenagers or adults, just start there. Not every story has to be hundreds of thousands of words long, and if you find yourself writing things you're not really interested in, odds are good that readers will feel the same way.

******** That would make later years seen silly. 17 year old Harry would be just a third year, which mean no body couls force him to go back to the Dursleys. A cause of tension in the books is people trying to shelter Harry because he's too young, he would be 19 during the order if the Phoenix. The battle in the graveyard feels scary because Harry is just a 14yo kid. Voldemort fighting a 18 yo wouldn't give the same impact in thst scenario. Harry would be way more wary of pretty much everyone if he spend 14 years in that cupboard, he would not open up to Ron and Hermione so quickly.

**** A lot of stuff can be dealt with a few paragraphs.

Example : Harry been raised by Sirius since he was 8. This story started summer before 4th year.

"Harry was furius. He couldn't go to diagon alley, as he had planned. But he needed too get there. He needed to find a gift for Sirius.

6 years ago, Sirius had finally had a trial. This was thanks to his then-fianc√© Marlene who fought teeth and nails for real justice. Even if she didn't believe him innoncent, as a magical lawyer, she believed in true justice, and that everyone deserved a fair trial, no matter what they had done.

It took 2 minutes for Sirius to be cleared of all wrong-doing, thanks to veritaserum. Pettigrew was caught, judge and sentenced not even two weeks later.

His Godfather immediatly asked for Harry's custody. Weirdley, Dumbledore's fought against it. Marlene worked her legal magic again, and Harry got to leave the Dursleys two weeks before his 8th Birthdays.

Harry had planned to celebrate that anniversary with a cake he made, and a gift for both Sirius and Marlene. However, Pettigrew had escaped Azkaban at the beginning of the summer. And now, Harry was confined to their house until he could go to Hogwarts.

He couldn't even go to the Quidditch World Cup Finale !!! All of that because everyone thought Pettigrew would try to kill him. And treated Harry like a defenseless kid.

He wasn't defenseless when he fought against a possessed Quirrel in first year. Even if he only got away because Voldemort seems unable to touch him. And he certainly wasn't defenless when he killed a basilic in second year."

The three books covered in a few sentences, the most meaningful change in Harry's life showed and explained. I can go into whatever story you want to tell from that, and how Sirius raising Harry make a difference in GoT, from now.

You can expand at will on other changed in the third book during the story. For example, at some point between the tasks, Harry to Ron : "I miss 3rd year. Nothing happened in 3rd year."

***** It depends on the story kinda.

If Harry is raised by Sirius from age 3, then he's realistically not gonna be like canon Harry. If he needs to overcome issues from being raised with Sirius, then it would sorta be required to detail what the issue is and what it was caused by.

Canon got away with no childhood Harry because his childhood had almost no significant impact. He could have been a shy kid of Tony Stark and Batman, and everything would be pretty much the same. If there is an issue that needs to be overcome, then the issue needs more than a paragraph for us to be emotionally involved.

For example, let's say that Harry was rescued from the Dursleys by Andromeda Tonks at age 7 or 8. You could write half a million words dealing with the abuse, nightmares, Harry building trust and so on. Or you could simply start the story at the start of the 4th year, with Harry being clingy (long hug, not wanting to go) despite his age. That shows you that Harry has build trust to Andromeda, that he has overcome the Dursleys, sees her as a family but is perhaps more desperate for familiar love than the average 14yo.

******* The consequences of an issue is still about the issue. If Harry is having difficulties with personal boundaries or similar because of his treatment as a child, then we should see the origin of that type of thinking even if he deals with it when he's 150 years old.

A story that has /elements/ of dealing with past abuse needs a different approach than a story about those issues. Writing a story about child abuse while never showing child abuse isn't really possible, but you can write a story about someone dealing with low self-worth without focusing on the abuse. Mostly. There's no single way to write about something.

****** Your point being?

If the main action of the plot is somewhere in book 6, why exactly do we need to sit through all previous books if we already know what happened in canon, and can easily be brought up to speed on changes relevant to plot?

Sure it may not work for some (or even most) fics, like if it's "Harry goes back in time to fix things" then starting somewhere in year 5 when by this point most redo fics are already done with changes is stupid, BUT imagine you're writing a Warrior!Harry with mentor Dumbledore - then you can start at the end of year 6 and intermix action scenes of Harry kicking Death Eater's ass (or getting his kicked in) with Harry reminiscing about training and school days and mourning Dumbledore's passing.

That's not really important if nothing significant (or significantly different from canon) happened during those years. I'm sure there are fics where Harry has a very interesting time and incidents even before he starts Hogwarts but we don't really feel the lack of the details of those years in other fics.

Similarly there are so many fics that start after Hogwarts where all 7 years might be mentioned here and there but that doesn't stop those fics from being interesting and captivating.

There's no compulsion in mentioning all of Harry's years if you don't want to. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12855052/1/][Riot and Wonder]] is a sweet one-shot that touches all of Harry's years in merely a few sentences and that doesn't make it any less pleasant to read.

** Not at all. Not all fanfiction focuses on politics or romance. It's still possible to have meaningful relationships and a great story regardless if they are 10, 15, 20, or 40. No one forces an author to start their story in the first year at Hogwarts. They can write it at whatever point they want.

As for Hogwarts starting at around high school, I really don't have a hard stance. I personally like that the kids get immersed in magic and start learning at an early age. But if you want more... ‚Äúgrown up‚Äù topics, I don't think there's any problem with starting at age 15/16. It just depends on what kind of story you want to tell.

Setting it up as a "standard" secondary school also prevents questions from being asked to the parents of Muggleborns, which would definitely happen if they suddenly put their kid in another school between years.

Lastly, as children, they can still adapt to the "magic is real, I can learn it, and there's a whole hidden society based around it" culture-shock. That's a lot harder to do when you're college-age.

It's not great that a lot of fanfic authors can't seem to write a realistic 11-year-old to save their life, but them's the breaks.

** I love kidfic. Really love that. In any fandoms.

The big issue I have is that most people do not know how to write kids. They made him either too ignorant and stupid or way too mature and skilled and knowledgeable. Especially when they want to write smart, independant kids. They read like adults trapped in a kid bodies.

That's why it doesn't work out. Harry in the books get distracted by tasty food, play with fake wands at the back of class, make rash decision motivated by his emotions and lack of long-term consequences thinking, sometimes priotarize Quidditch over much more important things. Despite all his important missions, he still does behave like a kid. at times. That's why it worked.

And even horrible abused kid or that deal with bigger responsabilities than their age (caring for younger siblings, or sick parents) laugh, play and have fun when the opportunity present itself. Harry rarely do so in fanfictions.

You don't really need to age up the character for political plots. You just need to show that despite those talks and responsabilities, they still act like kids. Maybe they screw up a deal because impulsiveness. Maybe they can't help but laugh at something funny, or get distracted a bit in the middle of a meeting because something interesting is going on outside. Or once they finished the talks, they immediatly go play some kids game. Or they seal the deals with Chocolate Frog cards. Or another deal goes sought because the other day kid 1 did something that only a kid would be upset about enough to be resentful days later.

However, I do agree that romantic plots they need to be aged up. Unless it the kind of puppy love, sweet that is more "he is nice to me, and he likes the same thing, and I like spending time with him", than "dude is hot".

And I don't read underage smut to begin with. Not only I found it disgusting to picture teens 17 years old having sex (but that because I'm an adult), but I'm not even sure consuming underage porn in whatever form (so including fanfiction) is even legal in my country, and I really don't want - nor need - to google it.

** White Squirrel's fics have always felt pretty good to me in terms of how writing children is approached. I think that those fanfics which do want to engage with more adult topics already tend to be set later on in the school year or after the events of canon. It's why there's so fucking many dramione fics set post-Hogwarts.

** I agree, I would love to see one where Hogwarts starts at 16 but then there are things that change because of this, like Harry living with the Dursley's for an additional 5 years, Hermione being a Bully victim for another 5 years, Draco being brain washed for 5 years.

I would love to see it where the Wizarding World is expected some cool, smart Gary Stu Harry and they get a Hot headed pot head and part time mechanic. Hell my vision is that Gryffindor in Harry's year are almost the antithesis of what it usually is, rather than all the 'Cool' Kids it's this hodgepodge of characters, like Seamus at 16 is a minor criminal, Dean as a passionate Artist, Neville is a introverted mess who sticks himself to Harry's side, Harry is a hot head, Hermione is a homely book work and all around "good girl", Lavender highly stand offish, Parvati doing her best Trelawny impersonation 24/7.

** Totally agree. But I think 13 is a much better number to start with. I mean, if you only have kids start Hogwarts at 16 when they're almost adults with clear views about the world you'd take away the magic of going to a magic school and learning about the magical world.

If they start at 13 they're more mature but still young teens. And to make the 4th year example they'd be 16-17 then and old enough for a serious relationship.

Also, in canon, kids show their magic from a very young age and not training said kids in magic before 16 seems ludicrous.

Basically, you'd have to make the story very AU if you want to make it believable. Instead of just putting slightly older kids through the same experiences.

Though, reading about the emotional growth and maturity throughout the years of the characters is one of my favourite parts of a HP fanfic. You start off worrying about a foolish 11 year old squirt and then rooting for a brutal young-adult vigilante.

** If you think so, then write (or read) post-war stories, or write to another universe. If you mean, that the story of the books should be transferred to the university age, then I think it is a very bad idea. So much in the books, personalities of characters, and storylines are based on the fact that people are of given age.

** Honestly, I just mentally age them up anyway. Most fanfic authors don't write children well, and canon doesn't exactly do a great job of it either. Either that or I just read fics that start around 5th year. Authors are also usually less good at deviating from canon early in the series. We don't always need a rehash of the first year sorting or the chamber of secrets.

** Personally, I don't have a problem with the realisticness of the tropes you've mentioned.

You're trying to apply modern views based on modern child rearing to fanfiction. However, the world of most fanfictions, especially the political ones, are not based on the modern world. They're based on medieval Europe, where children were ‚Äúlittle adults‚Äù and aristocrats were trained in politics as soon as they could walk and talk.

Harry getting married at 14, while incredibly young by our standards, would not raise an eyebrow in a society where people were eligible for marriage as soon as they hit puberty and peasants regularly married at 12. Likewise, Harry claiming his inheritance and taking over Britain a year after the tri-wizard tournament shouldn't be unrealistic given that Henry III did the exact same thing (minus the tournament) in real life.

However, if the historical perspective doesn't help, you can just pretend that they're older. After all, most fics never explicitly mention their age. They're always "first years" or "third years," and it's only through outside knowledge that you know Hogwarts starts at 11.

Sorry, but you are rather wrong. Peasants couldn't pay the cost of establishing a family at 12. So unless one of their parents were old/Dying/dead. They would at least wait until they had enough to start themselves up. Buying or renting land wasn't cheap.

The victorian era, but it feels similar. Still, I would /not/ call that "most". The WW is pretty obviously based on the modern muggle world, but with magic added in.

All those political fics are extremely bad, too. I don't think I've ever read a good one that had what you list.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This is just factually incorrect. It was never the norm to marry at 12 or 14. Those were various /lower limits/ on marriage, but these limits weren't actually used by the kids themselves, but their parents. Parents who were the highest, most inbred nobility imaginable.

#+begin_quote
  peasants regularily
#+end_quote

No. Marriage was tied to economics - a husband or his family had to pay the bride price, which was not a small amount. Additionally, most didn't marry before having their own home to raise a family in.

The average marriage age didn't change all that much over the years, it was mid-early 20s then.

#+begin_quote
  Henry III

A king. I say this with full confidence and knowledge: Kings and queens were in those days were all degenerates, as a result of no law applying to them. (and some say they are still)

This is just another variation of "it's not real". This is an ideological thing - I can't pretend they're older, because they aren't. Because the author didn't intend them to be.
