When I'm reading Marauder era fanfics, every time there's a mention of Halloween, I find myself counting down the years til James and Lily are killed. It's kinda sad, knowing that's it for them and everyone else is going to fall apart.


** That's why I hate reading Marauder Era fics :(

Their lives are all going to be ruined! How can I care about this?

** This is why I never saw Titanic. It is clearly a great movie, but I'm pretty sure I already knew the ending.

This is also why I love alternate universe and time travel fics, the chance to fix what once went wrong.
