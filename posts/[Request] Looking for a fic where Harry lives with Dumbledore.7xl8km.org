In this fic Harry moved in with Dumbledore sometime around 5th year (from what I can remember). They live in a cottage at the back of the castle. At some point Ginny comes to visit and they find an outlook post leading to a chapel, where they end up married. Any help finding this fanfiction would be appreciated!


** Goddammit. That is a two fic series (second one abandoned like, 3 chapters before completion). I can never recall the name of the first one. Follow the Phoenix or something? After work I can dig through my comment history and find out.

EDIT: Nevermind, found it with quick Google. linkffn(Follow the Phoenix by Rachelme177)

  AU after HBP:Chap2. After OotP, better choices are made: instead of staying a passive influence, Albus becomes an active part of Harry's life; and Ginny becomes a better friend. And at the end of summer, the hunt for the Horcruxes begins! H/G
