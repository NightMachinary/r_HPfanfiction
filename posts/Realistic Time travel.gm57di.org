How do you think characters would really behave if they got send back in time?

Alot of these time travel fics I see Harry or Hermione or who ever go back in time and are just able to excel due to their years of experience maturity and knowledge. Often while being able to secure a ideal gf or bf.

But think of if you are 20 something and you got send back to when you were eleven. Maybe you'd be able to excel in some subjects but not all. Even if you are good at it. Are you good at math? You are amazing at calculus huh? Maybe. But do you remember long division? And thats just the education. What about relationships?

You were just 20 something chances none of these children look attractive to you anymore they were hot when you were a kid but you grew up and you didnt go back to being a kid. You're a adult trapped in a child's body. What about friendships? Do you even have the same friends anymore? Even if you do they are way different now. Do you remember what they were like when they were that young? Do you remember their priorities then? Everything they liked and hated then? Would it even be fun being with them anymore if you're still close in your time line? Or would it be like being with a stranger and make you feel more lonely? Would you be able to pick up this friendship where it is now when you have so much missing info about this time in your life?

Being friends with adults isn't really a option either. As competent as you seem to them you can never be equals to them. There will be a distance because you are eleven. Its not their fault its just there are many things you can't discuss with children you can treat a child with respect but you can't treat them like an adult. As a adult its kinda creepy if you are genuinely friends with young children anyway. And what about plot? Do you remember every detail leading up to major life events?

So basically pick a character any character imagine them being sent back to their 11 year old selves when they are in their 20s or older. How do you realistically think they'd behave? What do you think they'd do? This is a discussion but if you have fics that you think pretty much illustrate your thoughts feel free to link them.


** That's something that bothers me with Time Travel fics, especially Butterfly Effect ones, I try to imagine going back some 6 years, and while I remember some things, most of it is a blur of routine, I do remember Calculus, and know more about some subjects, but other ones are way out(maybe only the concepts). Names and places would be hard unless I kept in contact.

Then we have Harry going back 5-7 years to his eleven-year-old self and having perfect recall of every subject, and events on an almost day-by-day basis.

I enjoy fics where that becomes a problem, where characters can't relate, or feel guilty(there's one were Harry get's Dumbledore's memories from before he had the Elder Wand and feels awkward being very attracted to Ginny, even if he's still 16 and Harry Potter, he thinks of her as young).

Time travel where a 17-18 year old something starts dating a 12 year old are just creepy.

I am actually writing something that touches on something similar to this, a 16-17 year old Harry dies in the end, goes back and reincarnates as James' cousin, son to Charlus and Dorea(who didn't survive childbirth the first time around), and has difficulties relating to kids, he only goes to Hogwarts at 13(Charlus is a curse breaker/archeologist and travels a lot, and doesn't want to be separated from his only son after 25 years trying) and even then he befriends older students and some more mature ones, having a hard time relating with young James and the then very immature Marauders.

It's an interesting aspect of Time Travel many authors just ignore.

** I don't think anyone could really manage starting over in their 11 year old bosy very well past the age of like 17. Even then it would be shit to do. 11 year olds are obnoxious, and Harry would constantly be comparing them to his actual friends. He and Ron had little patience for Hermiones unmitigated 11 year old bossiness, assurity of her own correctness, and respect for authority when they were 11. How hard would it be for someone who had gotten used to the nature Hermione to stand being around the immature one?

Harry loved Molly's smothering love as a neglected child, but started chafing under that smothering at 15. How would he handle having been an adult for x many years and then having people like Molly tell him he cant do things.

It would all push him away from the people he loved and then he would mourn the people that he knew, because as things changed his friends wouldn't become the same people that they were before. The friends that he went back in time to save would be dead just as surely as the 11 year old Harry that had been overwritten. No one is going to handle that level of isolation well.

The only Peggy Sue fics that work in this sense are the ones where 11 year old Harry and future Harry merge together and future Harry becomes more childlike again. An 11 year old with access to the memories of his future self rather than an adult in an 11 year old body. Even then Harry has experienced a lot and that will change an 11 year old, even if the memories feel slightly other and not like "his" own.

I have a plot bunny about a Harry that time travels into his body from a few years after the war, planning on doing the usual Peggy Sue things only to realize once he's back in his body that there is absolutely no way he could pretend to be the 11 year old Harry that he just overwrote.

Now he has to figure out how to still accomplish his goals of destroying Voldemort, taking on corruption in the ministry, death Eaters, horcruxes, etc. While in an 11 year old body and trying to evade the efforts of Dumbledore and the Ministry to locate the missing boy who lived and avoid drawing the attention of the department of mysteries and anyone that might figure out he's from the future.

The story pretty much deals with everything that you mention. And before you go "eek" at the thought of pairing Snape with an 11-year old: Harry uses magic to escape Hogwarts on weekends and goes to clubs in his 30+ year old body. It is pretty well-written, but I sadly cannot remember title and author.

***** I sadly cannot remember it (I tried), but you could crosspost to HPSlashFic or the Snarry subs if you really want to read it for the time travel aspect.

But if you want ethical HP/SS I can think of a few fics aside from the above:

- My Name is Cameron Sage by thesewarmstars linkao3(1648439)

It is a time travel fic. The war goes bad and a 19/20 year old Harry travels back in time to about 1977. He adapts the name Cameron Sage, befriends Severus Snape and uses his knowledge from the other time line to destroy the Horcrux items. Very slow burn.

- The Most Powerful Magic by cjr2 linkao3(2457953)

20 years after the War, Severus Snape wakes up.

- Fate is a Four Letter Word by Philo linkao3(4267422)

Fate is a who-dun-it, a story of a murder (several murders actually) and a conspiracy and love. It is about a 40+ year old Harry whose life takes a drastic turn in the first chapter. Hermione, Ron, the Weasleys, Draco, Lucius, Snape and Kingsley and the next generation of James, Albus, Lily, Scorpius, Rose, Hugo plus several OCs all get their lime-light. It is really really good. Main pairing is Harry/Snape/Kingsley plus a few others. 525k words and finished.

#+end_quote

If we're just speaking on education, I think it really depends on how the author wants to configure their magic system. If they make it seem like everything in magic builds on itself, like if the author made it so that most of the Hogwarts spells were the foundations for how Auror spells are performed, then I can see them excelling at education. Or the author can make it seem like the traveler has gone through so much tougher stuff (academically or otherwise) that school seems easy by comparison.

I do agree with you on how hard it would be for an adult in a kid's body to socialize w/ kids, especially with people who they used to be good friends w/ as adults. That said, if you're always around people who act a certain way and you're trying to blend in, I can also see some of their traits rubbing off on you, even if you'd rather they didn't.

What I haven't really seen fanfic authors consider overtly is whether or not having a kid's brain/hormones/neurology would affect the time traveler's reasoning or emotional capabilities, since they are still physically a child. Kinda like how children have a lot less self-control or restraint than (many) adults. I'd like to see a fic where a time traveler reacts to something in a childish/immature manner, realizes their reaction's immaturity later, and then questions whether or not that reaction was due to being physically a child or not.

theres also the issue with teachers and authority figures in general.

There are so many freedoms you got used to now that you don't get in school especially boarding school. You have curfews, you have to get permission to leave the classroom if you need to use the bathroom or feel sick. Are you used to your own room? Well you got to share with at least 2 other people now and you don't necessarily get along.

And thats not even accounting for the teachers. Can you imagine having Snape for a teacher again after living life as a adult who no longer has a boss or really anyone berating them anymore? Someone who now in detail understands how much of a bully he is as a teacher but cant do shit bout it?

#+end_quote

For Harry or Hermione, probably befriend either one of the upper year students they knew through the DA or one of the younger teachers because they could not deal with their "peers". Or maybe get in touch with one of the younger Order members (Tonks, Hestia, Bill) and do a full disclosure, including private tidbits which prove their story. Either way, I don't see them enjoy Hogwarts or their former friends' company after the initial "it/they are back in one piece" euphoria wears off.

The other avenue I can imagine is Hermione going full "mum mode" on Harry. That would be utterly hilarious and at the same time not that far from her character in the first three books.

For Lily, well, sucks to be Snape.

A lot of people overestimate the difficulty of relearning or revising things you learned in the past. I'm no genius, but it would only take a cursory read through my books for me to be fresh with the concepts that I studied in school, about a decade and a half ago, even with subjects which weren't my favourite. I have done something like this after college to prepare for my Master's (along with several of my peers), and it was very much do-able. College stuff is a fair bit more advanced than school stuff.

As for character interactions, well, there's only one way to make life easier for the character travelling back in time - aging potions. IMO, the only reason why anyone would go through the risk of destroying the world and travel back in time would be to prevent something catastrophic - in such a scenario, attending school and playing with friends would hardly be something of great importance, all things considered. Wasting time when you have traveled through time sort of defeats the purpose of time travel itself.

Just have the MC take an aging potion, and age them up to an adult and have them do whatever it is they traveled back in time to do.

Yeah, I mean, who /doesn't/ remember long division? They teach it to 8 year olds, it's pretty fucking easy lmao. Plus that's not even really applicable to Hogwarts, because even basic first-year spells and concepts are still used frequently by adults. Asking “could you remember how to do long division?” is like asking “could Harry remember how to say wingardium leviosa?”

** I think that's why most TT fics include an evil/manipulative Dumbledore, there wouldn't be much of a story if harry or whatever MC just wrote him a letter with all the future info.

I usually don't like romance in TT stories since most of the time the characters are kids. I think it can be fixed with an aging potion so the MC can have adult interactions outside of school instead of just going ''Tee-hee I guess puberty is filling me up with hormones so I'll just have to date a kid. Even tho' I was 106 year old before TT, I'm a kid now so I have to date other kids''

***** I've been reading this, and let me tell you. It is so inspiring for writing my own story. You can't grasp just how much it affects my mood. I just love it so much, and there's not enough of these stories out there.

** I generally think of it as 'yeah, adult mind in a child's body, but the body controls the hormones and emotions'. No matter how mature the person is or at least thinks they are they end up acting their age. Say Voldemort dies but is given the option to go back and he jumps on it. But fate's a bitch so instead of going right back, he gets dumped in the great hall as a toddler. Despite thinking of these people as below him, when his body gets tired, he becomes your typical 3yo. He dreams of torturing gifs victims, but the body perceives a nightmare and wakes up scared and crying. Perhaps he wets the bed because it might be humiliating to an adult but the body can't help it.

Great, now I want to write 'Lord Voldemort and the Trouble with Incontinence'. Lol see what you people do to me? I don't have time for this! I'll just have to add this to the plot bunny list. (Sarcasm does not relate well into text. I really am laughing my rear off)

** It gets even more complicated than that. Our brains are basically configured to forget non important facts.

E.g think about your life as a 11- 16 year olds you can only really accurately recall major events not day by day events and this effect compounds over time every few years. Let alone extrapolate the butterfly effect.

The other thing would be hormones. While your mind may be mature imagine going through puberty again.

I think Peggy sue fics work best if a group time travels then you avoid the friendship and creep issues completely. You also have mire people to remember things by.

*** It's incorporated in An Old and New World by lens of sanity, the traveler took into account not just the earth's rotation but its trajectory in the universe as well, though the process seems to have left them somewhat insane if I remember correctly.
