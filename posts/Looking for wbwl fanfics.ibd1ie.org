I'm looking for wbwl fanfics. I have already read twins a different life and Harry Potter and the boy who lived. I'm okay with any pairing except for hinny and romione. Thank you!

** This is one of the best I've ever read. My favourite fic that I've started reading this year. A bit trope heavy, but it seems to subvert most of them. It's a WIP but updates weekly. Be warned though, it's going to end up being very long if the author keeps on pace. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the ashes of chaos)

For some reason, the bot hasn't been working lately, so let's hope it does me a favour this time :)
