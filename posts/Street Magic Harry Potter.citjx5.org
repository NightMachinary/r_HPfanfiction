A story idea I had years ago that never went far but gave me a chuckle every time it popped into my head. Especially after I saw "Now you see me" 1 & 2, those movies heavily inspired this idea.

Basically the Dursley's were a little clever when telling young Harry that Magic wasn't real. They showed him, and Dudley, that ALL magic was nothing but smoke and mirrors. That every "Magic trick" had a logical and scientific hidden trick. They showed Harry that the only "magic" was that of stage magicians. What they didn't know is that this would spark Harry to learn everything he could on Slight of Hand Magic. Everything from routines on stage, to great escape artist like Houdini, to the hustle of street magic to get some money off of stupid people. Though his interactions Harry would get more confidence, more cunning, a dash of anti authority, and a dry witty humor.

Then when Hogwarts sends their letters, well lets just say that the staff is going to have their hands full with this doubting Harry. Students and Teachers alike constantly asking, "What was that spell?" never knowing that its just slight of hand. Hogwarts having to deal with a Harry that actually knows how to NOT get caught by authority. A Harry that will use every single tool he can get to give him an advantage. This Harry is going to love the simple Switching Spell. Though the thought of him using Playing cards as weapons would be interesting.

Funny bit would be Hermione being the only one in the school that knows what's Harry is doing. All the while every other student would say, "Silly Hermione, muggles can't do magic. What Harry is doing is obviously very powerful wandless magic." I can see them driving her up a wall in frustration. All the while Harry and Luna in the background placing bets for when Hermione will finally snap.

So many fun things could happen in this AU, hope you guys like it enough to give it a shot.

  Not a lot of things could affect Harry's mundane life in the house of his abusive relatives. But then, you don't need extraordinary things to obtain extraordinary results. A seemingly simple step pitched his life into a direction no one had ever expected. Harry Potter, the Jack of all trades and Master of Misdirection. Intelligent! Harry.

***** It isnt. I mean it looks like one but it truly isnt. Although the masterpiece is abondaned and their is American spelling which is hard to overcome as a Brit but in the end it is a true shame that it was abandoned. We need more focus with this Harry.

** When I first saw the reference to street magic, my first thought was of John Constantine.

Voldemort gets eaten by a demon, who then rampages around Britain causing mass destruction before running out of power and returning to Hell. The wizarding world has a massive job on its hands erasing the memories of people who saw it, and half their population is dead, but the immortal dark lord is gone.
