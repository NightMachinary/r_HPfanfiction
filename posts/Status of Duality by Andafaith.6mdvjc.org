** I'm not certain about similar stories, but "Be Careful in the Dark" by Silent Call on AFF was a major influence to me in some minor ways, when it comes to fanfic. (It's old Hermione/Snape from 2004-ish).

As for Duality, I'm a terrible human, I'm sorry! I'm glad you enjoy it - it's the most flattering thing - and I certainly am not going to abandon it ever. It will be updated, it just may take a while due to various reasons and I'm not sure how long it will be. Hopefully you stick around!

Thank you for being a fabulous reader!

**** Thanks!

I'm not really a reddit user - more of a lurker. One of my friends pointed me to this post, so I made and account to reply. Double thanks for enabling me to finally sign up. :)

Cheers to you as well!

** If you're looking for more Haphne, my other favourite (very different story though) is 'A Different Sort of Bond' by Balfour.
