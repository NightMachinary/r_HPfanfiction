I remember Harry having went back in time, having met his grand father and grand uncle and them discussing Harry's existence. Harry played it off as being the last of a potter family branch that was erased from history by a dark lord and that it made it seem like they had never existed.

I remember a few lines of this conversation being roughly. "It's as if an entire branch of our family was erased/whiped away as if it never was." And it being the "darkest of magics"

Something like that anyway, can't find it and its driving me nuts, like mandela effect kinda nuts, I know it exist but I can't find it for the life of me.

Prove to me that I'm not crazy please and thank you!
