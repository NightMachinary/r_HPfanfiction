Hey all,

I'm currently in need of nice, fluffy fanfics after some heavier ones, and just finished reading an adorable story where Draco takes in a bunch of kids of convicted death eaters and they very quickly wrap him around their tiny fingers :). I would love to read more fics with a similar tone, preferably with an added Harry/Draco because I'm a shameless shipper, but that's not necessary, I just want kids and happiness and good feelings. Please recommend?


** It's not quuiiite adoption.

And there's angst so it's not super fluff..

But have you read The Man Who Lived by SebastianL?

Edit: bonus that it's drarry

** Have you read Away Childish Things, by lettered? It's a recent drarry, with the bonus that Harry is the kid taken in by Draco, for a short while. The premise is that a de-aging potion falls on Harry, and he's suddenly 10 (fully, no memories of being older), with only Draco in the near vicinity. There's quite a bit of fluff in the beginning. It's very well-written, updates once every 4 days, and had only 2 or 3 chapters to go until the end. I fully recommend it.

This sounds very similar to something I've read months ago, but the dates suggest otherwise, this should be good, thanks for recommendation! With only 2 chapters to go, and since you're saying updates are frequent, I think I'll bookmark this and wait for it to finish to read <3
