[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/1/Deprived][Deprived]] is essentially an AU story Harry has a brother and his parents are alive. I know that sounds very trope-y but bare with me, while it does have the "wrong-boy-who-live" tropes, i really like how the author wrote harry and his character who is practically the youngest hit-wizard so badass every other hit-wizard respects him. this is without writing several chapters on /how/ he got strong. Not to say i don't want an explanation but rather don't make dull and boring to read, i like exposition to be sweet and simple.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]] is also a good example of a type of story i'm looking for. all pairings are welcome as long as it isn't a slash.

***** Lots. His current story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]], I'm finding very enjoyable. Inspired by Hammer Horror movies.

Is it the best written stuff around? No. Is it terrible? Outside that first story and the Thorny Rose trilogy, I would say no. The real problem is that the conclusions are always unsatisfactory.

** I quite enjoyed linkffn(11191235). It has its problems but the characterisation is strong, and Harry is very accomplished without being over powered. It's just finishing up second year.

I find it enjoyable because it's trying to find in-world reasons for all the poor decisions cannon characters make, though at its worst, it does tend to say "because magic" and leave it at that.

Still, it's a well put together fic with lots of satisfying moments and a interesting protagonist.

**** It's quite intentionally a reference to the trope, but suit yourself.

***** Harisadrian Potter-Black-Ravenclaw-Emrys-Uzumaki-Slytherin-Aozaki-Gryffindor-le Fey is a reference to the trope. That is just the trope in its natural habitat.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.
