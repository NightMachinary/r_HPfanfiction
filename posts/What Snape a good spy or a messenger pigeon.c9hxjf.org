I feel like Snape was less of a spy and more of a go-between messenger pigeon for Dumby and Voldy. AKA the only way the two war leaders could directly communicate with each other without risking a duel to the death. I've read many great fanfics that show how great a spy Severus Snape is, but since we see nothing in the books, we have no idea if he really was a "spy" or a glorified communication channel between Dumby and Voldy to play "mind chess" with each other /(with Snape's own mind being the literal chessboard upon which they play. This image gives me giggles at the thought of Severus moving pieces around just to fuck with/ */both/* /players. The chessboard has a mind of its own, oops! )/

Both Dumby and Voldy knew Snape was a double agent and believed him loyal to their cause. And it seems both sides knew Snape had occlumency to guard his thoughts. Which makes sense. How could he spy on either Voldy or Dumby without the ability? It also didn't seem like a secret that some of Voldy's followers know the Mind Arts since Snape openly talked to Draco about Draco learning Occlumency from Bella. So that means Draco knows Snape can read minds and that Snape knows Draco and Bella can hide their thoughts. So I don't understand how Voldy trusts any of his followers if he knows they can guard their thoughts.

If Voldy trusts them, that really leads me to believe Occlumency must be undetectable by a Legilimens if you're a master at it and you must be able to selectively hide stuff.


** It's sorta implied that Snape The Best when it comes to occlumency, like better than both Dumbledore and Voldemort. With most of his followers it would be easy enough to rip through their occlumency shields whenever he feels like it, making them easy to trust. I imagine Voldy has torn down all of his followers in fits of paranoia or even just for the hell of it.

The question is, what the hell did Snape do to make Voldemort trust him so much? He's either got to be good at pretending to be less perfect at occlumency than he actually is or he's got to have done some pretty messed up shit to convince Voldemort he's really on his side even if the guy can't read his mind.

With the whole chess thing, like, Dumbledore's got to consent to Snape giving Voldemort some real info that can harm people in order to make Voldemort think Snape's got good information from spying. I guess it works the other way around, but both Voldemort and Dumbledore at some points have to be essentially handing each other plans willingly to get their spy all trustworthy. And both possibly have to not act on that info as to not tip the hat in the other's favor. It's some triple spy bs going on even before you get to mind reading.

  advanced Occlumency involves suppressing only the thoughts, emotions, and memories that would contradict whatever it is an Occlumens wishes a [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Legilimency][Legilimens]] to believe, producing a "faux" layer of mentality that can totally throw off the perspective of one who uses Legilimency into thinking that the said layer being the legitimate one whilst its bona fide counterpart lies deeper within; hence, it is not obvious that Occlumency is being used even if the person is lying

Snape being The Best at occlumency straight up implies that Voldy thinks he's ripping through his barriers and finding nothing amiss. He trusts Snape for the same reason he trusts all other DEs.

**** Before that. He's accepted as a spy right when Voldemort returns. All he did was give half the prophecy and Voldemort didn't hold up his end of the bargain. Why would snape be loyal?

***** I'm not sure Voldemort really trusted anyone. He just expected his followers will be loyal to him because he's more powerful than them.

** I don't think occlumency skill is a binary absolute. It's not that you either don't know it and you're completely vulnerable, or you do know it and you're completely invulnerable. I imagine that Voldemort has no problems overcoming most occlumencers.

As for the rest of it, I'm not sure. For Snape to have been a good sneaky spy required that Voldemort be consistently overly arrogant (not unlikely) /and/ that Snape be probably the greatest occlumencer alive. Otherwise veritaserum/unbreakable vow/legilimency outs him immediately.

** As written Snape is most definitely a spy, but the idea of him instead being an unwitting go between for Voldemort and Dumbledore seems like it would make a fun little crack fic

*** hahaha! I wasn't suggesting Snape was stupid or unaware. I was just suggesting maybe he isn't some super-clever spy /(that fanfic writers love to elaborate on, and I certainly enjoy it!)/ since they both know he's a double (or triple or quadruple) agent and they're both just using him to communicate. AKA there is no REAL "getting caught" since they both know he's a spy and he's really just a glorified go-between, albeit an intelligent one.

** Simply put, Snape is good enough at occlumency to make Voldemort think he's sucessfully reading his mind while not revealing anything.
