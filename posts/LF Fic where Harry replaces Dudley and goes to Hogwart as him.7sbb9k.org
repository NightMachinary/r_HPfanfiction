I read this fic a while back where Harry uses accidental magic to switch places with Dudley (or he takes over Dudley's body and kills his own body) and the Dursleys don't notice and spoil him and he ends up going to Hogwarts.

I can't remember the name of the fic and i've been searching for it for the past couple of hours. If anyone knows what i'm talking about and can share the name of the fix then i would really appreciate it.

Edit: I found it! Thanks!


** That's "Who is Dudley Dursley?"

  Harry Potter disappeared well before he ever was meant to go to Hogwarts and Dudley was the one that got the letter from Hogwarts. Dudley has a big secret, he's not who everyone thinks he is. Mostly a narrative after Dudley arrives at Hogwarts. All six chapters now posted.

** huh. Now I'm kinda curious to see a prince and the pauper type story where they body-swap, and Dudley lives. Bonus points if Dudley keeps the Horcrux, and gains the ability to use magic, the same way Harry gained Parseltongue from it.
