So, it's been a while since I've read CoS but I am hoping there's a fic where Arthur finds the diary horcrux and or Malfoy's death eater robes during his raid of the manor. Or notices when the diary is slipped into his daughters cauldron.

I'd like to see what actions are taken because of this. How does the Weasley family respond to Arthur's success(I'm imagining this could lead to 15 minutes of fame in the prophet)? How does Draco respond to his father being caught red handed? If the horcrux does make it to the ministry does it get destroyed or does a death eater/sympathizer recognize it and steal it for their own uses?

Anyways I just thought this would be good to read. Thanks for any suggestions.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.

  What if, instead of going back for Ginny's diary, Arthur decided to owl it to her? What if he discovered it wrote back? What if he took this knowledge to Moody and Dumbledore? The Chamber of Secrets has NOT been opened. Enemies of the heir, rejoice.

** Regardless of Arthur's emphatic speech to Ginny at the end of CoS, I don't really see him being able to escape the Diary's pull. It was designed to be found, thus there would have been protections in place to keep from it being disposed once in someone's possession. How would he or anyone else have destroyed it anyways?

The question is if the Diary could only gain sentience for opening the CoS, or if it could possess anyone for anything.

I'm leaning towards the latter explanation.

*** Arthur may well be one of the best people to find it, since disposing of ordinary-looking artifacts with insidious effects is his very job.
