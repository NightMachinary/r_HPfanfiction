It feels like people remember Angelina Johnson and Katie Bell when it comes to the Quidditch Team, but people don't really write about Alicia Spinnet as much. From my memory we did get more with Katie and Angelina in canon then we did with Alicia, so it makes sense, but still feel bad for her. The three of them seemed like friends, or became friends because of being on the team, or what have you.

Anyone has any stories where she has more focus? She doesn't have to be the main character, just more in the story then in canon.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing).

Can be oneshot/drabbles/Multichapters.

IF Harry is in the story: No OP Harry, no Harem Harry. If Harry is "Lord" I'd rather him not be Draco Malfoy 2.0, and still help other people. Harry can be smarter or more powerful then in canon, but I'd like for it to be believable.

Anyone can be the main character, can have any warnings, can be on any site.

Would rather have it be completed or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.


** this one shot is pretty good.\\

also, i think quidditch oriented fics are likely to involve her more.

  Alicia Spinnet's hair is purple. If someone has a problem with that, she's listening. Maybe.

**** You can definitely tell an American wrote that, heh.

A fifteen year old dating a seventeen year old wouldn't cause anyone to bat an eye in the UK, so Alicia panicking like that was just strange to see from a fellow Brit.

Being 'lynched' from the likes of Romilda and other fangirls? Yeah, I could see that, though.

Hell, one of my friends was sixteen and she was dating a twenty-one year old, when I was younger.

Age gaps with people being in the same sort of generation as each other aren't really that big of a deal over here, unless they're ludicrous and/or there's something else going on (e.g. coercion).

*** In all of them, except maybe the sixth. She was one of the Gryffindor chasers and joined Dumbledore's Army. She graduated the same year as George and Fred, so I'm not sure if she was mentioned in the sixth book. But she was precent during the final battle.

*** She was in Gryffindor as a Chaser. Whenever the female part of the Gryffindor Quidditch Team was mentioned, she's often mentioned alongside Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson. She fought in the final battle at Hogwarts. But nothing to really define her as a character other then the pure basics.
