*** Wow, thank you for recommending this! It was deliciously sexy, HarryxFleur is a favorite of mine. My contribution is "Unspeakable Beauty" on fanfiction.net (can't link, on mobile). It's HarryxLuna after the war. Not a pure smut fic, it has a great story with sexy, nicely-written lemons mixed in. Incomplete though.

**** Eh, it's a mix of both real bdsm, and 50 shades. I actually just blitzed through most of his/her fics, and while there's no doubt that literally every single relationship in his/her writing is unhealthy as shit, there is quite a bit of what you'd actually see if you were into the BDSM scene in terms of the actual sex.

That said, I've only lightly touched the surface myself, and that was in the privacy of my own home with a few friends more experienced than myself. Doubtless those more informed can comment.

A word of warning though. Pretty much /everything/ by Salon_Kitty can be off putting. I'm trying not to spoil it too much (because I do actually think her/his work is interesting and fun to read), but you'll get some serious rape vibes in the very first chapter of the linked fic. And the second chapter. And plenty of chapters following those. If you can let it go and try to contextualize the situation, maybe you can enjoy it. I did, but I can definitely understand how others couldn't.

** For me it, it has to be Self-slain Gods on Strange Altars by scumblackentropy. For a span of, like, four chapters it's some of the most erotic shit I've ever read after a metric fuckton of build-up, and it's pretty in-character. It's SSHG, with a nasty!Snape.

A close second is a Moody/Tonks/Lupin one-shot I read a while ago. It was pure filth, but lord the author knows how to write a love scene. The only thing I didn't like was the part with the candle...

/When a curious Hermione Granger shows up at one of the BDSM clubs Neville Longbottom likes to frequent, she watches him dominate another woman's pleasure... and something unexpectedly shifts between them as a result.

I've never been interested in reading about Neville but he is SO hot in this one.

** The fic "Harry Potter and the Secret of the Golden Unicorn" contained both the sexiest and other most disgustingly disturbing scenes I've encountered.

Unfortunately by amount of content it way mostly the later - though that may be simply a matter of taste in fetishes - there is a lot of snuff and sick torture.

The scenes that I liked were the "milder" stuff - it was mostly the particular context/situation in the story that made them stand out.

Overall though I think it was the only story I ever stopped reading because I got too grossed out by both the scenes described and what all the main characters turned into.

Story concluded my brief enjoyment of "dark" Harry or Hermione.

**** Can't open it at work, but tvtropes.org has this info for it:

[[http://www.restrictedsection.org/story.php?story=2672][Harry Potter and the Secret of the Golden Unicorn]] by Lord Wrackspurt

Recommended by Foo Fighter

Pairing(s): Harry/Ginny, Harry/Hermione, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Gabrielle, Harry/Luna

Synopsis: In an alternate universe, a young wizard named Harry Potter comes of age in a time of civil war between wizarding factions. He learns the final secret of why he is the "chosen one" who can end the war and save his friends, but only by fulfilling his destiny.

Warning: Darkfic, Incest, Squick, Violence. Definitely NSFW

Comments: One of the last fics to be completed before Restrictedsection.org stopped accepting fics (thankfully the archive is still up) and boy did they go out with a bang. If Harry Potter met the Sin City verse in a back alley you'd get something like this.

** NSFW [[http://marjorie.auroris.net/harry-potter-cov/a-trip-to-hogsmead/][Harry Potter and the Charm of Venus]] by Marjorie Greene

"My apologies to J. K. Rowling, but as the magical threesome heads into their late teens, I just couldn't resist expanding their education a bit. In this short work (I can't see it going more than a few chapters), Harry learns the hard way that sex waits for no man, and that there's a lot more being taught at Hogwarts than he thought. "

Why it rocks- despite mis-spellings and ignoring canon in various ways, it portrays all the involved characters as complete characters. The descriptions are rich, the emotions believable and the sex is varied.

There are even some supplementary drawings by the author, with links within the story text. (also NSFW, obviously)

** My own fic, but that is probably because it is mostly in my own fetish zone. Also because I try to ensure that the people involved are actually people and give them good motivations for everything they do.

It is mental masturbation but I enjoy my own sex scenes more than any others I have read (not that I don't also enjoy many other authors).

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7EGinnyMyLove][http://www.fanfiction.net/~GinnyMyLove]]

Particularly 'Searching for the Power': everything except for R/Hr at the beginning which was intentionally hard to read and not overly intimate (and no penetration).

*** I have such mixed feelings about this fic.

On the plus side, I enjoy the Harry/Ginny/Hermione at the start, with quite a few chapters of teasing and "accidents" before they get around to having sex. (Though all the crying on Harry's part is tiresome, and makes you wonder why they're attracted to him.)

On the down side, the fic really jumps the shark when it goes harem with Gabrielle and Susan. Not only is the thin semblance of plausibility completely discarded, Harry suddenly has a character transplant into a guy obsessed with dominance during sex, and the sex itself becomes rather repetitive. Worst of all though is the sense in which all individuality is lost. Harry's various partners all merge into being completely interchangeable, with no real identities of their own. Just "the blonde one", "the brunette", etc.

Basically, smut fic is driven by two things: unresolved sexual tension and character chemistry. Search for the Power lost both as soon as Gabrielle arrived.

**** I strived very hard to ensure each girl maintained her own personality unless she was a "visitor". You have to read further into the fic before pieces start falling into place about why all these girls are so ready to jump in the bed with him.

If you have no interest in Harem, then don't read it. I'm sorry.

Also I'm sorry for the mistakes in the first...20 chapters. It was my first fic and I had no beta, it gets better.

You seem to have no interest in Harems in general, or you would see that my fic specifically addresses the problems you mentioned (which appear in other fic). There is nothing wrong with having no interest in harems (and enjoying the threesome). I don't blame you, I just feel like you couldn't get into it so found every flaw :)

Thank you for trying to read it though!
