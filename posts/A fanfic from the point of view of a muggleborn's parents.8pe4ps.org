I was sitting in my child's room with my sister and best friend, all huge Harry Potter fans, and we were talking how odd it would feel of Little Bear excibited signs of accidental magic right at that moment. Well, they were teaching him how to use a replica wand...

That got me thinking just how interesting a fic from the point of view of Hermione's parents, for example, would be.

Are there any like that? Suggestions welcome.


** linkffn(11456392) Its a fic from Vernons point of view. The change is that Petunia died without telling him about magic, and he has to raise Dudley and Harry alone. In this Vernon is more of a father to Harry, but its shows how magic impacts their relationship.

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home. AU. COMPLETE with epilogue!
