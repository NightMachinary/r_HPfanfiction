** In linkffn(9911469) the main character, Lily has a very unique perspective and thus is quite dissociated from reality. This fic and it's sequels might not be for everyone due to it's absurdist nature but it might be what you're looking for.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** Grindelwald is not quite in tune with (at least current) reality in linkffn(Reformed, Returned and Really Trying).

#+begin_quote
  "We can't unleash Fiendfyre in London!" Granger yelled. Was she related to the Weasleys? She would certainly fit right in.

  "Well, I think you mean we shouldn't," he corrected her. "We most certainly can. But we shouldn't." Albus had said something about that, too. Gellert blinked. Perhaps... "Does anyone know if Albus has used Fiendfyre lately? No?"

  Apparently not. That would complicate matters. A little. Unless flooding the Ministry with poison gas and then setting Inferi on the survivors was also unacceptable for some reason or other.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

** Then you are in luck, because linkffn(13484792) plays this for comedy. It is arguably the centerpiece of the story (but not recognizable as such until the eighth chapter), and unambiguously unique for it.

This is a story inclined to bashing Ron, but it doesn't dwell on it long. It's /also/ a story that's not kind to the organizers of the tournament , and it spends a fair bit of time on that. Hence the title.

  Harry and Hermione decide to help Fred and George to enter their names into the Goblet of Fire. Then, they enter some more names. Chaos ensues... A story that combines humour, logic, canon concepts, and some unique plot bunnies into a 4th-year tale that's hopefully different. COMPLETE

** In A Mentor's Burden Tom Riddle consistently misinterprets what's actually going on due to his own distorted worldview. He's also a really big fan of Dumbledore. Comedy. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18394745/chapters/43563074]])

For serious works:

The Eyes is a bit of a reverse of your prompt: Harry sees things how they are; nobody else does. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9767473/1/The-Eyes]])

/Friends/ by the psychotic house-elf on ffn has Luna very much not understanding reality.

Harry Potter and the Illusions of Reality is a Harry Potter-Matrix crossover. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7370121/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Illusions-of-Reality]])

Harry tries to break out of Azkaban in Elizium for the Sleepless Souls, but not all is how Harry perceives things. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls]])

  Young Tom Riddle watches Dumbledore set his wardrobe on fire and thinks it's the coolest thing ever. From that point on, Tom only wishes to become a man as great as his Professor. Dumbledore really, really doesn't know how to deal with the little psycho kid following him around. Series of short drabbles and snippets into the life of Tom Riddle, star pupil, future Transfigurations master, and president of the Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore Fan Club (the APWBDFC, for short).

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.
