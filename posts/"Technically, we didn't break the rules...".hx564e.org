Even with the ever-growing list of forbidden items and the blanket rule of "no magic in the hallways", that still leaves plenty of stuff that's totally against the /spirit/ of the rules, but technically not /against/ them.

You're not allowed to physically enter the Restricted Section of the library? Aren't Summoning Charms handy?

I'd like to see some crackfic-y snippets and one-shot stories about loopholes like that.

Prompt inspired by linkao3(25488247) this one-shot, in which the rules say "No students out of bed past curfew" - and technically, the students in question didn't get /out of bed/ until they were caught.


** 'I'm disgusted,' said Professor McGonagall. 'Three students out of bed in one night! I've never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.'

'Fifty?' Harry gasped -- they would lose the lead, the lead he'd won in the last Quidditch match.

'Fifty points each,' said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.

"But Professor' Harry said 'The rules only say that students cant be seen out of bed at night, technically we weren't seen' Harry couldn't help but smile 'We were found under my Invisbility Cloak, so you cant punish us'

'Don't tell me what I can and can't do, Potter. You knew very well that what you did is wrong. Now get back to bed, all of you. I've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.'

A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this?

â€‹

Obviously this mostly taken from Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone, but I am pretty sure thats how Mcgonagall would react to a 'Well, technically' excuse.

*** I mostly agree with that, and I love it more, but as I recall, McGonagall was all for it when they crashed into the Whomping Willow, and ended up not taking points because technically term hadn't started yet.

That might've been more about pissing off Snape than agreeing with their reasoning, but still, she went with it.

** Okay so I can't remember what fic it's in but there's a chapter in one of Daily-Chan's Marauders Era fics in which Sirius, James, and Remus tie their mattresses together and put a levitation charm on them, and then proceed to float around the school. McGonagall and Flitwick catch them but they don't get in trouble because their technically /not breaking the rules./
