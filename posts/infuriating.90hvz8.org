when an author writes 21 chapters of an actually interesting story, and then holds his readers hostage by posting a patreon demanding 50$ per 5000 words donation. And it hasn't been updated in 3 years, because it's stuck at 41$ since 2015

I know, Harlan, pay the author, but let me ask..is the author paying JKR for use of her characters?

**** wait, that's the reason that it hasn't been updated?

I've actually considered setting up a patreon before, but never as a gatekeeper to the content, just as a way for people to send a tip if they actually like what I'm doing.

The rewards I was considering were things like access to some original drabbles I write every now and then, nothing fancy like holding a popular fic hostage.

I suspect that the sheer amount of flak he got for pulling this stunt put him off writing fanfic - at least under that name - for good.

He may or may not have had a nastygram from somebody's legal team as well, but that would almost certainly have involved the story itself being taken down, so I doubt it.

***** I don't think you CAN gate keep fan fiction, its profiting without permission on the original works. You can however set it up for them to tip you and reward them with original works dabbles.

LOL why didn't you say that before?

  because it's stuck at 41$ since 2015
#+end_quote

It's still at $41 *now*, even though he hasn't been writing. I'm quite sure it was much higher before, he just abandoned the story anyways and kept the cash.
