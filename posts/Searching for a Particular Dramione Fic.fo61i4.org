I read it a couple years ago and the gist was that Draco and Hermione were married (due to some marriage law nonsense) but hated each other. Some of Draco's pureblood cronies offer to kill her as a way of getting him out of the marriage and end up kidnapping her, but he has a change of heart and has them release her. Sorry I don't remember more, but I feel like the plot point above might be enough to identify.

Not my usual reading material but for some reason I want to find and reread it.
