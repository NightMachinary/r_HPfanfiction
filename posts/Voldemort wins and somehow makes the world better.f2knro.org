I'm looking for fics where Voldemort wins the war and now the magical world is booming. Either by mistake or on purpose. I'm cool with Voldemort being defeated after changing the world but I'd like to see a fic where the world is drastically different from cannon with the magical world much better (population/economy/advanced) than they would have been.


** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom). Voldemort does a lot of amoral things in this fic but overall he is a good leader and the magical society cut off from the muggles that he maintains works fairly well. Some groups of wizards do live similarly as in canon but other groups have better lives.
