Just finished BolshevikMuppet99's Downward Spiral Saga, and looking for more dark harry fics like this.

My favorite things about it were that:

-Harry starts out as a good person, gradually becomes evil (he is gradually consumed by the dark arts)

-death eaters are very clearly NOT in the right

-harry does really gruesome death eater stuff later on (it's really messed up, if you haven't read it yet)

â€‹

harry isn't overpowered in this fic, but i'm okay with op harry fics

***** I wrote a whole (spoiler free) [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c1mmgx/fic_review_the_downward_spiral_saga_by/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][long-ass review]] about it if you really want to know what you're getting into. I don't consider myself squeamish but this was pretty dark even for me.

***** If you want a preview of some of the incredibly gruesome stuff Harry does in this fic, see this chapter

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13058572/12/Harry-Potter-and-the-End-of-War]]

This is from book 6 of this series.

Control + F, type in "fred", and brace yourself for what Harry decides to do to someone on the opposite side of the war from himself.

(Do yourself a favor and make sure you're not currently eating or drinking anything)
