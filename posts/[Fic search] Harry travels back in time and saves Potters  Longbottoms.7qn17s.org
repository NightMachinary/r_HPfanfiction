I'm searching for a fanfic that's around 45K words, where Harry travels back in time to change things.

Fairly early on he bumps into James Potter at the ministry after Harry takes NEWT exams.

He joins the aurors, is able to influence Barty Crouch Sr. to enact policies to combat the Death Eathers more harshly.

He convinces the Potters and Longbottoms to use different secret keepers (I think James used Frank, and Frank used James).

Eventually he tells them who he is when the men are getting drunk after Voldemort dies.

If anyone can link me to this fic, it'd be much appreciated.

  Harry was massively disappointed in how things were going after the final battle. Nothing had changed, it only looked like it on the outside. So he decides to change the past to prevent certain things from happening. Being the Master of Death has its perks. Time-travel, Harry / OC

...Wasn't that what Crouch was doing /without/ interference, and kind of a problem onto itself?

*** From what I understood of canon was that Crouch was taking a hard-line stance against Death Eaters, but he was blocked by the likes of Dumbledore.

In this fic, Harry identifies the Dark Mark (which they didn't know of before he informed them).

***** Considering his son was found to be a Death Eater that derailed his political career, and instead Fudge became minister, that doesn't sound like the better option.
