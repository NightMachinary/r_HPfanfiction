** I guess it depends on what you like to read. Canon compliant? Better stay away then.

But oneshots like the one I linked below aren't really impacted by the release of DH, and most stories set in the earlier years ditch the DH plot either way. It basically boils down if you want Harry to be a Horcrux or not and if you want certain characters to be "redeemed".

Other than that, the existence of DH doesn't make much of a difference, especially if the story goes with an original plot that diverges before the 6th year (see 2nd linked as an example).

  What if Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts had begun not with a dementor attack and a trumped-up charge but with a birthday party and a ransom note? In this AU, the Order's decision to pull Harry out of Privet Drive on July 31 has far-reaching consequences.

** Fics written before the end of the series often had creative interpretations of characters or would come up with creative ways to kill off Voldemort (with or without Horcruxes).

This can be really interesting to see canon perceptions of you like to read non canon compliant fic.

** In my opinion you are, for two reasons. When I first started out reading, I only wanted Canon compliant fics. But after a while I really started liking AU fics just for variety. At that point it doesn't matter much of it was written pre deathly hallows or not. The second reason is that there are many really well written fics pre hallows. Many of the most popular tropes were started before Hallows and became popular because they were so well executed. That said, because they started these tropes they can seem a bit stale if you have read a bunch of more modern similar fics. I think the best example of this is Dobbyelflord's Altered Destinies. It was written pre Hallows so much of the information regarding Grindlewald wasn't out when it was written. Horcruxes play almost no part in the story from what I can remember, and it uses common tropes like time travel, multiple animamgus forms, and a dueling specialist Harry. Some of these make for a stale experience if you have read similar things before, but I remember it being one of my most beloved fics for a long time.

** Yes, because fics written before DH or even HBP aren't stifled by the terrible decisions JKR made for those books.

Fics released after those, even when they attempt to rewrite the final two books, never really manage that carefree attitude of completely forgetting about HBP and DH.

But it all depends on what you want out of fanfiction.

** Yeah, there's a few really good fanfics that were written before and continue to be updated that are quite interesting. There's also the fact that the authors can incorporate canon facts into the story later on.

One that comes to mind that was completed before the 7th book (well, 1 month after actually, but only the last chapters) is linkffn(Hell Eyes). Also Hope from Jeconais, I believe was from before too.

Another that is still updated but was started before the release, is linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky), which is going strong since 2004, if I'm not mistaken, it was just published later in FFN.

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.

** Well, you'd miss out on linkffn(Seventh Horcrux), for starters.

And the most-favorited HP story on all of ff.net was started before book 7, though it continued to update afterward (sadly on hiatus due to author health, but not abandoned).
