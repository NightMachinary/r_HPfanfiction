  One-shot. Harry suspects the Second Task will involve hostages, but he still can't find a way to breathe underwater. In his desperation, what other options might he devise?

** Bonus points if he just it the most Loony Toon way possible.

Harry was in a panic. He'd found nothing to breath underwater except a charm he'd learn in 2 years which, wasn't exactly helpful at the moment. Wracking his brain, Harry struggled to come up with a solution. Without consciously realizing it, Hermione had gently started pushing him towards the docks. The next thing he knew he was standing next to the other champions as Dumbledore was talking about the hostages. Then, a cannon blast.

Harry's mind snapped and he did the first thing that came to him. Harry raised his wand to his own head and shouted, "Let Ron go, or I swear to Merlin, the kid gets it!"

Edit, also recall one where Harry threatened them/their fish with grenades until the hostages were brought up, then delivered a chest of mussels as payment once the transfer was complete.

Anyway, fics are Triwizard Tales and Unconventional Harry.

Also, it was clams - not mussels.
