I think that the community has a lot of great authors who might want to share tips. Maybe we should create a [TIP] tag for suggestions to other authors.

Anyone else think so?

Also, what is the [Suggestion] flair for?


** To be honest I have no idea what the Suggestion flair is for. I always just use Promotion. [[/u/NaughtyGaymer]] created them.

*** Now that I think about it, I really can't remember why.

I think I made Promotion for self promotion, and Suggestion for non self promotion, like if you really liked a fic and would like to suggest it to other readers.

Where as Promotion was for the author of the fic.

** My assumption has been:

[Suggestion] = a story I found cool

[Promotion] = my story that I'd love you to read

Although I often see non-author-OP posts linking a fic they liked tagged with [Promotion], so I'd appreciate a clarification on this too!

*** This is it exactly, but we've never been very strict in regards to flair.

** I think it'd be a bit too specific, the discussion flair seems appropriate for that kind of thing.
