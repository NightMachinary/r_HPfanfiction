At the Third Task, Rita Skeeter change into her Animagus form and hide in Harry's messy hair. When the Portkey transport him and Cedric to the graveyard, she is brought with them. Rita Skeeter then see the whole resurrection of Voldemort, taking pictures and the likes before going back to Hogwarts with Harry and writing an article. The article is published the next morning before the Ministry can do anything.

How interesting would it be to read that? It makes you wonder how the timeline of events would change if a reporter such as Rita Skeeter had proof of Voldemort's resurrection and published those in the Prophet before Minister Fudge and the Ministry could interfere.

EDIT: formating because Reddit is dumb.


** Hmm, Rita feels bad for what Harry went through so she decides to hitch a ride once again and find out if Dumbledore is going to train and protect him from the newly resurrected Dark Lord. Only to find herself in the middle of muggle no-where and is witness to just where Dumbledore has been keeping Harry safe all these years...

Doesn't have to equate to a AD bashing, simply that Rita Skeeter is a woman who is handy to have on your side. She knows how to get you what you want.

*** This reminds me slightly of the beginning of HP & the refiner's fire. Where she discovers Harry in Little Whinging while doing a story on him at his summer job.

*** That could be kind of interesting. Instead of following Harry around in the past she'd be off doing her own thing causing trouble.

It could be interesting as a side diversion to have future Harry in the past try to catch future Rita. Because she keeps publishing articles that Spooks the baddies and screws up his hunts.

Eventually he finally catches her. And goes all WTF on her. Her meddling basically doubled the body count. So he has to go back a second time and try again. But now there's like three of him in one time period.

What happens when there's three of him in one place. Does it start to destabilize reality itself? Maybe it causes other people to slip Through Time accidentally?

Not sure what the endgame would be after that. I would suppose that all magic breaks down and the entire magical Community worldwide just becomes Muggles overnight.

All in all that actually sounds like a heck of a lot of fun to write. It's a Pity that I don't have the talent to do it.

**** Now that is something I want to read! And you shouldnt hesitate to write something if you want to, even if you don't think you have the talent. Writing is easier than it look like and all it matters is that you have fun doing so.

Personally, I started writing because I had a fanfic idea that I couldn't find anywhere and wanted to read. The problem was that I didn't think I would be good enough of a writer because I had never done so before, much less in english (it isn't my maternal language) but I thought “Huh, sure, why not.” and started writing! Anyway, in worse case scenarios, you can just ask people to beta your work or just revisit, change some thinga or even rewrite it until its good enough to your liking. Basically, what i'm trying to say is that you shouldnt hesitate to write if you can have fun doing so just because you worry about your talent. As long as you like doing so, it won't be a problem. ;)

***** I used to write quite a bit when I was younger. I could outline decent stories, and I could write Snappy dialogue. My main issue is that I couldn't make a scene flow.

So most of my successful stories ended up being written in the first-person. So instead of writing what's happening I'm basically telling a story by a campfire first person style.

When I read a well-written story, it's like watching a movie in my mind. And when I think back on things that I've read I can see the scenes that I imagined even though they were just written word. That's why I love the works of Tamara Pierce. Her circle of magic and tortall series are fantastic. His dark materials by Philip Pullman is also that same way. The way that the scenes are written just makes them come alive in my mind.

Sadly I just don't have the talent to do the same.

So while I can come up with an outline and I might write a few bits of scenes here and there. I know that I would never be able to actually write all the in-between bits that makes it a whole story. I also really don't have the time for it. So even if there was a will to do it I don't think I could find the time.

I do appreciate the encouragement though. It's what makes these kinds of communities so much fun.

**** There was a tidbit about multiple Time-Turned selves in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10041727/1/The-Ambiguous-Artifice][The Ambiguous Artifice]] by murkybluematter, which might be of interest to you. [n.b. the linked work is third book in a series, the fourth book is currently in progress, updates come slowly][Edited because I dunno how to make the bot's links work.]

  Harriet Potter's third year masquerading as a pureblood boy promises to be even more complicated than the last two. All she wants is to get through her studies unimpeded, but with pureblood politics, ancient artifacts, and adolescent hormones getting in the way... well, at least she's up to the challenge. Alanna the Lioness take on HP, book three.

***** I've read that series before actually. Alanna the Lioness is one of my favourite books. The author does a really good job of mixing the two.

If I recall correctly, because it's been awhile since I've read it, something starts happening once there are seven copies in the same proximity.

Unfortunately I don't remember what happens. Just that are heroine comes very close to death towards the end of that particular book. Part of it I think is because of the multiple copies.

  Regulus had known that he would have to sacrifice himself, but had gladly accepted it. Death meant being free of the Dark Lord, and that was the only thing that mattered to him. No more evil master, no more Horcrux to destroy. Only, that's not what happened at all.[Still writing, it just takes longer!]
