So last weekend I was bored, and decided it has been a few months since I last re watched the Harry Potter films, so why don't I started them up again? After I was finished I was online looking something up from the last film, and somehow stumbled upon a stranger in an unholy land.

I have been vaguely away of fan fictions, but honestly I though most of them where lame shippy/romance types that don't really interest me. Oh how wrong I was!

I was utterly enthralled by A stranger in an unholy land. Honestly, I couldn't out it down (even reading chapters at work instead of, well, working).

I finished it up last night and started to have a look round an other stories I could start to read that may be a good, and to be honest it is a little over whelming lol.

I had no idea there scale of how many different stories there were out there. I noticed quite a few extensive list with fan fic after fan fic on there and again, don't really know where to start. I did notice that SIUL continue into another story but it doesn't seem finished so I didn't really want to start that up.

What I am looking for a few suggestions from you guys for what to read next. It doesn't necessary have to be alternate universe stories, just looking to narrow down the list of what I want to start reading next!

Thanks in advance for the help, and oh boy am I glad I found this sub! :P


** You may want to check out the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=2][DLP Library]] - it's a collection of the best fics the fandom has to offer, rated by a bunch of discerning jerks who care.

A subset of these stories can also be found in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/][DLP five-star community]], which is a convenient way to browse the best of the best.

There's also a tool called [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/][Scryer]], which is the absolute easiest way to search for fanfiction as it's a lot more versatile a tool than ff.net's search functionality. I find sorting results by DLP Review Score and Popular & Recent to be very handy.

As for narrowing it down amongst the big collection of really impressive fics, that's a tough choice! Perhaps Santi's /Harry Potter and the boy who lived/? linkffn(5353809) ?

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

*** You say scryer is easy to use, but from my experience that is not true. For example, I just tried to find stories with the search criteria of DLP Review Score sort by descending order and it does that completely wrong. Top three stories on the return are rated 2.5, 4.44, then 3.29.

I always tend to run into these issues with scryer, so I avoid it most of of the time.

** This sub is where I get my recs these days. I find that there's definitely something for everyone. Try adding a keyword like 'AU' or 'Crossover with xxxx' to the searchbar and see what comes up, :)

What I'm reading right now: A Marauder's Plan linkffn(8045114). AU, Sirius-rescues-Harry fic. I like the politics and it's pretty well written, IMHO. It's really long, I'm still halfway through, and I've been reading for a few days now (reading at work as well, shh! haha).

** You seem to like dimension travels then. This theme is also one of my favorites. The best dimensional/time travel imho is *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), where Harry went to a world of 1975 and turned Bellatrix. The story is creative, credible, funny, and contains tons of intrigues.

You should also like the *Dark Prince Trilogy*: linkffn(2913149;3340621;3959072). Harry in the first part was in a similar situation as in 'Stranger in an Unholy Land', where he was Voldemort's key enforcer. The third part actually has him traveling to the canon universe where he swapped his place with the canon Harry. At one time, there would be two Harrys and two Ginnys running around.

*Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925), has Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Luna travel to an alternate dimension in which things were significantly better. The story is often told from Snape's, Sirius', and Lily's POVs.

** Alright, Lots of recs here, definitely not enough of the one's I like.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]]: First fanfic I read with a female Harry. It's absolutely fucking fantastic. Definitely top 10 if not one of top three. Jasmine (female Harry) and the gang go exploring Ancient Egypt. She fucks up and has to take the long way back.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]]: Another one of my top 10 fics. Not sure how to describe this one really. Eleanor Potter is a strange girl who goes to meet her uncle death more often than she should and has odd conversations with her imaginary friend Lenin about the sad state of his revolution.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6031176/1/Tied-for-Last][Tied for Last]]: We gotta get you into the weird ships somehow! This is a Tom RiddlexHermione and it's actually pretty good. It does quite well at portraying how fucked up their relationship would be if they ever did have one. (spoiler alert: It's /really/ fucked. Great fic though.)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes I am Harry's Brother]]: This one is probably one of my favorite Voldemorts. The guy is subtle, manipulative, smart, and /really/ fucked in the head. Oh, and he's Harry's half-brother. Bet you didn't see that coming! Seriously though, this Voldemort's long-term plan is nothing short of awe-inspiring.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]: Probably one of the fandom's favorite fics. Harry is subsumed by the horcrux and an insane Lord Voldemort takes his place. Why does he do the things he does? Hell if I know. All I can tell is that it's funny as fuck.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]]: This fic's a happy fic. Happy /Happy/ */Happy/* It has some of the most interesting explorations of womens' rights in the wizarding world I've ever read as well as some great stuff on mental magic. Definitely in my top 10.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7370842/1/The-Worst-Muggles-Imaginable][The Worst Muggles Imagineable]]: Turns out the Durselys are Satanists and Harry is Lucifer's firstborn. Yeah. This story kicks ass.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9340220/1/Crosswinds-of-Fate][Crosswinds of Fate]]: It's a crossover with Fate//Stay Night. It's got my favorite Dumbledore. He's got just the right mix of competance, political savvy, and power with just a touch of senility.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]]: Crossover with the Dresden Files. You don't need to know anything about it to get the crossover. It's a pretty fun read. It's got one of my top 5 Dumbledore's in it massively powerful, incredible magical knowledge, biggest badass ever. Seriously, his robes /eat things that get to close/ when he's fighting.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/1/The-Snow-Queen][The Snow Queen]]: Never gonna not recommend this. It's a fantastic read. Fem!Harry gets ported to the Hunger Gamesverse and then gets summoned back for the Triwizard Tournament. She's a charismatic psychopath with a gun fetish and Hermione pretty much becomes a female Mad-Eye Moody because she has nobody to trust at the school. It's got the best fucking Second Task I've ever read (fuck that boring ass lake. You'll understand why I say that when you've read this fic.) This one is probably my favorite fic of all time.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7244255/1/One-Wizard-Too-Many][One Wizard Too Many]]: Harry's a tad psychopathic and he doesn't take to well to this whole Tri-Wizard thing.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5199602/1/The-Thief-of-Hogwarts][The Thief of Hogwarts]]: Harry's a just your average thief who steals everything that's not nailed down and rearranges the stuff that is. Then he goes to Hogwarts.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]]: Harry is raised by Gellert Grindelwald and heads of to Hogwarts for 5th year. Great fic. Easily in my top 20.

- [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiJsYifvOPJAhWIez4KHUP7A3kQFgggMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanfiction.net%2Fs%2F8177168%2F1%2FWand-and-Shield&usg=AFQjCNGaE03-Gf0-WuTm6htjC3KTsrLcvQ][Wand and Shield]]: Harry ends up in the MCU with Tony Stark and Iron Man and stuff. It's great. Probably one of the best crossovers in the fandom I think.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10884162/1/][Incendio]]: Smaug lost his son to orcs years before taking Erebor. In another world Harry Potter is experiencing some strange new symptoms while taking part in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. But how could these two things possibly be connected?

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483280/1/][Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion]]: It's a crack filled Ron bash fest. There's nothing but Ron bashing here. Don't read if you like Ron.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8854828/1/A-Crime-Fitting-the-Punishment-or-Dumbledore-s-Monster][Dumbledore's Monster]]: Personally, I think that this is the only way that post canon thing can end. They didn't really tie up any of the loose ends, nothing really changed except now the Dark Lord is dead and his followers are no longer tied to the whims of an insane psychopath.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4726291/1/Eternal-Return][Eternal Return]]: It's for the Greater Good. All of it. Probably one of my top ten fan fics.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1291535/1/Betrayed][Betrayed]]: Harry is sent to Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit. One of the only good ones in this genre imo.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8979274/1/Love-is-a-Many-Splendored-thing][Love is a Many Splendored Thing]]: Again, there's just something fishy about the epilogue that makes me love these kinds of stories. This one's better than the other imo though.

- [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjmqI2IwePJAhVDcT4KHWHYCnkQFggdMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanfiction.net%2Fs%2F2217444%2F1%2FA-Mary-Sue-Alphabet&usg=AFQjCNGr7ZO5IkWQxTi7CfCnY5z0VWzxhg][A Mary Sue Alphabet]]: This one makes fun of a bunch of Mary Sue stories. It's pretty funny.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11635055/1/A-Certain-Scientific-Accelerator-may-also-be-a-wizard][A Certain Scientific Accelerator, may also be a wizard]]: I /really/ like this fic so far. Accelerator is Harry. He, Last Order, Railgun and Misaka Worst get dragged back to Hogwarts by the TriWizard Cup while they're experimenting on Accelerator's calculation assistance device. It's probably in my top five fics at the moment just because Last Order is [[http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/to-aru-majutsu-no-index/images/8/84/LastOrder_Profile.png/revision/latest?cb=20110321095954][the]] [[http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/to-aru-majutsu-no-index/images/e/e2/Last_Order1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100326130326][cutest]] [[https://49.media.tumblr.com/f35a88a7f38f5180c7e7cdfad1259ddc/tumblr_ms1horbhGS1sstysro1_400.gif][goddamn]] [[http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/to-aru-majutsu-no-index/images/8/84/LastOrder_Profile.png/revision/latest?cb=20110321095954][character]] [[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SF7kWOeQOCE/VAXVUn_QHoI/AAAAAAAAA5g/wJ48tilPKqI/s1600/Screenshot_21.png][of]] [[http://i.imgur.com/dWkcEeo.gif][all time.]]

- [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Worm]]: It's the heartwarming story of a girl who gets superpowers and decides that she's gonna become a hero. She makes lots of new friends and defeats lots of villains with the help of a beautiful angel who loves to sing. It's not Harry Potter, but definitely a great short story for a plane ride ^{^{^{^{or}}}} ^{^{^{^{three}}}}

And that's most of my big recs. I've got about 100 other ones if you want more.

** I am going to repeat something that has been mentioned in the sub at least once in the past. Nonetheless, here goes.

You are new to fanfiction, so you have not yet become accustomed to or easily annoyed by common cliches or dubious plot devices of this genre. Therefore, there are certain stories that people here ( me included ) would suggest you avoid, but could prove to be really fun for you nonetheless.

If you start off with reading the best of the best, you will become a 'jaded' and picky reader faster, missing out on a lot of potential fun reads.

To loosely quote someone else, when you first discover FF it is like a quest, where you strive to search, read, exclaim and cuss on a variety of stories by yourself. You spot what you would later on characterize as mediocre stories, and still enjoy them. You find what others hail as perfect ones, while you wish the author's PC would break down already. It can be a frustrating but intriguing experience at the same time.

Anyway, no matter what you decide to read, I hope you have fun.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]] is absolutely hilarious - it's a fantastically clever fic, the narrator's voice is wonderfully sarcastic, and it makes all sorts of fun allusions. You should read it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7118223/1/Elsewhere-but-not-Elsewhen][Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen]], by the same author as Jamie Evans, is a dimensional-travel fic that has a rather dark side, but has many moments of clever gallows humour. Unfortunately, the fic seems to be either dormant or dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]] had me on the edge of my seat the entire damn time; /this fic alone/ made Bellatrix/Hermione one of my favourite pairings. Lots of wonderful scenes and lots of angst. There's a few short sequels by the author that follow up the events of the main story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4684861/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Lands-Below][Alexandra Quick and the Lands Below]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784632/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Deathly-Regiment][Alexandra Quick and the Deathly Regiment]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7689884/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Stars-Above][Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above]]

Basically, these are set in Magical America, 10 years after Voldemort was defeated, and don't involve any of the original cast in any way. That fact turns some people off, along with the somewhat annoying protagonist, but the writing and plot-crafting is absolutely spectacular. Thorn Circle is the first in an ongoing series - all are novel-length, and the 5th is set to maybe come out sometime next year (if Inverarity gets a move on). They're /truly/ in a class of their own, quality-wise.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] is the single best Slytherin!Ginny fic out there, and perhaps even the best Ginny's-perspective fic ever written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]] is a great, if very angsty, Harry/Hermione fic without any of the usual bullshit that accompanies such fics (i.e. Weasley-bashing, Dumbledore-bashing, dumbing down Hermione, et cetera). Dimensional travel plays a large part, as does Luna.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2006636/1/Catechism][Catechism]] is perhaps one of the most terrifying fics I've ever read, and it explores an unusual concept in astounding depth. Read at your own risk.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5906518/1/Ron-El-Greco][Ron El Greco]] explores the more adult, parental side of Ron/Hermione, and involves Ron being a diplomatic Auror in a rogue Middle Eastern city-state. Very adventurous, but ultimately down-to-earth. Canon-compatible, if you tilt your head a bit.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3894793/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Distaff-Side][Harry Potter and the Distaff Side]] is also a really detailed delving into a concept that, unlike with Catechism, has been done a few times before, but NEVER to the degree that Distaff does it. Sadly, it's either dormant or dead.

** This type of post is fun but can get you recommendations you can't get into. I may be in the minority but with as much as the Santi's boy who lived story gets recced I could not get into it.

Here's a few of the stories I have off the top of my head that haven't been mentioned yet (such as the amazing BwP series)

(I'm on mobile, so I'm sorry for lack of links)

For a fun, short, time travel mystery: Torn Away: Scenes from a memory

For a mentored by Bill, first person harry: Bungle in the Jungle

For a good crossover: Browncoat, green eyes

For a nice comedy (the minion Ginny one in case there's another by this name): Seventh Horcrux

For an insanely powerful harry with l3ots of action: Harry Potter and the wastelands of time

For a great in progress one that is updating regularly: 800-Rent-a-Hero

** I'll recommend some that feel original as shippy romance types don't appeal to me either.

I've never seen this one recommended but the author makes his own world and runs with it. It felt so rounded that it felt like a crossover even though it was the authors original universe.

Hell Eyes

linkffn(2686394)

I'd recommend this one when you've read a few fics as it has a few nods to other fics but, it is definitely a story of its own. It's probably my favourite fic because it's so energetic and the characters are so likeable.

An old and new world

linkffn(6849022)

My favourite comedy fic. Actually probably the funniest thing I've ever read, fanfic or not.

Seventh Horcrux

linkffn(10677106)

Written in 2nd person. Once you get over that some bashing and maybe the way women are portrayed it's pretty mega. Some of the best action sequences I've ever read. It has a sequel. Anything by jbern is pretty terrific.

Bungle in the Jungle

linkffn(2889350)

Comedic, a lot of people seem to love and it's by nonjon. All of nonjon's works are pretty good.

A Black comedy

** Without knowing what you're looking for (I haven't read SIUL myself) it's hard to narrow it down. You did say you don't want romance/shippy fics. If you're not familiar with fanfiction.net it's a good place to start that's very user friendly and doesn't require an account. The sticky general recommendations thread on this sub is also a good place to start. Fanfiction.net has search filters though, you can search by character, genre, length, how many reviews it has, all kinds of things. It will depend on what you want most stories, unsurprisingly, are about Harry. Harry at school, Harry rescued from the Dursley's at a young age, Harry traveling the world after the series. Humour stories are usually a good place to start if you just want something light and fun. And author named Rorschach's blot on fanfiction.net has a lot of fun stories and one story that is a series of first chapter only for various story ideas he sometimes expands on. Anyway, I've gotten off track, start with recommendations from here if you want, look at posts requesting different kind of stories and see what interests you. I started of liking really sappy, unrealistic Draco/Hermione romances, your tastes will evolve as you read more and you figure out what makes you like a story. If a fic says "no pairing" or "general" that means it won't focus on a romantic relationship. But even stories not listed as "romance" tend to have at least a subplot maybe "damsel in distress" or "my best friend is a really hot girl" variety common in other kinds of fiction like film or TV.

** This sub is incomplete without listing [[http://hpmor.com/][Harry Potter: Methods of Rationality]]. It basically takes Harry and asks, what would happen if he was really good at logic? Complete, too!

*** I love this subreddit at times. It was pretty brave of you to recommend HPMOR knowing what would happen.

***** It's the most polarising fanfiction around. Some professor got drunk and dedicated a tumblr to reviewing each chapter. It has a massive wordcount.

It's the most read/reviewed/followed story on fanfiction.net. It's lauded by many but panned by most of the subreddit. It has been discussed to death on here and it even has it's own subreddit. Basically the author injects to much of his own personality onto Harry, tries to be clever and constantly gets it wrong and sets up lots of strawmen just to get Harry over as smart but it just comes off as I'm better than you.

It feels like he's just trying to say how shit canon is at times yet he's not even read the books.

Also he basically held back chapters for donations which is a massive no-no in fanfiction.

It's a running joke that it should be banned from the subreddit.
