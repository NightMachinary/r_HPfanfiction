:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello, as the title said, I'm looking for a specific fanfic of Harry Potter. I was reading a BNHA fanfic, where a reviewer said this:

"I read this Harry Potter story fic before and in it Harry is like Izuku here, working behind the scenes to get more powerful. Harry wasn't there to stop the troll from harming Hermione and she was paralyzed. Harry visits her parents and gives them the option of healing her in exchange of her services under him."

I've been trying to find it for a while now, but I've had no such luck. Maybe one of you knows the fanfic, and would be willing to tell me the name of it? Have a nice day.


** Ask the reviewer that mentioned it, maybe?
