Do you think Family words similar to ASOIAF could work here? I'm not thinking of something not all over the place but reduced to a number of families with long history. Actually, I have 2 ideas, either just give them to the houses instead of families (so more like house mottos based from a popular phrase of each founder) or something more related to old pureblood families like (Potter, Malfoy, Abbot, Ollivander...) Any suggestion of what might be good examples for some of these?


** Those actually occur in real life, not just Game of Thrones. I'm not overly familiar with the books or show, but I know there are jokes about him basically just plagiarising real life for a lot of his worldbuilding and backstory - this is one of those occasions.

They're called 'Heraldry Mottos' and a lot of older families do have them - they were most often used by individuals and specific titles though, so they really were all over the place, which lead to a truly obnoxious level of complexity overall. Generally, if you look at the crest or coat of arms of any UK family old enough or powerful enough or prominent enough to have one, they'll have some words written on somewhere like "Strength in God" or "Nobility in Adversity" or something like that. Scots tend to have theirs above, English tend to have theirs below - I can't remember the reason why. If you check 'Fleurdelis.com', they have a big list of real world examples of mottos and you might find some ideas there.

EDIT - in terms of actually making one up yourself, it's a little difficult since there isn't really as strict a ruleset for mottos as there is for heraldry symbols. If you wanna make a proper Heraldric Crest, you technically have to have reasoning and originality for everything on it in order to get it officially registered, but I can't find anything specific on what rules a motto might have to obey. I'd say just to remember that they're usually either a battle cry or a slogan, so keep in mind that it either has to inspire people going into battle or convey an image of your family to your rivals or opponents.

*** So I'd call myself something of an armchair herald, most of my knowledge is in Scots Heraldic law (Heraldry in Scotland by J.H. Stevenson, and ‘Scots Heraldry' by Sir Thomas Innes of Learney).What you say about the relative positions of the motto scrolls is correct. There is a whole art form to designing a motto, and some armigers (People who have a grant of arms) will have two mottoes. The one displayed above the crest (Decorative ensemble affixed to the helm), this is usually a short ‘sluagh-ghairm', Gàidhlig for ‘army/ host/ war'-‘cry' and anglicised as ‘slogan'. Examples include: ‘In Defens' Scots for ‘In Defence' or mine own ‘Gu a chrìoch' Gàidhlig for ‘Until it is finished' or ‘Until the end'.

If a second motto appears it will be longer and placed beneath the achievement. Example being ‘Nemo me impune lacessit' Latin for ‘No one provokes me with impunity'

In Scots Law and the Court of the Lord Lyon, the motto is a legally protected element of the armorial achievement, and as such can only be changed with a new matriculation of arms, which is not typical. Multiple armigers may bear the same motto or the same crest individually but not both.

No such restriction exists for the College of Arms in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, as the motto is not a specified part of the grant of arms, and so mottoes may freely change with the Armiger who bears the grant.

Traditionally, a language of vogue for mottoes was Latin, in anglophone areas of the UK. In Scotland, a fair amount of armigers either use Gàidhlig or Latin, though the current consensus is to use a language that you actually understand and speak, so now there are mottoes in Gàidhlig, Latin, English, Irish, Welsh, French and Scots.

The motto is also typically emblazoned on a pennon, guidon or standard, if you meet the qualifications for being granted one (Either as an armiger in England or anywhere with College of Arms grant, or in Scotland as someone who would command a following historically, eg. Clan Chief or Nobility)

Addition: typically the motto is supposed to tell you something about the armiger, or something about the values they stand for. Its unusual to see actual mottoes that are just common latin proverbs.

***** Guilty as charged. Feels like a bit of a pointless hobby because very few people actually care these days, so when people ask I tend to go far overboard. As to some choice ideas for mottoes for pureblood families,

Ollivander: ‘The Wand chooses the Wizard'. Potter: ‘Hallowed be our friend' inherited from Peverell. MacMillan already has a motto as Clan MacMillan, whether you'd want to follow the rules and copy it for the Wizarding MacMillans is up to you: ‘Miseris succerrere disco' ‘I learn succour the unfortunate'. Fitting as MacMillan rendered as MacMhaol-Iain means ‘Son of the one who bore the Tonsure of St. John'.

Sometimes elements of heraldry are used to create a pun of the armiger's name, known as canting, so have fun with that.

** There is at least one example of it in canon - namely, House Black, with its motto being "Toujours Pur" (Always Pure).

The Potters also have "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death" on their tombstone, and some fanfic writers believe these words to be their motto, but I'm not sure about it. In any case, the phrase originates from the Bible (Corinthians 15:26 to be precise).

Still, I think that old pureblood families having mottos (likely in French or Latin) is absolutely canon-compatible. Go for it.

P.S. The Malfoys supposedly have “Sanctimonia Vincet Semper” (Purity Will Always Conquer) as their motto, but I'm not sure if it was in the books.

*** I saw that from the tombstone, but having it be from the bible and a tad too long makes me hesitate. I think I like "Equals in Death"... in focuses on equality and how Potters were defenders of muggles and muggleborns, but it also has the extra layer of Death for their Peverell side.

**** Oh, that sounds like a good motto for the Potter family. Make it Latin or something :D
