I'm 36 chapters into For Love of Magic, and I'm wondering if the sex is ever toned down. From reading the AN it seems like the author is really touchy over the sex in the story, so I'm not going to ask them.

If the rest of the story is just constant sex with little bits of plot in between, I'm gonna stop reading.


** Chapter 36? Wow, you must have a high tolerance for suffering. I think I gave up around chapter 20. And that was after 10 chapters of hoping that maybe it gets better. The smut is bad, the plot is one big boring trope and Harry is a huge douche.

** The sex just intensifies, to the point where all semblance of plot is displaced by smut.

**** Actually, I think there is far less of it in a sequel, but maybe I just stopped paying attention to it.

****** Well, it's pretty early in it's development, the story didn't even get to the Robert's rebellion.

Also IMO the smut scenes at least are more relevant to the plot.

**** Yeah there's a part where the Magical world is revealed to muggles and there's a lot of trouble with religious extremists, especially from the middle east, which leads to Harry going around and cursing mosques.

** The sex is easy to skip past, but dear god the internal monologues are endless. This is like quintessential male writing, and why I generally don't have patience for male writers. So much mansplaining. So much harry is a sex god. So much creepy pedo incest shit.
