Hi Guys,

I've tried reading a lot of the Haphne Recommendations on here and honestly most of them don't have great writing or they're just not realistic. My favorite are Unatoned , Contract actual invalidation, Duality. I couldn't get into Honor thy blood, to refuse the givens ( didn't like that Daphne is a parseltongue), pureblood princess, The Legacy Preservation Act, Beginning of a New Life etc. I'm definitely picky haha. I'm ok with Golden boy and ice princess but its rare to find a story that's well written with that trope. Help me out!!

*** Enjoyed this one. Little on the short side for me, but a nice tight story. There's a sort of sequel too: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13232699/1/The-Importance-of-Intent-After-the-Credits]]

  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.

** I love how you asked for 'new' Haphne fics and people are recommending stuff published a decade ago. Here's one that was actually published in 2020 - linkffn(If not for Umbridge)

I'm convinced that 99% of the people in this sub don't actually read HP fanfiction anymore, they just keep recc'ing the same stories over and over ðŸ˜‚

  It might never have happened. In fact, it was a decision she nearly didn't make, and yet she did. See how everything can change when Dumbledore's Army recruits a Slytherin member, Daphne Greengrass, who just wanted to pass her O.W.L's.

  When Lily's secret is revealed Harry runs away from home and meets a girl unlike any other. But she can never be with him, and he would never even suggest it. Things change drastically when his mother's legacy turns him into something no one expected.

** I liked linkffn(I'm not a hero), which is something considering how much I generally dislike Haphne, or WBWL. The fic is a lot less tropey then the usual Haphne fics, and even the Dumbledore bashing feels more... natural? Then most. It's not forced or shoehorned in.

** How about Harry Potter and the Unexpected Friend?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12557197/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Unexpected-Friend]]

There's a sequel also, that is not completed but is active.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12927652/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Unexpected-Dogfather]]

I've read so many of these that they blend together now. But these were good. One I just finished reading (because it ran out of chapters) is Haphne. But it is WAY AU. I like the dragon theme, and I like this author's writing style. Worth a look: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11610805/1/Dragon-Chronicles-1-Muggle-Raised-Champion]]
