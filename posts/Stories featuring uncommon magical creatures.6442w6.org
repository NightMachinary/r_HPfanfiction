I don't care how they are part of the story, a creature that is encountered, a familiar, an animagus form, etc.

Phoenixes, nundus, manticores, hydras or a magical counterpart of a mundane creature.

Thanks!!


** Does the creature have to be a big part of the story? Or just a chapter or three?

*** As long as those chapters are interesting and don't gloss over the creatures

**** A Black Comedy and Rise of the Wizards have a Nundu. The most recent chapter of Dodging prison and Stealing Witches has an Obsurial and a Tebo.

HP and the Lightning Scar has a Thunderbird(not a canon one though) animagus Harry.

Can't think of much else of the top of my head atm. With the new Fantastic Beasts movie plus the book, we should be seeing a lot of creatures in fics soon I reckon.

** There's a great 6th/7th year fic where Harry receives a baby Runespoor. I don't remember the fic, and I don't want to spoil too much, but I personally liked the fic. If anyone can remember the name of the fic, that'd be great! (Hint: It's not "HP and the Runespoor Shield" that I'm thinking of, though that's also a cool fic.)

** I just ten minutes ago finished a year 8 Drarry fic called Helix that I really enjoyed. The couple is brought together by frost snails.
