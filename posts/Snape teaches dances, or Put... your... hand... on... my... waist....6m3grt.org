Okay, i've just seen too many jokes on that topic lately.

I understand that normally Snape wouldn't do that as most of slytherins are from pureblood families and parents must have tought them to dance.

But I don't care. Any fics mentioning Snape teaching dances?


** Ooh on his waist? Is Snape dancing as the girl? XD

I don't think I've seen a fic where Snape teaches dancing, but you've made me curious too.

** Engaging in such activities would probably go badly for Snape. He's not the most affectionate fellow.

I'm all ears.

** Dumbledore could make Snape teach Harry.

"Harry, my boy, I know that you and Professor Snape have unresolved issues, but I assure you, it wouldn't do to have a Hogwarts' Champion attending the ball and make a fool of himself because he can't dance. There's really nobody else we can trust with such an important matter, do you understand?\\
-But...\\
-That's settled then! Be in Professor Snape's office Thursday night at 6, before dinner. I urge you not to speak of this to another soul. I cannot stress enough how much secrecy matters in this instance! I can only apologize once more for all the hardship you have to go through. Once again, Harry, will you be able to forgive an old man his mistakes?"

*** I need —Åontinuation to it!

"Clear your mind, Potter!"

"Sir, are you sure it must be done like this?"

"I know for sure, Potter! Arrogant, just like your father..."

"You danced with my father, sir?"

** This is likely not exactly what you were thinking of, but I can't not mention this fic since it fits so well: linkffn(Blurring reality)

Snape is a dance teacher in this strange AU universe. This fic isn't really what you expect though, and he is in character here so he doesn't exactly dance with anyone. I know the summary sounds really silly, but it's really good, well written and gets super intense at times. It's about a dance school putting on a performance called "the prophecy" thats basically the plot of canon events. It's a story of double meanings and parallels between the plot, the characters performing the play, their canon counterparts, the events going on in the dance school and canon universe. As time goes on, the characters start losing their grip with reality and the parallels between them and their canon selves become more apparent. Has some great characterizations of Harry, Tom Riddle and Snape. Its sadly incomplete though.

I believe I have also seen a few fics where he teaches someone to dance, although I don't remember in which ones. I don't think that is in character of him though and I have no idea which fics those were since it wasn't a major plot line in any that I can think of.

  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection. The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.

*** You do realize you just put a really sharp object in my chest with this rec. This is one of my favorite stories in the fandom and it's likely abandoned. I've been trying to forget it exists so I can go back to it one day when (hopefully) it's updated, lol. Also, he does guide Harry's dance in one scene, so it does apply here!
