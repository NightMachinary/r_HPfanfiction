I just wanted you to know you confused a poor girl and made her feel like a fool.

*** I too spent a few moments beeing confused -though that might have something to do with me continually forgetting that not everyone considers cursed child canon. Its like requesting fics with OC's from random-bad-fic-everone-hates, its just such a wtf moment for me XD

Ceplma has a massive hate on for this story but if you read his little essay it comes down to "insufficiently worshipful of Ron and Ginny". It doesn't even bash them, just writes them out respectfully.

  If Harry Potter could alter the past, he isn't sure what he'd change, but he knows he'd change something. If Severus Snape could hold history in his hands, he knows exactly what shape he would mold it into. Albus Dumbledore might flatter himself enough to think he would walk away from such power. But Delphi Riddle isn't here to serve any of them. (Rating for some really prolific cursing and very little else.)

** I have really conflicted thoughts about “The Augurey” by La Matrona (intentionally not linking). On the one hand it is truly atrocious thing, which I haven't managed to finish, and [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/augurey-or-loosing-of-sanity.html][I wrote about why]]. On the other hand, I really liked the basic premise of the story: The Trio learns about existence of Delphini (all bad jokes about inconsistency of her existence with the canon put aside) by the means of the tapestry in the Grimmauld Place or otherwise, and Harry's saving-orphans-thing (which I believe could be the thing, see linkao3(601124)) lead to him saving her after the war and rising her in secret (or perhaps not so in secret, could she be a sibling of Teddy, Andromeda raising all orphans of the Black family?). I would really like somebody write it in a decent way, which doesn't make my brain boil.

#+begin_quote
  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)
