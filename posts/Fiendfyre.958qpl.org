There is no 'incantation' for this complex dark magic but I'm wondering has anyone read a fic that created one? I really want to put an inca tation to the spell


** My own headcanon is that, like the Killing Curse, it's in an old dead language (aramaic for the Killing Curse) which is why it's obscure.

So, we're looking for an ancient culture that was /really/ in to fire? Well, how about the ancient Arachosians, whose religion went on to maintain fire as a holy symbol? (We know it today as Zoroastrianism).

Fiendfyre is cast with a chanted stanza of Old Avestan. Up to you whether it's the blasphemous unleashing of Ahriman's destruction (which is suppressed as Dark Magic for very good reason) or it's a call for the holy cleansing flame of Ahura Mazda (which is called Dark Magic out of racism and/or religious bigotry, but is still wildly illegal to cast in a built-up area).

*** The Fiendfyre seems to embody the destructive aspect of fire, that seems to have a mind of its own as it eats everything. That doesn't mesh that well with the benficial, purifying interpretation of fire in late Zoroastrianism. Of course we can always go with it representing fire corrupted by Angra Mainyu. I think would be more fitting to show his corruptive aspect rather than straight-up destructive.

**** Well, maybe if you're calling the fire with a pure heart to cleanse a taint from the world, you get the one, and if you try and use it as a weapon, you get the other, with attendant risk of having it turn on you?

***** That's an incredibly strained interpretation because you have to add the destructive aspect of purification, which wasn't originally here, and because of the name.

** In my fics I use the incantation "Terror Infernus", which doesn't mean much but I like the sound of it. I've also seen the rather more literal "Malus Ignis" being used a fair amount.

*** I've also seen Malus Ignis a few times in fics. Personally I don't care for it because a literal translation of "bad fire" doesn't seem very poetic or impressive. I could see that being the incantation of a lesser flame spell, but Fiendfire is supposed to be the highest tier; I'd want something more exotic to fit.

** Another incantation used is Az-Roth, to invoke a gothic feeling or an ancient mysterious language. If I remember correctly, it was used in linkffn(Wastelands of time)

*** It was "Az-reth" actually.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/14/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Ch13]]:

  Az-reth, I thought, penning a particularly vicious looking rune, all jagged edges and malevolence. Destruction and chaos --blasts of fiendfyre hotter and stronger than what could be conjured these days by a mere wand.

HPMOR also uses the same incantation as an homage to that fic.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** Inferni ignis = hellfire

Ignis Edax = voracious/devouring fire

I liked the movie displays of fire being breathed out by Voldemort in the Atrium battle and in a very controlled way by the Durmstrang student at the end of their arrival march. From my perspective, why have ten different fire spells when five will do -- let's say that those were examples of Fiendfyre. If so, the incantation for the spell would have to made silently, which may be part of why it's so difficult to control.

** Following all the other answers, I also read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12729845/19/Adversity-Breeds-Excellence][here]] someone doing some kind of ritual invocation with a long spell to use Fiendfyre. Not the only place I read something like this but that's the one I remember right now.

Of course there is also the not really original "Fiendfyre" incantation.

** I would see the Fiendfyre as representing a destructive aspect of fire. Like a big fire that ravages through the city, that almost have the mind on its own in how it devours more and more buildings. I would probably use "malus flamma" as "malus" seems to have that connotation of bad will.
