My thoughts are that it'd be nice to have a potion or contraception charm in real life as they do in fanfic world instead of having to deal with pills that fuck with your emotions or an implant device.

I've only seen one fic where they recommend an anti-disease potion, so not sure what fanfic characters do about that. Are there magical condoms?

Food for thought as the beginning of the New Year is when dating apps get the most sign ups. Unless you're one of the 11-year-olds on here, then don't think about such things.


** I read one where Harry was given a strip of condoms with the /impervious/ charm applied individually. (More effective that way, doncha know) This concept works for me, although I've not seen it used elsewhere. Normally it's a charm or a potion or some combo thereof with, once in a while, a brief mention of Muggle methods. Usually considered not as good.

  ‚ÄúNot that wand, Potter!‚Äù Mad-Eye replied with a grin. The old wizard then reached into an inside pocket of his cloak and fished out a perforated strip of foil-sealed condoms that cascaded down towards the ground, accordion-style.

  ‚ÄúWill a half-dozen be enough for the day, or should I make a run to the chemists?‚Äù

  Harry looked at the prophylactics with wide-eyed shock and a bright red flush on his face and neck.

  ‚ÄúMad-Eye, it's really not like that...we're not...these girls aren't...‚Äù

  ‚ÄúUh-huh, sure kid,‚Äù Moody retorted. ‚ÄúThese aren't just normal muggle rubbers...got /Impervious/ charms applied individually...much safer that way...‚Äù

**** Regarding muggle methods - it's actually pretty common in marriage law fix's in order to circumvent the ‚Äòmandatory breeding' programs.

Oh great. For all those people worried that condoms give you just too much sensation, now you can feel absolutely nothing!

  "With these on, technically I haven't touched you," Harry explained to Daphne, "so I guess you'll still be a virgin."

**** Yeah, an Unbreakable Charm would be better if they're worried about it being defective.

**** It's all about the intent! ;) But Harry had better learn how to charm his own, in that case.

** I've been brainstorming it lately and as much as I love the options of potions and spells, id like to do something new or different. Such as; once a witch or wizard starts puberty they are called to a Mediwitch/healer where they teach them to place a runic seal that locks to their individual magical signatures on their lower abdomen. This must be done once every 3 months and doesn't effect the child's puberty, just makes them temporarily unable to have children until it fades.

** I don't think there's anything actually in canon about birth control. My solution was a simple potion that works the same way for both sexes. 3 drops every 24 hours, Madam Pomfrey hands it out no questions asked because ‚Äúit's easier than delivering babies in the hospital wing‚Äù.

*** I like the idea of a potion every day, but I think different potions for different sexes would be more effective, no? Like, males have different hormones than women, so it would make sense to have a potion tailored for that

** There is a reason all the witches and wizards are married young.... üßê Ive actually see several flicks that use the ‚Äúprevention in a bottle, added to the food‚Äù approach.

_______ sorry the following is quite dark____ It all started when the worst headmaster of all times were murdered in his own office by the headgirl. A girl whom he had obliviated like he did with all his girls. This girl just kept a much better journal and began to investigate when more and more memory gabs appeared. She learned mind magicks from a pureblood friend.... and got really really motivated when she began to suspect she was pregnant.

Then.. she was called to see the headmaster the very same day she came to the conclusion, that she must be pregnant. She had all the signs. Her intent was to go to the school nurse, and explain her worries. She had no boyfriend and she had not had physical contact with a boy, for more than half a year (and that was only a kiss).

The girl got the most surreal feelings and d√©j√† vu like she's been in the headmasters office before. Hear instincts told her to run, her hands were cold and twitching as small ghost-impulses toward drawing her wand. The headmaster told her to disrobe, to stand op and let him inspect her again. She was a beauty, a price in his collection. She did not obey as he wanted. The headmaster lost a bit of his temper and threw go to compulsion curse at her, while ranting about how ungrateful she was and that she should be glad one such a he, would even look at her. The compulsion did not take hold.

The girl began to understand and she slowly took off the outer rope, while trying to think about a way out. She did not want him to try another maybe more successful charm or spell. Satisfied the headmaster also started to remove his clothes, but paused just as he was about to put down wand on the table. He turned around and mumbled ‚Äúbetter not to forget‚Äù, while flicking a basic anti-pregnancy charm at her. The charm met the parameters it was designed to work on, and therefore could do nothing else but, to fizzed out of existence with a little spark and odd ozone smell to the air. The headmaster was baffled and stepped closer. He interpreted her frozen stance in panic, as a obedient girl waiting for orders.

‚Äúyou are pregnant!? But I was careful and always use the charm....‚Äù The headmaster mumbled while casting one more charm, directly at her lower stomach. ‚ÄúHow careless of me, stupid stupid stupid!‚Äù He turned around (last major error of his life), The head master were looking trough some vials and old musty books. ‚ÄúNow... termination and obliviation or just a banishment... or all of them.... She's not that important.‚Äù He mumbled while believing she was standing there under a compulsion.

He did not even have time to react before he was thrown to the floor. Dazed he sat up and looked at her standing there with one of his signed Beaters bats. Her fingers was already white from holding the bat so tightly. ‚ÄúYou monster! You are supposed to guide, protect and help us learn!!!‚Äù She stormed over and tried to hit him one more time. But he raised his arms just in time to await a hit to the head. He froze and looked at his now very much broken wand. His focus was swiftly changed, when her boot made the headmaster move 3 feet back, facilitated by a direct hit to the groin. One more kick and he fainted.

The girl was standing breathing heavily against the headmasters desk. After a while she noticed a single black book on the table. The only reason she pulled the book closer was because she spotted some names, including her own. It was a list with names next to the date and time of the week. On the following pages there was a small description of what had happened to the girl during that time and what fake memory had been used. She was disgusted. Felt like she would throw up. She found the last page. It just had her name and time. Nothing else.

She was about to panic, but found the strength to turn the pages..back. The book opened automatically on a overview like the first page she saw in the book. Her name was there again. Another time, but on the list. She turned forward once more and found her name. Not a short description, but a long tale in graphic details. She threw up and clung to the table. She grabbed the book again and turned the pages, back. Same names. Further back, skipping some pages. Other names on the list, but still her. Stil her... still her... So many details.

The girl grabbed the beaters bat again and went to town. Her magic infused rage actually made contact with the wards, and made resonance with them, letting everyone know that something happened. The wards made a huge gong sound when they snapped to the new deputy headmaster.

Sadly no one learned anything good from this. The next headmaster was an ass. An racist ass, but not a deviant. The board were told a ‚Äúmudblood‚Äù had caused all the problems, but that the public could not be told that. The papers already brought the news to the people and told tales about the old headmaster and his devian ways. Instead the new headmaster started the tradition of having pumpkin juice on the tables in the great hall. It is frighteningly easy to mask potions in that stuff. From the beginning he added a potion to the pumpkin juice so all students now have a small addiction and wants to drink it. Then they started to add a fertility blocker to the juice. Totally harmless and will stop working after 3 months. Can be ingested every day without any problems.

//////////

I just wrote this because I was bored.... but the idea is not mine at all. This is pretty much what happened in a long lost fanfic. I've actually seen this several places.

It could be... - Potion, for men and women, long and short term - charms, short term - Technically a Curse since i requires a counter curse - Potions the day after - Potions to remove all cramps and pains and make it a 3 hour nightmare instead of multi day. - Runes, on the beds that make it a non-fertile area Rune-ingraved piercings.
