#+TITLE: My «favourite Harry» is in the later books when he is sassy and witty with great comebacks. Any fics out there that capture that side of him well?

*** Summary:

Getting stuck in 1942 was bad. Getting put into Slytherin was even worse. Having Tom Riddle practically stalk him? Harry hated his life.(Not a slash)

** linkao3(survival is a talent) does this well. All the characters are witty without being irritating. It is a slash fic - and Drarry at that - but I would give it a chance. I read it recently, and the romance plays second fiddle to the friendship aspect of the fic.

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)
