** There is also very similar fic but with female!Harry when thousands years old version of her sends herself back in time. Harry was some legendary witch that is considered kind of founder of magic. Sending back in time place is in fact a pyramid that she warded.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

**** Okay, if that's Harry then why in chapter two does the character think "And now 'Harry' was lying on his bed. What an awful day to start being Harry. He suddenly wished he had never vanished the boy - not that that had been an option." Then the character goes on to repeatedly tell himself he's "Harry James Potter" so he'll believe it himself...

I find it infuriating when the author lies to the audience. I'm going to assume that's what's going on since you've read the story and I haven't.

****** I assumed that was the bullshit excuse used. I probably won't read this one because of this. It's a HUGE peeve of mine.

Thanks for explaining!
