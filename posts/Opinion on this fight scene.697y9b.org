Backstory first. Arawn is a Voldemort-adopted Harry^{Don't hate me please}. Voldemort took over the wizarding world after letting Wormtail try and kill Harry for him. When the spell rebound he kept Harry rather than try for himself. The strongest muggleborn are put in Hogwarts to be indoctrinated into Voldemort's muggle-fighting army he's building. Hermione is being nominated to rise up the house ranks from second to last to the very top house. To do this she needs to beat someone from that house in combat.

*Scene begins*

"No injuring reproductive organs, no killing," she reiterated before swiping her wand down. "Go!"

Immediately, Granger dove behind a wall and vanished. Had Granger's nominator been anyone but himself, Arawn was sure Pucey would have been taunting and jeering about her skill. But since she had been trained by him . . .

Instead, Pucey cast the super sensory charm on himself. He then took a step and immediately had to cover his ears as he triggered a catwurling charm. He was raising his wand, no doubt to cancel either his charm or Granger's, when he abruptly dove to the side, wand snapping out a whip of fire even as the blue light of a tongue-tying jinx grazed his robe sleeve.

"Finite!" The alarm stopped, and Pucey was immediately casting again. "Fumo!" Great plumes of dark smoke flowed from his wand, revealing the negative shape of Granger's invisible form. The 7th year's wand trained on her. "Cru-"

"Astringo! Semper Adhaereo!"

"-ci-ack!" Pucey was cut off as his tie tightened enough to choke him then stuck permenantly in a knot. Pucey dove away behind his own cover and after a second of yanking at the tie, gave up and cast a low powered cutting hex, slicing through the cloth. Arawn, despite his anger at the mudblood, was impressed. The permanent sticking charm was very difficult to cast in battle.

On the other side of the Pit, Granger had reappeared, and was conjuring oil using a variation of the water-making spell. The oil was being shot into potion vials. Seeing that Pucey had removed the tie, Granger tapped one of the full vials and from her wand gushed a deep blue flame, catching the surface of the oil on fire. She then lobbed the vial at Pucey's area. It hit, shattered, and the flame exploded. Pucey, who had been coughing and trying to breathe again was forced to scramble away, a spout of water soaking the flames. They didn't go out and instead spread further as water mixed with lit oil. The teen cursed, but as Granger readied a second vial for throwing, Pucey sent a shattering curse at it. Granger's eyes widened and she barely jumped back in time, even then still getting lightly scorched. She hadn't even landed fully when she was forced to duck and dive a barrage of spells ranging from disarmers to the cruciatus. As she did, she fumbled in her robes and came back out with a vial of potion that she quickly uncorked, beginning to raise it to her lips.

"Accio potion!" The vial was torn from her hand, speeding toward Pucey. He only had a moment to enjoy the victory when Granger sent her own shattering curse. The potion splashed all over Pucey's face and eyes and the seventh year cried out in pain, casting a spell to clean away the goo that had already begun to burn away skin. In that time, Granger had vanished again. Growling in frustration, Pucey swung himself in a circle, blasting the cover areas to pieces, two fire whips slicing through the air as soon as the arena was clear.

The two whips flashed, one high and one low so Granger would have no hope to dodge. Indeed she didn't, and in a corner, the whips were blocked by a shield. Immediately spells began to rain down into the corner. Pucey kept up the barrage for a good minute, and there wasn't a single counter attack in that time. The shield had shattered after five seconds. Arawn's magic was beginning to swirl with anger and he ground his teeth. That mudblood better be faking, or- before he could finish, to the right of the corner, spells began flying back. To his surprise, they were all cast silently, even the cruciatus that Pucey barely ducked. One of the larger fragments of what used to be a cover spot stretched and twisted into a long metal needle the size of Arawn's forearm. It lifted off the ground and began flying for Pucey, who was trapped between two cruciatus curses and a stunner. Pucey took a breath and stepped into the way of one of the torture spells, the needle swooping overhead and banking to come again.

Pucey however was paying more attention to the fact that the cruciatus had done nothing but turn where it hit a sickly red. Arawn realized at the same time as he that Granger had been using a coloring charm in place of actual spells. Pucey's face darkened with fury and embarrassment.

"You bitch!" He hissed, anger making him spin and snap up a magic absorbing shield to stop the needle. Unfortunately he forgot the needle used to be a chunk of rubble the size of his head. So when the needle hit the shield, the transfiguration and locomotion spells on it were cancelled. The momentum not so much.

Pucey tried to twist out of the way, but the rock smashed into his hip with a loud crack. He dropped screaming, his left leg jutting oddly at the joint, body stiff and twitching with clear effort to not writhe and bring more pain. Granger, visible once more, approached at a run, practically stepping on him she got so close. Aiming at his wand arm, which was propping him up on his good side, she cast again.

"Brackium Emendo!" Arawn frowned. Why was she casting the bone mending-oh. He didn't bother hiding a smirk when Pucey collapsed further, his wand arm bending bonelessly beneath him in ways a normal arm shouldn't, looking more like a fleshy worm than a limb. She had purposely miscast the spell. Granger then proceeded to pluck the seventh year's wand from his boneless grasp, stunned the teen and held the wand aloft in victory.


** What is 'a magic absorbing shield' and why would one use it against a physical object. Surely it makes more sense to banish/deflect it/transfigure it. Also if Pucey is a seventh year in the top house (I assume this means he should be skilled) then surely he should use silent casting a bit more?

Also why use smoke over the Human-Presence-Revealing Spell (Homenum Revelio)? Where does the smoke go? Surely it would restrict vision not aide it?

*** That's a good point about the silent casting, I hadn't thought about it, thanks. As for the shield, he got sloppy in his anger. The shield is a spell I made up. Smoke is a good point too. Thanks! I think I honestly forgot that spell existed.

**** The pacing is better than a lot of stories. The only other thing that stands out to me is the oil vial thing. Its neat and makes for a clever move but it feels like you sacrificed realism to pat yourself on the back because just shooting oil at and around the cover Pucey dives behind would be quicker and more effective. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief but if I could shoot a jet then why wouldn't I?

****** That's fine, I might suggest you change ' The oil was being shot into potion vials' to The oil was trickling into potion vials or something that implies a weaker flow.

** I award you 8/10 for pacing. Imo nothing ruins a fight scene like overabundance of details that kills the pace of action. Not full marks because there's some clumsy wording and paragraphs need to be restructured (the two big wall'o'texts in the middle) that could further improve the scene.

The prose needs some work, but it's a good effort. I'd say it's a scene I would've written a couple years ago. Definitely stands above typical fanfic crap, though how much of a compliment that is is for you to decide.
