Not looking for stories where the Dursleys are just nice, but where they also help Harry in some way, shape, or form.


** linkffn(Proud) has a lot of flaws, but excellent characterisation. The focus is more on Vernon than Harry.

  What if Voldemort made a mistake with his Horcruxes? What if he had truly been vanquished that fatefull night? What if the Dursley's didnt treat Harry like crap, but rather with casual indifference? Who would Harry become and what would his world look like? Read along with a seventh year Harry as he goes through his diary of Hogwarts and experience his best and worst moments! AU

  Getting expelled from Smeltings was probably the best thing to happen to Vernon. Finishing her Nursing degree was probably the best thing to happen to Petunia. In this universe, Harry Potter is left on the doorstep of a very different Dursley family.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
