As above, I am looking for stories told mainly via documents such as letters exchanged between characters, diary entries, clippings from magazines/newspapers, etc. Example of such a fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3867175/1/Notebooks-and-Letters][Notebooks and Letters]]. Thanks very much in advance!


** [[http://letterblade.net/thirty-five_owls.html][Thirty-Five Owls]]: "Go teach your children, eat your candy, preen your bird and bury me. But we were brilliant together, Albus, and not even you can change history" --- a correspondence between Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald.

This is some of the best writing I have ever seen, period. Every fan of Harry Potter should read this.

** Okay, I should get a macro to recommend this fic. Most of it is journal entries, so it fits the request:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]] by wordhammer

#+begin_quote
  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.
#+end_quote

--------------

So. A warning first.

Where it says "dark and disturbing?"

It means it.

Really. That is not a joke. This is /not/ a powerful Harry macho fantasy, where he's "dark" and "brooding" and blows people up with a wandless wave of his hand while having sex with a dozen girls. Not even close.

This is a freefall jump into the depths of the evil possible in a magical world. And most of the time, the main character is not even vaguely in control of the situation. Or even their body.

Great writing and plotting. Just about every possible trigger. That "M" rating means this fic isn't fucking around, not that it drops a few f- or c-bombs.

It's really horrible and disgusting. Honestly, I think it got away from /wordhammer/ at some point, but they stuck to their thematic and world-building guns and followed it to the logical conclusions.

And that's why it is one of my favorites of all time.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1575593/chapters/3344900][Chaos is a Butterfly]] is collected from a Potterfic tumblr and includes a great deal of this sort of thing, mostly personal correspondence, press articles, and interdepartmental memos at the MoM. The central mystery is only sort of resolved right now... the author continues to post updates as part of a general focus on expanding the history/mythology of the Potterverse.

*** Thank you for the recommendation. The format vaguely reminds me of the SCP foundation wiki. However, as a general rule I prefer completed stories, even though that rules out a lot of good content. Still, I appreciate the rec.

** The Hogwarts Blog:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3884283/1/The-Hogwarts-Blog]]

It goes through all the years, changing a few things slightly each year until you end up with an entirely different story. There's a sequel that covers post-Hogwarts. The first few years are very similar to cannon, and that gets you used to the style

The first part is a little crack-ficcy, but it gets serious later.
