So I just gave Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19 a reread and I loved it just as much as the first few times i read it.

For those interested, it takes place in a heavy AU where Salazar becomes immortal and takes over the wizarding world. He reworks his empire into a caste system with old family purebloods at the top, and mudbloods as casteless. There are a number of factions at play, both within the empire as well as without, including the Dark Lord Grindelwald and his forces that have taken control of Eastern Europe. The entire empire is basically at Total War, with serious dedication to the war on the border.

For those that have recommendations, I would love other serious overhaul AUs that are as well done as this. Or, and it's kind of a strange request, any fic with a mentor like MacNair is in this fic. I just love him and the other groundskeepers. How different they are from their canon selves but how little hints are the same and they just have so much character for their little screen time

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** Linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom)

This one is pretty dramatic AU, but is unfortunately unfinished. The premise is that the Potters ran away from britain and went into hiding after hearing about the prophecy, and voldemort one and cemented his power in Britain. The story is from the perspective of harry returning to Britain as a child, and both he and the wizarding world are different yet similar to their canon self.
