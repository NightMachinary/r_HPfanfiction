I remember that a group of people sending patronus charm and Harry kept on going giving a more overpowered one... A patronus stag was said to have gored voldemort and all his horcuxes.. People was shocked when Harrys scar got the patronus attack too.


** I have no idea if either of these is the story you are seeking but Moments in Love by Gandalfs_Beard has Harry and Hermione's patronus charms be pretty much dark curse busters and they use the charm to destroy Voldemort.

And his addendum for certain steamier scenes linkao3(5204972)

The story What If? by TheCrackedoutFirebird has the patronus charm used to destroy voldemort

  In First Year, Harry realises early on that he has more in common with Hermione than Ron. Their friendship gradually blossoms into something more - something that Voldemort will come to regret - the Power that he knows not. ... First through third year near canon, more AU from fourth year on.

  What would have happened if Harry had asked Hermione to the Yule Ball first? How different would things have been between them and how would the wizarding world be affected by a simple question? Chapters are a comfortable 5,500 words.
