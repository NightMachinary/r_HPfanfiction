I don't think the title of this post is entirely fair. I remember at least one Muggle AU where Ginny was a former boxer and there's a multiple reality fic (The Granger Principle) where she plays tennis so presumably people find alternative sports for Harry too. But the reality is that there's only one sport with the adage *catches win matches* ([[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/cricket-researchers-prove-catches-dont-win-matches/WWWIAF6O7YZ4YMTC3WAEGP3ASM/][not everyone agrees, though]]). And, thus, for those of you thinking of writing a muggle AU with a sporty Harry, I present [[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/cricket-logan-van-beek-takes-stunning-catch-as-wellington-firebirds-beat-northern-knights-in-super-smash/R6MBYMYKJ455LXRTYLROFQWTHA/][this.]] Hopefully it's not geolocked or anything stupid like that.

(Oh, and I'm pretty sure the answer is "because soccer is by far the world's most popular sport".)

Actually, I'm pretty sure Quidditch was created as this weird fusion of cricket and soccer. It probably sounds a bit weird because soccer seems a much better comparison. But, if it helps, treat Quidditch as simultaneous cricket... where a team is fielding (seeking), bowling (the beaters, actually) and chasing (chasing) all at once. Of course, in cricket, you only chase if you're batting after someone but that's what I mean by simultaneous.

The seeker's 150 points and the consequent irrelevance of the efforts of the chasers to the outcome even kind of has an analogue in cricket. You see, the efforts of the batsmen and the bowlers are far less related than those of defensive and attacking players in soccer (or American Football or netball or any other sport with clear defensive and attacking roles). Imagine, for example, a bowling attack that restricts their opponents to 150 all out in the first innings. That's a very strong performance by the bowling unit. They can do (and many teams) have done much better but it's not really attacking or defensive because it has no bearing on what the team makes in its own and subsequent innings. And that's where maybe you get a reply of 136 all out. In other words, the hard work of the bowlers (chasers) basically doesn't matter at all because the other team's bowlers (seeker, now... it's not a direct analogy) were better.

(And, yes, you can get similar situations... the odd ball over the top or whatever that an attacking player sticks in the net even as the defence concedes goal after goal... in other sports, but the division between the two is no-where near as stark. All the batting players have to contribute to the bowling effort are catches and run outs. )

And this happens all the time, incidentally. The bowlers do something good... or even remarkable... and then the batting effort collapses. There are probably some examples of the reverse scenario but I can't recall any.

Anyway, the main thing is just... the natural choice for Muggle sport Harry (especially in the AU context), is cricket because of the whole *catches win matches* thing. The rambling argument that Quidditch is just more extreme a division of responsibility for winning than in most sports (although, I think in American Football the offensive and defensive player subsets can have no overlapping players whatsoever) rather than being completely insane, is sort of a distraction. Although, yes, I do feel like I'm constantly teetering on the edge of having solved Quidditch... it mostly feels like a sport designed to make obvious sports tropes work more obviously, e.g.

- teamwork
- tragics (Ron is a Cannons tragic)
- a player better than the team they're on (Krum... compare, for example, CR7 vs his Portugal teammates vs Messi vs his Argentina teammates)
- the gamut from casual indifference around (lethal) force to considering it an essential part of the game ([[https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/sidharth-monga-how-soon-will-we-need-to-reconsider-how-essential-bouncers-are-to-cricket-1246365][read this]])
- the thrill of the chase (ironically, mostly with Harry)
- and more beside (in fanon, of course, we also have the old Qudditch muscles trope)

That, and Americans writing fics at least understand soccer. No one over here has any idea how cricket works.

*** Cricket is no more complex than any other sport. It's just most sports don t have legions of people who spend their time perpetuating the meme of their complexity. Imagine if all soccer was known for was the offside and handball rules.

What's even more ridiculous is that tennis and American Football are borderline unwatchable if you know nothing about them due to how frontloaded their trivial rules and quirks are. Cricket's a bat and ball sport... it's very easy to make sense of what you're seeing.

**** Complexity has very little to do with it. Cricket just isn't popular over here. No one learns how to play it growing up, you don't see it on TV, it's just not a part of our culture.

So many American fanfic authors probably wouldn't even think of cricket as an option. And the ones who do would still prefer to use soccer, because it works just as well and it's what they have experience with.

***** Yeah, fantastic.

Now... let's talk about lets, tie-breaks, how points become games, how games turn into sets, how sets are won, second serves (remembering we have lets), aces and everything else.

All of that makes a lot of sense if you know how points become games and basically none if you don't. And if you're watching it trying to figure it out, you're liable to be thrown as soon as you come to the first tie break where the standard rules don't apply.

** Because football is a fast-paced team based sport, much like Quidditch.

Because football involves all players on the pitch at the same time, much like Quidditch.

Because football involves players passing a ball to each other and scoring a goal past a keeper, much like Quidditch.

Because football is a popular sport in schools, attracting lots of spectators, much like Quidditch.

Cricket is still reasonably popular, I agree, but it's still not quite as mainstream as football. Honestly, I think Quidditch is closer to a football/basketball hybrid than football/cricket. Harry even says in canon "it's sort of like basketball on brooms with six hoops".

It's not out of the question that Muggle AU Harry would play cricket. In fact, it's nice to see it as some variety.

But there are plenty of Muggle sports closer to Quidditch than cricket is.

**** It's all about cultural perception: while baseball, rugby, and cricket rank up highly in people's eyes of being American/British sports, American football and football (sorry, I can't keep calling it soccer, lol) are perceived to be /the/ American and British sports, respectively.

Football and American football matches are constantly publicized and hyped, what with events like the NFL, Premier League and its under leagues, and European cross-country competitions like EUFA, et cetera.

** Football's huge in Britain like how Quidditch is really popular in wizarding Britain. Cricket just isn't. It's got a following and all but people tend to think it's a bit boring. That and Harry (probably) would have grown up playing football even just having a kick about.

*** Not really, no. In fact, I'm going to say it's a hard no on that.

In cricket you need three players to represent a reasonable course of play. Compare "solo goals" in soccer. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K9sKqjr8xs][Here's a video so you can see what I mean]]. Every single one of those goals is a lot more complicated than "the bowler steams in, the batsmen hits/misses, the [fielder does something]".

Something complex to describe in cricket requires something special or absurd. But even then there's very limited simultaneity. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xSuEBhHkzM][Like, you can't actually tell what happens in this video due to the lack of replays,]] but Latham's dropped by the first guy and then the second one manages to catch it after it bounced out of the first guy's hands... thus Latham is dismissed. Even this is probably easier to describe than a jinking run past several defenders, the denial of passing options and, of course, the goalie's POV. And that's with a solo goal which aren't representative of a soccer match at all.

Of course, soccer's quite uniquely suited to an extremely restricted limited POV. No need to deal with anyone else and what's happening if you're just stuck in the head of a single player. But then you're not going to get any scope of the game... which, after all, does have 22 players (barring red cards of unfortunate injuries). But if you want to fill this moments of action, you're going to get crazy score lines like 1-9 (e.g. this match from [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWbnPX2K14k][Digimon Adventure 02)]] Because soccer is, in some sense, a low frequency sport.

The level of ambition required to write a soccer game is high, is what I'm saying.

(Not that I can remember all that many Muggle AUs where you actually see the sport in question.)
