**** Hermione fosters some war orphans and Harry uses his inheritance (cash not bullshit magic) to help her, along the way they both end up falling in love. The ship isn't the main focus of the story, the children are. It's a slice of life fic where the tear jerker moments exist because of the nature of the relationship between foster children and parents.

It should be noted that while some of the teenage characters can be angsty, it's not an angst fic.
