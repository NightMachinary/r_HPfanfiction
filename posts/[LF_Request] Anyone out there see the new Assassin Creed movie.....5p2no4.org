Heh. Takes me back.

Yeah, AC can be pretty boring. It's mostly running around, the fighting is rarely difficult, and god help you if you're a completionist. You're basically paying for the setting you're playing in, rather than the game itself.

I actually liked the first AC. Video guy was whining about the characters sounding like robots when he showed the clip of Altair and the other assassin; well, fucking yeah! They're brainwashed cult assassins, you think those guys are encouraged to have feelings? You're a professional murderer. This is literally your job. Of course you're going to be doing a lot of trailing your target. Patience, grasshopper.

AC2 was better in pretty much every way, hands down.

Everything after 2 was "Ezio/Connor/4th guy/5th guy/6th guy's Flying Murder Circus". Though, I did make my own fun in AC4 by taking the assassination contracts and finding ways to snipe my target in the head from maximum range.

As for the new movie... meh. I doubt they'll do anything special with it. Usual action movie shit.
