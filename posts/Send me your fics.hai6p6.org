Literally just the title :) I'll read one or two chapters and leave a review. So recommend me some fanfictions!!


** Circinus

March 1984. Walburga Black sits alone in Grimmauld Place, accompanied only by her ghosts, a broken woman with little left to live for. The House of Black lays in ruins, it's members scattered, awaiting its inevitable demise. Until, one day, a Ministry owl comes tapping at her window, bearing news that offers a last chance to change the course of her life - and the fate of the Black family.

Seizing the opportunity to free her son from Azkaban and secure him the trial he was denied, Walburga quickly finds out that three years in prison has done little to quell Sirius Black's rebellious spirit, and it is soon clear that he is not going to simply follow the plans she has so carefully laid out for him.

As the impending trial approaches, both Sirius and Walburga must grapple with their broken relationship and stormy past - and Sirius himself must decide whether he will seize the chance of the freedom offered to him, or whether he will send himself back to Azkaban for the punishment he is so convinced he deserves...

My take on the "Walburga gets Sirius out of Azkaban" scenario.

***** Alright, I'm going to read it sometime this evening (in my time zone). Your story looks really successful, do you have any tips for another Black-family-centric-story writer?

****** I'm flattered you think that :3 Honestly my views aren't as great as other Black family/Sirius fits, since the way I write them is part of a rather small community that really doesn't buy into the whole "Sirius was abused by his evil parents" angle. They're by no means perfect, or even "good" people, sometimes, but I try to write them as well-rounded characters :)

Ultimately the biggest tip I'd have is to just go for it and really focus on whatever idea it is that you have. Study the characters beforehand, both from Canon and whatever headcanons you want to give them, and basically get to know the people you're writing. I find that stories flow better when you feel like you know how the characters would act/react.

As for promotion, I share my fics on Tumblr, which is also a great place for fandom interaction, so if you don't already, I'd highly recommend sharing your fics on there and seeking out like minded blogs. Mine is by the same name as my reddit username if you want to find me.

Good luck with your writing! :)

** linkffn(We, Harry Potter by wille179) is my creation. I had a conversation about this fic with one of my readers earlier today that made me revisit it, and I finally overcame my writer's block on it. If you make it to the last chapter, I have another chapter that should be coming out within the next day or so after I edit it.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (some fluff, no bashing, not power wank.)

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.

** AU where Luna Lovegood grows up as a Seer and founds a blood magic school for girls instead of going to Hogwarts. There's a lot about the Hallows, runes, experimental magic theory, wandlore, and crafting magical objects generally, if that's at all your help thing. Luna, Ginny, and Lavender are the three primary characters and there are also a few female OCs. Lots of female friendship as well, and the final pairing is F/F.

** I've been working on a founders era fic for a while! The first two chapters read well as a standalone piece if you want something shorter.

linkao3(the might of the architect by tinyporcelainehorses)

In case the bot doesn't work, here's the URL: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23957842/chapters/57621055]]

And here's the summary:

Hogwarts, Britain's largest community of magical learning, is only decades old and already bitterly divided. England has fallen to a foreign king. And as the stone walls of Hogwarts grow ever higher, whispers say that Salazar Slytherin is plotting something... Two students from either side of a war are driven together by events that will change Britain, magical and non-magical, forever.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13586585/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Enigmatic-Professor-Riddle]]) is a fic I'm currently writing. Basically Tom Marvolo Riddle didn't go all dark and chose a slightly different path to achieve his goals. When he applied for the post of the DADA professor, Dumbledore thus happily chose him.

Now Dumbledore is dead, with McGonagall as Headmistress and Tom as Deputy Headmaster. Harry is beginning his first year.

Do let me know how you find it!

** Here is my story: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24304897/chapters/58589047][Reformation]]

Summary: (or what happens when Tom Riddle realises the potential of mind control)

"You may think that the best kept secret on Earth is the concealment of the magical world from the muggle one, and you would be wrong. Millions of witches and wizards know that secret. No, the best kept secret on Earth --one that only a select few know-- is the concealment of the muggle world from the magical one." - Arcturus Black

Seven years after he left the magical world, Sirius Black's grandfather contacts him to say that his brother has gone missing. Sirius reluctantly agrees to work with his family to solve Regulus' disappearance by helping decode his brother's journals. Meanwhile, ex-werewolf-soldier Remus Lupin is hired as a personal assistant for Black Enterprises, Narcissa Malfoy tries to convince her sister Andromeda to run for the House of Commons, and Harry Potter is bewildered by the appearance of a stranger at Number Four, Privet Drive.

Very AU. Divergence after Tom Riddle's graduation. (rated M for coarse language (courtesy of Bellatrix and Sirius) and brief descriptions of violence)

Thank you for making this thread!
