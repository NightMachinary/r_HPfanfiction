Title


** My headcanon for HP universe vampires borrows heavily from [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185][Forever Knight]], which essentially has the modern idea of vampires imported into the Universe.

Abilities:

- Immortality
- Increased speed and strength
- Minor power of suggestion against humans, less effective against witches and wizards
- Minor resistance against dark magic
- Natural regeneration
- Heightened senses, particularly night vision
- Retains most magical abilities

Weaknesses:

- Sunlight is extremely painful, causes severe burns and is quickly fatal
- Highly weak to fire, causes extreme burns and quickly becomes fatal
- Prolonged duration without feeding inhibits regeneration and magic resistance; can lead to a bloodlust, driving them to feed from the nearest available source
- Contact with silver causes burns and inhibition of powers
- Unable to apparate
- Unable to conjure a patronus, exposure to one causes similar effects to sunlight, though not fatal
- Aside from fire and sunlight, can be killed decapitation or wooden stake through the heart

If you want to introduce vampirism in an interesting way, there must be real drawbacks to gaining whatever abilities you decide that it should entail.

*** I wouldn't make them fatally weak to Sunlight or fire, but rather it drains them of so much energy and power it essentially leaves them in a coma, making them easy stake targets. It becomes too simple that a simple incendio would take down a Vampire Horde within seconds.

**** It really depends on how much faster they can move than humans. If If they can run literal circles around them, and are able to cast magic themselves, then anything short of fiendfyre is probably going to be impractical to use offensively.

** Most of the vampires in HP Fanfiction skims over the negatives in vampires to be honest. It depends really on whether you want your fic to be a OP!Harry type story, or more of a Cursed!Harry scenario.

I haven't really seen a ton of Vampire stuff outside of shitty Harem fics where Harry can't do wrong, might be interesting to see how Harry would deal with actually being a vampire.

For your question though, Vampires are, I would assume, much like Werewolves; Super-Strength, Super-Speed. They probably have some sort of thirst for blood (might be good to look at how Vampires drink blood from muggles legally?). Weak to light, fire?

I dunno, you can kind of do anything really, just make sure there is actual weaknessess to being a vampire, and not just 'Harry Sex-God Potter with pale skin'.

**** So... Only above literally the two most powerful wizards alive? You are aware that the Flamels are not necessarily more powerful than either of those two, right? I mean, if you want them to be, go ahead.

But you are already waaaay deep in the OP!Harry trope.

****** Age doesn't equal ability. Flamel could be just an average wizard, but absolutely exceptional Alchemist and they spend their lifes dicking around the world, having fun. There are wizards alive during the HP canon way older than even Dumbledore, who aren't even close as powerful.

I mean, again, your fic, you rules. I'm just saying that placing Harry that far up the foodchain is really tough to write in an engaging way.

** There are rules regarding vampires in Guidelines for the Treatment of Non-Wizard Part-Humans (GoF)

That may mean that vampires aren't able to use wizarding magic. Of course it can also mean that muggles can also become one, or that according to creators vampires can no longer be considered true wizards.

** I've written many vampire!Harry stories and the trick is to make it feel like it's not actually all plusside. There has to be some real penalties to becoming a vampire. Like, penalties so big that even Voldemort, who is obsessed with immortality, didn't see it as a solution.

I like my vampires to be gritty and dark, so I don't want to see a magic solution that allows him to go in daylight, and I don't want him to be able to subsist on animal blood carefully given to him once a week by Dumbledore. I want the thirst for human blood to be nearly uncontrollable, and nearly insatiable.

** Given there have been Vampires that have been to Hogwarts though we don't know of a lot (There could be me more, we just don't know Hogwarts is a big school and I can easily seeing kids hiding within the normal bunch) I'd say they aren't severely weakened by the sun. However for a fanfic I guess you can have it so he is weaker in light and stronger in darkness. You could really do anything you want Vampires were never touched on much in HP. As for the rest, things like higher physical abilities and semi-control over humans/hypnosis are pretty much law when speaking Vampires. Just don't make him a half-breed, half-breeds tend to have none of or less of the weaknesses a vampire has and all the strengths that come with it.

** I think the first thing you should do is decide if they're still humans with odd habits or monsters? Also are vampires a species that occurs naturally, or what created the first vampire at least, are they natural or are they a failed experiment of some sort. Better inferi or a route to immortality perhaps.

Personally I think you have to go for the monster side. Not that they can't potentially be civilised but if they were they why would we see so few. Hags are more accepted in wizarding society than vampires. There has to be a reason for that. Why are they treated with such distrust? The easiest answer by far is because they have earnt it. Blood is hugely important in magical society. You ancestry, your magic, your very life is tied to your blood and vampires try to take that. Vampires must also be weaker than wizards in combat. Why, because else they'd rule over farms of humans. They cannot be capable of taking over and have been driven back into smaller less well policed parts of the world which they likely share with werewolves who have turned their backs on civilisation. They exist at the mercy of wizards or perhaps it has been forgotten exactly why they stopped exterminating them. Either way if they were more powerful than humans they why would they be so shunned? Before you go down the numbers route, a common theme is that vampires can create more vampires, this means that they could create a force large enough to subdue the normal population and have easy feeding. They are regulated against and they accept it. They cannot be more powerful. Wizards are arrogant because they exist at the top and they know it.

This gives you the story were there is constant conflict as people try to decide if they can accept Harry. Harry has to conflict with his nature and his purpose. Does he choose to fight or is he coerced? Is the cost of winning the fight worth consorting with a vampire for the wizards. Would allying themselves with a vampire turn more wizards to Voldemorts side if the Order side with what they see as an abomination? Would wizards have sought retribution against the vampires for what they did to Harry in the first place? Would other Vampires have turned on those that turned Harry for the wrath they have brought down upon their species?

** The only thing we know in canon is that they're socially acceptable enough to be invited to parties. Otherwise, Slughorn wouldn't be caught dead inviting one. So they're not mindless killers or anything and maybe more accepted then werewolves. And the drawbacks must be enough that Voldemort didn't want to be one.

Rowling has written a blurb on Pottermore about them but the main gist is that she didn't feel like making a mythology for them: [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/vampires]]

Edit: Now that I think about it, there are blood lollipops in Honeydukes. Being a vampire must be way more okay than being a werewolf.

** Something essential to my view of HP vampires is that /they're not undead/. I seem them as another offshoot of humanity just like Veela, not something a wizard can just /become/ --- thereby handily solving the plothole that Voldemort (and Herpo the Foul, and literally anyone who ever wanted to cheat death) could just have become a vampire.

Beyond that, I see the vampires as having an Animagus-like ability to turn into bats or wolves (depending on the individual --- one vampire can't do both), plus magical abilities they /could/ use if not for the Wand Ban (and of course, most know a bit of wandless magic and the wealthier ones just bribe their way into Ollivanders anyway).
