**** Yeah, the author writes more of a mature character on principle, I think. His other series is a fun bit of crack if you don't mind a some Naruto smut. As for the cliches, HP isn't his main fandom, so I don't really think he cares much on that count...

***** I see what you mean. Still, overly-mature kids takes the charm and wonder out of the magic and story, for me, which is why I tend to avoid the trope in this fandom. Crack is nice, but it's not really a substitute for a /story.../

Still, thanks for the link. I know my request was really specific, and it's nice to know there's another story out there with a similar idea.

****** Well, the crack has SOME story, especially the first and the last one. Those are more story than crack. He wouldn't have been able to put out four stories of it otherwise. It's the faceroll variety, so it's understandable if people don't like it.

**** Debunking of cliches does pop up, I noticed. Early on, Harry's always trying out some sort of fanon cliche and having it fail or be something that isn't real.

The story isn't the best ever, but it's well written with no horribad grammar or that stilted, dry prose that you get from people that are trying too hard.

It's a good, entertaining read in my humble opinion.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Growing up as a Kneazle is tricky, especially when you realize you might be human, too. Add in posessed professors, sinister snakes, and more detentions than he can count, and Harry's Hogwarts career has certainly been memorable. What will he do when he faces his biggest challenge yet? Being a teenager isn't easy no matter what species you are. Sequel to 'Growing Up Kneazle'
