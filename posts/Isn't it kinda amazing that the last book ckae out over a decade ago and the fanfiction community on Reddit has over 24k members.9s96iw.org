Just reflecting on how strong the Harry Potter fan community still is to this day. I know that Fantastic Beasts is responsible for a lot of that, and that the numbers are still in the Long Decline from the heights of the gap between Goblet and Order, it's just so great to see so many awesome fics still being written and discussed and recommended here in this community and we're not just literary archaeologists unearthing forgotten material from the early 2000s.


** It's especially notable when you compare it to other fandoms, I think. I was in the Glee fandom (I know, I know) and it was pretty large in its heyday - 108k fics on ff.net, second only to Supernatural in the TV category - but became practically nonexistent the moment the show ended. That so many people are reading and writing HP fic /eleven years/ after the last book is really something.

Truly is. I have been a part of quite a few fandoms (Glee as well briefly) but all of those usually end a while after the show ends. In fact, I have observed a cycle with Supernatural and GoT (at least personally if not in the fandom) where the fandom popularity increases when a new season of the show is about to arrive, keeps up as the show goes on, spikes up slightly right after the end of the season and then reduces again until a new trailer arrives.\\
But there is something about HP that I keep coming back every once in a while. I am not even a huge fan of the Fantastic Beasts movies (I like them but Newt is no Harry/Ron/Hermione). But it's like I go deep into a particular fandom and then get a little tired of it so I come back home to Harry Potter.

My mother for example was a fan of those indian stories like Winetuu etc. And while it was kinda entertaining, my go to book was HP. So I fear my children will have their own books, and HP and magic will be our generations “getaway card” like the (the few centuries ago) americas was for the previous one. Or at least for Europeans.

Few fandoms have a scenario like this.

A big contributor on my part for staying with the fandom is that there are so many freaking possibilities to take the universe.

In Germany on Fanfiktion that was a similar think with the Inheritance Cycle. Unsatisfying canon to a point paired up with the ludicrous possibilities of the world and the ‚magic-system‘ itself.

**** Now that I'm more awake, let's see if I can be more eloquent.

First, and foremost, HP has characters, and situations that surround the main character, that many of us relate with on a visceral level. This makes them fun to play with, and fun to read about people playing with. I'm in no way discounting this, or underestimating it.

However, so much of of the HP universe is just slightly off. Perhaps you were bothered by things that happened because the plot dictated they must, and want to play with how things might have changed if things happened differently, or situations where things that happened should have been more explored, and you want to look at ramifications.

There's nothing terribly broken individually, but taken as a whole, there are enough injustices, mistreatment, and poor plotting, that many authors want to mess with it. Is this the primary reason for everyone? Nope, but so far as I can see, it's a significant contributing factor.

***** Not OP, but I think that you seriously underestimate the sheer amount of "canon in my own words" stories which add nothing of value to the existing works, often literally quoting whole pages.

I fully agree with you that "fix it" and "what if" are driving factors, but there are plenty of works that could honestly shed 90% of their length and yet not lose anything original.

***** I don't agree with you at all, but I saw another reply of yours being downvoted and it annoyed me, because this your argument is well stated. So I think anyway.

I think you (general you not you specifically) get your ideas of what the majority (or at least what could constitute as "many") of the fandom thinks from what area you hang around in. I've mostly been in somewhat canon compliant territory since 2000, so obviously I know that there is a ton of people who prefer that. Definitely feels like the majority to me!

Would be interesting to do some sort of... count. A study of the motivations behind fandom participation, heh. :D

****** Perfectly fair. And thank you for a well reasoned response.

I agree, my opinion is largely molded by authors I whose works I read, and who I converse with. Many of whom are not the greatest fans of JKR, despite loving Harry Potter.

However it also comes from reading in other fandoms. I've noticed a trend, where in more tightly written published fiction or movies, where there's less room to argue and nit pick how certain plot points should have gone, there's less fiction, even among popular fandoms. But with expansive works like Harry Potter, there's more room for discussion on how certain things should have gone. I've personally noticed a similar trend in the Naruto, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Stargate SG-1 communities as well. In HP, BtvS and Naruto especially, I've seen this expressed as fixing what was done wrong, though in a more general sense these boil down to a "What if" scenario.

That said, there's somewhere around a 3/4 of a million stories for HP alone on just FFN, so that may, as you said, just be what I see from my point of view.

Edit: Finished a thought I apparently had forgotten half way through.

**** First, personal anecdotes in no way negate generalizations such as "many".

Second, I agree, many people love canon. However if they love the thing, and think it is good as it is, are they more or less likely to write than if they love the thing, but feel they can fix that specific thing there?

Third, I overstated my case due to being tired. See my full response to [[/u/LordDerrien][u/LordDerrien]], if you wish, but here's my conclusion:

****** Things in canon compliant stories that I don't like:

- epilogue compliant. I don't care about Albus Severus, James or motherfucking Rose. I really can not identify with a Harry Potter who would name one of his sons Albus Severus, both of which names he should feel very ambiguous towards after the events of DH. It's a big deal for me. Also I strongly disagree with the notion of "All was well." just because Voldemort is dead.

- Big Happy Weasley Family. I want less Weasleys, not more. Most of the Weasleys are either boring or annoying to me.

- canon compliant stories during Hogwarts usually revolve around unimportant side characters and what they did. They are unimportant side characters for a reason. I'd rather read an original novel that follows the actual protagonists.

- canon-compliant pre-Hogwarts or Marauders era could be ok I guess. But I'm not super into prequels and it's just a bunch of named OCs anyway.

- pairings: Sure. Canon pairings are awful across the board.

- HBP and DH (DH more so) were bad books. They make a terrible foundation for anything post-Hogwarts.

****** My problem with canon compliant fics is that I generally find them really boring. I've read the books multiple times, I've read dozens (at least) of fanfics that stick close to canon. I already know the story. Reading what amounts to the same story over and over again is boring. So when I see a fic that says 'canon compliant', that usually tells me I'm gonna be seeing a hell of a lot of the exact same story points, which I do not want. For me, the further it leans away from canon (up to a point), the more original and thus interesting the fic is.

** I only recently came to the fandom, after reading HPMoR and discovering that fanfiction was an actually good thing. I never cared that much for the original HP books - well written, interesting enough, but the magic was poorly developed and I didn't find them anything particularly special.

Now, two years later, I'm reading more fanfiction than regular fiction, writing my own, and regularly engaging on this site. About nintey percent of why I'm excited for Grindelwald's movie is 'more reference events to write fanfic about'.

** I believe it has to do with the way JK wrote the series, in that she created a full world, but we only see it through such a narrow lens of a single person that we naturally have to fill in the blanks, aka headcannons and fanfictions. Not only that, but the characters and setting are just the perfect toolkit for creating a story of your own.

** I'm surprised that fandom is going on strong. What makes HP different in fanfic is all the sub genres and the tropes and the wide range of almost blank slate characters. The setting isn't limited even though the books pretty much were, and stories held outside of Hogwarts can still have that magic feel. Another thing is that since the Wizarding World is essentially hidden from the Muggle World, a lot of stories are regular stories slightly adapted to magic.

I think the popularity of fanfic definitely increases with movies. It also interesting to see which ships are the most popular over time. Some of my OTPs are waning in popularity while others have new talented writers.
