#+begin_quote
  Lonely and outcast by his classmates, Remus wishes on a moonshadow for a friend who understands him. To his amazement his wish is answered not once, but three times, by his former enemies, the Marauders. SBRL and some JPLE as well, of course.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10754389/1/The-Marauders-Year-One][The Marauders Year One]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11476656/1/The-Marauders-Year-Two][The Marauders Year Two]] (WIP), while only having the Marauders' pranks as a minor detail, like Fred & George's antics in Canon, are some of the best pranks I've come across in any fanfic so far.
