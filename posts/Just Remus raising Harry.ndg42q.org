Im looking for a fic where maybe at the end of PoA when Harry can't live with Sirius he asks Remus if he can live with him. So maybe It's just Harry and Remus then Sirius joins them a year later.

Or maybe Remus somehow gets Harry pre-Hogwarts then he can rekindle with Sirius later. I know there's “the art of getting by” but Harry is like 3/4 and I'm looking for him to be older like 8 plus.

But specifically looking for Harry and Remus to have a relationship before Sirius joins them.


** There's a bit of self promotion but it is Remus raising hairy it's crack but yeah Remus is the Prime Minister of the UK and well he has serious chained up in the basement it's a little it's hard to describe but people like it I hope.

​

The national consensus is an Angry panda is the most effective way to describe the Prime Minister
