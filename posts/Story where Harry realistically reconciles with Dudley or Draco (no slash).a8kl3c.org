I always thought it was a bit of a pity that it was never shown whether Harry and Dudley reconciled. Despite having been raised like he was and not having had any real positive experiences with magic, Dudley managed to show that he cared and worried for Harry in a really clumsy way the last time he appeared in the books. If you consider the way his parents treated Harry, and think about how little Petunia cared about her only living relative, despite the fact that Lily obviously loved her sister, I thought it was quite an achievement. What if, after the war, the two boys sought each other out and talked about some things and reached some kind of friendly relationship?

Same goes for Draco Malfoy. I don't know if anybody cared but in the scene with the fiendfyre it was clear that he had lost his standing with Crabbe and Goyle after his father lost the favour of Voldemort. The story has never been told from his perspective and from what we could see through the trio's eyes he was pompous, pampered, then cowardly and the opposite of wise in the face of danger. It was never shown that he truly cared for anybody and I believe it is canon that he had never actually been friends with anybody. But in that moment, when his "followers" basically told him that they didn't care for him at all and he nearly died in the room of requirement, I believe he was holding onto Goyle when faced with lethal danger and the first thing he did after being rescued was inquire after Crabbe, who had put Draco and himself in that danger in the first place. It was clear from the epilogue that Ron still held a grudge against Draco, but it was also told (I think in The Cursed Child, which is kind of canon) that he grew up to be a loving husband and father. Since Narcissa basically saved Harry and the war and Draco was shown to be able to genuinly be caring and good, I would love to see a story where he and Harry reconcile, perhaps over their children, and also reach a kind of mutual respect.

Having said that I don't care for stories where they sleep with each other so... is there anything like that out there?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4172226/1/A-Hero][A Hero]] does a decent job of it, a one shot in which Dudley comes to realize his parents are abusers. No slash- hell no ships at all but I suppose Molly/Arthur. Edit: Hm, does that have a name? Marther? Arolly?

*** Any canon pairings are alright with me, thanks for the recommendation. I think it will take a long time, if it ever happens, for Dudley to judge his parents for how they treated Harry, was thinking more along the lines of the two of them sporadically contacting each other despite his parents, but if it works, why not?

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13376133/chapters/30633729][Waste of Space]] by bluehat is a lovely read, especially since it's from Dudley's POV and his OC wife is a wonderful character in her own right.

I've always loved stories that emphasized the growth Dudley had to willfully strive for to overcome the horrible person he was in his youth. Bonus points, because it contains Dudley Dursley at a wizard wedding, and it is as awkward, lightly terrifying, and heartwarming for the poor guy as you might think.

There's also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13603437][Secrets of Other Cupboards at Number Four]] by RoseFrederick.

It's not a perfect reconciliation, but it's an interesting thought that Petunia didn't just rob Harry of memories of his mother, but that she also robbed her son of memories of his extended family - possibly the only other part he has, save for his Aunt Marge. Having the boys bond over old photos of Lily is an interesting idea for sure.
