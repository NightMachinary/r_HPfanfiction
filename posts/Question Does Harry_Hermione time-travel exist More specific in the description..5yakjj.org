Is there any fanfic where Harry and Hermione travel back to the Mauaraders era when they try to go and save Sirius in 3rd year? They can either find a way back or get stuck there. Most time travel fics I've seen always include "some ancient family spell" and aren't as interesting, and they always end up as 7th years back in time which you think anyone would be suspicious of. Just a thought though.


** Yes, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9757451/1/Three-Turns][Three Turns]], linkffn(9757451): They went back 20 years instead of 3 hours, and got pretty much stuck back there.

  "What we need," Dumbledore said slowly, "is more time." He looked at his watch, "three turns should do it, Miss Granger. Good luck." Only Lady Luck wasn't on time. Time went back, but not to when it should have. "Well, we came from the future, but apparently it wasn't two hours ago as we first thought and if that really is Remus Lupin, I'd wager we went back twenty years..." AU

That story is really terrible though. Time travel stories are probably inherently broken, but that one doesn't even try to make sense of its mechanics...

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.
