Like the title says, I'm looking for a fic where Harry maybe moves in with Sirius as planned, I'm a sucker for those. But I want to read one where instead of immediately being best buds they have problems and their relationship as godfather/godson develops better than just "hey I don't know you but I trust you because you knew my dad and you couldn't possibly be mentally unstable, also I have no problems whatsoever"


** To be fair to canon, Harry's life was totally shit. Sirius was the first adult to do something kind for Harry just because. Both by sending the firebolt and by signing the Hogsmeade permission form. Other adults who did kind things for him (and this was a short list indeed), usually did it while performing a duty of some sort, either for Hogwarts (Hagrid) or for their own children (Mrs Weasley).

It makes total sense that Harry, who had dreamt of flying motorcycles and someone sweeping in and saving him from the Dursleys, would latch on immediately.

They do have trouble communicating. In fact, it can be argued that a miscommunication basically causes Sirius' death in the end.

** I know one like that!!! :) It was about Umbridge raising Harry, and then Sirius comes into his life and he has clear issues and Harry actually doesn't like him sometimes! Also there was another one about Lupin going back in time and I think Harry and Sirius had problems too. :( Sirius was super moody and a bad godfather.

*** I'm guessing the first one was linkffn(The Daring Win)? Haven't read it myself, but it's the only Harry raised by Umbridge I know.

The second one sounds like linkffn(The Bureaucratic Error by Iniga), which I would also recommend. Harry and Sirius don't have a ton of issues with each other, but Sirius has PTSD from Azkaban and struggles to fit himself back into daily life and be a good godfather.
