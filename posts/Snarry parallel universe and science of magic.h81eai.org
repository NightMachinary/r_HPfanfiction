Hello there!

I am looking for a fan fiction that has been in the recesses of my mind for at least 8 years. I use this story as an example of some great writing, and I remember at the time it was well recommended. I don't think it was on the usual sites like fanfiction.net but I could be wrong.

From what I remember either Harry or Snape (I think Harry?) wakes up in a parallel universe in a house that they share together as long term partners. The story is about both the development of their relationship (and having to convince the other to coexist with them in some capacity) as well as the science behind magic. I want to say one of them is sick as well, but it could be that one actually replaced another version of themselves who was terminally ill.

I hope this isn't too obscure! Thanks in advance.
