I am searching for good snape centric fics They should be long and completed or updated regularly. I do not have squicks. I personally love deaging and growing up again fics. As well as those that deal with physical and or emotional trauma. It can be gen or het or slash.


** Soul Play by Snapesforte follows Snape immediately post-HBP, it really does give a canon portrayal of him which is quite rare. It was unfortunately taken down but you can find a copy [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/attachment.php?attachmentid=1243&d=1430419111][here.]]

** "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13131947/1/Boy-Snape][Boy-Snape]]" linkffn(13131947) features de-aging of Severus, though, he doesn't have to grow up again.

"[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12550041/1/Raising-Snape][Raising Snape]]" linkffn(12550041) and its sequel "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12877029/1/Raising-Snape-Mischief-Managed][Raising Snape: Mischief Managed]]" linkffn(12877029), which is on-going, appear to be fairly popular, though, how good they actually are will have to be for you to find. Corporal punishment is not my thing.

"[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12022253/1/Callidus-Prince-and-the-Unseen-Adversary][Callidus Prince and the Unseen Adversary]]" linkffn(12022253) is the first installment in a series where he's de-aged and has to grow up again.

Edit: put in links because the bot doesn't appear to be working.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

  Not satisfied with "Deathly Hallows?" This alternate version of Book Seven was written at the same time that JKR was writing DH, but has a different take on the story and contains an account of Snape's most unique Halloween celebration.

** Not linking it because I don't remember if they get frisky while being underage. BUT. Pride of Time by Anubis Ankh is SS/HG. It has time turners, deaging, and 2 different endings so you can pick how you want the story to go. I personally love this fic!

  Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters. AU Sequel posted: The Moment It Ended.

** Sounds like this one. Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12386916]]) I dont really keep up with it anymore cuz im not into the hints of Snape/Lily that they showed but its regularly updated and it does have time travel/deaging theme. Its also fairly popular so u might have already read it lol.

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody---' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.
