Hi! I need help finding a fanfic I read once that I want to read again! It was set before the events of the book but Harry was the master of death anyway. Time travel may have been involved I'm not sure but there was also a Lord of Magic. Harry arrives at Gingots and basically collects all the horcruxes with the goblins help and kills Voldemort right away. Then there's a whole thing with unlawful magic blocks that have unknowingly been placed on practically everyone and magical family inheritance reemerging. Basically Harry is a descendant and lord of the houses Peverell, Slytherin, Black AND Potter. Neville is descended from Godric Gryffindor, Draco is descended from Ravenclaw and someone else is found for hufflepuff but I can't remember. Please help! I'd like to bookmark it so I wont loose it again!
