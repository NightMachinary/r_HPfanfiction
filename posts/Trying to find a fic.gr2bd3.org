:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I found Chasing the Pride of Portree by Newshound on AO3 after it was archived by The Hex Files. Unfortunately, the fic wasn't completed before being archived. I'm wondering if anybody knows of the finished version or where I may find it? The summary is: “Two years ago, Draco walked away from the man he loved convinced he was doing the right thing for him, but when he is drawn into a case headed up by Auror Harry Potter involving the trade of Dark objects and illegal potions, the truth of what really happened will come out.” It is rated explicit and is Draco Malfoy/Harry Potter. And if this is the wrong place to post this, could someone direct me kindly?
