Hi guys, can you help me by suggesting some good fics where characters go to 1978-1981 to change the past? So no Hogwarts


** linkffn(One Hundred Sixty Nine) is great and I believe complete.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** *A Little Child Shall Lead Them*, linkffn(10871795): instead of physically traveling back, Hermione sends her memories and powers to her 2 year old body, or 42 days before the Halloween event. Hilarity ensued, but also heart-breaking moments.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.
