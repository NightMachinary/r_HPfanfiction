Recommend fics that are probably abandoned, but you wish the author would some day come back to.

On the way to Greatness linkffn(4745329) One of the best Slytherin!Harry fics

Magical Relations linkffn(3446796) Wizard!Dudley, and my favorite portrayal of Dudley in fanfiction

The Hogwarts Six and the Darkest Wizard linkffn(11677935) Great and underrated fic that I haven't seen recommended here often. Main character is an OC "Slytherin!Anti!Hermione", a smart muggleborn witch with a very different personality than Hermione. Prequel fic linkffn(11280068) covering years 1-3 is completed.

An Unfound Door linkffn(7552826) A Ravenclaw!Harry with great worldbuilding by the author of Harry Potter and the Wastelands/Heartlands of time. So far I think this fic is even better than his Wastelands/Heartlands fics, and is possibly not actually abandoned--the author did take 9 years to finish Heartlands of Time.


** I really love Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon which has a wonderfully unique method of time travel, and seeing Harry and Hermione overcome obstacles by just throwing themselves at them over and over until they get it right is so endearing. The fic is clearly labelled on the first page:

  Don't expect this story to ever be complete. It'll keep expanding indefinitely as long as I keep getting ideas

But somehow that just makes me feel worse that it hasn't had an update in over 6 years

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.

** - linkffn(When Harry Missed the Trick Step by Srikanth1808) ... it is one of those Sirius gets liberated and Madam Bones kicks many asses, but it seemed like keeping the story in style (no Lord Gryffindor anywhere),
- Both linkffn(Petunia Snaps by Meester Lee) and “[[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=9931566][Terms of Matrimony]]” by Galad Estel (it was taken down from FFnet, so I found just a copy in [[https://ff2ebook.com][ff2ebook.com]]) claim to be finished, but really I think they are just abandoned stories in disguise. The author setup very nice story, but he didn't have proper plot or will to write it down (and I am in exactly the same situation right now myself, so no looking down on them).
- linkffn(A Sensational Story by Srikanth1808), a sequel to linkao3(A Dramatic Reading by White Squirrel) ... heroes read JKR books type of story, but a way better written and with an authentic plot.
- linkao3(The Wheel Is Come Full Circle by White_Squirrel) which promised to be better written “Hermione recovers the memory of her parents after the war” (and yes, there was a secret weapon how to find them in whole Australia in couple of minutes, no need for linkffn(Australia by MsBinns)-long search for them).
- And of course, a zillion of stories by Northumbrian:

  - linkao3(James and Me by Northumbrian), but read linkao3(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian) first, is probably the most painfully felt abandoned story;
  - linkao3(Friends and Foes by Northumbrian);
  - linkao3(Aurors and Schoolgirls by Northumbrian) ... probably the least painful of these three, but still, what did Wilberforce Wylde do? I was so impatient with this story to be unfinished that I wrote my own sequel linkao3(Aurors and Schoolgirls: Christmas: Distraction by mcepl).

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations][Realizations]] linkffn(1260679) is one of the few fics I read early in my fandom days that still holds up. And while it's incomplete, the plot is more or less wrapped up by the last chapter, so it has a less jarring end than most abandoned fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] linkffn(3557725) is a trio fic that strikes an excellent balance of characterization and plot. I really would've liked to have seen where the storyline would've gone next.

linkao3(589726) - snape meets a time travelling harry in his 6th year, very very good

linkffn(6306296) - the best snape-centric time travel fic in my opinion, he takes his newts 2 years early and works at an apothecary. it's snape/lily but i don't mind the pairing in this one

linkao3(3390668) - one of the best alternate dimension fics

  When he looked back on it in later years, Severus realized how much worse his life could have gone. Those few short months in Sixth Year were of much greater importance than he could have ever known at the time. Then again, it was hard to have perspective on something like that at 16, when his daily existence consisted of constantly dodging hexes and being ignored by Lily Evans. The Professor had known, though. That's why he'd come.

  Last year, a chance encounter brought together Harry Potter and Fleur Delacour, while her father exonerated Sirius Black.

** Sovran's Meaning of One: [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]]

Copypasta from my second to last comment: “It's a Hinny Soul-Bond which (rightfully) is a turn off for some people, but this is I think objectively the best fic, at least that I've read so far. Each character feels like their canon counterparts, it is a gripping, tense, and emotional rewrite of Hogwarts, and has some brilliant twists and turns I don't think I've seen anywhere else. The bond itself, normally a trap for uncomfortable moments and trashy tropes in similar stories, is well thought out and given a clear explanation of it's mechanics early on, and the relationship that builds between Harry and Ginny is handled with tact and maturity, while also acknowledging the weirdness (read: puberty) that comes with the bond they have and at their age. “

It's 600k words but it's only finished up to 2nd Year. I'm writing 3rd Year as a fic of a fic right now because I love it so much.

** Radaslab wrote a super-powered HP do-over which, to me, had a very interesting set-up. Future Harry sent back in time a magical 'hologram' to advise young Harry to avoid the complete destruction of humanity.

The first story Radaslab completed which takes place before Hogwarts, the second story has Harry just starting to attend. Unfortunately it was never finished, but I've always wondered what Radaslab's plan was for for finishing up this tale.

The first (completed) 'book' is linkffn(5178251) and the second (incomplete) 'book' is linkffn(5480014).
