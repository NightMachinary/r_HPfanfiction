The title sounds like I am saying that I've read every fanfic, that's not the case. I can't find a fanfic that I looked at before but did not bookmark or read, so I have nothing to even search it by. I'm beginning to think I imagined it. And I will say that I did search for it before I asked, for at least a couple of hours. I feel like I've seen it but didn't recognize the title.

Anyway, here's what I do remember. I saw it on fanfiction.net(edit: I can't be 100% sure but I think it was hosted here). It has 7 different fanfic entries to represent the 7 years/books. I THINK it features Harry with a brother/twin but googling for that brought me nothing so I may have imagined that. I'm pretty sure it was complete. I don't think its THAT popular, I've searched many top lists and most reviewed and can't find it. Probably in part because its separated into 7 fic entries. I think they were all named 'Harry Potter and xxxxxxx' style, could be wrong though.

I know this is vague but I really can't remember anything else and I want to read it! Thanks!

Edit: Wow, I found it! Brain threw the word 'lightning' at me. Then I googled 'harry potter lightning brother' and finally found it -..- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave]]

Oh god why its draco/harry

I guess I'll still try it..


** That's funny. I'm actually reading that series (Sacrifices Arc) now. As far as I remember, the Author stated in an A/N that the Drarry stuff wouldn't start until Story 4 so you're safe to read stories 1-3 at least. As of chapter 18 of the third story in the series (where I am right now), there has been zero slash, just Harry and Draco friendship (which isn't even the main focus of the story).

*** Its not that I even hate slash. I just haven't given it a shot yet. Also, I hate draco. Maybe he won't be so bad. I'll definitely try it. I think its the longest harry potter fanfic, and its actually complete which is quite a feat.

**** It's a story with very definite strengths and weaknesses. It's been a while since I read it, so the stuff I remember best is the stuff that bothered me about it, such as:

- Harry is a Mary Sue, the further you get the more Sue he is
- General abundance of overpowered Sue characters
- A LOT of internal dialogue about feelings, gets repetitive
- Too much feelings-magic
- Frustrating morality
- Glamorization of purebloods and their "noble ways"
- A lot of canon characters have significantly different personalities
- Plotted before Deathly Hallows was published, so canon stuff revealed in Deathly Hallows never happened

HOWEVER. I am rereading it right now (halfway through second book), so I obviously liked it despite its flaws. A lot of the stuff that bothered me isn't as annoying on a second reread. Some of the positives:

- LONG AND COMPLETE, Merlin be praised
- Good grammar and sentence structure, despite occasional repetitiveness
- Nice, complicated plot (although I didn't examine closely for holes)
- You get very attached to the characters despite their deviations from canon
- You can count on at least one scene with huge emotional impact per book (possibly excluding the first one)
- People die, sometimes people you hate, sometimes people you love
- Justice, for the most part, eventually gets served, and it's incredibly satisfying
- Harry might be OP, but Voldemort is at an appropriately adjusted power level
- Voldemort is more horrific than he ever was in canon
- Complex, flexible magic system (YMMV on whether this is good or bad, I personally liked it)

The Harry/Draco doesn't get much in the way. I don't like canon Draco either, but he starts out with a slightly different personality due to the universe's differences, and continues to diverge more and more from canon. You can safely skip the sex scenes if you ever get that far, but I read them and I didn't drop dead of horror or anything.

Overall, I think it is worth it for you to read at least the first two, then quit if you don't like either of them at all. "Saving Connor", the first one, is widely regarded as the worst of the seven parts, but you have to read it for context for the rest of them, and it's not actually that bad. "No Mouth But Some Serpent's", the second one, is still not the strongest but it is /much/ better, I don't want to spoil too much but there's a one liner in it that still makes me tear up when I remember it.

I'm not sure it's exactly glamorization, but the books do spend a lot of time on pureblood traditions. That said, it was pretty obvious that the author ignored them unless it was convenient. For instance, clothing color choices and their interpretations came up about four times in the two million word story -- less than I would expect; Harry doesn't bother thinking about what image his clothes project when seeking allies, which is a glaring mistake. And there are a lot of complexities that would take bloody ages to learn; the more intricate of them that are uncommon would naturally be elided.

There's long, and then there's drudgery. Make it through book six and then realize you're barely two thirds of the way through the series, /then/ tell me it's a good thing.

One part made me cringe, actually. Anal sex without lube and without building up to it. These things take time and practice. And lube. Never forget the lube. Unless you want a world of pain.

Pain during sex is not good. Yet story after story claims it's normal for the first time.

****** It wasn't how many words got used on pureblood stuff; it was the attitude all the characters had toward it, and the words that were used to describe it. Basically, the subtext gave me vague supremacist vibes. It also felt sometimes like the author was just making up more pureblood stuff as the story went on as an easy-way-out plot device. It definitely added complexity to the world but if half of it were cut out I wouldn't miss it.

Yeah, it's definitely long. It could have used another edit or three. But as far as I'm concerned, if I'm still interested it could be a billion words and not too long.

If you want to, it's pretty easy to rationalize the no lube/pain (they're kids, didn't know what they were doing the first few times, etc).

I mentally retcon stuff that bothers me in fanfic. I'd be interested to know if anyone else does this, it seems like other people probably would. Without the ability to do minor mental gymnastics I don't think I'd be able to enjoy very much fanfic, and it's relatively easy to do this for most of the problems I have with "Sacrifices".

*** Sacrifices Arc is one of those stories that got me into fanfiction. Yes, it's far from my favorite story of all time, and I haven't even finished the story (stopped halfway into 6), but you can't deny that its quality and appeal.

**** s'tarkans team 8 and HP stories fucking ruined me. I'm always looking for 1 million+ word stories regardless of the quality just so they don't end on me. I won't even pick up anything below 300k words honestly even though I know I'm missing out on some good stuff.
