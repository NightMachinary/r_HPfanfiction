** How about advice on how to make fics more engaging and entertaining? I've come across some fics that would've been great stories if they weren't so dry. As in some writers seem afraid to use dialogue or vernacular... You also could address character and relationship depth. Some authors spend too much time going into minute details about a character/relationship whereas others just rush things through.

I always thought "how to get hopping when a plot bunny hits you" would be a good topic of discussion.

Congrats on the panel, and let us know how it goes :3 !

*** I agree with this, I personally have an awful habit of going into detail / focusing on relationships and forgetting about the badguys. Hell the first 25 chapters or so of SFTP were summer hols at Grimmauld...

But then.. my stories are all character / relationship / smut. One thing people do not complain about is me having empty characters. Every girl (except Cho and the Patils) are not easy to swap out with any other in that story.

I'll make sure I have a section on how important it is for you to know every character, including ones that only appear once "on screen" and including the bad guys. Character Depth is what makes them engaging!

I like the "how to get hopping" bit, that is an awesome bit of wordplay!

** There is actually one extremely well done panel that I go to every year at Anime Detour in Minneapolis. They focus one the “Do's and Don'ts of Fanfiction” and focus on several things

- The importance of a summary: either using a vague snippet or quick overview of your fic without giving away any plot twists. They emphasize the importance of NOT putting “I suck at summaries, just read” bs. If you can't write a summary, people are going to assume you can't write a creative story either.

- Giving the nod to the original creative team. They emphasize that it is just good manners (and a cover your own ass practice) to not simply write “this show and its characters are not mine”. Give a nod to the show's creative team (Hayao Miyazaki, et. al) in the “disclaimer” so if push comes to shove credit is given where credit is due.

- Avoid the Mary Sue unless you are very, VERY good at making them

- The importance of giving you OC a flaw and not making them perfect (that's why people hate them --following Mary Sue)

- The importance of criticism -- taking criticism. Never lash out at your readers. Take the high road. No one wants to read a writer who is going to bash you on their fic. In addition, don't ask for constructive criticism unless you can take the harsh and the constructive stuff. Know that a negative comment does not define your fic, but can help you get better.

- Do not hold your story ransom. No one likes a writer who threatens to take down/end their story unless they get a certain amount of reviews. Most people are lurkers now. Make then want to give you great reviews.

- Get a beta. Most people can't effectively edit their own work. Some can. If you aren't comfortable getting a beta, make yourself wait a few days after writing a chapter or fic so you can come back with fresh eyes and see your own mistakes. Reading them out loud also can help with this.

- Get a soundboard. If you can, have someone to talk over ideas with, they will usually stop you from making unpopular character choices or give you a look at what the initial reaction will be (readies you for hate mail if you intend to do something unpopular intentionally).

- Most importantly: GRAMMAR!!!! Can't emphasize this enough.

- Always have a notebook with you. You never know when an idea for a fanfic or a break of your writer's block might happen. Have one in your bag, keep one by your bed. Do whatever you can to catch those little ideas, because they one's you will "write down later" are the ones you lose.

- Create a music box. Find a set of songs that remind you of your story. Maybe a song for each character you are writing. One for different stories. Whatever you decide. Use these songs to play while you write certain tics because when you become stuck these songs can help you concentrate, get yourself back on track, or even find ideas you lost. That and when you hear them, you feel a need to write again. For instance, I use This is War by 30 Seconds to Mars for one of my fics and each time I hear it, I get a new idea or the desire to work on it again.

- Figure out how to do description effectively. No one really wants to read a three paragraph description of a landscape, no one really cares how the character laces their shoes, and no one needs to know about the mole above the character's eye if we are never going to hear about them again. If it is a major character, more and more of them will be described over time, so don't feel the need to detail purge about them the first time we meet them. Find the balance of necessary detail. Many of the experienced writers that come to the panel I attend usually say you should be able to describe something in two sentences (I usually give it three if it is important). It won't bog down the reader.

They also encouraged those that had been writing longer to give some advice they had learned along the way to those that were newer. They also discouraged plugging of fanfics so that it remained constructive for everyone (unless the individual had a point to make about a certain group of readers).

These are just a few, sorry for the excessive rant :) . If you want any more ideas, I can try and remember more of what the panel discussed.

*** Don't apologize! This is great!

I haven't attended any panel discussion on FanFic myself but I have been actively involved in Yahoo Groups for years and most of this is a collection of what is repeated over and over when people ask for advice.

It is all constructive and very helpful.. I will probably get myself a music box :)

The description section is especially good, When I first began writing I was heavily influenced in style by Terry Goodkind and Robert Jordon.... both authors who write epic length novels in multiple parts with WAY too much description.

*** Yes,

But that is dangerously close to a Trope... and in a one hour panel if we get lost in TV Tropes we will never get anything done :)

I will talk with my beta about adding this as I think it IS a good discussion. But we must be very careful about which debates we spark.

** Avoiding Self Insertions might be an interesting topic.

Which is what /all/ harem fics are no matter the name of the protagonist.

*** I can agree with this topic, thank you. However while I agree there is a "degree" of self insert in all harem fic, there are authors who can keep from making the protagonist completely OOC.

The problem with any Harem Fic is that you have to contrive the situation. Threesome fic is easier to do with the right girls without making it all about creating and maintaining the harem. Once you add a third girl or more well... We don't read harem fic for the plot as much as the PLOT.

#+end_quote

Not to put too fine a point on it, but that doesn't ever happen. It has less to do with the characters and their OOC-ness and more with the subgenre being escapist fantasy for aging virgins who assume promiscuity as the apotheosis of masculinity. I prefer fics with stable believable relationships, not those with /a stable/ of women. But to each their own.

***** And not to argue to heavily with you, but basically every one of my stories is harem and promiscuous, and I am far far from being a virgin. I take great pains to ensure that every character has a real backstory and motivations, and that you cannot simply switch the names during any scene to imagine a different girl.

And I'm sorry... I've gone and made this personal. I'll stop now, obviously this IS a good topic for a panel but I will need to remove my own bias on the issue.

It IS escapist fantasy though. But that is true of any fiction worth reading.
