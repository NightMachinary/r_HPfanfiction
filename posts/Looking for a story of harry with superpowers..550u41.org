I'm looking for a fic where harry has a super power like incredible strength, high speed regeneration, super speed, power over metal ala magneto etc... I would prefer if it stays in the hp universe i don't mind merging universes but still in his universe i'll read out of universe ones if there really good. For the most part though i would prefer though not required for him to be the only one with a superpower like he's telekinetic but he's the only one, or him and a small group of people preferably friends but it has to be for the most part harry-centric.

*** Surprisingly, no. In the HP verse wizards are extremely limited in the things they can and cannot do (unless they have the Elder Wand). For example, Transfiguration can only last a certain amount of time, Conjuration (basically transfiguration, but I always thought there should be a distinction between the two) is the same. And you also have to have a clear idea of what you want to happen, and the wand movements for a spell to work, also wands....pretty pointless to have a piece of wood that is easily broken to rely on in battle.

** Harry Potter + Super powers?

You'll want to check out crossovers between HP and some super hero comic. You'll probably find plenty of stories where Harry gets extra powers. Or his wizard stuff gets buffed to the point where it's more of a super power than it was originally. Not that HP magic isn't already pretty OP.

If you want a Harry that is basically a second Superman and is also still a wizard there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5920203/1/Harry-Potter-Returns][Harry Potter Returns]] by JBean210.

It's a HP/Superman crossover. Harry's world and Clark Kent's world are the same planet/universe. Harry gets most of Clark's super powers in the first chapter. Harry is the primary protagonist. It's also non-slash if that concerns you.

It's a pretty old story, and I haven't read it recently, so I can't tell you if it's "good" or not. You're best off reading it and making your own judgement.

*** Does he ever even get powers in this? I mean, sure he gets taught things, but does he ever get his own, super special asgardian power?

****** No. Various times. He powers up in life threatening situations to omega levels but the rest of the time he's mostly alpha level, accidentally crushing goblets and so on.

** Would you be interested in a harry x naruto crossover? Harry is trained in the art of ninjutus and has a very strong / fast body. It's of my own writing.
