I'm not that bothered about pairings or anything but I feel like Draco and Hermione could have a friendship thanks to their love of learning and put their differences aside - could be really sweet.

I don't ship Dramione but I ship them in a friendship kind of way? I'm not sure

Anyone know a fic like this?


** Can I second this.

Specifically I'm thinking of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] and its sequel which keeps touching on this topic but never really strays from the main plot of tea parties and how splendid everyone was that day long enough to do it justice and ultimately teasing the idea of an interesting Dramione outcome in the epilogue but not delivering.

Basically Hermione/Draco friendship or romance that *isn't* following a trope like Draco in leather pants, caring for a sick person or they are trapped in a room/task and must learn to work together despite hating each other. Basically neither one of them is suddenly treating the other as their soulmate, but rather slow tolerance leading to friendship leading to possibly something more.

*** yeah I mean when I was younger I shipped them but I can't see than as anything more than friends- maybe thanks to the copious amounts of drarry fics I've read, but I love the idea of them growing to respect eachother and connect in some way
