So a few months back I mentioned here my idea of a fanfic following a new group of students in Ilvermorny with the main character being a guy trying to finish the spell his dad left him in a journal while dealing with outside forces threatening the school.

​

My second idea was to take the mc of that story and just put him in Hogwarts with Harry since that seems to be more popular to readers.

No matter the choice the mc is gonna stay relatively the same.

- Son of a female Auror and a male magical researcher
- extremely gifted in charms and healing magic
- Sarcastic and mischievous though loyal to a fault
- raised by his grandmother
- has a little sister
- Is bad at combat though great at defending and getting out of combat.


** I like the first idea better. Heck, if it turns out really well, you might even be able to file off the serial numbers and make some money off it a la /40 Shades/.

The second one has a lot of fandom-specific pitfalls. For example, your character is extremely gifted in Charms. More or less than Hermione? That could affect the classroom dynamic and easily slide into Stu/Sue/bashing territory. Or, this loyalty to a fault of his: that means that he won't be able to sit out the Voldemort conflict. What would be his role?

*** Ok so he's good at charms but sucks at the classroom aspect of it. Like he's good at using charms but his grades in charms are average. So Hermione is better than him in grades and maybe he's slightly better than her in using them but it's a toss-up where he might preform the spell first one class and she the next.

As for the Voldemort conflict he'll take part in the ministry battle in OOTP and rhe Howarts battle in HBP but in DH he doesn't go with Harry and instead goes to Hogwarts and helps Neville.

** There's nothing stopping you from just doing both.

Hogwarts verse is a natural way to get comfortable with writing his character, his essence. Especially if it's a canon timeline so you already have an easy set of steps to use as the backdrop. It's “more popular” so protag might gain some supporters.

And then throw him into his Ilvermorny verse. The new students. The new threats. And since you already wrote him an AU, it might make the swap more comfortable and give you a greater understanding of how his voice sounds.

** 2nd idea seems boring, the character and his merry loyal friends just go along doing day to day things. 1st idea seems much better, preferably in Hogwarts, unless your world building is good.

Also with sarcasm and ‘loyal' friends a lot of fics tend to make Mc and his/her friends extremely logical whereas everyone else is just making bad decisions for the plot and ooc.

1st idea is much better.

*** Well the 2nd idea he would become a part of Harry's friends and basically it'll show other perspectives like Hermione and him running to get help in PS, what's going on at Hogwarts in DH, etc. As for the sarcasm I don't mean he's gonna be extremely logical or anything like that I just mean he's gonna be sarcastic at times which can sometimes get him in trouble(like aggravating Umbridge by listing all the things that would want to harn students like them). As for the loyalty it's more of like in GF and PoA he'll be trying to play peacekeeper the whole time but it ends up draining him mentally. Like he's loyal but also to the point he pulls himself in too many directions to where it becomes a flaw.
