It's a Dramione one-shot. Criticism -- or any kind of feedback, really -- is most welcome! Linkffn(12935992)

#+begin_quote
  Bonded by the Marriage Law, Draco and Hermione spend their days trying to kill one another. But when one of them gets a chance to fulfill that wish, what will they do? Post-Hogwarts, Dramione, a oneshot.

** That was really enjoyable and oddly fluffy. Most of the criticism I have are nitpicks, like how Draco says the 'oxygen' in his room was replaced with a toxic substance, but I think it's a bit too specific. Only Hermione knows that it was the oxygen in the room that was being replaced since she was the one who switched it, but Draco would plausibly only know that the 'air' in his room was being replaced. Does that make sense? Anyway, it's a really tiny thing, and it didn't really take away from the story.

Another issue I had which is somewhat more general is the timing of the plot. I was a bit confused towards the end when Draco says that the 'small prick' comment had been bothering him for the past year or so. I was under the impression only about a week or so had passed since Hermione made that comment.

Otherwise though, I really liked it. It has a nice pacing; it didn't feel too rushed or too slow, and moved from scene to scene with fluidity. Your writing style was whimsical and fit the story's tone nicely. Overall, great one-shot :)

*** I'm gonna fiddle around with the wording, see what works. The oxygen thing would be easy to replace; the comment about the prick is supposed to convey that it's been bothering him more than any /assassination attempts/ that had happened over the past year (so you're right about the one week), but I can see now how that's coming off clunky. Thanks for bringing it to my attention! And I'm very glad you liked it :)

**** One thing I am curious about: how did you decide that it's Draco who gets to spare Hermione rather than the other way around?

***** Honestly, it was a very easy decision to make. In Draco and Hermione's relationship, he's the one that needs to be redeemed, not her. Draco saving Hermione makes a statement that he's changed and grown beyond the spoiled, bigoted boy from Hogwarts; while if she were the one to aid him, then that aspect of his character would still be left ambiguous.
