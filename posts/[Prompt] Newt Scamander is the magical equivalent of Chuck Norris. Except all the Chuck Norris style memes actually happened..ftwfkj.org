I was reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/616045][Code: BLUE COAT]] recently, and that has shades of this. Newt takes down so many criminals and the like that the aurors around the world have a code for him. He doesn't /try/ to take down criminals, they're just in the way of whatever creature he's trying to save.

*** Oh yeah, works nicely with Hagrid as well. I'm just on a bit of a Fantastic Beasts fic kick, and wanted to use Newt.

Hagrid also works for a lot of the same reasons: he's kind, gentle, caring, and would totally rip you in half if you don't put the Kneazle down /right now/.

I like to think that if he didn't get expelled, Hagrid would have ended up as the second coming of Newt, possibly apprenticing under Newt after Hogwarts.

***** Subjective Opinion Incoming.

The first film is pretty good, it's great fun seeing the different creatures, following around some wizards who aren't schoolchildren, and Newt's character is very enjoyable.

The second, while having some really fun moments (mostly with Grindelwald, as played by Johnny Depp), falls short in my opinion.

I recommend finding a best of compilation (here's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdvxUPCTBiI][one]] to get you started) , because I really think that Eddie Redmayne, who plays Newt, is absolutely brilliant in the role. Newt himself has this passionate, awkward, dorky thing going for him that I personally find really endearing.

Also, Newt is just plain awesome. They gloss over it, but the guy has a /Nundu/ in his suitcase. He just walks up to it and pets it like it's nothing. And he's a /Hufflepuff!/ Fun to see someone from that House get some recognition.

****** As a counter point. Depp as Grindelwald was the only part of crimes I liked. The way he used magic like a conductor in a symphony. He knew he was good at it and shows off. It might have been where Dumbledore got his eccentric flair from. To keep the best part of his oldest friend alive after he had fallen from grace.

Honestly, the films have lot of issues. It should have been 3 with Newt just doing his own thing and 2 or 3 with Dumbledore, the end being their final battle.

Edit: I've just read your comment again and realised thats the only bit you liked too. Sorry!

But yeah, El Dorado would be a great one too. But he's Chuck Norris of the magicals, so it's not like he can't do both.
