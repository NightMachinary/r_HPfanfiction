I'm trying to expand my fanfiction horizons, but I don't know where to start. It can be any pairing or none at all, the only things I want are enough detail to see the story in my head and a high level of writing skill that won't make me want to stab my eyes out with a red correction pen.

Preferably, the stories will be betaed or appear to have been betaed.

Any help will be much appreciated!!!!

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

** This is an intense, interesting story, but just know it does end with a child's death: "Blood for Blood" linkffn(12045810).

"Facade" linkffn(11815322) is a cool fic that you may or may not enjoy depending on how much you like Ron. This fic doesn't portray him in the most flattering light.

So, this one is more than 10k, but it's basically a collection of one-shots that fall under a single unifying theme. "The Stories of Unsung Heroes" linkffn(11650679)

"The One" linkffn(11716978) is a fairly short one-shot, but a really lovely take on a young Molly struggling with the decision of marriage.

"An Honest Mistake" linkffn(11616414) is a fun one-shot about an underwritten character and an incident from his time teaching at Hogwarts.

  During his tenure as professor, Silvanus Kettleburn racked up an impressive 62 probations without being fired and only having sacrificed a leg and a half and one arm. Seems like a small price to pay. It wasn't that he was a bad teacher. He just wanted to provide his students the opportunity to learn about magical creatures. Anything that followed was simply an honest mistake.
