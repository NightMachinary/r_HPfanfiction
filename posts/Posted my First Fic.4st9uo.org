So I finally got up the nerve to post my first fic, and I'd really like some constructive criticism, if anyone has the time. Thanks in advance.

** It's a really good start, especially for a first fic. There's a nice balance of dialogue and description, and though I admit I've only skimmed it during my tea break, I didn't spot any glaring problems with grammar or spelling.

A few constructive criticisms... Snape's dialogue seems quite out of character. You have him saying dammit a few times. I don't recall him ever saying that in the books, and it feels quite American. I think you should also remember that it's perfectly ok to sayou "he said". At one point you say "he quipped", despite the fact that he did absolutely nothing that could be interpreted as a quip. My advice is to read through Snape scenes again and maybe copy out the dialogue so you get a good feel for how he speaks naturally.

*** Yeah, I have to agree, I have a hard time writing in Snape's "voice". Which is unfortunate, since he's the character I'd like to write the most lol! I'll absolutely try what you suggested about reading through Snape's dialog in the book. I've actually just started another re-read where I'm taking notes on spells and stuff, so it will be easy to mark out his dialog as I'm reading lol.

Thank you!

**** No problem! It's tough to get certain voices right. I'm currently doing the same exercise for Remus Lupin :)

** I have to agree with [[/u/FloreatCastellum]], this is a very good first fic, which was helped by the decision to keep it short and narrow in scope. The big problem is the Snape dialogue you wrote that wasn't present in canon (though "Save Draco Malfoy from his own stupidity" felt very Snape) did not have the Snape character voice. Also, it's 'dammit' not 'damnit.' The snippets of Snape fighting I rather enjoyed, and reminded me of the scene in 'The Prince's Tale' where Snape accidentally removed George's ear.

All in all, a very good first fic. I look forward to your future works.

*** Hrm, note to self, write Snape's dialog when I'm tired and grumpy and had a long day? Because literally, that line I thought of while working my third 14hour day in a row, and I was playing through the fic in my head, and it came to me more as a to-do list, then I realized that it sounded like something Snape would actually say lol. Anyways, thank you for the read and comments, I completely agree that I have a hard time with Snape's dialog. :-)

  Severus Snape died much like he lived. Distrusted, misunderstood, he lied as easily as he breathed, and fought for redemption to his final breath. At least he wasn't cursed to die alone.

** It's indeed a very good fic as your first fic. I don't have any criticism to tell you only that I liked it very much (but that isn't really criticism is it).
