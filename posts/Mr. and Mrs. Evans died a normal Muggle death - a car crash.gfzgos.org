The last people executed in the UK were Peter Anthony Allen and Gwynne Owen Evans on 13th August 1964, for the murder of John Alan West. The death penalty was outlawed permanently in the UK in December 1969 (barring Northern Ireland, which outlawed it in 1973), permanently adopting a temporary ban passed in 1965. Lily and James died in 1981, 16 years after the abolition of the death penalty.

Even if the death penalty had still been legal in Britain at the time, the double execution of a husband and wife from Surrey would have been /massive/ news, and Petunia's lie would have fallen apart under the most basic of scrutiny, plus she would not have made up a story that would cast a negative light on herself as a criminal's sister. A car crash is actually a very good cover story, it's mundane enough to be accepted without question and tragic enough that clamming up on details would probably be accepted, plus given that it's the 80s people would assume James would have been driving, and thus Petunia wouldn't get any scrap from being associated with Lily, even if she claimed they were drunk, reckless or whatever.

As for your comments on Mr and Mrs Evens, idk, a car crash seems perfectly plausible, though the leading causes of death in the 70's for people over the age of 30 was a heart attack, which I doubt Lily could heal on her own, and St Mungo's probably wouldn't admit Muggles who don't have magically caused injuries.

** Petunia could have it both ways. She could copy her own history, making it easier to give the story the necessary emotional gravitas, and she could say that Lily and James's accident occured because they were running from the cops, or drunk, or something else unsavory.

** While I think this is mostly coincidence, a lot of Snape-centric fics I read that takes place during Marauder-era where the friendship with Lily remains (which may or may not have developed into outright romance) have a habit of killing off one or both of the Evans parents some time after Severus starts 7th year by means of -- you guessed it -- a car crash. It's so common that it's basically part of my headcanon at this point (taking into account the very reason you bring up -- Petunia choosing that means of death to explain to Harry how his parents died).

I wonder if Jily fics do the same thing? I don't really read that ship, so I wouldn't know.
