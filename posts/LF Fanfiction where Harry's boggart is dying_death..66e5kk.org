I remember reading a fanfic where Harry's boggart was death. It also had a part where Dumbledore was disturbed by the similarities between Harry and Voldemort's fear of death.

I can't remember the name of it, so any help is greatly appreciated.

*** Specifically relevant would be chapters 43-46.

** So what would it turn into? If Death doesn't have a physical form, could Harry be used as a Boggart killer? Or, if it does have a form, it makes the Tale of the Three Brothers seem far more likely. IDK which I'd rather see, tbh. As long as its not a dementor.

** Was it a bleach crossover? I read something with that a while ago. Could dig it up for you if you want.
