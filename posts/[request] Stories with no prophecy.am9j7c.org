I'm looking for Hogwarts era stories with Harry fighting Voldemort and trying to get through school as normal. The big change I want to see is no prophecies.

Nothing concerning Harry specifically is a requirement, none at all in universe is even better.


** If you like Berserk, I'm reading a Berserk/Harry Potter crossover currently that I'm really enjoying. Spending so much time with Guts has rubbed off on Harry, so he doesn't much care about prophecy or destiny.

** Any other suggestions? Surely this isn't that unusual an idea.
