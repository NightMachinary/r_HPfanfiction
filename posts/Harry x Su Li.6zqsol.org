I was wondering if there are any of these type of fics? Whether they be short fluffy one shots or epic length stories, I don't mind. So just chuck them at me!


** Not to judge anyone's fandom, but Su Li is little more than a name on a list. She isn't mentioned a single time in the books. What is there for a writer to expand on? Wouldn't she basically be an original character?

*** Its the same reason Daphne is loved by the fandom; because its an easy way to add an oc character without it being as abrasive as if the author just made up a name and face.

**** You're correct. Plus, the only other Asian we know of is Cho Chang and she doesn't particularly have many fics either.

** I can only think of one right off the top of my head linkffn(The Cult of Dionysus by Ynyr)

Fair warning, It's a Harem fic. Honestly, though, it's one of the better-explained harems I've ever seen. It gives a semi-reasonable explanation as to why so many women are willing to put up with one person.

It's a crazy ride but It's been on my favorite list for about three years, worth at least trying.

  The blood wards around Privet Drive have a disastrous effect on Harry Potter's magical development, leaving him unable to use a wand. But there are other kinds of magic, and other paths to power. Harry/many witches. No horcruxes.
