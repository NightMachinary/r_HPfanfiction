I barely had the emotional stability to read the main series, so understandably sometimes the fanfic world destroys me emotionally. Therefore, I'd love to see some fics that contain literally zero angst. I mean like slice of life utopia nobody dies who is this Voldemort guy type fics. Thanks!


** Here are some sweet fics, mostly Drarry.

linkao3(Storm in a Teacup; Cake by astolat; The Full Monty by magpie_fngrl; The Way These Days Seem to Go (And Go); Harry Potter and the Incredibly Organized Personal Assistant; Sirius Black Is Sick of Your Parenting Advice)

It's been a long time since I read linkffn(The Best Revenge) but I remember it being very slice-of-life and wholesome. There might be some minor angst but nothing like character death.

  Stress baking isn't a hobby Harry ever thought he'd pick up, but he's surprised to find how much it helps him to get through those long months post-war.

** Linkffn(13230340)

Voldemort is a thing but he's never really a major threat. I think he appears like three times in the entire fic? And only his final action (in the last chapter of the fic except for the epilogue (which isn't out yet)) really felt like something close to an actual encounter.

The only other vaguely-angst-like thing I can think of is Umbridge, but she's dealt with pretty quickly too so I don't think it'd be a dealbreaker for you.

Overall the fic is just really pleasant in my opinion.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Lists had never failed Hermione before. So when her feelings for Ron get out of hand, it's only natural for her to write a list to clear her mind. She would come up with a list of boys most objectively compatible with her, detail the reasons why, and choose someone from the list to serve as a distraction. Of course, she never dreamed that her notes would all magically get sent out. (Inspired by To All The Boys I've Loved Before)

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19444075][A Strong Connection]] a short Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint soulmate fic. The summary says it all *Summary:* “As you know, Mr. Wood, for a soulmark to appear a strong moment of connection must occur.” At that, Oliver blurted out laughing. “Sorry, I'm sorry, it's just, we bloody well did have a strong moment of connection! There was a moment where his elbow strongly connected with my head!" AKA, a Flintwood Soulmark Get-together fic

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334][chalk this one up as a win]] is another Flintwood soulmate fic and frankly, I like this one even better than the one above. Overall, you might want to check out the whole series as it features two other Soulmate fics in the same AU universe. One is a Drarry the other is Dean Thomas/Seamus Finnigan fic *Summary:* Oliver Wood wakes up in the Hospital Wing a week after his first Quidditch game ever with a head injury and his soulmate's thoughts wound around his left wrist. Frankly, he's more concerned about missing the Quidditch game.

  Auror Sirius Black is in love with a French Muggle. Forced to keep the fact that he's a wizard secret, he still wants to move things forward. Only things aren't as easy as they seem, which Sirius learns the hard way after taking Remus on a short holiday.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
