Preferably 1st or 2nd year startup, and I don't mind what House Harry's in. Don't mind pairings either, but no slash.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** Linkao3(Other People's Choices) begins with Harry being resorted into Slytherin in the Chamber. It's great and the sequel is already up. Snape is a complex character and it is canon divergent.

*** That's a good fic. Mentor Snape stories are great because they delve into Severus' character and build solid relationships between him and Harry.

  AU. The Sorting Hat doesn't just let the Sword go when it falls on Harry's head in the Chamber, but also Sorts him again, this time into Slytherin. Harry is furious and terrified, and the adults aren't helping much.

** Linkffn(Stronger Than Hope by Alaunatar) it's not a 1st or 2nd year start, but it's definitely my favorite mentor Snape.

  AU after OoTP, a few HBP details. An obsessed, grieving Harry has decided on a dangerous way to defeat Voldemort. Snape is paying closer attention than before, but his contempt for Harry blinds him. Eventual Snape as Harry's guardian story. COMPLETE
