So I'm curious. What is your "guilty pleasure" fanfic? That trope or pairing or whatnot that you really enjoy but feel a bit bad about enjoying? My husband informed me last night that I occasionally worry him when I started laughing hysterically at a snarky remark made in a fairly gory torture scene... For me, I've always loved dark!Harry fics, or dark characters in general. And I've recently found that I enjoy HP/TMR slash, which I never thought would happen since I started reading fanfic for SS/LE fluff, lol. Totally fell down the rabbit hole, not gonna lie.


** Just like the acts of Voldemort, my enjoyment of marriage contract/law fics is great and terrible.

**** They're just nice, easy, quick to read and don't require much brainpower. Great for when I've got a headache or just want to shut the mind down for a bit. Other than whiskey, haven't really found anything else that can do that. And whiskey is a dark, dark road I'd rather not go down again.

** Time travel fics. I LOVE the concept but it's so rarely done well and falls victim to tons of cliches. Nightmares of Futures Past and Hogwarts Strike Team are the only ones I really enjoy (despite their cliches), though I also liked 0800 and C'est.

*** Seconded. I especially love Hermione romance fanfictions that involve time travel, but I've read at least two well-written-ones that fall to the clich√© ending of, "Hermione stays in the past, and has a daughter who later has a romance with/marries Harry or Ron in Hermione's stead".

I personally find that trope kind of squicky, considering that Ron and Hermione were canonically each other's love interests in the books. I know that Ron and Hermione aren't related by any means, but I just find the trope to be not to my taste. It's just far too pedictable and obvious of an outcome, and I feel like it's a lazy one on behalf of the author.

After all, even though Hermione's daughter might inherit some of her personality and traits, her child would *not* be the same as Hermione herself. I feel like some fanfiction authors completely overlook that.

*** If anyone searches one of those, there are two I can ehm... "recommend". The one, the better one is linkffn(Harry Potter and the ? (Sorcerer's Stone) by bookhater95). His biggest problem is his need to fix plotholes that aren't plotholes on some ridiculous and unnessery way. But he is just finishing book 3 and is still going on.

The other one is linkao3(Struggle To Salvation), althougt I will be honest. The author tries to envelop around the reading (actually that's smart as this is one of the big downsides of those stories). The problem is the extra story is utterly shit and I would suggest skipping it, also you need the book next to you, to read the story (or be a crack like me and know the scences by hearth). The only reason I even suggest that fic is beacuse it is already in HBP.

  Harry's had a hard life, much harder than most people could have ever thought of. Unfortunately, it only gets harder on him in his fifth year. Finally he's had enough and decides to go all out for once, but when Umbridge fights back, it affects both his life, and possibly her freedom...permanently. This may sound like the story Exploring Harry Potter's Life. Well...it is. When reading this story, you will have to have the appropriate book beside you. This is a reading the book fic, without the actual story line. You'll get the hang of it soon enough. Labels: Paragraph = self explanatory.Dialogue line = One or two lines where a character speaks or does an action while speaking.Dialogue set = More than two lines where a character is speaking and doing actions.
