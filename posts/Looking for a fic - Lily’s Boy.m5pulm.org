** This is from the author's bio:

If you're here about my fic Lily's Boy, I know it's gone. AO3 has taken it down because someone reported it for copyright breach, claiming there were some chapters that didn't contain enough original material and just took straight from the original work. I'm trying to get that sorted, but I might not win that fight. If it does get pulled for good, please don't message asking when I'll put it back up. Having it taken down has been the cherry on top of a terrible year and I'm gonna take some time away from AO3 to regroup. If and when I finish actually writing the fic, it'll go back up, if I can figure out how to fix the bits that AO3 don't like. I'm sorry, I know a lot of you love that fic, but I need to put my mental health first.
