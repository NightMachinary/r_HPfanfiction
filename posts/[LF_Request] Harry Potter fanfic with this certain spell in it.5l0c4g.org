The spell was a huge shield like a guardian shield that in the fanfic it scorched a lined in the ground when it formed. Looking for the fanfic that had this spell. Thanks Redditors.


** Was it linkffn(the pureblood pretense) ? that had a running plot line about fem!harry instinctively creating a lethal shield that disintegrated things which touched it (aka scoring the ground) when she felt threatened and having to unlearn it so she didn't kill someone. I think it happened in class, not in the Great Hall, however.

** Hmm...I think I know the bit you're thinking of.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/27/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Nightmares of Futures Past]] has a point in Chapter 27, near the end of Chamber of Secrets, where Gilderoy Lockhart memory-charms Rita Skeeter and attempts to do the same to Harry's group; Harry (from the future) uses an overpowered shield spell to block it, and Hermione comments on it leaving a gouge in the floor.

I believe Harry Potter & the Summoner's Stone has a super-shield-spell as well, developed for Harry's use with the help of Flamel, though I don't think it leaves lines in the floor at any point.

*** Harry Potter. Sort of a bad-ass sort of fic. Over powered. Not a crack fic but has elements of one. I don't remember the plot only it had this huge shield cast in the great hall the left a mark in its stone

**** Hmmm, sorry I wish I could help. My first thought was the marriage stone (slash, unfinished) where hp and the gang sort of team up and cast this huge ass shield against an elder demon but it was on the pitch on the great hall. Hope someone else can come along and help!!

Is there a specific or unique word you can remember about the fic or that moment? It may help
