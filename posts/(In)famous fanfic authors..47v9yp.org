Are there any authors that are know for their extreme views on certain characters or shipping?

** I'm surprised no one has mentioned Cassandra "Cassie" Claire yet. She was particularly well-known to be the reason why Dramione (Draco/Hermione) is so popular as a pairing today, and she also shipped (and wrote) the Ginny/Draco and Harry/Hermione pairings heavily as well. She /particularly/ liked Ginny/Draco, whom she later turned into the characters of Jace and Clary in her 'original' work, /The Mortal Instruments/.

Because she removed nearly all of her fanfic from the internet when she was about to be published, it's impossible to prove now, though it was enough to get her kicked off of ff.net and it's enough that she's being sued now.

That being said, some changes don't really need an explanation aside from “this is a change”, which basically means mentioning the thing at all. Though I'll note that for one, I'd never read the story you mentioned, or at least not far enough that I'd get to the moment you are writing about, and for two, I'd say it falls under either shoddy plot resolution or shoddy relationship writing.

*** It's a shame, because his original version of his "Emerald Flight" started off pretty good and seemed to have a lot of promise, but then wandered into "the same story he always writes" territory.

Yet I'd still argue that he isn't as bad as DZ2 in that regard. DZ keeps writing the same story in which Harry gets some sort of inheritance or power which gives him an excuse to act like an ass towards just about everyone. I honestly wonder if perhaps even he's bored with that because of how often he starts a brand new story doing essentially the same thing.

It's a shame, because there are so few authors who write Dark Harmony stories like what he keeps starting and then abandoning.

***** It's a difficult temptation to overcome, isn't it? :)

When you see a situation or relationship a certain way, and feel that it works "perfectly" that way, it's hard to write it differently.

It's one of the reasons I prefer to write a FemHarry, even though I have a couple of outlines and initial chapters of stories with a regular male Harry. Putting a girl in the leading role makes it a little harder to fall into /all/ of the same patterns that others have used. I have other reasons, of course, and wanting to see female characters in the leading, adventurous roles is primary, but being forced to look at old situations/scenes through new eyes is helpful to me as an author.

***** Yeah, I think they tend to have a lot. I can't say for sure because I don't read them anymore, but it's rare to have such large harems without a ton of smut as well. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but if you have several stories of exactly that type, I'm not sure it's possible to not get repetitive.

It's also nearly impossible to do a good job developing the individual characters, no matter how long your story is. With multi-pairings, the reasonable limit is a total of three or four people. Otherwise, the author will never do justice to them all and their interwoven relationships.

******* Harem politics has potential, but not harem politics alone.

First and most obviously, it would get boring if the women were sitting around in the chambers all the time, just plotting. If they never step out and actually do anything, just scheme and talk, I'm not sure how interesting they would be as characters.

Second, and perhaps just as obviously, they need to be plotting about /something/ - so the story needs to also depict the outside events (like wars) which are being plotted over. If we never see the consequences of the plots, we'll never care about the plots.

******** If I were writing it it would have Hermione plotting to escape and the rest jockeying for position, trying to deal with rivals (not limited to non violent means) and such. It would not be that long a story and the point would be to show the harem as a world of its own and an artificial social system the members cling to because they don't want to or cannot deal with the world outside. Anything from the outside would be filtered through that.

********* Ah, /that/ would probably work, though as you say it wouldn't work for too long, so it would have to be a relatively short story.

I was thinking more along the lines of a serious story, something like... I dunno, Game of Throne in the Harem? I don't suppose I had a super-clear idea of it, but that's the way my mind was moving.

However, injecting a critical perspective that showed both how ruthlessly political it really could be but also how parasitic it essentially was wouldn't suffer from the same problems. What's happening outside is irrelevant to the person trying to escape (except insofar as those events might help escape, of course).

***** I have to disagree that he's always coming up with "new" ideas - they are only "new" on a very superficial level. The details vary slightly, but the consistent running theme is some creature, elemental, or power-type inheritance which causes Harry to say "f*ck you" to everyone, act like a jerk, turn over expectations, do things his way... Or at least, that's the plan, until he gets four or five chapters in and decides to start over with a slightly different variation.

Also, it's a mistake to think that "dark" necessarily means "asshole." Dark means taking a more ruthless path, being less amiable, that sort of thing. Simply taking the first opportunity to yell and curse at someone who may or may not be annoying isn't "dark" unless you're a toddler.

**** Actually, he hates Hermione, so all of his stories bash or ignore her. It's worth noting that while that story is perhaps the most different or unique of all his stories, he says he doesn't like and it only leaves it up for others.

It's not a great story, but the part about how badly Hermione is affected by her delving into Dark Magic is actually nice because it's not something we usually get. Granted, as someone who does like the Hermione character, I'm not pleased by what happens to her, but it's still an idea that deserves to be explored more than it has been.
