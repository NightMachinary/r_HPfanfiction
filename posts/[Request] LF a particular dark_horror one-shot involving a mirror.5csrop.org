This has been bugging me for a few days now, and furious searching has turned up nothing.

I'm looking for a particular dark/horror-ish one-shot I read a while ago. I believe it starts out with, during the cleanup of Grimmauld Place, Harry stumbling upon a mirror in which the reflection talks to him and claims to be - I think - a person trapped inside. He ends up tricked into "releasing" the reflection, which takes over his body, traps him inside, and convinces his friends to ignore the mirror, leading to a bad end in which Harry is just stuck forever.

I don't recall it being a particularly outstanding oneshot or anything, but it's bugging been me and I'm hoping someone around here can help out.


** Damn, it's going to bother me now, too. Part of me feels like either it was on ao3, or was in a ficlet collection. I read it maybe a year and a half ago?

*** Yeah, I'm honestly not sure where I read it, or even how I came upon it. I feel like it might've been on a livejournal somewhere maybe, but I wasn't able to turn anything up with a livejournal-specific search.

** Have you tried searching for quotes on google with "quotations"? Maybe a line or key words? Hope this helps. Ps sounds pretty amazing!

** I now really want this, to be honest. Whoever finds it will have my utmost appreciation. On my hunt, I did find linkao3(A Little Knowledge by Nia_River). It only has a vague 'Harry trapped in a mirror' concept, but it's not too shabby, and should tide you over until someone more Google-savvy finds the fic that matches your specifications.
