Hiya!

I'm looking for a Fanfiction I read a while ago. I tried googleing it, but no luck so far, now I'm hoping one of you might remember it!

These are the things I remember: - Harry, Ron and HErmione meet on the train and stay in a compartment - They decide not to follow expectations and change the World/take it over - they use Harry's money to buy new clothes - all of them are unhappy with their home life - they hide the fact that they are investing money by masking it as playing a game ("5 to crystal mine" meaning "invest 5000 into the crystal mines" - at some point flitwick walks by them playing this game in the great hall - I Think they are Ravenclaws or slytherins

Hope to hear from you lot! Alcedininae

*** I think this is it. But I am singularly disappointed. Last updated in 2006. Was good but ended on a cliffhanger that will never be answered.
