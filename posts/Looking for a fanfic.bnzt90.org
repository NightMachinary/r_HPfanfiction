***** Sadly no. I didn't remember it at all but I stumbled upon the symbol of the healers symbol, and it reminded me of the snake.

Harry might have done healing, considering.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** Sooo read a portion of it. Nope! This definitely isn't it. The one I'm thinking about has decidedly less... Resque scenes and he uses parseltoungue for a lot of his magic.
