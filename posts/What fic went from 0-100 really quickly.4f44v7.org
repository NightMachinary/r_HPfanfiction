Whether it's Dumbledore suddenly trying to kill Harry after a normal conversation, or two characters suddenly having sex out of nowhere, there are plenty of fics where escalating quickly is an understatement.


** I remember reading a fic years ago...The summary was very vague and gave no indication what it was about other than that it was a Snape-mentors-Harry story. The first 3/4 of the first chapter were pretty standard -- pre-Hogwarts Harry is found with the abusive Dursleys, gets sent to Hogwarts until a guardian can be found for him. Then comes the part where Harry meets Snape. He says to Snape something like, "can I be forgiven for being bad at home?" And Snape replies, "well if my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ can forgive me for my sins, I'm sure he can forgive you too." I laughed until I cried then closed out the fic. Wish I had bookmarked that shit though, it was hilarious.

** Don't remember the name, but it was a rather long story. It felt like the story was having seizures occasionally. Like, everything goes more or less predictably for some time, then --- boom --- Hermione's sicking centaurs to attack Umbridge and laughing at her when she gets traumatized by the attack. Or Bellatrix starts torturing Hermione herself like it's 1944. Or a huge fucking snake bursts out of an old lady's body, etc.

**** The one I remember was not written in the first person. I know that as a result of the British wizards helping the muggles, Magic Britain was under embargo/no contact from the other wizarding governments. Because of this two minstry officials ended up sneaking onto a muggle plane under an invisibility cloak. A third person posing as a muggle observes them. That and the beginning are all that I remember. I am also reasonably sure it was on lifejournal by an author who had already written 1-2 longer action-adventure-angst fics.

Anyway, thanks for the link, looks interesting. Now I got something to read. :)

** Draco Malfoy and Practice of Rationality - It is sort of sequel to HPMoR. Draco here is a friends with Harry, but doesn't truly trust him, because of Harry's secretiveness. He is slowly looking for truth and becomes more paranoid. And then "slowly" gets thrown out of the window and he attacks Hogwarts and Perevell Hospital with band of ex-Death Eaters, flies the country, become mafia overlord under false identity and gets ready to ambush Harry who wants to lift Statue of Secrecy. The end.

****** If it's the fic where they die because they fall off their brooms after an airplane flies near them then personally, no I wouldn't read it. Harry is too ooc for me.

He becomes an asshole and justifies by saying "I have to be an asshole to survive." It's like after he almost got arrested he turns into a completely different person.

I also could handle Peeves being turned into an ultra powerful demon/ghost/spirit that starts manipulating everyone for some reason.

The thing that annoyed me the most was the insane hit wizard that wanted to kill Harry because his brother died while chasing Harry. No one at the ministry really cares that he's insane. They go "Yep, he's insane" and carry on with whatever they're doing. At one point he grabs Harry apperates away, beats the shit out of Harry, then leaves Harry and he doesn't suffer any consequences from it. A bunch of people watched him leave with Harry and not only does he get off scot free, no one mentions it again after several paragraphs.

All in all, regret I read it.

****** While it does have its 'psycho' moments, it is a very well written story. Its writing style makes you feel a little bit like you're reading a published book.

That 'insane' hitwizard's behaviour and the following acceptance by the ministry fellows kinda goes through because, from their viewpoint, Harry did get multiple colleagues of theirs killed. It makes some sort of twisted sense.

Anyway, there are some really polarized views about this one. Others love it, others hate it. I'd suggest you check it out just in case.

Also, there's [[/spoiler][Dubledore's 'you shall not pass' line]] towards the end of the story. I'd reread just because of that.
