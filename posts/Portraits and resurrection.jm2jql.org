Here is an idea for a story: Harry is looking through left over research papers from both Dumbledore (granted access by Aberforth) and Voldemort (Ministry insists Harry sort out Dark Lords belongings).

From Dumbledore he finds that portraits are no mere simulacrum, but protrusions of real Souls of the real people from Beyond into our dimension. Hence the memories, personality, etc. And Dumbledore figured out a way to draw them out of the canvas - if only there was a vessel to house them in!

From Voldemort he finds new research on how to create bodies and a way to infuse said bodies with a soul.

Combining the two Harry figures out a way using the paintings to resurrect the dead.

How would that change magical sociaty, whom would Harry attempt to bring back first, how would people react. Eventually (if knowledge got out) someone might try to draw Voldemort back too ... or other dark / light wizards from History. So much room for such mayhem!


** This would be basically the invention of immortality, I see murder, natural death and suicide being taken much less seriously to begin with since now they would be rather easy to reverse, about when he would bring back first... why Walbunga Back of course!

** There is a fic where Hermione brings back Sirius from the dead. I think it's a great concept

*** I believe that after OotP and between HBP, there were quite a few fics which ran on the trope of bringing Sirius back from beyond the Veil. Similarly with Dumbledore after HBP.

**** oh ok, I wasn't around then, so I wouldn't know. I'm not surprised this was the case. I can imagine that being in the fandom and losing Sirius must have been really full of angry and upset fans!

I was about sixteen at the time it OOTP came out and couldn't believe it.

***** Oh geez... you just made me realize that I've been into this fandom for almost two thirds of my life (with ons and offs). I was 10 when OotP came out and I was desperately searching for a story called 'Harry Potter and the Green Flame Torch' (which at the time was speculated to be the actual name of Book 6).

** If you want a Harry that experiments with souls, life and death, you might want to take a look at linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat)

Harry's unique abilities combined with the Deathly Hallows (the Stone), allows him to resurrect the dead.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
