Too often I see a Sirius who was once an auror in training (which is plausible I guess) but he's always secretly Moody's secret favourite student, who is the one to have a soft spot for him and him alone before Tonks came along. Moody has always been one to doubt Sirius's imprisonment and always secretly knew he was innocent, apparently.

Sirius is also the one who gave him his nickname 'Mad-Eye', which so far I've seen three times in fanfictions. Calls him an old softie behind his back and knows how to get around his strict rules very easily by having his heart.

Does this have a basis in canon? On another note, I never actually remember these two characters interacting through the books at all.

What's the appeal of this Sirius-Moody mentorship?


** Apologies, but I've never seen this particular setup. More common is that Sirius and Amelia Bones had a romantic relationship, which doesn't hold any kind of canon water - the timing is all wrong.

Then again, by canon I don't believe Sirius had any kind of serious ( ^{heh} ) job, and James supported both Lily and Remus from his trust fund.

It's possible, I guess, as in "trainee Sirius has an affair with his superior", but all these fics for some reason decide that Bones is Sirius's age, which doesn't make any sense.

*** Canonically I believe Sirius was a Hit Wizard, and James was either one too or an Auror. If I remember right the ranking in the DMLE is Aurors at the top, then Hit Wizards, then LEOs. Also pretty sure Aurors are basically detectives and Hit Wizards are like swat teams. Been a while since I read up on them.

Why would he support Lily at the point when he still had a trust fund? They only get together when he is 17. What was that author thinking?

**** I perhaps misphrased it. 21 year old James Potter supported his wife, stay at home mom Lily, as well as his friend Remus, using his inherited wealth.

Better?

** No, it doesn't have a canon basis, but Sirius, written correctly, is Bellatrix-lite and Moody is a once in a generation duelist/auror. Imagine them together and possibly mentoring Harry? They're also very easy to make 'gray.'

** They both were in the Order together the first time around, so they might have done a lot together. But what you are describing certainly has no canon grounding.
