*** Harry's progression from innocent schoolboy to revenge driven solider was an utter joy to experience. Huge fan of your works and I can't wait for the last bit of part two of Battle School!

** linkffn(Rise of the Wizards; Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power)

They both feature school and later on somewhat unconventional warfare, although in the former's case [[/spoiler][it is less of a war against Voldemort and more of a takeover against both wizards and muggles. It also happens only towards the end]]. Given that it is such a popular story, you might already know that one though.

** My first story starts with a bloody revolution, but after chapter 8 or so, it pretty much focuses on an escalating war in Magical Europe: linkffn(10595005)

Though it's a war, not an anti-terrorist action. Logistics, mobilizations, training, politics play a big part. You don't just go on an offensive across the continent, and even magic can only go so far in lessening the logistical concerns.
