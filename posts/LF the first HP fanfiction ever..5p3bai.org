I think it might be interesting to see what the fanfic's about and see what cliches it employs.


** I think this would be incredibly hard as FanFictions have been on the internet since the mid 90s (at least!) I believe. Many of those first sites have shut down. The best you can do I think at this point is to go to various fanfiction sites, sort by date and choose the oldest one.

** Harry Potter and the Man of Unknown is widely regarded as the first HP fic. I think it's even pre POA.

*** I noticed one that said it was published in 1969. Very much glitches.
