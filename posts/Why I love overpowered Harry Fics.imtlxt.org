I have only read the books and not watched the movies. I have been recently rectifing that and just started watching OotP. I could not find myself able to watch it. The frustration I feel for the isolation and abuse Harry endures is way too much. Like something needs to change. He needs some sort of support. For that reason I love fics that give Harry the support whether it is from someone else or even himself. I could not handle Harry just accept straight up from the one place he considers home. I stopped watching during Harry's first detention with Umbitch. He literally just went with it and did not think that he deserved better. It is just so sad. Rant over.


** JKR obviously wants the Trio to get all the accolades, and thus writes good adult guys as basically useless idiots. Where you can excuse Dumbledore's behaviors in first three Books as typical children's book shenanigans, his behaviors in Book 6 amount to total criminal negligence and incompetence. Heroic deeds by other students get skimmed over in a few paragraphs and completely ignored in Movies.

But she doesn't want to write the Trio as really competent either, because she wants to write a fairytale in which innocence and passive sacrifice overcome the ultimate evil. Therefore, the Trio must NOT have political acumen, strategic brilliance, and tactical competence. They must not act proactively, they can only react to whatever shit bad guys throw at them, and they will rush into any dangerous situation without second thought.

Also, JKR goes all in the “good guys don't kill” trope and prevents the Trio from putting any of those sadistic genocidal terrorists permanently out of business. As a result, they can only win through literary weapons such as Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiats, Plot Armors, and the “Lucky Hero” trope. Bad guys have to be dumbed down to room temperature IQ for them to even have a chance.

*** As i've said before, the main characters make a little more sense once you factor in the author's religious views.

Supposedly she has admitted that the books had inspiration in Christian themes.

** If I wanted a story about a clueless teenager whose whole life is a giant fuck up and he is dumb enough to never take any active steps to fix that, I would just go down memory lane and reminisce about myself.

No matter how trope-filled, cliche, and even poorly written a great deal of OP Harry fanfic is, it's just something about the setup that makes me go back to them every single time. You show them, dude! Don't back down a single inch!

*** Linkffn(The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries) is pretty great.

Linkffn(Albus and Harry's World Trip) has overpoweredness, but not in all aspects. Harry is smart and clever and sees solutions nobody else does.

Linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist) has a lot of over the top inventions and badassness, but not in the sense of a blunt hammer, but rather a multitool. For instance, Harry found a way to constantly heal his lungs in order to smoke without risk, that sort of thing. It has two sequels, both crossovers. The first is arguably even better than the original, but the second is bad.

Additionally, you might appreciate the Lone Traveller series. It's a bunch of episodic stories about Harry intervening at various points in history and slowly ramps up more and more in later stories. The first was written by The Professional, and the rest start with Linkffn(Further stories of the lone traveller) I think. Just look into the author for that one.

** it's a children's book. Objectively, if you want a badass kid slaying monsters and laughing maniacally and overpowered as /fuck,/ look into Percy Jackson series. If you're an old ass mofo and just started reading Harry Potter, it's not for you. While I loved the hp books, I loved them as a /child./ I loved it to death and have read hp fanfics for years now.

But would I ever read HP books now, as a grown ass man? Hell no.

*** I grew up with Harry Potter and rn I sort of wanted to return to have a break from work by returning to my favorite books my watching the movies. But I had forgotten how dark and hopeless it got especially since I have been only reading fanfics for a while. I don't think I could love the books as much now then when I did when I was middle/high school.

** It's funny that that was your reaction to the OOTP movie, because I really hated the movie because it was so much LESS dark and hopeless than the book. Book 5 and 6 were pretty gritty and the movies did not seem to capture that tone - other than Umbridge and one confrontation with Seamus, fellow students come around quickly to Harry in OOTP the movie, whereas in the book it's slow going and bad things have to happen before the students slowly come around, plus they cut out a lot of scenes where Umbridge did damage from the movie. Same with HBP - the music and seemed way too light and happy compared to the book, plus so many plot elements cut...

(Note: the scene where Voldemort posseses Harry in OOTP is one of the best scenes in the entire series, so the movie is not a complete dud)

** I read the books when they first came out and was a lot younger and unable to completely recognize just how terrible all the adults were in Harry's life. After that I have mostly read just fanfiction. Now going back to can on just brings back the story with a newer understanding that really just frustrates me.
