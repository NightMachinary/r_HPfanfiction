yea the title says it all, maybe newt or hagrid or both are involved with magical creatures or maybe neville is involved with herbology or professor sprout too, etcetc, mainly i just want fics where he is into magical creatures or herbology like newt and neville


** linkffn(Antithesis) has a Harry who is really into magical creatures. Actually a major point of the fic in my opinion (even mentioned in an authors note somewhere). Be forwarded though, it is tragic and a sad story.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
