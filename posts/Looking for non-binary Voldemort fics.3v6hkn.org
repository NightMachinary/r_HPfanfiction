Please forgive me if this is in the wrong place, but I really want to see if anyone has read any non-binary gendered/structured Voldemort fics. (Tom Riddle too if the distinction is there) Non-binary can include anything from transgendered to true hermaphroditic to xenobiology. Heck, even a fic where Tom riddle is half book would be fun to read.


** I've always seen Voldemort as (reassuringly) asexual. He was willing to use his charm to manipulate others but his own desires seemed completely disassociated from intimacy or sexuality.

*** Comes with Tom Riddle being a psychopath. They can easily be more dangerous than a sociopath because they have a much easier time creating a disarming or charming false personality. Voldemort falls between the two because he allows himself to become agitated and have outbursts.

I believe the Horcruxes changed him although calling it an improvement would be wrong.

*** An interesting proposition. Have you read any fics that talk about that?

**** It's not something I look for, and I'd bet that most writers that focus on him as a main character choose to sexualize him as part of the humanizing done to make him relateable.

If I were to grab one from memory, I'd say try linkffn(Fire Born by wickedlfairy17), wherein Harry is suffering the latest in a series of time-displaced reincarnations, this time as a pre-Hogwarts female contemporary of Tom Riddle. There is a spooky quality to the narrative that fits this sort of possessive not-quite-sexual bonding that Riddle has with fem!Harry.

  Being the Master of Death was a curse, plain and simple. That had been death's intention when he 'gifted' his trinkets to the brothers three. The sound of shedding skin crackled loudly in his ear as he got up to look over his new body, he was a girl this time, maybe eight or nine years old. Time travel fic Tom RiddleX Harry potter

** I haven't done much with it, but I've always seen canon Voldemort as haploid. He rejected his father's blood. Now he's XO. He's sterile, so the line of Slytherin dies with him, which is part of why he's obsessed with immortality.

  For once, Tom does not view the imperfections in his body, the ones that make him unlike a normal man, with repressed disgust - instead, they take on a new, saving sheen, for at least they are not shared with that other Tom Riddle.

  #+begin_example
      I've thought about this variation on Tom Riddle a couple of times\. This is the first time I've written it out\.
    In case it was unclear, this Tom's identity is definitely male, not nonbinary, but he desires a neuter body for personal/aesthetic reasons\. While it's out of the ordinary, I don't think anyone would characterize Lord Voldemort as psychologically ordinary\.
  #+end_example

  A note, just in case: there is a fantastic story in which Tom Riddle's possible routes through life branch out through all four Houses, and each cites the particular virtues of his House as the reason for his actions... and yet they all converge in Lord Voldemort. Similarly here. Though Tom's situation influences his decisions, past, present, and future, others in his situation would not take the same actions, nor would they find such actions justified. In canon, Tom's childhood as an unloved orphan "made" him pursue power and domination, while Harry's childhood as an unloved orphan "made" him pursue friends and justice; that's one perspective, but another is that their similar circumstances did not "make" them good or evil, only how they reacted to that and the choices they made as a result. I bring this up because... from this Tom's perspective, his having been not recognized as a boy was an influence upon how he behaved at the orphanage and the lessons there that he learned for life. But, had he been a cisgender boy, would he have ultimately turned out much different, all other things unchanged? Likely not; he'd instead cite "freakishness", or bookishness, or some other trait as what made him a social outcast and initially drove him to lash out with his magic against others. As the linked fic says, "all roads lead to Rome". It was this Tom's initial casus belli, but it would not drive a similar Harry down a Dark road, however it affected him. (Unless it was a Dark!Harry fic, of course...) Apologies for the rambling. I'm just worried that writing a villainous character as trans might seem to have problematic implications when that wasn't my intent at all. Hopefully this note will turn out to have been unnecessary...
