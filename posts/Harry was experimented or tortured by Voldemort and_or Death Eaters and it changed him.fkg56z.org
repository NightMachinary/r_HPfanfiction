Showing how it changes him, interested in reading a story where he becomes more deranged, but that's not mandatory. Just changes him in any way you can think of.

He could become more scared of Voldemort, and/or Death Eaters, he could end up doing something else entirely, his whole personality could change one way or another.

(Not really wanting character bashing). Like how Ron and Dumbledore are often bashed, not wanting that.
