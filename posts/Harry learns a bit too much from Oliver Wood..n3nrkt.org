Harry did not get to it later. In fact, he never got to it. Instead, he went on to read a 3000 page book on Belgium quidditch tactics. 13 kids died.

This has always been my assumption, but we have very little to go on from canon.

As for your Egyptian Herpo theory, it's certainly plausible, but has nothing to back it up. More importantly though, why would it matter? Bill Weasley's experience is with Ancient Egyptian dark magic. Herpo would have lived closer to manned spaceflight than Ancient Egypt.

******* My understanding is that, while putting protectives enchantments is common sense when making an Horcrux, they are technically not needed in the creation of one. You could make an Horcrux from a simple diary, or an unenchanted rock. It's stupid but you can do it.

Because of that, Harry was an Horcrux. An accidental one (something that should not be possible, but neither is splitting your soul in 8). An unprotected one but an Horcruxe all the same, which is why Dumbledore was forced to make a way too longue plan just to give him a chance to survive.

2. Dumbledore was professor of Transfiguration / Alchemy (I am not sure whether the latter one is not a fanon), not a specialist on the dark magic (and neither was he specialist on the Divination, by the way; and yes, I ignore FBaWtFT2). Yes, he was ridiculously old, so he probably read a lot of other literature, but I don't think he was the biggest specialist in every area of magic without any competition from people who actually specialized in the particular field.

3. Dealing with horcruxes is the most advanced DADA possible, because they are the most obscure magic (that's canon, I believe), so it makes sense he should consult as many people as he can. Yes, Snape might be too close to Tom, so he should be kept in secret, but there is no such limitation on Bill.

It's not thats not talented, it's that it's the equivalent of someone getting a 4.0 GPA and going to Med school being asked for help by Einstein on the theory of relativity. Sure, he's smart, but he's not the once-in-a-generation genius that Dumbledore is. I'd say Bill is comparable to Hermione.

Dumbledore, meanwhile, is acknowledged as one of if not the best wizards in the world. He did magic thought impossible as a teenager, invented a variety of things, and generally was incomparable to anyone in his age except Grindelwald and Voldemort.

It was priority number two for Dumbledore to not let the secret of Horcrux spill (priority 1 being to destroy them), in case Voldy figured out he was on to him. Snape is literally the only person it made sense to speak to it about, since he trusted him absolutely.

But to be fair: he got lectures from Dumbledore that did help to defeat Voldemort - it wasn't like it would have helped if Harry started "training" like he does in so many fanfics. You have to be realistic here: Harry is an above average wizard, but nothing more. Voldemort on the other hand was one of the most brillant wizards that ever lived. He had perfect control over his magic even before he started Hogwarts. He could fight Dumbledore to a stillstand. He had 50 years more experience. It wasn't like training could fill the gap.

The only thing I agree with you is that Harry didn't grieve Sirius enough. We see a little bit at the end of OotP and there are some weeks between book 5 and 6 - but that isn't enough.

Not fighting. Surviving.

Memories of Death Eater raids, ambushes, propaganda... What tactics they used in the Rise and might use again. What to watch for if someone might be coerced or under a curse. Spotting potential allies, scouting, avoiding Dark hotspots. Taboo.

It feels to me like the situation didn't fully sink in for Harry until halfway through book 7, and I'd have liked to see him aware of what exactly he was fighting and having some basic capability to seek help - even if just to resupply. Dumbledore, who both experienced the events himself and has friends who did could have done much to prevent Harry from stumbling around like a drunk from trap to trap.

If that is the initial premise, Dumbledore should have fallen in the Rise, or to Grindewald. No plan survives the contact with the enemy, that's why they're called the enemy.

Relying on a single plan never works and someone of Dumbledore's age and with his life experiences would know that. Even if Dumbledore trusted Snape, he saw that he was the only one, so any plan where Order would be relying on Snape without Dumbledore around to vouch for him didn't fit with the information available.

And finally, Dumbledore had enough problems with the Ring that he should have assumed a similar level of protection/danger. With St. Mungo's being too public and Snape unwilling to provide healing potions for all safehouses even if he had been able (he wouldn't be, not with his other duties), at least ways of obtaining the ingredients should be mentioned, or reference material provided. Getting food, dressing woulds... The basics, something to buy time.

Relying on Hermione ex Machina leaves sour taste in my mouth.

And even disregarding the above, giving Harry a few simple, but universally useful spells to practice would give him a sense of accomplishment and distracted him from Malfoy - a matter Dumbledore wanted Harry to drop. Which is something Dumbledore could have realistically thought of, since he'd been a teacher and then headmaster for a while.

"I betcha the Lestrange brothers support the Tutshills," grumbled Harry darkly. Hermione rolled her eyes. Harry had long since surpassed Ron in making annoying statements about Tutshill supporters. In Harry's mind, it seemed that supporting the Tornadoes inevitably meant you also supported Voldemort. She blamed Wood fully.

"Er, mate, I don't think they really care about Quidditch too much. Too busy doing Death Eater stuff y'know." said Ron, drumming his fingers on the table. Harry scoffed and reached towards his friend.

"Of course. Bloody Tutshill fans only care about the team when they're winning the league. No bloody sense of loyalty. Unlike you, Ron, you're a shining example of a /real/ Quidditch fan!"

"Harry what are yo-HEEEYYY!" Harry gripped Ron's robes and cleanly tore them off with one firm yank, leaving his friend standing in nothing but his Chudley Cannons boxers. Ron yelped and tried to cover himself with his hands.

"Wh-wh-why did you do that?!" Harry gave a proud smile and clapped the trembling Ron on the back.

"See? Some actual sense of /caring/ about your team. Good on you mate, I mean it!"

Hermione discreetly wiped away some drool at the corner of her mouth before looking Harry in the eyes as Ron slowly inched out of the room with a mortified expression.

"Harry, I do think you need to take a bit of a, y'know backstep in regards to Quidditch for a while. There's a bit of a war going on if you hadn't noticed." Harry gave her a withering glare.

"How 'bout I stop bloody breathing?" He mounted his broom and fell out the window. It had not been open and he got a face full of glass. Not that he cared. It was time for Quidditch. And that all was mattered.
