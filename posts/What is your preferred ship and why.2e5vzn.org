I'm curious about which ships are popular in our little sub and your reasons for doing so. I've never really been able to read some pairings so I'd love to hear some arguments for them.

To start, I ship H/Hr and have since I first picked up the series in middle school, right before HBP came out. The reason was a little silly then --- I had a little crush on my best female friend and H/Hr paralleled us. I was actually disillusioned with the last two books because Harry inexplicably (in my mind) fell for Ginny and Hermione for Ron. I held on the fragile hope of my ship until the R/Hr kiss in DH --- yes, I was that delusional. I didn't care much for Potter until my sister showed me fan fiction of Percy Jackson, whence I stumbled onto HP fanfic about two years ago and have been hooked since. My reasons for shipping have changed but my ship has not. The HMS Harmony! Our ship does not need canon to sail.


** Harry's my boy and I ship H/anybody. Het, slash, doesn't matter. As long as he's happy, I'm happy.

***** Best to me, that is. It's about Harry getting kidnapped and locked in Malfoy's dungeon. Lucius begins by abusing Harry, but eventually starts using him for sex. It's all done through Harry's pov and you watch him hate Malfoy with a passion, holding out in hopes that he'll be rescued, but gets broken when rescue fails, and so totally confused with the tender way Malfoy treats him and calls him "my pet" in bed. Draco has no idea what's going on and he's afraid to know (that really ruined my hopes for a drarry/rescue story).

Its really different from the usual non-consensual slash in that Lucius really seems to take refuge when in bed with Harry and live out this fantasy where he's caring and touching in a way that he can never be in front of anyone else. On top of that, the writing is so masterful I gasp with the beautiful descriptions. The words the author uses have this flowery extravagance and harsh beauty that is so Lucius Malfoy.

It's called The Unforgivable Pit by Catseye. I know this till now because I searched so desperately for it, but it looks like the author has moved on. It was written in 2004. The email address listed was [[mailto:cats_eye152@yahoo.com][cats_eye152@yahoo.com]] (but the fan email I sent her failed to deliver).

edit: I started searching for it again...and holy crap!!! Someone managed to find the first chapter!!!! ..but only that. [[http://web.archive.org/web/20080417061011/http://www.thesilversnitch.net/tss3/viewstory.php?sid=1908&chapter=1][Here]] if you want a taste of what I've been talking about!

** Harry/ Tonks is always interesting to me. I mean really? Older girl by about 6 years starts hanging around a 15 year old boy quite a bit and he at least is never interested?

But if not for fanfiction, Harry/Luna makes the most sense to me. They both know what it is like to be alone. She is often a comfort to him in times of emotional duress not Ginny or even Hermione. She convinces her father to print Harry's interview to help prove he is not crazy, something she probably identifies with.

Sirius's death? Burying Dobby? They have similar childhood's. What was the point of introducing Luna otherwise? And the mistletoe? And the slug club party? Lost chances for Harry in my opinion. Seriously considering Harry would have some bad PTSD after everything he has gone through I would think Luna much more capable of helping than Ginny. At least there is evidence of her being concerned with his emotional well being. Ginny on the other hand is just pissed she doesn't go for an "adventure" in DH.

*** Honestly I think you hit the nail on Harry/Luna, but I think some of that craziness Harry experiences would make him mature enough for a suitably immature and/or equally troubled Tonks. Also much liberty is taken with her age and personal life in most fics, so they often are not that different in age or personality, so it fits.

There's also the fact that it fits with several teenage fantasies: older woman, able to act as an adult/minder in his favor, can change her freaking body (not that a single writer has skipped the "show me your true self" clich√©).

*** I agree about Tonks. Harry with an older girl (Tonks, or to lesser degree, Fleur) has lots of potential as a pairing. My main interest would be in seeing how Harry would win them over. Fleur considers him a "little boy", and there's a six year difference between him and Tonks (not a big deal when it comes to adults, but if Harry's still in school, it's different).

** I'm less inspired by ships than quality of writing. A few pairings may turn me off a story (Hermione/Snape, Hermione/Draco, Ginny/Draco, Harry/slash), but I'm generally ambivalent about who is with whom.

If I had to pick favorites, I'd say Harry/Hermione, Harry/Ginny, Harry/Fleur (the rare stories written plausibly), and Harry/[Slytherin female who is not a stereotypical Ice Queen], but the stories do have to be written in a certain way. Specifically, a shipping fic with romance as a main theme must have characters that are fleshed out and interesting. Ideally, the stories are also set at a time when the characters are consenting adults making decisions (and coping with their fallout) like adults. Granted, this is only a small sliver of what's out there, but it's my choice. If I wanted to read insipid, breathless, schlocky romance, I could always just pick up a Harlequin.

I also have zero tolerance for "mind speech" or "soul bond" rubbish, whatever the pairing.

*** Hermione/Snape was a great turn off for me for the longest time, but some extraordinarily talented writers ship that. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374460/Aurette][Aurette]] has hands down the best dialogue in fan fiction [[http://www.fanfiction-junkies.de/efiction/viewstory.php?sid=2377][when she's on]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1317626/Ms-Figg][Ms-Figg]] is the queen of fan fiction smut, and that is also her ship. And there are quite a few good stories out there; at it's best, it is two nerds being socially awkward around each other and hilarity ensues.

The ships that make me cringe hardest are Lucius/Hermione and Voldemort/anyone. Snape/Hermione and slash have a chance to be written well enough to cover for instinctive unpalatability, but those two just make me ill.

** I also love HHr, seeing as I still don't see Hermione and Ron together. However, I do not like the notion of getting married so early on in life, having kids and staying happy with your high school love, as I do not think that is believable. I imagine that Ginny becomes more outgoing later on in life and dates some older Quidditch players, for example Oliver Wood. I also love Seamus/Dean, which goes a bit against my earlier point, but there must be an exception to every rule.

** My favourite is no ship. I can't stand to read fics where the author clearly has a couple that they feel is "meant to be". They're all so bad.

I don't mind fics that contain romance, but shipping is distinct from that I feel. Shipping is rather more rabid. The plot is oriented entirely around the romance, there's generally no conflict (the couple will get together in the first third of the fic and stay together), a lot of bashing, and a lot of authorial mouthpiece preaching.

These fics also often present painful gender stereotypes.

The only realistic result to any high school relationship is that they eventually break up.

I can't say precisely how amusing this sentiment is, but know that it has me laughing out loud. There are plenty of happy couples who have been together from early on, just as there are plenty of miserable or broken ones. It's the same story with relationships at any stage of the game. It's hardly a strike against realism that a relationship begun in high school lasts beyond it.

** Draco/Hermione will always be my go-to. It's funny because the first fic I read was a Harry/Hermione story with a Draco/Harry friendship and the entire time I was rooting for the other two to get together! I just did my own searching from there and never went back.

I'm also a huge fan of Hermione/Sirius only within the time traveling trope. Its a weird obsession. As for second gen I like the Rose/Scorpius pairing because anything is possibly canon when it comes to that timeline.

I really dislike when Harry is the lead in a fic because no author will ever come close to canon, and I don't want to lose my authentic mental image of Harry from the actual series. Neither do I like Ron/Hermione fics because, let's face it, nothing will ever be as charming as the real ship they have. I guess I'm just adverse to any canon ship heh.

** I'm a big multishipper, because unless it's been recommended as really amazing then I'm not a huge romance fan. I'm more interested in good writing and good plot. As far as relationships go, if you've written it well enough then I shouldn't need to ship it to believe it.

That said, the two pairings I'll always come back to are Harry/Draco and Hermione/Snape. There's just so much potential for H/D--early starting AU where they're friends from First Year, post-Hogwarts meetings, mid-Hogwarts AUs, the motherlode of pre-OotP fics... ten years of reading may have given me some bias, but I just feel like there's unlimited possibilities with the pairing. If I am in a mood for romance, they're my go-to pair. As for SS/HG, I just love the idea of two intelligent people together.

(I should probably also give some mention of Snape/Lily. It was the first pairing I ever shipped so it's always going to stick with me, but canon revelations and various meta discussions changed the way I saw it and now I'm a lot more picky about how I like to see the relationship portrayed.)

**** I've had this idea in my head for a while that sorta spontaneously combusted and since then I've thought that Gred and Forge were very different regardless of their unified 'public' front.

I always imagine them both being incredibly brilliant at making pranks (potions, arithmancy, runes, enchanting, charms), and running a business, but George is considerably more uptight than Fred. He's much more of an introvert than he shows and because of that, he finds acting his part of one of the twins to be almost stressful. He likes making people smile and entertaining people, but not necessarily being the center of attention to do so.

Fred on the other hand is way more out going. He's the one that comes up with ideas, and he does most of the front-end work while George is behind the scenes developing them. George is therefore much more like Hermione than Fred, and that's why they wouldn't work. They're practically the same person. He would certainly find working with Hermione to be productive and pleasant, but Fred would be the better one for her. She needs a Fred to bring out her fun side, and Fred needs her to make him realize that while George loves him, he doesn't like the Twins shtick. Once he realizes this, all three are able to become much closer because Fred won't feel like he's being abandoned, George won't feel like he's being forced to be someone he's really not, and Hermione will have an outlet for her brains and her fun side.

They would always be close of course, and in a fight would no doubt be at each others' hip. They are brothers, twins even, after all. And while Fred finds Hermione, George would find someone quiet like himself rather than an outgoing chaser like Angelina. Perhaps a Slytherin or Hufflepuff.

Granted, all of this is just my headcanon that doesn't actually come up in fanfictions very much.

Book six I thought Draco would breakdown and confess his feeling in the tower, and book seven would be Harry questioning his sexuality and battling Voldermort. Which in retrospect was all obviously me projecting my own sexual discovery on Harry, because he was dating Ginny for last 1/3 of book 6.

It's the pretty and popular girl with the popular jock. It's the highschool prom king/queen stereotype. Let alone the fact that Lily never considered him dating material before seventh year (according to Remus with the James hexing people for fun comment), making it a cliched flash romance.

Don't get me wrong, despite Snape being a favorite character of mine I think Snape/Lily (or the even more cringeworthy Sirius/Lily) is far worse... but I just don't get it.

**** I just can't stand people writing the same characters JK developed so well. No one will ever be able to do it as well as she did. So I like reading about characters we barely know anything about. It lets the authors create them however they want. No two Lilys or James are the same.

As far as the flash romance thing, I just don't see it that way. It's super interesting to me to see how different people envision James changing and growing up and Lily getting her head out of her bum and realizing he's a good person.

***** Lily was less than 4 months before 18 years old when she started seventh year. At that time she disliked James (according to Remus, because James only stopped hexing people for fun then). She was pregnant with Harry before she was 20. In those two years and two months, she had changed from disliking James to deciding he was the love of her life to starting a family with him.

That seems extremely rushed to me. And if I'm in a particularly nasty mood, like many couples who start a family before twenty, likely followed by an early divorce that didn't happen because they died too early.

** I really enjoy Severus / Remus because there's a lot that I think they can bond over, never quite fitting into society, feeling quite horrible about things about themselves.

** Hermione/Sirius and Hermione/Remus are two of my absolute favorites. Marriage law, blood/breed law, time travel, bring it on! As long as it's well written and not a one-shot, I'm game. These pairs need time to properly develop, and a one-shot can't do that IMO. I think the characters involved feed off of each other quite well, and the Marauders have a potentially rich history and personality that we don't get to explore in canon.

WolfStar is my ever reliable OTP. I mean, seriously. I've shipped it ever since first reading PoA. Marauder Era, first war, post Azkaban... We have three very different time periods that greatly affected these men so why not play in this playground? What little canon we have is just a starting point, not a limiting factor.

Harry/Tonks is one I've grown to appreciate after reading one where Harry is crazy good at Runes. Idk, it's cute, she can challenge him, the age gap is made up for by the maturity gap (and we don't have that much of Tonks personality in canon, but she did seem immature to a degree). Plus, she's an Auror so she has to be intelligent and useful in battle anyway, she can help Harry in his whole saving the world thing without suddenly becoming a hero herself.

Hermione/Draco is one I like at certain times of the year. If it's well written and has good character development, and the personalities at least start out as properly in character, I can give it a shot. But I get so fed up with Draco very easily that it's easier for me to not have him as a prominent character. Yeah, he's definitely complicated, but that isn't exactly a good thing.

Hermione/Weasley Twin is a fun one. No, the twins aren't interchangeable, but these are fun reads and again as long as the personality is developed (since we don't see them individually much), it can be great.

A guilty pleasure of mine is Lily/Sirius. There doesn't seem to be much, a lot of it is close-friendship, but that's always good too. I just like the idea of one Marauder being in love with another Marauder's girl, and seeing how it turns out, not only for the boys, but do we get our canon Halloween, or does it go full AU?
