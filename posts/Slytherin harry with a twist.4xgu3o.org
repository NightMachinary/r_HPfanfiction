Hey, I am searching for a slytherin!harry fic where he is bullied & ostracised by his whole house &head of house.

I mostly see fics where he is a uber political 11 y/o with more cunning than Salazar himself. I just want to read a fic where he is as clueless as in canon and has to adapt to an even worse treatment as in his muggle school.

** linkffn(8984932) I, Alone has Harry as a slytherin and he's more or less bullied by his older housemates. Not completely ostracized, as he makes friends with a few people but Malfoy and co. delight in pranking him and making his life harder.

  Can a child, raised to believe that he is worth little more than the dirt he sleeps upon, find the courage to rise up and face his destiny or will the weight of the entire Wizarding world that rests upon his small shoulder be the final straw that breaks him? (This is a seriously abused Harry - forget canon Harry! Abuse is not overcome in a few months time)

Has that in the begining, though it's a re-do fic so this Harry might not be as teethless as you might want him to be.
