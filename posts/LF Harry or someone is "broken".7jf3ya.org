Got interested in the idea after reading Batman Knightfall. Basically looking for fics where a villain pushes Harry or someone to his/her mental and/or physical limit then confronts them and "breaks" them but let em live similar to like what Bane did.


** "Stages of Hope" sounds pretty close to what you're looking for. Harry and Hermione and Neville and Luna are about a half-step away from losing their sanity.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** linkffn(11650496) -- warning, there is very dark stuff in here. It's also not finished, and the author (who I follow regularly) hasn't posted for his other stories in a bit either. I guess it's to be expected with college.

  Voldemort emerged victorious on the night of the third task. Harry Potter was in his clutches, his faithful servants were back at his side. Yet he committed a grave mistake: He thought Harry Potter feared what lay on the other side of the gate just as much as he did. Harry/Fleur with a complication.
