-The ‘manipulated' Harry and/or his ‘minders' (Ron & Hermione) are disbelieving and point out that they don't really have that much influence on Harry's life (blaming Ron for Harry not being some magical prodigy is just unfair with the guy -not everyone wants to put twelve hour per day in studying and this is fine), the manipulation attempts are ridiculous and even outright impossible.

-Harry takes him to Madam Pomfrey because he thinks Dumbledore either has gone mad or is very stoned (alternatively Harry may just let him wherever he found him and go search his office for said drugs because he also wants to get stoned).

-Petty much everyone has already figured it up and was going along for their own reasons or because it fit in their plans, Hell, maybe Dumbledore himself was being manipulated by everyone else and his erratic behavior was the result of everyone of his manipulators having their own incompatible schemes.

-It was all actually a prank played by both Dumbledore and Harry with them seemingly to be going progressively deeper in the “Indy!Harry x Manipulative!Dumbledore” trope just to mess with everyone else.

-“Dumbledore” was actually /another/ Death Eater that managed to get into Hogwarts and was trying to ruin Dumbledore's reputation (The Death Eater wasn't the smartest one around).


** I'd love to see one where Dumbledore is being manipulated, and the story has Dumbledore working with cliche indy!Harry in the same disapproving tone that Denarian Renegade has.

"Okay, I have my Goblin Allies ready to ruin the Weasleys," Harry said, eager to completely bend the law in order to achieve revenge yet again.

"This is wonderful news, my boy, but must you have your sixteenth wife sucking your dick during all of our conversations?" Dumbledore asked, sighing.

"It's the twenty first one," scoffed Harry, glancing down under the desk. Yup, still Narcissa down there.

I imagine this one happening during Year 7 at some point, just to add to the ridiculousness of this plan. Harry's not even there, everyone knows Dumbledore's dead and Death Eaters run the school, and Fake-Dumbledore is grandstanding in the Great Hall claiming all sorts of atrocities against "Lord Potter".

Severus Snape seriously considers turning his wand on himself rather than being associated with whichever dunderhead thought this was a good idea.

*** Would probably be either Crabb or Goyle doing the acting and promptly stumbling every three words, asking Snape what was their script again and again to say nothing of simple generally bad acting.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
