Basically looking for fics where Harry doesn't just automagically win. He has equal wins and losses,and builds his power from the ground up. If you've ever read Amenaza, I'm looking for something like that. Naruto (It's a Naruto/Bleach fic) starts off weak asf, but eventually evolves through stressful moments and powerful enemies.

Let's say, for example, Harry has rather weak magically. Near squib like. But eventually grows and grows in power,coming to the point where only a few can match him, but not having it happen within a few chapters.

For wealth, maybe he starts off with a moderate amount, nothing too fancy, and eventually grows it through smart investments, but also having stupid investments as well.

And, at the very least, he has to have some reason other than "Dumbles has been manipulating my life! Get him, Goblins!"

Over 70k+ words.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six-year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.
