** Sorry about formatting errors (on mobile)

    "Mrs. and Mr. Dursey you said you needed a nanny," said Marry Poppins. 

     "Yes we do, would you do it?" asked Mr. Dursey.

     "Why of course," she answered. 

Years later:

      "Harry, you're a wizard."

      "I'm a what?"

       "A wizard." presiding to explain all about magic.

Shortly after his eleventh birthday Marry Poppins takes him to get all his school supplies.

     "Harry come with me, you need your stuff for school," said Hagrid.

     "Harry dear ignore him, let's get what you need for school."

     "Ok Ms. Marry,"

On platform 9 3/4:

     "Alright dear owl mee weekly and please do tell what house you're in and do remember slytherin isn't pure evil."

     "I will Ms. Marry."

On the Hogwarts Express:

    "Can I sit with you everywhere else is full?" asked Ron.

    "I would prefer you don't for one and for two the one behind you is empty so you are lying to me so please leave me alone." A few minutes later:

    "We heard you stood up to our brother," started Fred.

    "Would you like to be our friend?" finished George

    "Sure."

Being sorted:

    'Hi Mr. Hat'

    'Alright Mr. Potter... hmm Ravenclaw would be the best for you but Slytherin wouldn't be bad for you either Hufflepuff would work but not Gryffindor so which do you want?"

    'I trust your judgment Mr. Hat so Ravenclaw.'

    'Good Mr.Potter' "Ravenclaw"

In Dumbledor's office that night"

    "What do you mean he ignored you?" asked Dumbledor, dumbfounded, 'my plans were perfect, why did he have to mess them up?'

    "He just didn't talk to me," explained Hagrid.

    "Hey at least you are neutral to him. I was caught lying to him," said Ron.

Around Christmas

    To whomever this may concern, 

    I have seen in the public records that my godfather Sirius Black was not given a trial. Why is this? As I have been told by one of my parents friends Ms. Mary Poppins he was extremely loyal to his friends. I also have seen the will of my parents that says that Peter Petigrew was the secret keeper for my family. If you could clear this up that would be wonderful.

Sincerely,             

Harry J. Potter

   Dear Mr. Potter, 

   Thank you for bringing this up to my attention. I will look into this. 

Sincerely,                    

Amilia Bones         

Head of the DMLE     

The Daily Prophet February, 18th

Sirius Black is now free after Investigation finding that Peter Pettigrew was the Potters' secret keeper and that he blew up the muggle street.

At the end of the year  everyone is arriving back on the plattfom. Quirrelmort didn't get the stone.

   "Thank You Pup," said Sirus to Harry.

   "Sirius let me go," said a surprised Harry.

   "Padfoot let him go."

   "Hi Marry."

   "Hi Ms. Marry."

   "Let's go home Pup." 

That's it for now

** She would hardly make Harry and Dudley better off than they are already in Privet Drive. An arrogant nanny who gaslights children by showing them magic then denying it would not be good for them to be around. Dudley might be convinced that he is a wizard and be disappointed to find out that he isn't and Harry would be confused as to why she shows him magic then says it isn't real, then Hagrid comes and tells him that he is. Also Mary Poppins would probably try to discourage Harry from breaking any Hogwarts rules judging by how strict she is, something which Harry wouldn't be happy about. I don't think that Harry and Dudley need a nanny who calls herself "practically perfect in every way", is very distant and and says "Spit spot" often enough for it to be annoying around them. Also Mary Poppins forces shut the mouth of a bird, which makes me concerned that she would do the same to Hedwig, which Harry wouldn't want her to do. ps I'm judging this on the Mary Poppins in the film, I haven't read the books so I'm not sure about that Mary Poppins
