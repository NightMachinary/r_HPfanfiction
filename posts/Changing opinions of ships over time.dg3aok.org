What it sounds like

Harry potter ships fanon or canon you started out hating or being indifferent on and you grew to to love (or at least like) , and ships you started out being indifferent about or liking but grew to hate ( or at least dislike). At least one for each category. What made your opinion change?

If its a situation where you wouldnt have wanted to see it in canon or like it in canon but like reading fics on it ( or vice versa) that counts.


** For me I started out liking Drarry because of a well written fic I believe. And for a long while that was my otp but eventually I think I just got burnt out from reading too much. I don't hate it or anything but I dont go searching for it anymore. I'll still read a Drarry fic if the plot sounds interesting and it's well written. I'm actually reading one right now

** I'm so over Drarry, mostly because when Drarry first became a thing Deatheater whitewashing wasn't also a thing. People mostly wrote about Draco falling in love with Harry and getting woke, or getting woke and falling in love with Harry. These days, it's this unholy combination of racism and classism and bad sex and just ugh. Fanon!Draco and fanon!Daphne have become interchangeable but for their genitalia. I seriously have no idea where Ice Prince Draco has come from, because canon!Draco has no chill. He's practically Gryffindorish in his pigtail pulling.

** I came into HP fanfics looking for a "better" Harry/Ginny romance and more depth for her. And the first few fics I've read were great, but then the next few were exactly the same, and, after realising that I have ended up in trope hell and coming across a few better-written fics, my interest in H/G steeply declined.

That's not to say that I don't ship them, but I have yet to find an H/G fic with an actual plot which I enjoy. There is always some element I don't enjoy, the figurative hair in the soup. Most notably the Big Weasley family with 5413451453 children (to me, that would be in-law hell), R/Hr and Hermione bashing.

**** That's the Slytherin Ginny one, right?

Does it have any of the following:

- R/Hr?

- Harry getting assimilated into the Weasley family?

- Positive depictions of Snape, Voldemort or Draco Malfoy?

- Hermione bashing?

- Positive depictions of Lupin, Lupin/Tonks?

Because that's my no-go list. And let me tell you, trying to find a Harry/Ginny fic without any of those has proven impossible so far (at least for non-explicit stuff)

***** That's oddly quite a specific list? I can see why you struggle to find Hinny fics, but I'm curious why you're sticking to that criteria so much.

The Changeling is indeed the Slytherin Ginny one, and I'd say it doesn't have any of those elements. The only exception is maybe Harry and the Weasley family, but that's more just following canon. The sequels will have the R/Hr and the Weasley family stuff, but I'm not sure it's at all possible to avoid the Weasley family if you have Harry dating one of them.

I was more thinking of the author's standalone fics which are not based on her Slytherin!Ginny universe. 'gone was any trace of you' probably has slight trace amounts of Weasley family and R/Hr bits but mostly focuses on the Hinny relationship.

I could have sworn there was another fic I had in mind about Harry and Ginny being Quidditch stars and having a FWB relationship that turns into something more, but I can't find it now for some reason.

Because any of those is a reason to immediately close the tab. I'm struggling to decide which was the more unconvincing relationship, Ron/Hermione who had way too much water under the bridge IMO or the trainwreck Lupin and Tonks were in. Which is the reason why I can't stand positive depictions of Lupin, as he was not there for either Harry or his wife.

At the same time, I like Hermione and therefore don't like fics which bash her any more than those who bash Harry's parents (WBWL, Snilly). And disliking Malfoy, Snape and Voldemort needs no further explanation I think.

I think it's quite easy, especially after the war. Fred's death and/or Molly's overbearing nature would be enough to write a falling out.

Was it the one where Ginny decided to randomly bring Harry to a family dinner or am I thinking of something else.

** I grew up as a Dramione shipper because Tom Felton was incredibly cute in the movies, and my teenage angst fell in love with the bad boy trope.

Now having grown up a bit, I enjoy Hinny fics mostly because the big-name authors seem to be fairly mature and portray a loving and emotionally stable relationship that my adult ass craves. It's like, the wish fulfilment went from wanting a more exciting life to just wanting a nice, loving and stable home life. Something about how they seem to get each other, how they portray a strong front but can get emotionally vulnerable with each other, and how bad ass Ginny can be while also pursuing a more light hearted career just seems very attractive to me.

Not gonna lie though, I have a soft spot for Hermione/Fred because Fred reminds me most of my current boyfriend. They're always goofs, trying to make people laugh and at times crossing a line (U-No-Poo anyone?) but in private seem like such a gentleman. I've become a sucker for the Joker with a soft side since I've started dating my boyfriend. Unfortunately I've run out of quality fics for this pairing so I just settle for a few binge reads when I miss him and need a hit of the fluff.

** When I started reading HP fanfictions, I had minimal opinions on ships -- the one ship that comes to mind that I disliked even back then was Remus/Tonks, because to me it always seemed to be an objectively bad match given their interactions. As for fanon ships, I had no "special" opinions -- however, there has always been ships I've shied away from due to the mere idea of it sounding very dubious. An example of this would be Harry/Voldemort.

Over time, I developed some opinions on some ships. For example Ron/Hermione -- before I started reading fanfiction, I was indifferent to this ship. A result of reading various fics, alongside reexamining canon, led me to the opinion that it's a rather questionable match -- they seemed to spend the most of their interactions fighting about pretty much everything. Ultimately, my view on the ship is simply; I can see them try a relationship (because they clearly have feelings for each other) but I can't see it go anywhere longterm.

I think my biggest change of opinions of a ship is Jily. Before I started reading fanfics, my opinion of the ship was basically "seems like a decent enough match", I had rather little opinions beyond that. As I started reading fics, especially Marauder-era fics, I started to notice a theme: once James became a teenager (3rd year), he notices Lily and starts pursuing her. She is uninterested, and her responses get progressively more harsh as James simply doesn't stop bothering her. The fact that he kept harassing her friend for personal amusement didn't exactly help his case. Ultimately Lily caves in 7th year with them both being Head Boy/Head Girl, and because nobody else even tried due to James' relentless pursuing. I saw this in several fics, and most of the fics, being pro-James didn't really seem to consider this behaviour a problem. I did, and given how common this setup was, I started disliking Jily as a result and started to consider it a negative fic trait. Eventually, in an unrelated SS-centric fic reading spree, I developed a major interest in Snily, which, while not strictly a strike against Jily, reduced my interest in the ship indirectly further as a result. Then I read Veritas Omnia Vincit, a Severitus fic, which easily has the worst portrayal of James I've seen while still not making him utterly one-dimensional and thus leaving me unable to take him seriously, and portrays emotionally abusive Jily. This fic ultimately turned a ship that I was already disliking for other reasons, into a ship I couldn't stand at all, and for a while it became part of my "to be avoided at all costs" list (alongside stuff like Harry/Voldemort). Eventually I forced myself to read some fics that has it anyway, due to how common it is and me not feeling like removing a large chunk of the fanfiction archive, and I'm able to stomach it again -- as long as it isn't a main-focus of the fic, and my feelings on Jily hasn't really recovered since.

*** Eh I guess you don't like that kind of romance.

I don't think it is realistic either.

But I wonder if there are any Jily fics with a different set up? Where Lily found James annoying for a reason not even she could explain and disliked him until her view was completely changed when she saw James doing something extremely kind that was completely out of the ordinary. Or maybe they were in a playful prank war and others thought they hated each other? Or maybe one where she had a crush on Snape for the first few years and it dissolves when Snape calls her a mudblood and here she is very heartbroken until James comes and tries to comfort her - she gets angry at this as James was the one bullying Snape but soon in her eyes James proves himself to her. There are just so many set ups, and I am rubbish at romance, someone else think of other set ups.

#+end_quote

While I haven't really read a fic doing this, it's one of the more plausible ways of them ending up together that I've considered myself (with or without previously existing romantic affections for SS) -- but also one I find rather disturbing. As in, "James, in the process of trying to win Lily, gets rid of Snape, only to swoop up and 'comfort' her in the fallout". Worse is, James actually does this /twice/ -- he (and Sirius) is ultimately also the last straw in the breakdown of the Lily-Petunia relationship, by playing a magical prank during the Dursley wedding.

At this point, if I want to read a Marauder story, I'd much rather read one where Lily either isn't shipped at all, or is shipped with Remus (while my preferred person to ship Lily with is SS, that lends itself to a non-Marauder focus and thus not really useful in this case).
