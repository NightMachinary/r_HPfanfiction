:END:
I think I recently read a story where Harry was raised by Goblins, and their entire society was based around paying for everything at the time, and directly. I think I remember Harry having to pay for healing and loosing some of the money he'd been saving up to buy more advanced potions lessons with? No idea where I read this, but apparently I didn't save it when I did


** It's part of the series From Gringotts to Hogwarts - with Love, by Brennah_K on Ao3.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1290977]]

The story you are thinking of is the first one Gringotts' Lesser-known Branch.
