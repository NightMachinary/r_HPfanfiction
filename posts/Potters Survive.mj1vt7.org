I'd like for there to be no bashing, Indy!Harry, and preferably no Romione(while I like Ron, I'd like him to get with someone who plays Quidditch or something and for Hermione to have an OC love interest). If the author fleshes out Romione, I can deal with it.

Other than that, I'm good with anything.


** Depending on exactly what you mean by Indy, linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) could be quite a good fit. Tom Riddle went into politics instead of terrorism, so there was no war, the Potters are alive and well and basically form an extended family with Sirius and his son and Remus. Harry isn't allowed at Hogwarts because she's not pure-blood, though - but she doesn't intend to let that stop her. And then it turns out that Riddle has the next stage of his plans in the works, to reshape the Wizarding world into what he thinks it should be...

Hermione is in the story, but isn't at Hogwarts, and Sirius' son falls for her. Ron is around and is in Harry's extended circle of friends (she's in Slytherin but has friends in all houses), but he doesn't have a pairing as yet.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** I like this one a lot: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15086759/chapters/34981118]])

I'm guessing what you actually wanted was a "Harry grows up with his loving parents" story though - in this one the Potters don't survive but Harry is adopted and raised by a new set of loving parents: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487/chapters/31624473]])

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
