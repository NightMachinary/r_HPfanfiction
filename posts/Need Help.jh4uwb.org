I'm writing a (crack?) fic about dimensional travelling Harry, then because he travels too much he rips a hole between all universes. It will have all canon-characters and fanon-characters in Harry Potter, and also introduces all characters I know from all franchises.

Examples of characters:

Assassination Classroom

Hunger Games

Diary of a Wimpy Kid

The Treehouse series

Final Fantasy

One punch man

One piece

Minecraft

Nintendo Characters

Pokemon

That time when I got reincarnated as a slime

Final Fantasy

Captain Underpants

Cuphead

Disney Characters

(You get the idea. I'm literally going to dump all things I know into the fic.)

Will you read it? What do you think will happen?


** Cool stuff just may be a bit big of an idea? I dunno I'm always told that it's quick to burnout when it's ambitious

** I probably wouldn't myself, but that's because I don't know anything about a majority of those fandoms and am only a fan of about three of them, so it'd be completely lost on me regardless of the writing (technical or plotting). I assume someone who knows all of (or at least a majority of) those things probably would be more interested though.

** I read a big long fic that had a lot of inside references and shout-outs to a lot of other fandoms. That was fun. But being an actual crossover mashing them all together? Nah, probably won't work.

*** Well, I'm trying to make it so chaos everywhere. I might even add undertale, since both Harry Potter and Undertale focus a lot on souls. Splitting human souls into 7 makes you immortal, and absorbing human souls makes you immortal.
