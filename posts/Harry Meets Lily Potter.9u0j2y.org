  "Where am I this time?" he mused. The last thing he remembered was biding his daughter goodnight before returning home to sleep. After all at his age he was longer as energetic as before.

  "Harry?"

  He froze. This voice. It haunted his memory filled nightmares and yet he couldn't stop from wanting to hear it again.

  'Could it be?' He turned around and there she was, tears in her eyes with open arms and as beautiful as he always had imagined she would be. Disbelieving he tentatively made a step in her direction. He hoped Lily wouldn't be too distraught.

** *face death in the hope*

Here's one. Time travel but different from the others. It's not a school time Hogwarts in fact James and Lily already have bought their house together I believe. I mostly read it for the fact that Regulus Black is a main character in it. Regulus/Harry in the tags but it hasn't happened yet despite it's length. Ongoing, regular enough updates.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]])

*A storm across time*

I liked this one to begin with but now it feels like it had past when it should have ended. Again, I read it for Regulus even though he's not a main. Harry meets his parents but they don't know who he is. Bit cringe with the whole "Hurricane" thing but it's alright.

*** From your first recommendation, this might be the funniest few paragraphs I've ever read in fanfiction.

#+begin_quote
  “Oh, well, they were. Tom Riddle Sr. and Merope Gaunt.”

  Regulus stares at him for a very long, very awkward moment, before he whirls on his brother.

  “Is this sort of thing not proof enough for you?” Regulus demands. “Because he's been doing this ever since I met him and I'm not sure that the Dark Lord can kill me enough for knowing this sort of thing.”

  “He'll definitely try,” Harry mutters, a little offended and not entirely sure why. “He killed all his living family, more or less. He even framed his uncle for the murder of his father.”

  “Constantly,” Regulus complains to Siirus.

  Sirius just stares back at him, looking between like brother and Harry, looking like he's having difficulty remembering what words are. He looks a bit like he'd like to go and try his luck with the hallway again, but Regulus is looking at him very unhappily and very expectantly.

  “That's... troubling,” Sirius says finally.

  Regulus nods, posture finally slackening as he leans back in his seat, so very relieved that his brother agrees with him that Harry is definitely offended, even if he still doesn't know why.

  “Isn't it?” Regulus says.

  Surprisingly, someone pipes up to agree with him willingly.

  “Very,” Marlene McKinnon says, flicking her wand at the broken cup on the floor. It comes together with sure clicks and settle wholly in the strainer with the crystal ball. “I have never in my life felt so fantastically outdone,” she complains. “How very dare you, Harry Potter.”

***** The author is really rather spectacular at it.

I was starting to think the author was making the mistake of rehashing the "Regulus doesn't X because Blacks don't do that" bit before I realized that it was only ever /Regulus/ thinking things like that and I realized that the author was conveying that Regulus is very... trained. Almost brainwashed into his beliefs about how a person should reflect their family.

It was a real "Oh..." moment.

EDIT: I'm also really beginning to suspect that the author is giving the best portrayal of PTSD in Harry that I've ever seen in fanfiction.

The Last Casualties is probably the best "Harry meets his parents' fanfic in the HP fandom. Lily and James were put into suspended animation by Voldemort rather than killed, and everything happened as canon until Harry's fourth year where the story begins. It's a very good fic that's an excellent mix of character development, action, humor, romance, and interesting plotlines.

*********** The series is about Supernatural immortals who have lived centuries playing a world wide game of king of the mountain where the objective is to take off the others players heads, that is Not a euphemism.

The second movie turns them into aliens who are de-aged, sent to earth and are tricked into playing 'The Game' by a evil Warlord from their alien planet. Did I fucking mention they were FUCKING ALIENS?

This is only accepted as Canon in the second movie alone, in the first, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Two Television Spin offs this isn't canon or even mention at all as a possibility. In fact the rest of the series focuses it self on the magical and mystical nature rather than any Scifi elements.

Many even debate the canon of films 3,4,5 as All Three features the 'End of The Game' in some definite way. In fact it supposedly ends in the first movie. Look when you deal with a clusterfuck of a series you learn real quick that Canon is what you make it

******** The further longer she leave the series the less canonical they become. Essentially everything she has said since Pottermore dropped has been non Canon to me
