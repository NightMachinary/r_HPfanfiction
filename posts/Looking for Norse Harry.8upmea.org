Are there any stories where it connects Harry to Norse Mythology? (Not really looking for Harry and Avengers Crossover) I really want to read a story which has Harry raised by Hela or Harry being raised by the Valkyries.

If anyone knows a story like this, please tell me!


** linkffn(the life he leads) HP has an affinity for the «Northern Magics» that isn't really used by anyone nowadays because [worldbuilding].

** linkffn(5247769) goes heavy into Norse mythology. Although Harry in this story is a bit of an OC and doesn't go by the name “Harry” due to him losing his memory. The world itself includes the gods, Norsemen, and a Harry raised by “The Maiden,” a figure that guards the gate to Valhalla. At least I think it was her? It's been a long time since I read it. The writing style is also really good but it is slash.

** linkffn(Harry Helason; Harry's Siryn)

They are the only two I know about. Both one-shots. Though especially Harry's Siryn is an Avengers crossover, I think they are somewhat worth a read.

I hope there will be more suggestions. It's an interesting concept.

*** All this did was literally tease me into wanting it more. The fact that so much more development could have went into Harry Helason has kinda made me a bit more... passionate (due to lack of better words) about wanting to see a more developed story of the concept

But thanks for the recommendations!

** There's an incomplete story of rather dubious quality where Harry deals with alot of Norse stuff. It's also pretty damn smutty.
