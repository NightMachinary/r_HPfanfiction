Most fics including canon has this evil, crazy Voldemort pushing the pure-blood agenda and attracting followers like crazy. I want a fic that either explores more of Tom Riddle's perspective to make him less of the 'evil' archetype or a different villain that has a less 'evil' agenda.


** You're probably aware of linkffn(on the wings of a phoenix by makoyi) given how many times I post it here, but Voldemort in the story is pretty relatable. He had a wife and a few kids that were accidentally killed by the Order despite being noncombatants. A large part of the story is spent emphasizing the fact that the "bad side" isn't as bad as people think, and that a lot of it is propaganda (both useful, and harmful), and that every side was guilty of war crimes. So Harry has to reconcile the fact that the man who he has been conditioned for years to believe was an evil psychopathic serial killer actually was capable of rational thought, capable of having real friends, and even capable of love.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

*** As much as this is a "classic" I just don't like it. It tries to do too many things without sufficient development. It's a fic I look back to and say meh this is forgettable

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) Voldemort is a main character and while he is still evil and a psycopath, he and everyone on his side is also portrayed as very human in this fic. Unlike most fics where he won the first war, Britain under him is fairly normal and and most people are reasonably happy. There are some morally questionable things and policies going on, but this fic does a great job about making him more of a leader and revolutionary than a crazy evil villain.
