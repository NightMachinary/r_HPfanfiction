Hi guys, so I love to read out loud (aka audiobook style) and as practice and fun I read Fanfictions on my very very small youtube channel. Lately I started on My Immortal, known as the worst Harry Potter fanfiction out there! If you want to check it out yourself I'm leaving a link to the first video. I've made a video for chapters 1-4 and one for 5-9 so far. I did have a lot of fun reading it, it's interesting how something so bad can be so good.

Constructive critismn and sugguestions are always appreciated. Have a magical day guys!

** After that, try reading linkffn(Hogwarts school of prayers and miracles), or linkao3(an English Major's take on hogwarts school of prayers and miracles)

  Do you want your little ones to read books; and they want to read the Harry Potter Books; but you do not want them to turn into witches? Well-this is the story for you! This story has all the adventure of JKR's books; but will not lead your children astray. For concerned mommies everywhere! Blessings! Grace Ann

  Inspired by "Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles" and my experiences with the flock. I look at Harry's how upbringing and school life might have been different if the Dursleys had been 'good Christians.' T for some questionable content and language. Sarcasm is imminent. Somehow became part hurt/comfort despite my best efforts. Please do not use as a guide to killing God.
