So I've just read a thread about a fic called "Quo Vadis" and it made me curious if there are any stories where Harry, whether through being infected with something, possessed, himself, another soul or whatever became something that even Voldemort truly fears, something unholy just like what that thing in Quo Vadis is.


** I'd say linkffn(the art of self fashioning) counts. Voldemort definitely treats Harry as a feared enemy by the end.

** I was just about to suggest quo vadis then i see the text field.

I don't remember the name but I think it may be by Rorschach's circle. The story has hermione find a spell for a mind link but when she and harry do it, it creates a borglike hive mind and Riddle bugs the fuck outta the UK because of it.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way.
