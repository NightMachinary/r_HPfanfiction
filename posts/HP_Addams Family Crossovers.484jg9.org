Looking for some good HP/Addams Family crossovers. Like Perfect Slytherins (jeconias) or Family Values (Ishtar). I've read some of the Harveste Addams series but it's not quite my cup of tea.

Edit: I have no idea how to add flair on mobile.


** There's /When Harry Met Wednesday/, but [[/spoiler][even though it's Harry Potter's body, set in the Harry Potter universe, the personality isn't Harry Potter. The basic premise is that Harry was a twisted little kid, who would have fit in quite well with the Adams Family, but Dumbledore discovered this when he was still a little kid and reprogrammed him into something suitable for the hero Dumbledore needed him to be.]]

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

*** Important note: Harry is a somewhat insignificant side-character for a good portion of the fic, and becomes more of a significant side character as it progresses. It is Hogwarts-centric, but not HP-centric.

** linkffn(Harveste by kyaru-chan) and sequels has Harry be adopted by Addamses, and it does a good job (unlike some others I could name) of maintaining the morbidly humorous atmosphere of /Addams Family/.

  He's done it. He's just five years old, but he's finally done it. The Dursleys are gone. And now he's with a new family who seems just as twisted as he is. How strange.
