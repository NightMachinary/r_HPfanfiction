Can be Canon or AU, it doesn't matter. It can be focused on the Golden Trio, or other characters in the Golden Trio Era

Just wanting to read some nice slice of life-y type of stories featuring those characters.

Can be oneshots/drabbles/multichapters.

There can be plot, I'd just like to have a lot of slice of life moments too.

Would rather it not focus heavily on romance. But I'm okay with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual.

Can be on ANY site, anyone can be the main character.

NO OP Harry, NO Harem Harry, NO Lord Potter stories. Harry slightly more powerful or slightly smarter then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable.

NO Weasley bashing.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

FloreatCastellum has done an excellent job on these one-shots. I think the characters are well-developed and there is a good blend of serious and comical and a few are from really unique perspectives.

(They also have a similar series for the Golden Trio post-Hogwarts and for the Marauders. Their tumblr has all of these listed along with many, many that never got published on ao3 (tumblr is floreatcastellum).)

  Ron Weasley has spent his life overshadowed. So when Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire, he's just not sure how he feels. But he does miss him so very much.

Don't know if you're into Ron/Hermione, but this is one of my all time favorite missing moments fics. It's all the times Ron & Hermione fell asleep with each other.
