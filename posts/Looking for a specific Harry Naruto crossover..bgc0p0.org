** How long ago was is published, what tags did it have, how many chapters total, and was it finished? Edit: because I just spent the past hour coming through FFN for this, but found nothing. Also checked Ao3, and while I don't use it, they didn't pop up under listed pairings.

** I spent some more time attempting to find this, but still no luck. Is there any other details you can give that might help me find it? Like website it was on, how recent it was posted/you read it, anything.
