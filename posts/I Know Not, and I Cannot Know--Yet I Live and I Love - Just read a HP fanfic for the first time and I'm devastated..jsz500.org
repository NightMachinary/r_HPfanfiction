I was not ready for the feels...

That left me in tears like I havent in a long while...

Here's the link to the full story :

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6693841]]

It's about Snape and Luna and the strange, beautiful relationship that grew between them over six years at Hogwarts...

And it was beautiful.

Makes me regret not getting into fanfiction earlier.

By the way, if anyone knows if a French translation of it exists, I'd be delighted, in order to give it to a friend of mine that sadly doesnt speak English.

Anyways... if you havent read it yet, go for it... that was something, really.

Now I'm off to wipe away the tears streaming down my face.


** What a glorious start! That's one of the best fanfiction stories I know about. Let's try what you think about “Puzzle by we-built-the-shadows-here” linkffn(6622580).
