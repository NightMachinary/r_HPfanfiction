** Well there's linkffn(blood crest) in which Harry becomes a necromancer's apprentice, but the fic has barely left the pre-Hogwarts years behind, so all the necromancy in the fic is performed by the master.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

  I took a flying leap through the Veil of Death. Gonna' be honest, not the smartest thing I've ever done. It doesn't help that Death seems to be a bit of a prick... and what's this about me being sent back in time? OOC, fem!Harry, dark!Harry. Elemental and Black Magics. Femslash. Rated M for language, violence, and mature topics.

** Tozette has one - I haven't read it, but she is reliably amazing in all her stuff, so it's a safe bet;

  All Harry knew that day was that his Aunt Petunia had begun to scream. When he came from his cupboard to see what was wrong, he found her sitting pale and distraught on the spotless kitchen tiles. She was gibbering as that evening's three-kilogram chicken dinner did a rather acrobatic tap-dancing lap of the room, squawked loudly, and then fled through the window and out into the back yard.

  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy. Oh, and everyone thinks he's a squib. When it comes to Harry, however, all bets are off and nothing is entirely certain.
