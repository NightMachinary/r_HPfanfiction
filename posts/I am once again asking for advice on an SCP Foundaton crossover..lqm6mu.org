I need some advice on how to write this crossover.

For those of you who don't know, the SCP Foundation is a fictional organization devoted to the Securing Containing and Protecting anomalous objects, entities, and persons. It is one of the largest fictional universes in existence, as its wiki is a collaborative writing site.

The idea I have for the story is that during the Second Wizarding War, the Foundation intervenes, recruiting several members of the Order and Death Eaters into their ranks.

The Foundation had become aware of the Wizarding World sometime in the 1980s. It was first thought to be self-containing and self-protecting, a dream come true for the overworked O5 Council(The ruling body of the Foundation).

That was until 1990, when an anomaly destroyed a large part of Wizarding Moscow, killing hundreds of wizards in the process.

The Foundation attempted to broken an agreement with the ICW through diplomatic channels. While the membership of the Confederation were very impressed at the Foundation's track record of saving mankind and, in some cases, all of reality. They rebuffed their attempts at a mutual defense agreement, however.

The Foundation, realizing that they couldn't just leave an entire world of people without a means of defending themselves against anomalies, decide to instead recruit individual wizards into their ranks. They do this in each nation they find wizards in, from Anchorage to Vladivostok.

When they got to Britain, they found the Death Eaters and the Order, two factions locked in conflict.

They recruit several members of the Order, and stage a false flag attack to recruit several Death Eaters.

My question is this: What is the best way to write this kind of story? How do I write the wizards interactions with Foundation staff? How can the Foundation convince even some Death Eaters to join them?

Any thoughts?


** Knowing the SCP foundation, it would probably end up in a conflict or inflitration of some sort. They are control freaks and will not accept anything less than total control of a massive anomaly like the Wizarding World who have litteral mind control spells, it would probably even be considered too dangerous for them to even make formal contact with the wizarding governments for fear of getting infiltrated.

I could see a nice plot point with wizards getting captured and contained having to escape.

*** That's one view of the Foundation, yes.

First of all, my intention is more 'Wizards working for the Foundation'.

Second of all, THERE IS NO CANON. So its whatever I want it to be. The Foundation is a control freak in one canon, and not one in another canon.

** I mean, there's already wizards in the scp universe. They're called type blues and their magic is more ritual based, but it would probably be easy to adapt HP! wizards as an unusual version of that phenomenon.

**** It's part of the GOC classification scheme- type blacks are actual deities, type reds regenerate, and there's several other types I forgot about. Here's the GOC short story about type blues:

The GOC hub has information about the other classification schemes.

**** It's usually better to go back and edit your own comments, so it's less confusing for other people to read them. I think the foundation would be able to recruit death eaters in the same way they recruit D-class, by offering them reduced sentences in Azkaban. They'd use some well thought out combination of loyalty oaths to ensure cooperation.

I'd say they'd use the less talented death eaters for obliviation services rather than as D-class. It would save on amnestics, and if you take 3000 as canon, it would probably be more acceptable to the ethics committee. The more talented death eaters would probably be useful as consulting researchers (in Rookwood's case) or as a Mobile Taskforce in the case of front-line fighters like the Lestranges.

****** They'd be forced to do so due to the very precisely worded loyalty oaths. I doubt they'd get along with baseline humans at first, but I could see some of them developing a grudging respect for fellow researchers after a decade or so of work at the Foundation.
