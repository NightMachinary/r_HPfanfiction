Long meaning exceeding 5k words per chapter. Hopefully over 100k words.


** For Regulus & time travel, LullabyKnell on AO3 has an incomplete & updating fic called 'face death in the hope.' It's time-traveling Harry/Regulus, but if that pairing turns you away you don't need to worry. It's a (very) slow burn, so it's still platonic and probably will be for quite a while.

  In 1979, Regulus Black goes to destroy a Horcrux, expecting to die in the attempt. But luck and Kreacher's ingenuity keep him alive...which leaves Regulus trying to negotiate switching sides in the middle of a war without getting killed. He hadn't planned past the cave. It's a good thing that both sides can find a use for a spy---isn't it?

** Snily, linkffn(If Someone Cared Enough by Shain-of-Ireland). Just got up to the end of what's written for that one.

Also Snily, but it's been a while since I read it. Has good OCs. Linkao3(The Road Not Taken by kellydofc)

If Someone Cared Enough can be pretty preachy at times, but comes from a good place. It's definitely got a modern feminist strain to it. I find the OCs likeable, even though they are the primary preachers. There's some you're/your problems I've noticed, but the storyline more than makes up for it, imo.

Both are WIPs.

  What if Snape had received some better guidance when he was young from people who cared enough to notice what he was going through and looked deeper than the surface? What if there had been Slytherins who weren't aspiring Death Eaters? Would their assistance be enough to help a few young and hot tempered teens? (Slow burn romance)

  Lily hated that toerag James Potter until suddenly she didn't and they were madly in love. What if it was a love potion?What if she was set free the moment James died?What if that was enough to make her switch sides?(Starts angsty, then gets a bit cracky)
