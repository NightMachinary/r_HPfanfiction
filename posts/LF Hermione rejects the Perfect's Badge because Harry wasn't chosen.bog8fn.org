Harry and Hermione end up doing the job anyway because Ron and Lavender are more interested in making out and abusing their power.

Or any story where people hand in their badge.


** Okay, so I don't have the name of the fic, but is it the one where all the firsties are terrified of becoming Prefects and refer to Harry and Hermione as Mom and Dad? And I think Lavender gets knocked up?

** Well, Ron and Lavender end up as prefects in Divided and Entwined while Hermione starts her muggleborn "support" group and Harry learns how to defeat Voldemort, if you're looking for that.

**** Some peculiarities about the stories from this author:

-Fiendfyre is green. No idea why.

-Obliviators use seers to arrive at the scene of an event right as it happens to cover it up. If you see obliviators, something's going to happen.

-Seamus is a muggleborn in this fic. He's also got a relative in the IRA and a talent for causing explosions.

***** Fiendfyre being green is probably some influence from GOT IMO
