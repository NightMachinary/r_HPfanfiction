#+TITLE: Where do you think the trace comes from? How is it attached. I’m fond of the theory that it’s placed on the wand or placed on the person. Maybe an age line type style magic in diagonal alley since all magical children would go through at some point, most likely before getting a wand.

** The Trace is a plot device that:

- will be bypassed if Tom Riddle uses his uncle's wand to commit murder.
- will always get Harry if he needs to use magic to save his life.
- will never work if Harry actually needs his magic to be detected.

Yes, it's a plot device that has the purpose of making things as difficult as possible for the protagonists and as easy as possible for the bad guys.

Riddle didn't bypass the trace by using his uncle's wand, he bypassed it by performing magic in an area where wizards (Morfinn and Marvolo Gaunt) are registered to live.

*** Then look at from FanFiction/AU point of view where characters aren't plot devices and this isn't either. Regarding Tom riddle, he is said to be a very intelligent wizard while in school, is it impossible he found a way to remove the trace?

**** My headcanon for that incident is that Albus was wrong; Riddle used the Imperius on Morfin from within the Gaunt's shack (where the Trace would be ignored), sending him up the hill to kill his family, then Obliviated him about Riddle being there once he got back. It's a much simpler explanation of the events.

** The trace is confusing... Adult wizards used magic in Harry's house at the start of book 5, but somehow that wasn't detected?? Do adult wizards have a anti trace?

So the trace can't tell if an individual did magic, but it also can't tell if magic was performed in an area that was muggle. Like, it is complete nonsense.

And it isn't like it is a old wives tale to make kids behave, because Harry gets in trouble for it...

** I've sort of been wondering if the trace is just attached to the homes and surrounding area of muggle raised magic users. All the characters get told the trace will get them if they use magic, but no one seems to know how it works. It's also confirmed that the trace doesn't work in wizarding homes bc it can't tell who used the magic. It can't be attached to wands bc then Dobby wouldn't be able to trick the trace. It can't be their bodies or magic, bc again, it was Dobby's body or magic or whatever that triggered the trace. This would also be such an easy explanation for why Riddle could trick it. He didn't use magic in his designated muggle area, so they couldn't tell it was him. The whole "the trace will get you" is probably just a lie to gets kids to be careful that gets supported when muggleborn kids tell stories about getting in trouble for using magic at home. In this scenario, if a muggleborn lived in a 100% nonmagical town, their whole town would be covered with the trace. If there's magic in the area, it probably just covers their home. The wizarding community is so small and condensed that Harry's Trace probably covers most if not all of Little Whinging. The trace most likely doesn't affect purebloods at all and muggleborns could easily circumvent it by just by using magic somewhere that isn't registered as them being the only magical person in the area.

**** I think that is because the trace if highly inaccurate and more of an area sense, like a radar coming from the wand. I think they mention it a few times that if you are in a house with a bunch of people doing magic, it would be hard to tell who cast the spell. Conversely if you are in a house where you are the only magical person and a spell was cast near you, the only explanation can be that it was you. Since a house elf should have no reason to be away from it's master, saying that a house elf cast magic in the house wouldn't work as an excuse.

** Going by cannon events, i'd wager it gets attached when you go to Hogwarts (so you could do magic before you go there or learn magic without going to school if you so wished), and is simply to prevent mishaps from the kids themselves and not for any other reason - thus it simply a check on whether there is an adult wizard in the vicinity when magic is used in proximity of someone with a trace.

Supporting evidence - Hermione in book 1 casts says she practised some spells while she is on the train - and didn't get in trouble for it.Noone gets in trouble for accidental magic as a kid, but i think it is noted that Harry blew up his aunt in book 3 and the Dobby incident is definitely recorded.But in book 5 and 6 there is magic performed in Privet Drive and other places in Harry's vicinity by adult wizards or by him out of Hogwarts (book 6 Horcrux cave, DoM battle) and nothing happens.

Or maybe the young wizards, while having the charm placed on them, they themselves decide whether the rule was violated and that triggers the trace (only they don't know that). Thus anyone having not known there is such thing as Trace could cast all he wants and not be punished, while someone like Harry could get a warning for Dobby's shenaningans because it endangered the statue.

**** Yeah, but she says she tried a few simple spells for practise. She doesn't say when she did it, if she were told not to practise out of Hogwarts, she wouldn't. So it's implied she did it at home - the 'train being a part of Hogwarts' is either fanon or was introduced explicitly later in the series if i recall well.

****** It isn't implied either way, but considering how long it took them to start casting during lessons in Canon I'd wager she had to try at home.

As the text goes it doesn't say or imply either, I've just checked.

** Hmm... Well, you know, I can see the Ministry deciding to keep the exact nature of the Trace a secret, just to make it harder for the kids to find and exploit loopholes. So instead of laying out the exact rules they just keep it as this mystical but vague "the Ministry knows when you do magic in front of Muggles, so don't do magic in front of Muggles" thing, and let the kids' minds fill in the details themselves.

If I'm to speculate... since the Trace seems to be mainly there in order to uphold the Statute of Secrecy, I think it mainly checks to see if there are any Muggles in the vicinity of whatever magic has been cast. If there are, that is counted as "risk of discovery" and letters are sent.

I don't think the Trace is put on the wands, it's more likely that it's put on the kids themselves, just to pick up any magic performed in their vicinity. Since the Trace don't seem to be in effect on pre-Hogwarts students, the easiest solution is that it's centered on Hogwarts, and that by attending Hogwarts the students have the Trace placed on them. Who knows, maybe that's the real reason why first-year students journey to Hogwarts over the lake; that route somehow puts the Trace on them and keeps it there until they're seventeen.
