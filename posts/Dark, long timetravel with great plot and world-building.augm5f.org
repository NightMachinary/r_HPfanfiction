Harry is the one travelling.

I am interested in Marauders' or Founders' Era.


** Turning of the Times by thenoacat seems to fit. Marauder's era, Harry becomes a Ravenclaw there. Long, dark, world-building is present and so is the plot, though I am not sure if it's great. The quality of the writing is super, though.

  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.

** Linkffn(Circular Reasoning by swimdraconian) is quite long, dark (exceedingly so in my opinion but ymmv) and does some amazing world-building via crossovers with the Dresden Files and Abhorsen series. It's abandoned and the plot moves slowly though

Edit: whoops, forgot to mention that it's canon era, my bad

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

Its Jasmine Potter, not Harry, and she goes waaaaaaaay back.

Very well written, one of my favourite fics.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** this has nothing to do with your inquiry and everything to do with cursed child (I hope you find what you're looking for): LONG TIME TRAVEL IS NOT CANONICAL AND THEREFORE CAN'T EXIST IN THE ACTUAL TIMELINE
