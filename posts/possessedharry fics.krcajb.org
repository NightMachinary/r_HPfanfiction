:END:
basically I'm looking for fics where harry is at some point in the story possessed by some form of spirit which proceeds to successfully masquerade as harry for several months, said spirit somehow overtime developing a crush on Hermione.


** I mean, it's not entirely what you asked for, but in linkffn(Five Nights with Harry by Harry Leferts) Harry gets possessed by a spirit named Aya in order to drive out the scar-horcrux. It is a Five Nights at Freddy's crossover, however it is very fluffy and family oriented. There is an already set up love interest, so there's no Harry/Hermione, but it works. It's not entirely what you want, but it is a great story, unfortunately, it's unfinished and hasn't been updated since 2016

*** I've read that one, you'll find the most updated version on spacebattles. unfortunately harry leferts is busy focusing on his kancolle crossover verse fic so it'll probably be a cold day in hell before five nights at Harry's gets updated
