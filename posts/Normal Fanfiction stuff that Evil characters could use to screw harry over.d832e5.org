Pretty much this question:

#+begin_quote
  How would you have Sneaking evil Goblins that have all the stuff that their normal helpful counter parts have Screw Fem!Harry over in the Goblin debt challenge threw the Contract alone?
#+end_quote

But applied to everything that a Normal super!harry gets, but instead of just The normal friendly Golbins stuff being used by their evil counterparts its everything.

Like If Voldemort and his death eater were to do the Time dilation training montage of their own, or if Voldemort were to go to Golblins to take adavntage of their fanfiction super healers.

Or if Voldemort were to got to the Golbins for help in creating a Horcrux and as long as he can pay they take care of everything even kidnapping a person he has to kill to make it.

Pretty much evil character geting all the stuff that Super!harry gets.


** Lucius accidentally delivers the highest of all compliments in goblin culture and now has a loyal army of thousands at his service.

*** Lucius then uses his status as a Goblins Friend to get the Normal goblin assisted Super!harry fanfiction training, But unlike Super!Harry who only does it for himself Lucius also put Draco, Narcissa, and all his Allies threw the Training and uses the Super Golbin healers and Time Dilation to get all the Death eaters who were in Azakban back in shape and sane.

So harry and Co get curb stomped by Lucius and his allies who trained over the summer for a few decades in Time dilation.
