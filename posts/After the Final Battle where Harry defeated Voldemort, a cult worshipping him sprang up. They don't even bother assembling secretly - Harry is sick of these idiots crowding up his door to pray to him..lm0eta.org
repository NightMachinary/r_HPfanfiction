** Harry: I'm not the Savior!

Cult Leader: I say you are, Lord, and I should know, I've followed a few!

Crowd: Hail, Savior!

Harry: I'm not the Savior! Will you please listen?! I'm not the Savior, do you understand?! Honestly!

Woman: Only the true Savior denies his divinity!

Harry: What?! Well, what sort of chance does that give me?! All right, I am the Savior!

Crowd: He is! He is the Savior!

*Harry: Now, fuck off!*

[Silence]

*Cult Leader: How shall we fuck off, oh Lord?*

Harry: Oh, just go away! Leave me alone!

  If someone believed enough, it would come true.Magic needed belief to come true, and what was prayer, what was faith but belief? Of course Harry Woke Up.

** I kinda like the idea of this mixed with the faith/belief background system in the Riordanverse: Harry ends up becoming a minor god due to the magical population's belief in him.

However, because of a Spaghetti Incident crisis going on at the time (this is pre-PJ), he's literally given a brief, semi-distracted five second speech, a manual on "How to be a God" is thrust into his hands, and then he is literally punted out of the Olympians' Throne Room's doors.

Utterly baffled and wondering "what the fuck just happened", he wanders away.

..It's only after the crisis is resolved that they remembered they treated a new god that way, and they're like, "Oh... oops? Anyone know where he wandered off to?"

** I've always been kinda surprised by the total lack of stories where harry leads or is in a cult.

Edit: a cult other than "Wizarding Britain," that is

** Plot twist: Believeing in Harry as a god actually makes him one.
