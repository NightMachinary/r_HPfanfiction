A week or so ago I asked for peoples favorite unfinished stories and got a long list of stories I should read. It would just be depressing. So now I am looking for finished stories that you wish had a sequel. I have a couple. The first is linkffn(Dark Marauder) . I really want to see a Harry raised by this version of the Marauders. I would also like to see The Thorny Rose series or The Butterfly Effect both by Brennus. I love post war stories and I really want to see those versions of Harry and Ginny's lives after the war.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** Revenge of the wizard; browncoat, green eyes; dark marauder(i suggested to the writer he could use his bitterness over breakup of marriage to fuel this story); and, of course, sum of their parts

I'd rather see wand and shield and the perils of innocence get completed more than sequels of completed works

** Even though it's a oneshot, I'd love to see a sequel to /The Last Enemy/ by Luolang, because it's probably the best oneshot I've read and lends itself really well to some kind of continuation (in my mind, anyway) - I'll link it so anyone who's interested can read it.

** Too Young to Die. I'm about 80% sure it ends before the Azkaban Breakout of Book 5, and since Harry is in jail for being a Necromancer and a list of other crimes, so a fic where he joins Voldemort to get a chance at reuniting with his sister would be pretty good.

** /Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire/ by Couldson Eagle (which went down with Portkey) had Hermione take Harry's place in the TWT. If the ending were a little less fixfic, it would have been a set up for a very interesting sequel with a very different character dynamic.

  COMPLETE. Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.

** Personally, I wish Ruskbyte had published the third book in his Order of the Phoenix trilogy. The second book ends on a pretty good note that answers some questions, but the fic also builds up to its last work, and it only has one 2k word chapter.
