Nearly every fanfiction I have ever read that has Harry and the gang (be it the trio, or a new one) become animagi while at school, gives them nicknames. So far, I have not found any I liked. My best example would be from Thanks to a Snake, where they named Harry Bay, Daphne as Snow, Blaise as Onyx, Susan as Chi Chi, Tracey as Cinnamon, Nevile as someone and Hermione was the only nice one which was latin for owl. So are there any good stories with nice nicknames for the animagi?

Generally, whenever a fic overdoes it with something I like to mess around to keep it fresh...

**** For anyone wondering, [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/word-replacer/djakfbefalbkkdgnhkkdiihelkjdpbfh?hl=en-US][here is a link to the extension]].

Go into the options tab, click import, and then paste the following in:

#+begin_example
  {
      "inputN": 4,
      "values": [
          {
              "replaceWith": "Hermione",
              "replaceWithinWords": false,
              "toReplace": "Mione"
          },
          {
              "replaceWith": "Hermione",
              "replaceWithinWords": false,
              "toReplace": "'Mione"
          },
          {
              "replaceWith": "Hermione",
              "replaceWithinWords": false,
              "toReplace": "Mia"
          },
          {
              "replaceWith": "Dumbledore",
              "replaceWithinWords": false,
              "toReplace": "Dumbles"
          }
      ]
  }
#+end_example

If you change replaceWithinWords to true it will cause some issues like Hermione becoming HerHermione.

**** Hermione is such a beautiful and unique name that shortening it to 'Mione' makes it harsh and ugly in my opinion.

**** 'Mione sounds like a mishmash of mean and grimy to me. Or just "my knee rhymes with whiny." I like "Hermione" and think it's pretty.

I just don't think she's a nickname sort of girl. I can see her grumbling that if she was supposed to be called 'Mione then she would have been named that. But she wasn't, so it's Hermione.

**** In my mind "Prongslet" is an acceptable name for Harry, given Sirius' close relationship with the original Prongs. But all the others? No. There's no need for any of them.

** I personally have never found any, and that is mostly because I am under the assumption that it's not doable. Nicknames in fanfiction tend to feel forced. This might be because nicknaming people when I was in school wasn't really done. Also, only the Marauders seem to have nicknames based around the forms. So when Harry and them do it, it usually feels weird, and often in a fic where they are trying to become Marauders 2.0. Which just doesn't work, Harry is not a prankster, and neither are most of his friends.

** I've come across some, but for the most part, they are just sort of fun additions to the story. Like I don't know. Most of the time it doesn't feel natural. But when it's used jokingly or just as if it's not central to much, I enjoy them.

Of course my favorite nickname for Malfoy and Crabbe and Goyle was "Malfoy and the Bookends"

*** If we are including group names my favorite has to be the Order of Flamers instead of the Order of the Phoenix. It was perfect because the whole concept of the fic was each person was extremely flamboyant.... Sadly, I have not found it again nor do I remember the title..

** I'm not particularly attached to a given nickname, but there was a fic that had an interesting naming convention. I forget which fic, but it had Padfoot explain to Harry that no, he can't pick his name, the others make up weird nicknames and the first one he accidentally responds to sticks. I think he ended up being called Tufts?

** Dumbles Lord of Lemon Drops, Order of the Fried Chicken, Mione, Hadrian, Drake, Nym, Ice Queen, Gred, Forge, Moldy-Shorts, Death Nibblers. Just kidding they are the worst. Nicknames in fanfiction are always going to sound forced as we, the reader, are not likely to be the same age as the characters making up the names thus we don't have the same perspective.
