Because if so, there's a pretty easy way to gain total world domination. Simply imperius someone, then instruct them as follows:

"Imperius someone who isn't already imperiused, except me. Avoid detection. Tell them the same. Repeat."

Exponential growth will ensure that the country is imperiused at the end of the week, and the entire planet in the next month or two.


** Yes, that is canonical, isn't it? Madam Rosemerta imperiused Kate Bell to bring the cursed necklace to Hogwarts, didn't she?

** Yes! It is canon! :) Malfoy imperius'd Rosemerta to Imperius Katie. So Imperius chaining is canon. :) :) I think that is also how they got to the Minister in Deathly Hallows? They chain Imperius'd people until they could Imperius Thicknesse?

*** I'd imagine that as you go further down the chain control becomes less and less powerful. It would be like a game of telephone through the imperious chain

** Yes, but the quality suffers. While Madame Rosmerta was Imperiused very well, she behaved exactly like normal, Katie behaved strangely and zombie like.

That's either due to the lack of skill in the curse by Rosmerta or the fact that every next link in the chain is weaker.

Either way, it's not a feasible way of conquering the world.

*** I guess it would vary based on how many people you could hold it on if it still works, but not as well or smoothly.

If I get you and tell you to go use it on your girlfriend and send her to me, if I can cast it on many people then I'd just need to refresh it on her and give her new commands.

** u/fuckwhotookmyname2:
#+begin_quote
  "Imperius someone who isn't already imperiused, *except me*.
#+end_quote

this does lead to a very interesting question, What happens if you imperious someone and tell them to imperious you?

*** I hope you gave very detailed instructions for them to give to yourself. Intent + vagueness interpreting the same orders from two perspectives could create some... interesting results.

** Yes, but it is very risky, as while the original caster can have full control of the first victim, only that part of the first victim's mind which is fully subdued will be focusing on mainting the spell, which means that you very rapidly get to a state where the focua on the spell is so weak with continued iterations that it becomes impossible to maintain.
