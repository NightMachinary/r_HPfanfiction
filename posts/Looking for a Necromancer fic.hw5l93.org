:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I forget the circumstance but Harry makes his way to Potter Manor and the portraits of his ancestors inform him (or maybe harry makes the connection and they confirm it?) that the 3 Peverell bros were infact just powerful Necromancers and that it's like their duty to safeguard the cloak. However this only upsets Harry, and he rejects them thinking that they were hiding/being weak. Harry vows to be a true Necromancer. There were a lot of other things going on in the fic but i can't recall anything. this scene just has sort of stuck with me. Pretty sure it was WIP and likely abandoned because i think the scene was closer to the end of the fic.

But also if Y'all have any cool Necromancer fics please recommend!

#+begin_quote
  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy. Oh, and everyone thinks he's a squib. When it comes to Harry, however, all bets are off and nothing is entirely certain.
