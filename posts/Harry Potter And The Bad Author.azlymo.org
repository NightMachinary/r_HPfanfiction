The protagonist is the normal Harry Potter, the one from the books. Nothing is different about him. Everything is as normal as the Harry Potter backstory is, but that changes when he gets his first year letter. Countless situations and cliches like that of a bad author pile up, opportunities left and right. Harry, being the boy he is, runs away and tries to ignore them. The bad author is trying to make Harry the OP MC, and it can do anything to anyone except Harry. Harry cannot be altered in any way by the author.


** I swear I've read a story like that with Harry determined not to be a MC in a story. I could be mixing it up with another fandom with the same concept though. This seem familiar to anyone else?

*** Reminds me of that short comic about a girl with pink hair dodging anime plot threads. Like how she sits in the middle of the classroom to avoid the 'by the window' stereotype, and how she's constantly having to deal with transfer students and mcguffins.

Here you go. Only 2 pages, it's mostly a joke.
