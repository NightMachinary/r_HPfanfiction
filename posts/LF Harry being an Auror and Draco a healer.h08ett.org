:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi guys,

There was this fic where Harry was an Auror (I think) and always getting into suspicious "accidents" or finding suspicious things that have him sent to St. Mungos, where he always has to deal with Draco. It's Drarry at the end, I think. Does anyone know that fic?

Thank you!!

Edit: I think I remember Harry having a replica of a p*nis in his office and his colleagues pranking him with it?


** I have read one, where Harry is a Quidditch player getting into accidents with Draco being the healer... But I do not remember its name...

** I haven't read this, but healer Draco and Auror Harry is quite popular. There are nearly 180 fics [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=kudos_count&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Healer+Draco+Malfoy%2CAuror+Harry+Potter&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=Draco+Malfoy*s*Harry+Potter][tagged]] with 'Healer Draco Malfoy' and 'Auror Harry Potter' in AO3.

  After transferring to the Apparition Department, Harry's life becomes one big dick joke. And all his friends are arseholes. So is Malfoy, but what else is new? AKA Harry Potter and the eighteen twenty dicks.
