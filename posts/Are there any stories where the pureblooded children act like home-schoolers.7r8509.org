Those of us who went to public school can point out a home-schooled kid in less than ten minutes of conversation. Considering that there seems to be no elementary/primary school in the wizarding world, the pureblooded kids should be...kinda weird.


** are you an american ? i guess in that case you cant tell me how many children are homeschooled in the uk. is there a Brit who can answer ? thanks

*** Basically, when children are homeschooled, the generally aren't socialized very well. In other words, they're weird. OP is asking for fics that play with the idea.

Wait but I guess your just asking generally how many British kinds get homeschooled. Disregard my above explanation!

**** I think you are kind of prejudiced here regarding effects of home-schooling.

Research tends to point the opposite way in fact - home schooled kids tend to have much better social skills (and academic skills) which shouldn't be that much of a surprise since they tend to spend a lot more of their time socializing with adults.

Here is a summary article on the topic which mentions studies and some sources - the social aspect is examined in the later half of the article.

[[http://www.educationandbehavior.com/what-does-research-say-about-homeschooling/]]

tl,dr - acting 'like home-schoolers' would normally translate to 'acting like kids a few years older than they actually are as compared to skills going to public school'.

Granted, OP is correct that to a public school kid, a same age kid that's acting more maturely than the norm would seem weird

***** My evidence is pretty anecdotal, I can only go off vague memories and this one kid who told me:

"I was homeschooled, and I was smarter than everyone, but i was a fucking weirdo. It took me forever to figure out how to talk to people"

But hey if the research says they're well socialized, then they are.

****** when it comes to personal experience like that, important to remember that home-schooling takes skills and discipline that by far not every parent can pull off.

I actually considered trying home-schooling my kid after looking over research regarding academic/professional outcomes (which basically mostly conclude that unless you are Ivy League family, home schooling is much better on average), but when I did research on how that's to be done properly I realized that neither I nor my wife are disciplined enough to do it right and don't feel like trusting that I will 'learn on the job'.

But to further clarify a bit about home-schooling, keep in mind that in vast majority of the cases, it does not mean 'the kid stays home, only talks to parents, never sees other kids'.

More often how home schooling is practiced is parents who want to do that form little clubs - so the kids learn from one or a few parents within the group in what amounts to a class of like a dozen kids or less, studying together in home environment. Obviously in such a case they each get a lot more personal attention from adults vs. public school, and their days tend to be more closely overseen and organized.

********* Parents are I think Catholic, but they're not really religious (never had to go to church and never really forced their religious beliefs on me). My parents chose to homeschool me because they did not want me to be part of the school system and after my experiences with friends who have chosen to go to high school i'm actually pretty happy with their choices. I did not have to study for external exams because I started taking concurrent enrollment classes at a community college at age 16. I currently have an AA degree from that college (I'm 19). Absolutely, i'd call it abuse if you are not having your kid go out and socialize. In my case there were various homeschool groups around and I spent time hanging with kids there. Overall, My parents really let me make my own choices for what I wanted to do and let me learn at my own pace which is great. Sorry for the delay, I don't log in to this account too much.

****** A lot depends on the parents or tutors doing the teaching. Some parents do basically lock their children away from the world, which causes poor socialization. Other parents make a point to socialize their children. Often, there are homeschool groups in communities for sports, music, arts, and other types of activities.

Given the pure blood mentality, where many of them likely only marry other purebloods, it wouldn't surprise me if they met up as children before going to Hogwarts. But hey, who knows!

**** There was this one family at my high school that was homeschooled for elementary and middle school... They were all super popular, all three made valedictorian, and the youngest brother was Homecoming King AND Prom King even though he didn't play football... In Texas. I'm not sure what homeschoolers you've met, and my anecdotal evidence doesn't count any more than yours does, but let's say that at least they cancel each other out.
