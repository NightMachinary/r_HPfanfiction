Posting for a friend: I once read a very well-written HP fanfiction on ff.net in which Voldemort returns despite losing his Horcruxes, and Harry returns to the past to stop him...in his 4th year. However, I have never been able to find this fic again. Does anyone know a story with the following story elements?

- Harry accidentally time travels to his fourth year
- Harry/Ginny pairing: Harry asks Ginny to the Yule ball
- Hermione/Ron pairing: Ron asks Hermione to the Yule ball
- Ron does not turn on Harry after the TWT
- Draco becomes “good” after Harry shows him Pensieve memories of what Voldemort is really like
- Draco teaches Harry to dance
- In the future, Voldemort and Bellatrix rise as undead...things, and destroy Diagon Alley

The fic was about 14 chapters long, and unfinished, when I last read it. Would appreciate any help identifying it.
