Just something that breaks with the stereotypes of the moody, angst-ball, and cold protagonist that seems so wide-spreed when the character uses the dark arts.


** An Old and New World is a fairly good fit (full fic at ff2ebook archive).

** To me, the Miranda Flairgold story A Second Chance of Life has a serious, Dark Magic using Harry that still is lighthearted enough to make new friends.\\

  AU - Harry defeats Voldemort in fifth year, so why is Dumbledore now dead set on sending him to Azkaban? The lies force him to take matters into his own hands. Now he's after revenge and it starts with the aurors trying to take him to the horrific prison. For some reason Snape is one of he few he doesn't kill. Time travel. No romance or pairs.

** An evil goof ball who has no problem killing anyone who gets in his way but is actually really laid back, no I swear he didn't kill you because you annoyed him or anything!

Your request seems to be contradicting itself. Dark magic is entrail expelling magic, bone breakers etc, it's not goofy and laid back by design, you'd be a messed up person or 'edge lord' of whatever to use it. Or evil. But not really goofy and laid back.

I doubt you'll find what your looking for because I don't think it can exist. Or if it does it would be a bad story. How can you be a Bad ass mf who kills people with dark magic and be a laid back goof??? Maybe a psychopath or an insane!Harry?

MoD!Style resurrection / dimensional dump, he ends up in one of the NYC burroughs with the sword of gryffindor, a healing factor and an attitude. I'm pretty sure its a oneshot, he wakes up in some alley and ends up hanging out as a mercenary in a bar.

  Death offers his Master a way to escape from the forces controlling him in the wizarding world.Harry probably should've asked for a better explanation on just what Death was going to do to him in the process.And what the f*3% is a mutant?

*** I don't know dude. That pretty much describes Claudia from the Dragon Prince, goofy and dangerous.

And it really depends on what exactly constitutes dark magic. Obviously it takes a psychopath to bind innocents against their will and torture them, but I don't see much wrong with reanimating already dead corpses or genetic experimentation.

*** Frankly, I was thinking something more along the lines of: “Harry was walking the corridors in a enthusiastic conversation with Lavander about an exposition at Teen Witch of one of his favorite singer.

‘So Lav, there is no way possible that the weird sister are better, there sound is good, I admit, but they just don't have the same depth in their lyrics, you know' said Harry animated while making gestures with his hands.

‘Yeah, Harry, I know from where you are coming from, but you've got to admit that in the matter of knowing how to play an instrume-‘

‘POTTER!' Yelled an furious Dolores Umbridge, ‘This is the last straw, how dare you ignore your detention, I will see you expelled for-‘

‘Crucio, what were we saying, oh yes, you are kind of right in this, but you see, there is more to a good music than only what you can get from an instrument, art in any form has a certain depth, something that you see and can't help but relate, you know?' Continued Harry ignoring Umbridges screams, and hooping without a care in the world at the side of a suddenly pale and wide-eyed Lavander.

‘Y-y-yes, Harry, guess you are right' said Lavander.

Harry looked at Lavander and scrunched his eyes in confusion over Dolores agonizing screams with a confused expression in his face

‘Lav, you feeling alright, you seem kind of pale all of a sudden'

‘J-j-j-ust fine Harry, really, y-y-you don't need to be worried'

‘Oh, well, if you are certain' shrugged Harry.

Lavander looked at the twitching form of Umbridge and against her better judgment decided to ask.

‘S-s-say Harry' she started ‘w-won't y-you get in trouble because of...' she asked looking at the the woman/toad hybrid.

Harry as if only now remembering of his use of an unforgivable looked at Umbridge's form with surprise.

‘Oh, I knew I was forgetting something, thanks Lav, obliviate' said him carelessly throwing the spell over his shoulder ‘can you believe she still hasn't clued on me erasing her memory all the time? Man and I'm not even particularly good at this, just now I've sort of managed to not erase her capacity of moving her arms, so, fancy getting something to eat at the kitchen, I could do with a sandwich.'”
