I am not the biggest Ron fan and think he could be a bit insensative (aka human) but I found myself a bit at odds with the way JK protayed Ron in Goblet of fire. I always thought that after all the 'adventures' they had Ron would be quick to believe Harry would not put his name in the goblet. I get that he would be jealous but to actively turn his back on Harry does not sound like Ron at all. I think Ron can be a bit insensitive, and not think things through but he is loyal, and smart.

P.s I always thought he'd make a good chef too.


** I think we often forget that Harry was actually disappointed he couldn't enter. The movies had him say "rather you than me" but in the book he earnestly agrees with Ron that it would be cool to be a triwizard champion.

It's not so much jealousy of Harry being a champion, but that it was something they both wanted to do and it appears as though Harry found a loophole and didn't share it with him. Ron knows he will always be in Harry's shadow, just as he will always be in the shadow of his brothers. Like many arguments, it's about something much more.

Don't get me wrong, it's shitty. But he's an angry, 14 year old boy. Teenagers are not always the most patient, sensitive, self aware creatures.

*** Harry fantasizes about doing it, but he never really tells Ron anything. I'm not wholly convinced that he'd try even if there wasn't an age line.

#+begin_quote
  “What d'you reckon?” Ron asked Harry. “Be cool to enter, wouldn't it? But I s'pose they might want someone older. . . . Dunno if we've learned enough. . . .”

  “I definitely haven't,” came Neville's gloomy voice from behind Fred and George.

  [...]

  “I might go in for it, you know,” Ron said sleepily through the darkness, “if Fred and George find out how to . . . the tournament . . . you never know, do you?”

  “S'pose not. . . .”

  Harry rolled over in bed, a series of dazzling new pictures forming in his mind's eye. . . . He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was seventeen . . . he had become Hogwarts champion . . . he was standing on the grounds, his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were applauding and screaming . . . he had just won the Triwizard Tournament. . . .

***** I think it was more about him feeling helpless. He can't help them find Horcruxes, he was injured for a time (so he was holding them back by keeping them from apparating), he was one more mouth to feed despite himself not being able to contribute, and he was sitting around waiting for nothing while everyone he cares about is in danger.

** Yeah I never really liked that. I mean come on Ron; you know that Voldemort and Death Eaters have been after Harry, ever since he defeated their precious master back then on that fateful October night; how is it so hard for you to believe that someone wouldn't try and get him into a tournament; that's so dangerous, that people could die from it?!

I love Ron as well; and feel like he's often under written, I just really dislike how Rowling wrote him in several different places, like he's someone who's into chess, he thinks ahead when he plays chess; you have too, in order to win; so why not use that to your advantage? Just feel like that was an unfortunate waste.

I love Rowling; but yeah, more than once I was disappointed by how she wrote something.

Voldemort is a spirit who, according to Harry, burned up when he touched his body. That's what Ron knows.

None of the Death Eaters had ever made any attempt on Harry's life until that point.

** One other thing- in the follow up to the fight, Ron's not joining in with the jeering. And Harry's always the one escalating the situation further- he literally snarls at Ron in the aftermath of the floo talk with Sirius and mocks Ron after throwing the badge at him. So even when there are potentially overtures from Ron to mend their relationship before the First Task, Harry's the one stomping them down.

** The adventuring and overshadowed by his siblings thing largely covers it, plus Harry, Ron, and basically everyone other than Hermione actually wanting to/being excited to enter the tournament before Halloween. Their disagreement lasts less than a month, he's 14, and he quickly comes around when he sees the danger firsthand. And canonically, Harry isn't the greatest friend and is partially responsible for the fight. We basically go through the series from his perspective, he doesn't really communicate well with others in general.

Remember that, from Ron's perspective, he doesn't know that this is a serious plot situation^{TM}

#+begin_quote
  "Listen," said Harry, "I didn't put my name in that goblet. Someone else must've done it."

  Ron raised his eyebrows.

  "What would they do that for?"

  "I dunno," said Harry. He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, "To kill me."
#+end_quote

At this point, Harry is already aware that something is going on with Voldemort from his visions AND that "Moody" thinks that the Goblet was hoodwinked in a murder attempt. Ron literally doesn't have that context, and Harry doesn't tell it to him, hence his heightened feelings of jealousy and betrayal.

And they even had an earlier conversation about how they might get their names in the Goblet.

#+begin_quote
  “Bet some of them put it in last night after we'd all gone to bed,” Harry said. "I would've if it had been me ... wouldn't have wanted everyone watching.”
#+end_quote

Then during their fight, Ron brings up exactly what Harry said earlier.

#+begin_quote
  "Yeah, okay," said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as Cedric. "Only you said this morning you'd have done it last night, and no one would've seen you.. . . I'm not stupid, you know."

  "You're doing a really good impression of it," Harry snapped.
#+end_quote

Harry's the one who's escalating the situation here. Obviously he's not fully responsible either- he's a panicked 14 year old, etc.- but Ron's reaction is far from unreasonable. Keep in mind that at the beginning of the fight, Ron is actively trying to fight down any jealousy and put up a positive front, trying to be happy for his friend.

** I had a random thought the other day that in hindsight the idea that Ron runs out on Harry twice feels a bit dated when it gets to DH so it would almost have more symmetry if Hermione was the one to walk out on Harry in GoF.

It could have worked too; Hermione is also conspicuously absent during the after goblet draw 'Party' when Harry gets back to the common room, and Ron could feasibly be waiting to talk in the dorm to speak to Harry in private as he was. The scene could be Ron believing Harry absolutely, and Hermione falling out with him in a similarly teenage fashion the next day; perhaps Hermione as strictly rule abiding is not pleased with Harry appearing to enter himself?

Obviously the main problem would be the scene where Hermione gets hit with the tooth growing jinx and later ensuring Harry could learn the summoning charm properly without Hermione to help him - but those could have been worked around - and Harry finding out about the dragons would have been less convoluted with Charlie being Rons brother.

It would have made Rons 'betrayal' (or perhaps I should say abandonment) of Harry more of a surprise in DH and help balance out the discrepancy between Ron's and Hermione's friendships with Harry.

Just a thought

** I actually didn't mind the disagreement Ron had with Harry in GoF. It was completely believable. OotP has him defending and backing up Harry which is awesome too.

It's in DH where I was annoyed, not with Ron, but JK's writing for having to create that fight because he's scared Harry and Hermione might get together. Don't get me wrong, it's entirely plausible, but I feel it was slightly unnecessary in the context of the story.

Hermione is always portrayed as being the ultimate loyal friend even in GoF. This would have been a perfect place for Hermione to get annoyed because of the Horcrux and maybe blow up at Harry while Ron tried to calm the situation. Hermione grew up with 3 full meals a day too and it would make sense that the Horcrux affected her badly. It would have cemented the fact that both Ron and Hermione are equally important to Harry despite their disagreements.

*** This one I actually see as possible. Weirdly enough, this could happen from a combination of fear for his family (he might be jealous of them but the Weasley are a close knit family so he will worried), the stress and discomfort of being on the run (not being in a place that they are used to can stress the human body out a lot. Even vacations can cause it) and the heightened emotions, all of this multiplied by the locket and it's 'evil' aura led to Ron leaving. I was much more shocked that Hermione didn't also burst even if they portray her has have better control over her emotions.

I'm rambling and sleep deprived, in case something doesn't make sense.

**** I did mention that it's entirely plausible. I just felt that plot point unnecessary and would've been better used if Hermione were to blow up. It would be so out of character for her and we would know vividly that it's the Horcrux 's doing.

It would also even the odds as both Hermione and Ron would've had their disagreements with Harry at least once. Harry already did with the both of them during OotP. This would've showed that all three of them are equal and necessary to each other.

And not to mention, reduce the Ron-bashing as Ron would've stood up for Harry.

** Take this combination of characteristics and you have Ron:

- He lives in the moment, enjoying the now. He doesn't think very deeply about the future.

- He forms opinions and sticks to them even if he forgets why he has those opinions.

- He's he's not afraid of pissing off people people with no authority or power over him.

This results in a guy who's fun to hang out with but is incredibly dense and prone to being butthurt over stupid shit.

** Nah...(Mo-)Ron was blinded by being a jealous little bitch!

Harsh? Maybe, I admit I don't like the character (IMHO he's useless! Good for comical relief only!)!

Seriously, Ron has the only thing Harry really wants:

A family with parents, maybe siblings (We don't really know if Harry would want any, but we know he wants his parents from the Mirror of Erised!), a home!

Ron who has all this however wants something else (without wanting to lift a finger to achieve it!):

Ron wants money, fame, recognition (He doesn't want to be "just another Weasley") - but sadly Mr. Ronald Billius Weasley doesn't even try to become something special! Hell, he doesn't even have a special skillset like his brother Charlie who is probably good with animals and Bill who probably is quite good at all things magic (he's a curse-breaker and learning how to crack a ward or a curse can't be all that easy!)

And he did this at 13, showing much more bravery than many adults would in that situation.

Let's not forget 12-year-old Ron, the year prior, venturing into the Forbidden Forest with Harry to face his worst fear because he wanted to save his friends and the school. He knew they were going after spiders, he hates spiders, and they're all well aware of how dangerous the forest is, and Ron bloody well did it anyway.

Probably should've just stopped reading when you went to "Mo-Ron" tbh
