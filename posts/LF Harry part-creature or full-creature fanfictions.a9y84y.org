i just read linkffn(7238855) and i was hoping there would be more like it,

​

what i'm looking for is a fanfiction where harry either due to Inheritance, accident or deliberately becomes either a full or part-creature (no werewolf, dragon or basilisk though) and where he studies The Dark Arts

​

He must become powerful, i don't care if he becomes OP as long as it's well written

​

Can contain Bashing of or indifference to : Dumbledore, Order of The fried Turkey, weasly, snape and hermione

​

Please no Slash, draco/Hermione/daphne or ginny pairing or light/evil Harry Preferably dark(but not evil) harry
