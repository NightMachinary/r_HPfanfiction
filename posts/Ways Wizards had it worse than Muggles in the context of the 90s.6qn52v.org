I have read so many fanfics where Harry/Hermione feel that the wizarding world is backward and point out that muggles have progressed far better than them. Never understood the scenario, Ofcourse Wizards don't have cars,guns,aeroplanes but they don't need it do they. Here's a thing. Let's say I am writing a fic where Lucius Malfoy is banished from the Wizarding world and sent to the muggle world. Is there something which can truly astound him aside from comps. Not even sure if computers and the Internet were that advanced in the 90s

** One of the weirdest thing in such fics is how wizards and witches bow down to might of muggles after seeing movies (often star wars) in cinema. Wizards and witches have moving pictures in their NewsPapers and photos. They have portraits that can store consciousness of their people. They can watch 3D memories of each other with sounds and all. I'm sure they have something at par, or better, than moving pictures with sounds in cinema.

Most of this comes from Weasely inspired writers though. They saw Arthus fascinated with muggle technology. I find his behavior toward muggles something like 'Wow! So they figured this out, finally. Let's see what else they have made to compensate for their shortcomings' kind of thing.

I know I'm exaggerating about Arthur but he really seems like someone who is fascinated by muggles finally figuring something out instead of getting awed by technology.

I guess their technical devices work much better than television. However, the production money for 'movies' will be lower. If your country has a few thousand people, you are not going to hire fifty actors for half a year to record a 'movie'.

PS: I am now thinking how people avoid porn making from themselves. With pensieves, this should be very easy, even without consent of the other.

** I feel like the Muggle world did have advantages, even during the 90s; they just wouldn't be advantages that would leave the average wizard thinking "Wow! How did I ever live without that?”

It'd be stuff like Encarta. For a short window there before search engines and what was available online really took off, it filled this unimaginable gap of a searchable encyclopedia. But I remember people not really caring about the software cause physical encyclopedias "weren't going anywhere". Hermione and other similarly academic people would love to get their hands on it, but the average wizard wouldn't care.

It all comes down to wild guessing, but I think Muggle medicine could be full of untapped potential. Stuff like dragon pox was still extremely deadly at least recently enough to kill Abraxas and James' parents, and to incapacitated a quidditch team in 2014. There's no way to know if they're comparable, but small pox was considered "eradicated" by the WHO as of 1980. Do wizards even have vaccines?

** How about cuisine and fashion? I don't know if this can really leave the wizard in awe, but some inputs here would be nice.

The older wizards and witches probably couldn't care less about what they wear, as evident in canon, the younger generation however, can't be contented with robes and pointy hats, no? As well as the way they dress obviously isn't so out of place in the muggle world, so they have to care for muggle fashion to some degree.

I don't know much about cuisine, since the elves at Hogwarts seem to be able to cook fantastic dishes, but how about new muggle dishes? How about fast food, pizza and such? I saw many fanfics used this to 'impress' the pureblood kids. Teens dig that, no?

** Going back to Muggle world doesn't mean they had to give up magic! They could cast all the spells they wanted behind closed doors. Household chores appeared to be one of the most ANNOYING things in Muggle life, and they could perfectly use magic without much worry here. Given experiences in HBP and DH, the Ministry seemed to have very limited means to detect magic in Muggle world.

We already have [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6pxd4b/discussionrequest_wizardsharry_taking_advantage/][a discussion about how to rip off Muggles]] a couple days ago, and it seemed that nothing in the Canon prevented them from doing so. The exchange rate from Galleon to Pound also looked super favorable at 5:1 during the 90s.

What sucked most in Wizarding Britain wasn't so much about missing certain Muggle entertainment, but almost exclusively about its government and the establishment. They stunk beyond recognition.
