title pretty much says it all, I'm looking for some pure comedy gold, anything that will just leave you in stitches laughing =p whether it's pure snarky Harry, the Marauder's "Great Hufflepuff Panty Raid", M*A*S*H* style back and forth pranks and assorted physical humour, 4th-wall-breaking, or whatever, just anything 5 Star comedy =D

edit: finished off all the fics that have been recommended already here, anyone have any more suggestions?

Harry Potter the Geek was excellent

Like a Redheaded Step Child was another excellent suggestion :P had quite a few good chuckles there

and The Unexpected Animagus still has me chuckling as I just finished reading it, although I do wish there was more of it and it wasn't abandoned :P


** It's semi-serious, actually, but linkao3(proof by novensides) is funny in a very subtle way.

Definitely not split-your-sides hilarious.

** linkffn(10677106) 7th Horcrux. A classic. Harry is Voldemort, and Voldemort became Voldemort because of a misunderstanding.\\
linkffn(11691332) So How Can I Weaponize This? - an SI. I needn't tell you what kind of shenanigans can an SI do in a HP setting if he's motivated enough.\\
One of the quotes to convey the slight insanity:\\
"/What's in the Chamber of Secrets?/\\
An old Soviet Tank i purchased. It flies."\\
linkffn(9807593) Harry Potter, The Geek - shifted timeline to more modern times. Harry delves into the depths of the internet during his holidays between 4th and 5th year. Aside from a few slightly cringy moments at the beginning it's an overall hillarious experience.

linkffn(10287864) Biting the hand that feeds you. Ministry of Magic tries to appease the Dark Lord. It doesn't work and tanks the economy of the wizarding world. As a bonus, it has one of the best Malfoy character arcs i've ever seen.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/892382]] Zero to Hero by Dysonrules is a comedy about 8th year and the students are putting on the Disney play Hercules. Draco as Meg is hilarious. It is Drarry and fluffy.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/761095]] Letters from Dr Malfeasant also by Dysonrules

Another Drarry comedy in letter style. Told by Draco writing letters to Pansy about trying to be a criminal mastermind. It's short and funny.

#+begin_quote
  "Alright. What are you doing now?"

  "I'm reading my textbook, Professor."

  “You have it under your feet, Mister Potter."

  “Yes?"

  “Do you have eyes on your feet?"

  “No, Professor. Besides, the book is closed anyway."

  “So how are you reading it?"

  “Very well, thank you."

  “Detention, Mister Potter."

  “I'll bite," Hari's eyes were still closed. "Why?"

  “Disrespect, Mister Potter."

  “I said 'thank you', Professor. Besides, you can't give me detention tonight. I'm already going to be not attending detention with Professor Snape." He paused. "I suppose I could work you in also, though. I guess it's not much harder to fail to attend two detentions than one."
#+end_quote

---This is cause at a young age Harry was given the Byakugan, which lets one see through solid objects within a certain radius. Including behind oneself.

also

#+begin_quote
  "Two attacks, Professor?"

  “You threw a needle into his eye earlier today!"

  “No I didn't, Professor."

  “He said you did!"

  “And I say I didn't." Hari looked confused again. "So that means the vote is even and it needs to go to a third party? Perhaps Professor McGonagall can help?"

  “You did it!"

  “If you say so, Professor. But in that case, I must report that Malfoy attempted to disembowel me six times during the class."

  “NO HE DIDN'T!"

  “I say he did. That's proof, right?"

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion; Harry Potter and his Veela Mate; Harry Potter, Unexpected Animagus by DWDuck)

The first is simply hysterical and is an absolute classic. The second uses some elements from the first and is a bit different, and is somewhat more serious. It does have some great scenes in it though. The last is quite sadly abandoned, however it too has some genius scenes in it.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

  A Harmony story. Hermione is a Veela and discovers this shortly before their fourth year. What will Hermione's new powers do to alter Harry's fourth year? Warning- there's Ron-bashing ahead. If you dislike Ron-bashing, don't read.

  With the love of a good woman, Harry becomes more confident and learns to handle the embarrassment that comes from being a teenage boy as well as an unexpected animagus. Set during the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Severe Ron bashing ahead.
