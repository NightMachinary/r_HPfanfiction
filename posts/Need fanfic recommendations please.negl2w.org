Hi guys!

I love reading Hermione x Sirius time travel fanfics. I prefer ones the begin around the 1st year for the marauders and have at least 60 chapter. I have already read debt of time and reaching across time.

I also don't mind ones with crazy, unique plots like marriage law or something like that but I prefer these to be shorter.

please help me find some good fanfics!
