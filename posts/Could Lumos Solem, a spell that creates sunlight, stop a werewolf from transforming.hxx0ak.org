Hear me out before spouting "IT WaSN't iN THE bOOkS!", please. The moon is still up by the time the sun gets up and it is already up by the time it the sun goes down and werewolves only transform back and forth at sunset and sunrise, so, clearly, the sun overrides the moon in the Lycanthropy Curse. Therefore, technically, Lumos Solem should be able to prevent the transformation or even change them back to their human form while the light created by the spell hits them, right?

Have I found another 'cure' to Lycanthropy? Alternatively, could an underground space made entirely by undetectable Expansion Charms and hermetically walled off by silver be able to prevent the transformation?


** No, because the werewolf transformation is triggered by the full moon, not by the absence of sunlight.

The book and movie both made the stupid error of having Lupin transform when the moonlight hit him on that one night, directly contradicting how even canon says the transformation works. If this was the case, then it could be mitigated by locking afflicted people in windowless dungeons to prevent them from transforming. It says right in the story that it doesn't happen that way, and that a locked up werewolf attacks themselves in the absence of any other prey.

Werewolves transform when the full moon rises which, by definition, is sunset because a full moon means the sun and moon are on opposite sides of earth.

(Which, incidentally, is ONE night out of every twenty-eight. I will nope out of a story that talks about the three nights of the full moon. The full moon is, scientifically, a specific /time/ when the sun and moon are in full opposition.)

*** I always assumed they left the shrieking shack at an incredibly (in) convenient time, just as the moon rose.

**** O.o I'm constantly astounded at little bits of ignorance like this.

I once saw a fanfiction (don't even remember the pairing now) that I closed after reading one character saying, "My love for you is as pure as that of Lancelot for Guinevere." So, as pure as infidelity and adultery?

** Better question: could it kill a vampire? Is it even actual sunlight, magically speaking, or just a really bright light?

*** I strongly doubt sunlight could kill vampires, thats an attribute of them that was created by movies. Rowling's worldbuilding is usually more based on folklore, in which vampires are mearly nocturnal.

*** I don't think we're really given any actual information about vampires. So I'm not sure if they even have any particular weakness associated with sunlight. The vampires in my story are more like truly higher vampires from the Witcher, so it would be a no, in my case.

** I feel it depends on what a person thinks causes the transformation.

Sticking to PoA Movie it seems to take the approach that it is the moon light itself that triggers the transformation. I'm not sure on exactly what is said in the book.

What I find difficult, when fanfics give a cure, is that often the cure isn't complex enough and/or not built on new ideas/findings for to me believe that it hasn't been done before and isn't in widespread use.

If we take what the film does - contact with moon light causes the transformation - and expand the idea: I'd say that Infected/cursed humans could be driven (by the curse) to seek out moon light on transformation nights. They might destroy and kill objects and people that try to stop them.

My guess is that the infection/curse is linked to the cycle of the moon. When the cycle of the moon reaches a certain point it will cause the transformation.

Edit: spelling

** Reading this made me wonder if werewolves could avoid transforming entirely, if they made clever use of international portkeys to ensure that they were always somewhere abroad when it was daylight while the full moon evenings were in progress, and then they took a portkey back to Britain after the sun rose?

** I don't think so, I mean, the transformation seems to be because of the presence of a Full moon (and possibly just its presence, otherwise it should be possible to stop the transformation by remaining in a dark place) not the absence of sunlight. I guess a spell to blow the moon could work, though it would cause some minor problems for the rest of the world.
