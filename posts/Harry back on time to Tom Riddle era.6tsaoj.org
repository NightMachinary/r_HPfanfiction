I really want to find a fic that has Harry traveled back to Tom era but has an open mind and just doesnt stick to Dumbledore like a puppy or cry out pathetically of nightmares. Like u know i prefer a more adaptable Harry who is strong and cold and can really do something to control the situation. I dont mind him going dark tho. Any recs guys?? :)) Thank you.


** Most Harry to Tom era fics ended up with:

- Harry and Tom becoming best buddies
- Harry and Tom shagging each other
- Harry raising Tom

There's one where Dumbledore was forced to protect Tom though:

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
