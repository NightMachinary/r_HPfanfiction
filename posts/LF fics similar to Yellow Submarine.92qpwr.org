Harry/Ginny preferred. I really liked the mystery of what happened to Ginny, the relationship between Harry and Ginny and how that developed, and the portrayal of both of their traumas, down to the small details (like the Weasley clock).

Thanks!


** Closest thing I can think of is linkffn(Seeking Ginny by Casca). It doesn't have the trauma that Ginny went through, but Harry does have some emotional issues. Imo the best romance fic in the fandom.

If recovery from emotional and physical trauma are what you are lookinng for more than romance then I'd recommend Saving Harry by The Seeker over at SIYE. It's a pre-Hogwarts fic with no romance where Harry is heavily abused by the Dursleys.

I don't think you'll find anything very similar (in topic and quality) to Yellow Submarine in the HPFF genre. That fic is a gem that trods on fraught topics that most authors and readers are afraid to go near.

I would definitely recommend Hominids by Robert J Sawyer (Hugo Award winning hard sci-fi romance novel) if you want some original literature that goes into the same topic as Yellow Submarine.

  For years Ginny Weasley has tried to stop her feelings for Harry Potter. She's even uprooted her life. But what happens when it's time to come face to face with him again?
