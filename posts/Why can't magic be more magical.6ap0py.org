Where is the amazing and the beautiful magic that you should see hear smell taste and feel walking down the alley? Where are the wonder and amazement you could experience as a kid playing in Hogsmeade? magic in the harry potter universe is dreams and intent made real so where are the awe-inspiring and great things that most can only dream of being seen every day. and Hogwarts just Hogwarts, you have a somewhat sentient castle that has contained thousands of years of children whose dreams and reality become reality and yet it is a cold and grimy castle upon plain hills with a dark and foreboding forest off in some direction, why is it not the greatest castle full of amazing things and beauty rather than cold gray halls lined with suits of armor and the occasional talking portrait when it should be one of the most amazing and magical places ever where countless generations of children have been imposing their dreams and imagination upon reality. Hogwarts should be an amazing place where anything is possible.

Why is the magic so mundane?

***** :) Yes.

I will analyze magic itself with mathematics, and munchkin the magic for my mathematics, and by power of mind and math and magic I will banish the blight of Death forever /maniacal laughter/. I might be a Raven, but my ambitions would make Riddle weep with envy. :) /mad wizard cackle/

TBH, my early experiences with mathematics was all 'I can do this in my head' or 'If I wanted to, and took an hour with pen and paper, I can see how to prove that'.

Then I read for the first time about the Riemann Hypothesis, as a teenager, and the song in my heart was "This is deep magic and I must learn what it is".

At the deepest level, math and magic are one and indistinguishable.

As I have written:

Octarine Lantern Oath: In Destroying Light, in Guarding Dark, On the edge dances the eighth bright spark. By mind and science, by math's magic sleight, I strive for Life, with Octarine Light!

** I think magic is mundane because the wizards don't really use it that much. If all the wizards were as creative as the twins or as powerful as Dumbledore then you'd see so much more.

I once wrote something to the effect that most magic users are just not good at it - the few we see in the hp books are actually the elite - the teachers, Dumbledore, Hermione, voldemort etc.

Most people in HP are employed as bureaucrats tho. And there was even a room in the 7th book where there were many wizards just multiplying flyers for umbridge.

And we can see no wizard kid being better than a regular muggleborn when by all accounts they should be so much more surrounded by spellcasting and magic that they should've soaked something up. but nah, even Ron didn't realize that the spell he got from his brothers on how to turn scabbers yellow didn't even remotely sound anything like a regular spell.

On the opposite side we have the Weasley twins. Two amazing spellcasters and creative minds. We don't know if they are actually more "powerful" than their peers ( I mean they sure didn't put any work into their academics ) but we know that the products they created were exactly the kind of thing you're looking for. Hell they even created clothes that perform simple defensive spell casts, something that apparently even ministry employees struggle with.

So in conclusion: magic is mundane because the people are mundane and don't pay much attention to magic or are inherently interested in it that much.

** They're British.

The best way to understand Britain is to go to a Fish and Chips shop. Look at the sides. Common options include "petit pois frais" or "mushy peas."

The country is so dingy and joyless that their language has lost any native concept for "fresh green things you eat." They have to use a French loan word.

Hogwarts is awe-inspiring and beautiful. It's just awe-inspiring to a British standard.

The notion of blue skies or comfortable flooring is alien. It's so removed from their experience that it would break the suspension of disbelief. In a book about wizards.

** I always assumed that Britain /was/ all this before the wars.

We know that when Voldemort came to power, Diagon Alley was practically dead. I'd assume this has happened in the first Voldemort War as well and Britain just never really recovered. There was still a huge societal trauma about the first war when Harry went to Hogwarts. The trauma is going to be refreshed in the minds of another generation after the second war. Voldemort claims that he wants supremacy for magic, especially "pure" magic, but the aftereffects of his terror and reign was a destruction and extreme limitation of magic.

I'm currently writing small snippets of a "Grand Tour" fic in which Harry and Hermione want to set out to get her parents back, but end up just touring the world until Hermione builds up the courage. In those snippets I write about the relatively subdued european cities that still suffer a bit from the influences of Grindelwald, but have recovered for the most part. They come to France and find a fest in honor of Jean d'Arc in which the people of France celebrate her trickery to escape her burning as a witch at the stake. They have 5 statues on the plaza and whenever those statues feel like it they switch places. Transportation is managed by rats that you ride on the back of in shrunk form.

Then they visit the two Lich Kings under the mountain at the Untersberg, Charlemange and Barbarossa and you already see how architecture and clothing changes. Culture is still very connected to unrestricted magic, since Voldemort had only a light grasp here. Grindelwald left a bigger mark, though he never sought to restrict magic (or enabled those who restricted it) - quite the contrary, he reveled in the most outlandish, inventive and creative uses of it.

Harry and Hermione end up coming to Tumbo la Dunia, the Womb of the World. The city that lies in the valleys around Uagadou and is ruled by what has inspired European sorcerer circles and witches covens. Shamans and Priests rule it and have done so for longer than Europe existed as a concept. Its one of only two cities in the world (so I claim) that hasn't changed drastically through the implementation of the Statute. Hence, when they visit Harry and Hermione visit what is essentially a magic society without restrictions (as the whole nation around Uagadou is practically non-existent to muggles). The richest and/or most talented of the people clad themselves in the absence of light. Houses are meaningless, as the greatest mansions may hide inside a hole in a stone, while some houses are sentient and sometimes get bored of their location and inhabitants. And not the least important is the fact that "half-breeds" are still just people there, as they never had to be hidden away from the muggles, and therefore the city has become a place of refuge for a wild plethora of "mythologicals" from around the globe.

Anyway, I rambled. But my point is that magic is so mundane, because Britain went through one war after another. Magic suffered for it.

** Hmm...good question.

I have a question of my own to add, actually; warming charms, or at least hot-air charms, are a thing, and Fred and George are apparently competent enough to convert a Shield Charm to a general purpose enchantment that can be put on hats, cloaks, gloves, etc.

So, why are the wizards walking around in boring old robes, given that it's almost certainly possible to enchant anything to be wearable in cold British weather? Why don't they show some skin, take advantage of magic to wear clothing designs that wouldn't work for muggles? Green leaf leotard, anyone? Faux-lion-skin fursuits complete with enchanted wiggly tail? Deep-space patterned trousers that look like they're full of stars?

...Maybe it's a Statute of Secrecy thing. If people wore enchanted fancy clothes, they wouldn't exactly be transfigurable into muggle clothes in case they need to interact with muggles, would they? Or something.

*** I've always imagined that spells don't last forever. So if you charmed yourself warm or something, it would eventually wear off or make you tired trying to keep it up. So its easier to just wear a jacket. But smart people could charm their clothes and add a rune to make it stay longer, but the rune might burn off and leave an ugly mark. And really rich people could get an enchanted robe, which will last forever, but is obviously really expensive and really hard to make. That's just my headcannon though.

*** Such enchanted "robes" are a key element of my AU Story "Patron" - they denote Status as well as offer comfort and protection. "Robes" covers a very wide range of clothes, including frozen flames, shaped mist and illusions. It's generally a story where magic is used everywhere and anytime - students summon stuff all the time, dishes float around the tables during dinner, and wizards consider muggles "prudes".

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** The wonder and 'magicalness' of magic in a society will be directly proportional to the access of magic by those within society.

When magic is limited to a subset of a society, such as in Lord of the Rings, it will be viewed by that society as more wondrous and amazing. When every member of your culture has the ability to flick their wrist to make things float, it stops being amazing that things float.

The entire world and concept of Harry Potter is amazing to us because we aren't part of that world. The wonder has to come from an outside source, or the world of HP has to change to make magic no longer common place.

** I think that true magic has to do with surrealism and whimsy. Britain, after the Blood Wars, was not a happy place. Filled with cynicism and pain, it simply wasn't appropriate to do such things. If we look at the most magical things in the books, they tend to be showy, flashy things, things meant to impress. The World Cup for instance, had thousands of wizards trying their damndest to impress each other, just with their tents. Weasley Wizard Wheezes had fireworks, moving posters, haphazard arrangements. Dumbledore's office was filled with eccentric items and devices, spinning, whirring, puffing out smoke. That is honestly the most magical things we really see, and they are all built to impress.

On the other hand, we see the darker side. Voldemort's Cave, in which he housed the Locket Horcrux was indubitably one of the most magical, mysterius places, a testament to his sadism and showmanship. An enchanted cave, which requires a blood sacrifice to enter. Filled with a lake of enchanted water, which is full of Inferi, and at the center is a basin, which requires you to drink a potion. Practical? No. But is is a very interesting look at what magic can do when you are trying to impress and intimidate.

My point to all this is that magic flourishes with imagination and creativity, a sort of whimsy which we see in the likes of Dumbledore and Luna. But that creativity just doesn't happen on a day to day basis. People simply get tired, and fall into ruts, doing the same things over and over, the daily grind so to speak.

Now imagine how weak HP magic would be with that limitation on it. Conjuration in itself would be impossible, since to just create even the smallest amount of matter, you'd need more energy than the entire nuclear arsenal of the world could unleash.

**** Hmmm... Actually it could work - as long as you throw in some kind of hand-wave way for a wizard to accumulate & store magical energy in their bodies or something. Maybe have wizards have something like the Eldunari? Or maybe that is the function of wands: they do not channel the magic so much as act as magical batteries - wandless magic is very limited for that reason.

Furthermore, I prefer to subscribe to the idea that Transfiguration is not permanent, it works by using the target matter, applying magical energy structure to it to warp its properties. Conjuration is not true conjuration, but transfiguring air (so it would fail in a perfect vacuum). Alchemy is rearranging particles by moving them around with magic - so you could alchemize a sugar cube into a fat cube, plus the remainder atoms that don't balance the chemical equation. Rearranging lead to gold is possible by rearranging on the subatomic level, but is incredibly dangerous, because you might accidentally nuke yourself if you screw up (while rearranging on the atomic level is at worst a conventional explosion or a nasty poison).

***** My point was that the Eragon magic, while working for the Inheritance universe, is the exact opposite of "magic being more magical". Its explains magic on top of a scientifically describable basis.

The way you describe how Transfiguration, Conjuration,... works also take a lot of the /magic/ away. I never liked explaining magic with science. Because if you could explain it with science, its no longer magic. Rather, magic in the HP universe is great because a philosopher or a sociologist could make a more accurate statement about how magic works than a physicist ever could, simply because the HP magic works over ideas, context and concepts, not over particles, chemical reactions and the like.

****** Huh. To me, magic like that is painful and... /wrong/. It detracts from the beauty of the world, and I find myself autogenerating extensive headcanon to rationalize the universe.

For example, for magic to work as it does in canon HP, I more or less have some blue and orange morality deities creating it, or have them be living in a simulation, etc.

**** I was talking about the the language of magic used in Eragon it is unique, creative and complex, to the point where one misspoken word could ruin the spell and you could kill yourself in the process. In Eragon humans are already weak in magic most can't even use magic the only human who was really powerful was Galbatorix Eragon himself doesn't even count because he practically became an elf. Elves are the superior race in terms of Natural magic in Eragon, there are also ways to get around the limitations which Galbatorix took advantage of. I'm not saying HP should have the same use of magic I'm saying I'd personally like it better if the spell-casting was more interesting I never found it interesting in Harry Potter. I always looked at it as random words and random wand waving with no real meaning behind it.
