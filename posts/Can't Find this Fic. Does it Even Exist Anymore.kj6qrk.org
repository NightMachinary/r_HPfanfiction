:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a Fanfic where Harry fell into a coma after defeating Voldemort in the final battle. During his coma he can hear everything around him and hears what his friends say about his condition. He's been in the coma for about 6 months and overhears the healers say he might wake up but they can't guarantee it. In turn his friends say to just let him die as hes "fulfilled his duty and used up his usefulness" and hes heartbroken. However, Snape tells them that they are being cruel and opts to take Harry to his home and watch iver him until he wakes up. Snape keeps out for Harry and takes care of Teddy Lupin in his place until he finally wakes up. After regaining energy and health, Harry, Teddy, and Snape go to Diagon Alley and run into his old friends. They try to apologize but he tells them to leave him alone after what they'd said about him. I can't remember the name of it or how it ends and I'm not even sure it exists anymore. It was on Fanfiction.net last I read it


** For the first few sentences I was expecting that to be Happily Ever After by Jeconais but then it went off in a very different direction.
