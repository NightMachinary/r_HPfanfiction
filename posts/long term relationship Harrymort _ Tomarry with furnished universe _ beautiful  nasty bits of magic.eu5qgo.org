Hi there! I just finished The Train to Nowhere by MayMarlow and - oh dear - my life isn't making any sense right now.

The few times it happened were when I discovered : - Enveloped in the Darkness by Brigade - A Different Life by Tiro - Death of Today by Epic Solemnity - Keep your Ennemies Closer by Riddletobien - The Art of Hidden Persons by Whitedwarf

All of these tend to evolve in a "dark" world and have some relationship between HP and LV but there aren't lemons at every page. And LV isn't just an absurd madman but a great wizard and there is a lot a mental manipulation involved. The author makes a different and very personified version of the Canon with some awesome magic.

Please, if you know of similar works, let me read! Many thanks :)

** You might like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7040089/chapters/16011331][Consuming Shadows]]. It has a dark, ruled by Voldemort world, a Harry who catches Voldemort's interest and is from that moment on manipulated by him but tries his utmost to keep up and gain the upper hand. Also very slow Harrymort/Tomarry.

** In Willing Sacrifice gives me a similar vibe, depite not being exactly like the other works you linked. It starts after canon!3rd year and involves a powerfull/not insane Voldemort.

  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.

** Thanks for mentioning my fic! Don't know if I'm too late replying, but here are two of my all-time favourite dark worlds:

Linkffn(3766574) You probably know this one, it's abandoned unfortunately.

Linkffn(4745329) Although LV isn't a main character, and it hasn't been updated in a while, there is a lot of delicious manipulation involved and it's the best long-term HP fic that I know, with well-rounded characters

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  Harry was left at an orphanage after his parents met their demise. There, he finds nothing but suffering until he rejoins the Wizarding World.
