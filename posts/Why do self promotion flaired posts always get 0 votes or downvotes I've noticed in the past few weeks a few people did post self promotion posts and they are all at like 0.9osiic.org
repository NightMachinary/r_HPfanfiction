Please yes explain why this happens? If it is bad or something to self promote then why is there even a self promoting flair option? :( Why not take it out? It seems very mean that lots of self promote posts get 0 or negatives just for existing.

When this is finally published it's going to take the fanfiction world by storm. Of that I'm sure.

**** Yeah, it sucks. Hell, the top comment in my own promo thread called my fic cancer; but, like Floreat said, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. Just write your story. If not for others, then for yourself. And never, ever, think that it's unworthy. Because those words are something you created. You gave them life. And maybe they won't gain fame or recognition...but it's still an accomplishment to be proud of, nonetheless.

**** Far be it from me to tell others how to use reddit, but in regards to Lost Ones, they were posting short updates about each new chapter, which I don't think is a good way to go about it. A longer, more in-depth post /after/ the story is complete might be more successful.

Imagine each active author posting here every time they updated the story - it would be a mess.

** As a professional physicist, I can confirm that nothing is quite as crass, or guarantees obscurity, as naming some discovery after yourself. Your fellow physicists will studiously avoid giving you the credit.

An author shamelessly self-promoting is going to suffer similar ignominy (unless, and a big if here, they happen to be Starfox5, our Lord and Savior®, blessed be His name, but even then I think many folks are going to say, "Yeah, no," and reflexively downvote).

It's not fair but it's human nature. Tall poppies are destined to get trimmed.

**** I was being a bit tongue in cheek.

That said, there really is an effect in science where if you try to get named after some discovery, you almost never get the credit for it. It's a variant of Stigler's Law of Eponymy, one of those laws, like Murphy's Law and the Peter Principle, that somehow manage to capture an essential truth. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler%27s_law_of_eponymy]] Even if you don't try naming a discovery after yourself, leaving it to your peers, it's common for someone else to get credited for it. I've firsthand knowledge of this as I've four or five basic discoveries that are credited to someone else in the community who published after me. It can take generations to set the record straight (if it ever happens--most don't care to try to set the record straight since they are more about making the discovery than basking in the afterglow).

While I've only haunted this sub five years or so, my observation is that folks generally like to ding those who self-promote in any capacity, save for a rare few (Starfox5) who get away with it because they have a devout following who will counter any downvotes. I might needle Starfox5 on occasion, but I think he knows it's good-natured. I much prefer him here over the utter shamelessness of an EY, he of MoR fame, who I find beyond insufferable.

The "trim the tall poppies" comment was a reference to a common metaphor for stifling the gifted and promoting mediocrity. This was a hint to the reader that I'm not being completely serious in my post.

No. I do not "know" it's good-natured, nor do I consider it good-natured. We're not friends, we're not acquaintances, we haven't even had friendly talks or discussions. It's about as "friendly ribbing" as a stranger punching your arm on the train.

So, if you truly thought you were just kidding - please stop with the "needling".

I just find it an amusing, this running joke of the sub that every story recommendation for any request pretty much has to have a +JoeHundredaire+ Starfox5 story linked.

Didn't know you were so thin-skinned and self-absorbed that you couldn't find a bit of humor in the situation. (That just makes it more funny.)

***** *Stigler's law of eponymy*

Stigler's law of eponymy, proposed by University of Chicago statistics professor Stephen Stigler in his 1980 publication "Stigler's law of eponymy", states that no scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer. Examples include Hubble's law which was derived by Georges Lemaître two years before Edwin Hubble, the Pythagorean theorem although it was known to Babylonian mathematicians before Pythagoras, and Halley's comet which was observed by astronomers since at least 240 BC. Stigler himself named the sociologist Robert K. Merton as the discoverer of "Stigler's law" to show that it follows its own decree, though the phenomenon had previously been noted by others.

*** Putting your work out there is not shameless. Depends on how you do it of course, but your response here is ridiculous.

​

If that were the case, every author, actor, and artist would be shameless for going to cons, doing interviews, going to bookshops because promoting your work is apparently 'shameless'

Try to view it from the other side- writers who want feedback on their work. There is so much stuff on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]], and they're trying to share their stuff with a like-minded community.

** I agree with you for the most part. I'm not a fan of when people self-promote every chapter if they are posting very regularly, but I tend to just leave the later posts alone if that's the case. I think they can be very useful for getting feedback and actually letting interested people know that your fic exists.

If I ever knock mine into shape (I've spent so little time on it recently that nothing's really happened) then I might use a self-promo post to let people know I'm continuing it.

** I use the voting system to mark the threads I'd like to re-read later (upvote), or I don't want to read again (downvote). For a self-promotion thread, it means, e.g. that I'd downvote a thread about a Dramione story so that I won't go back to this thread to read later comments. I up- or downvote neither the story nor the author, just the thread. It's just a sign, whether the thread is interesting for me or not.

It's not a writers reddit, like [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] mostly is, and my guess would be that majority of people here are just looking for good stuff to read. Which self-promotions are not guaranteed to be. I personally just skip these posts.

otoh, my own self promotions are rather upvoted here which just proves my point since my SPs aren't about my fics.
