Maybe Draco and friends smuggle in some firewhiskey and have a fun night in their dorm or they get up to shenanigans around the castle and at home. They have lots of money and the protection of their family name so I would assume they were getting up to some crazy stuff haha. No slash. Don't care about the POV, just want some boarding school shenanigans from the Slytherins. Thanks in advance.

This one....The Sacred 28 has a lot of the aristocratic upper class stuff in it. It's like a year after the 7th book so they aren't in school but Malfoy interacts with other Slytherins and you see all the different behaviors compared with Gryffindors/the Weasleys (more formalities, less expressive, not impulsive, more self preservation, emphasis on keeping up appearances) There are scenes were the Slytherin kids ditch parties with the adults to have their own parties and drink and dance. It's a Draco/Ginny fic.

#+begin_quote
  Daphne Greengrass is on a quest to be the main character of her own life for once, but that's easier said than done. Includes: conspiracy theories, evil plotting, a Slytherin revolution, and sassy Potter. OotP, HBP, and DH. Not your usual Daphne.
