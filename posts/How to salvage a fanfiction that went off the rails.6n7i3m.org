After trying my hand at trying to write a fanfiction I now understand why people stick so close to already tried ideas.Trying to break the mold when write a fanfiction is a Lot more difficult than I thought it was going to be.At this point the fanfic has went so far from how I want the story to be that I am just going to rewrite it.

The main problem I had was the pacing of the story the group of characters that were supposed have a slow decent becomeing antagonists of the first arc threw a combination of the group mentality of "ever one else is doing it" and peer pressure threw the first arc leading to a "what have we done moment " at the start of the second arc.Went from a group of normal if angry people to what I want then to be at the end of the first arc in under 2 chapters. Were as the way that I want the story to go is :

First Arc: the slow decent of the group as they get worst time leading to a "what have we done" moment. At the end of the arc

Second arc: were the group try to ignore what they did. Leading into the moment were they could no longer ignore it.

Arc three: Feeling guilty the group then go to the person they hurt were they would have a "I have wronged you please hit me "moment but unlike when this happens in anime were it is played for laughs the person they have wronged takes then up on the offer.Only for them to have a breakdown after the emotions calmdown. Because hurting the people who hurt them doesn't make them feel better.

Arc Four : They try to actually comfort and protect the person that they have normalize the bullying over over the school year. Just because they stopped dosnt mean the rest of the school did.

what would be some helpful tips for pacing the rewrites for the fanfic. So that my would be antagonists don't go from normal people to James Bond villains in two chapter.


** Question: Do you write with an outline?

If you don't, you might consider one with firmly delineated acts. For reference, I've commented on this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/6k5tq7/creating_a_cohesive_story/djl95xs/][elsewhere]] for a question someone had on a related topic about cohesive story telling.

If you /do/ write with an outline, you might want to consider that the story that you *want* to write and the story that you *feel* like writing are two different things. If that's the case, you should set aside the old version as the idea for something else (even if you don't plan on picking it up again) and then start working on the new version. I've done that before as a way to trick myself into writing something that's fighting me.

*** Thank for the link.

I have a plan with each arc planned out and how I want each of the main Characters to develop. I guess My Plan was not detailed enough if it went of the rails so quickly.

One problem that i am having is that the main reasons I Even started with this story is so that it would be something new.Its supposed to be a hurt/comfort story but I really just want to get threw the Hurt part to get to the other parts of the story.

** Something none of the others mentioned so far:

Be not afraid to throw away already written parts of your story. JKR allegedly wrote +12+fifteen completely different versions of the first chapter that - according to her - taken together would give away most of the plot.

Be not afraid to experiment, and be even less afraid to acknowledge that an experiment failed. And if you notice that something you wrote three chapters ago is hindering you, be not afraid to throw it away.

And with all this keep in mind that often rewriting isn't the best strategy, instead a 'refactoring' of some parts might be the best thing for your project.

Edit:

#+begin_quote
  Discarded first chapters of book one: I reckon I must've got through fifteen different alternative chapters of book one. The reason for which I discarded each of them were: They all gave too much away. And in fact if you put all those discarded first chapters together, almost the whole plot is explained
#+end_quote

([[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/1201-bbc-hpandme.htm][source]])

She wrote fifteen different chapters of book one, and the problem with all of them wasn't even the writing - it was an /outline/-problem.

Sometimes your outline is wrong. I've had it multiple times that when I finally write the scene from my outline, the characters don't behave the way I want. One example: I'm currently working on a story where Harry and Newt will meet post-CoS, and I think there could be a lot of interesting interactions and I have a solid plot idea where Harry gets to travel the world a bit with Newt in the summer (only to Germany, but still hopefully interesting)

My first idea was that Newt basically takes Harry to the MoM and this worked great in the outline and what I had in my head, but the characters just wouldn't behave: Harry wouldn't be comfortable interacting with an official person in the official environment of the Ministry, especially after what Fudge pulled with Hagrid last year. He'd never be able to trust Newt at all. Maybe Newt could work around this, but he'd then have to overshare some stuff and that just isn't Newt.

I only noticed that after writing the first draft, and seeing my characters not behaving well. Only then could I diagnose the problem and find a way to work around this.

Bingo.

Just because you've written it doesn't make it a good part of the story. All they are at this point are words until you form them into a coherent part of an overall story. Sometimes you can write for days and realize that everything you wrote was just a warmup for the real writing you're about to do.

I am constantly doing this in my own writing (both in fiction, and in the real world). Sometimes the most satisfying - and agonizing - feeling is going back and completely scrapping days worth of writing because you realize it just isn't good, or simply doesn't fit with everything else you've written. /But that is completely okay/. All that means is that you have discovered a method of approaching a problem (in this case telling a story) that doesn't work. Which means you can avoid that path in the future.

Added onto all of this, the best way to prevent a story from going off the rails is having an alpha or beta reader that is willing to kill a bad idea in the crib for you. My alpha reader is ruthless about doing this for me (they know my signs of when I'm about to spin off the rails), and my beta reader is very good at catching wonkiness that has made it through the first pass.

** As [[/u/mistermisstep]] already said, you need an outline. It also sounds like you could use one where you actually write down the outline for each chapter. Whats happening in the chapter, whats the point of it, how does its end make my reader want to read the next chapter?

Its tedious, but the moment you want to regulate yourself, you go away from freeform brainstorm writing to the more structured process of trying to deliver a product.

*** Yeah I am probably going to have to go there all my notes and make them more detailed and not just have the arc planed out but what is going to happen inside each arc.

** The others are right to talk about good planning but I'll add in knowing when to stop. Say this is enough. Moderation is a powerful tool, just because you can doesn't mean you should. Going off the rails often occurs when you try to do too much even if you planed it, a good story doesn't need a thousand plot twists and intense moments every few paragraphs. If everything is intense then it becomes the new normal. You need flat bits so we understand the low bits and the high bits.

** People have discussed outlining, which is important and definitely helps a lot with pacing. This is a technical skill that is very concrete and easy to execute on (Easy may not be the right term, but there is at least a clear goal).

Another thing I think will help with your specific problem is characterization. The content you've included in your description of the story arcs is all character and personality based. I'm guessing yours is a character driven story?

This type of thing tends to lead to a very fluid, indistinct line between plot and characterization, which is not recommended. The correct method is that the plot moves the story forward and your characters' personalities inform the plot.

It's hard to maintain realistic characters when you are trying to use their mindset and revelations to drive the story forward. Instead, as you outline your story, use plot to accomplish your story arcs, and refer to characterizations (and how they change) as you build the plot.

You really need to get into the minds of your characters to determine how they behave at a given point in the story. Their actions are what drive the plot forward. The external consequences of their actions are what cause changes in their personalities. In this way you can achieve harmony between plot and characters by creating a feedback loop between the two, allowing the characters to drive the plot, and the plot to change your characters.

This separation and feedback between characters and plot will help your pacing issues. The characters change and progress as the plot unfolds around them, and these changes and progressions in personality will influence the plot. This is opposed to the contrived, unrealistic alternative of both happening simultaneously.

** Writing an outline helps out with pacing and having a basic idea of where you want your story to go. And don't be afraid to re-write or revise your chapters either. I've rewritten or just thrown away many drafts over the years because they either want off the rails or I didn't like them down the road.

** There's a lot of big picture story writing and planning advice here which is great, but it seems like you really struggle with basic spelling/word choice, so make sure you have a beta to edit your work. Doesn't matter how good your plot is, if your story was written like your post I would have stopped after three lines.

*** That something that is getting better with time. Trying to decipher some of my first notes for this story is horrible but at least it is getting better with time.
