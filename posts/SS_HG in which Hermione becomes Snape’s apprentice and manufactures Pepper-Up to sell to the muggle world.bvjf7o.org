IIRC she does it without Snape's knowledge. I distinctly remember reading this fic on Ashwinder, but can't find it now.

It's the one mentioned in this thread: [[https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9xp3l0/looking_for_fics_in_which_people_use_magic_to/]]


** I remember a fic where Hermione is Snape's apprentice and sells potions to muggles, but she's not romantically involved with Snape. It's H/Hr: linkffn(Blindness)

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** Thanks! Unfortunately this isn't it - the one I read was very Hermione/Snape-centric
