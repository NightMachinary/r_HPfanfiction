Hi all!

I am looking for good long stories set in a world where there was no Voldemort, although there probably should still be some prejudice.

Something like Hermione/Draco years in Hogwarts overcoming this prejudice, being Head Girl and Head Boy, that sort of thing. Also it would be interesting to read about Hermione's friendship with Harry and Ron without troll accident.

Or maybe friendship between Harry and Draco (who becomes sort of like Sirius, a blood traitor, maybe even gets sorted in Gryffindor). Actually, I would read about this even in a world with Voldemort

Or maybe something about lives of Lily and James and all the rest of Marauders after school

Thanks!

  Minerva McGonagall steps in on the awful night the Potters are murdered and arranges to have Harry Potter raised by Sirius Black and his somewhat cousins, the Malfoys. Draco and Harry grow up as almost brothers and everything - well, almost everything - is different. Gryffindor!Draco. Dramione. AU.

  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Tomione. AU. COMPLETE.

** Well, linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is based on Riddle going into politics instead of starting a war. So Lily and James and all sorts of other people are still alive, Riddle never became a "dark lord" and there's no prophecy, but legalised prejudice is rampant. Harry isn't allowed to go to Hogwarts because she's half-blood, but she's been obsessed with potion brewing since she was four years old, and she isn't going to miss out on the chance to learn from Professor Snape. (Naturally, with drive and ambition like that, she goes to Slytherin.)

Riddle's ambition in this series isn't to regain a body (he already has one); it's to pass laws that block muggle-born Wizards from marrying half-bloods. He actually has a mixture of good and bad reasons for doing it. He dislikes muggle influences, but is genuinely trying to push the Pureblood families to mix in slightly fresh blood to stave off the effects of inbreeding.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD. DISCONTINUED
