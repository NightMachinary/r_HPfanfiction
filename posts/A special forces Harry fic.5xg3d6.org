Someone linked this fic recently, but Ive opened so many other posts on various devices that I have no idea where to start. Anyway premise:

Harry gets sent back in time because reasons to the first Voldemort war. He wipes out a Death Eater raid, and can either go in for questioning, or flash his "get out of jail free because im Undpeakable special forces", which he does. Other points include him trolling the hell out of a new recruit on the team he gets stuck in, and Nicolas Flamel being head of either the special forces branch, or the DoM in general.

Thank you in advance for pointing me in the right direction.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976
