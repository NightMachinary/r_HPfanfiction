I looking for a fic where Harry was like his father, not so much change in personality, but like, him in love with a girl and keeps chasing her. That sort of stuff. I actually read something similar in wattpad where Harry is very much Infatuated ,I really recommend it. It's called 'Carina Malfoy' by Jessie/V/

Oh, I would really want it as Harry/OC only pls. Thanks üôèüíï

It's kinda underrated but quite better than most of the stuff out there.

"Of course"? While it's a great fic, it's pretty far away from "love at first sight". It took them months to get anywhere. Hell, they only just kissed in the last chapter after 200k+ words.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

**** Well, Harry took really long time to get his shit together, but I think they were working towards it since start. But perhaps I am too optimistic.
