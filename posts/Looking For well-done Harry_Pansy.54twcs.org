Preferably not Slytherin!Harry, nor as background to or including Dramione or similar. Yes, I know it's a hateship. I still ship it.

  This is the story of a very unlikely pairing in a love, hate...more hate relationship. This is a cynical look back on how it all began and the maddening realization of why it hasn't ended. A Harry, Pansy pairing. Yes, I have undertaken the implausible.

**** He was known for being one of the best early on. But now a lot of his stories are known as cliche. Also he never really puts Harry in a situation he can't handle and there is little to no conflict in his stories. I personally love his stories and drop everything when he updates. But a lot of people can't stand his writing style.

*** I mean, I've read it, but it reads more like Harry/Slytherin OC than Harry/Pansy --- and frankly there's better in that genre too. But thanks anyway.

*** Thanks for the recommendation. Not really my thing; part of my liking the ship is the give and take between two equally-strong-willed people, whereas this, like a lot of other Harry/Pansy I've seen, seems to devolve quickly into a 50SoG-level misunderstanding of BDSM.

Edit: Admittedly, the writing is better. But that's not a high bar to jump over.

**** i definitely agree with you about the bdsm in fanfiction even the semi realistic ones don't cove the part of the bdsm I like reading which is the aftercare.

And even among the rare fanfictions that includes aftercare I have income across only one that has the Dom receiving aftercare after for filling a subs fantasy
