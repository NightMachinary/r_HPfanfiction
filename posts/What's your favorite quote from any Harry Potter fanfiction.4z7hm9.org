  Ah, Severus, my most loyal servant. It was good to see that, even a decade after my disappearance, he continued to attack my enemies. I suspected this would negatively impact my Potions grade, since I currently was one of my enemies. Nevertheless, his devotion was admirable.

  Sirius noticed Harry slinking away and slapped him hard on the shoulder in a friendly gesture, while adding, "But unless you count his back, he's not really hairy. And I am rarely serious."

  "Oof," Harry groaned, partly from the smack and partly from Sirius' line. "Can't you not crack a name joke, just once?"

  “That didn't take as long as I thought it would,” Scott commented, shovelling the first crispy strips into his mouth. “Record time. Hey -- I didn't ask Slughorn, but what are we supposed to wear tonight?”

  “Most of the other parties have been casual,” Hermione supplied, “but for the Christmas gathering we've been requested to dress formally.”

  “Great, wonderful,” Scott muttered into his bacon. “Anyone know where I can get a cheap suit?”

  Hermione frowned. “You don't have any dress robes? They were on the school list.”

  “What the fuck do you call these?” Scott gestured at his school uniform. “Any robes are ‘dress robes'. There's no such thing as casual robes. That's like saying you need a casual cummerbund. Oh dearie me, I seem to have misplaced my casual tiara.”

  “I'll have to get out my casual cufflinks,” Harry added.

  “What about your casual pocket vest?”

  “I'm leaning more towards my casual top hat.”

  “You could always wear your casual monocle,” Ron joined in.

  “No, I think it would clash terribly with my casual kilt...”

It's a bit slow to start - I really enjoy it and haven't found really anything that even comes close to filling the same niche.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** "But you must remember that in this life, no matter how much we wish to, in the end, we cannot truly change the world; nor can we truly change other people. We can change only ourselves." That's from an old, old fic called Love Under Will by Asi.

And the following is the first line to one of my favorite fics. A reviewer once called out that the opening line is simply an excellent sentence to introduce a novel, not just a fan fiction. I agree with that assessment and think of it often as a great example of a hook opener.

"Not far from the Interstate, but through a fence, a field, a spur of woods, and over a small hill, three children were lying in the tall grass surrounding a sluggish green pond." -Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle by Inverity.

  "You don't have a clue what kind of power we Muggles have, Mr. Potter," said the Director-General coldly. "You may have your magic, but we have our science."

  "Science?" burst out Scrimgeour incredulously. "What is science to magic? Your bloody 'science' wouldn't last a minute against a wand! Your insolence---"

  "Minister," said Harry, giving him a stern look. Scrimgeour sneered, but remained quiet. "Thank you. Now, Director-General." The man met his gaze, and the teen reached across and brushed through the Muggle's mind swiftly. "I see you've gleaned much information about our world from Auror Shacklebolt---your own version of truth serum, I see. Ah, yes, we cannot deny the power of science; you are correct in this." Harry's eyes widened slightly. "Oh my, now that is surprising---though not unmanageable. You're attempting to make Muggle-borns into spies."

  The Director-General's eyes narrowed, before he broke eye contact abruptly. "You can read minds," he said solemnly. Harry had to give him points for his composure. The man was devoid of any facial expression that gave away his feelings. Quite impressive.

  But instead, Harry remained cold and aloof---he needed to make his warnings stick. "Indeed, Director-General. I can read minds---and, and so much more." There was a subtle quality that he added to his voice, and both the Prime Minister and the Director-General found their eyes drawn to him. Harry stared hard at both of them, and allowed the full weight of his seriousness press on them. "And now, Prime Minister, Director-General, allow me to address something you have till this moment been ignorant of: you have absolutely no idea how powerful magic can be. Of course, your experience with magic has been severely limited: you have only met wizards such as our former and present Ministers, both fools, and Auror Shacklebolt, who while powerful in his own right is nowhere near the upper echelons of the wizarding world in terms of magical power---it is time to correct your view of magic and the so-called strength of your science."

  Harry twirled his wand, drawing their attention to it. "With this wand, this single wand alone, I can destroy Muggle London---and nothing you can do could stop me. Would you fire your guns at me? I could create a ward that would turn every bullet into a lovely flower. Would you direct your missiles in my direction? I would've been warned long before because of my proximity wards and Disapparated instantaneously to a location hundreds of meters from where I had previously been. Would you attempt to overwhelm me with numbers alone? With two words I could kill a man---now allow me to ask, how long do you think it'll take to whisper two words over and over again to destroy a battalion of hundreds of soldiers? Not too long, sirs, not too long. All the while I would have a magical shields that would protect me from any lucky shot, dragonhide clothing to protect me from those that manage to get through the cloak---and a single wave of my wand to heal anything truly powerful enough to damage my person.

  "Would you hide within your mighty structures of concrete and metal? I could Apparate through walls, I could conjure a fire so fierce it would burn water, let alone melt metal; I could send a storm so powerful it would blow your walls down, or I could transfigure cement into sand and metal into straw. I could drop the earth beneath your feet, call lightning out from the sky, summon the ocean in the middle of your city, or put your nation to sweet sleep. Would you believe your hiding would save you? I have spells that could search whomever I wanted, wherever they may be. You will have no where to hide, to shelter, to cower from my might and power." Harry leaned back into his seat and stopped twirling his wand. "I may not be able to destroy Muggle London in a single day, or even perhaps a week, but if I direct my wand and my magic to her destruction, in the end, /she will fall/."

  There was a stunned moment of silence. He sighed slowly, and asked gently, "A single wand, gentlemen; what can you possibly do against a single wand?"

  "I don't know, Uncle Vernon. I mean, you're already allowing me only the barest minimal necessities for keeping me alive. You're also beating me on a four times a day basis, five times on Saturday since it's your day off, plus the beatings that Dudley and his friends give me whenever they feel like it. Also, I've never been allowed to properly tend to any of the wounds I've received from those beatings, so my body's probably heavily infected in multiple places right now. You killed my owl and then forced me to cook her for your supper, and then beat me because she was too salty. I could honestly die any day now of starvation, dehydration, overexertion, or a combination of all three. The jury's still out on whether or not I've contracted cancer from that toxic waste you dumped on me the other day, and let's not forget that I'm also mentally scarred, not just from all the verbal abuse I take from you three, but also from seeing my godfather, the last remaining family I have that cared about me even the slightest bit, killed right in front of me not so long ago. I can honestly say that my life sucks about as hard as is metaphorically possible already and, off the top of my head, can't think of a single way that you could make it worse short of murdering the rest of my friends in front of me."

  Vernon thought about that for a moment, making a mental note to return that toxic waste barrel to the dump before Dudley started eating it. There had to be something he could do to further torment the boy. What else did he have to live for if he couldn't fulfill such sadistic pleasures anymore?

  Then an idea came to him. "Well, what if I were to violate you sexually?"

  "...Well, there you go: that would do it," Harry said with a firm certainty.

** I have a section of notes on my phone specifically for HP fanfic quotes. I tried to pick one favorite, but to me this answer is more for people reading it to read cool things so I figured I'de post them all.

"There's chaos out there, you said," Harry noted. "Does this Chaos have teeth?"

"If at first you don't succeed... walk away, no sense in being a damned fool about it."

"God is cruel -- sometimes he makes you live."

"Come quickly, listen close -- I'm going to share one of life's great secrets. Yes, yes, a secret. And like most dark, hidden things in this world, it is a secret with teeth. It is something we all learn, that we let children discover for themselves, and that haunts us to our grave... and for all I know, beyond. It is something we work to forget, something that can be forgotten, if we fill our days with enough activity that we're left no time to be alone with our thoughts... You don't have to hear this, just block your ears and turn away... last chance... Are you sure? Very well: Regrets are forever. How many regrets do you have? One? Two? A few? Enough to fill a lifetime? Regrets are forever."

"Wounds heal, bones mend, regrets are forever -- regrets don't heal, they whisper and dig deep into our souls."

"Do you know what the trouble is with doing something right the first time? Nobody knows how hard it was."

"That which you promise, you must perform."

"Because my kung fu is old school."

"If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It could mean mockery--isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is."

"You never knew the last time you were seeing someone. You didn't know when the last argument happened, or the last time you had sex, or the last time you looked into their eyes and thanked God they were in your life. After they were gone? That was all you thought about. Day and night."

"It sucks that we miss people like that. You think you've accepted that someone is out of your life, that you've grieved and it's over, and then bam. One little thing, and you feel like you've lost that person all over again."

"It's the same with people who say, ‘Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.' Even people who say this must realize that the exact opposite is true. What doesn't kill you maims you, cripples you, leaves you weak, makes you whiny and full of yourself at the same time. The more pain, the more pompous you get. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you incredibly annoying."

** “Because, for time out of mind, there have been witches in Pendle.”

The very last line of “A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles.” by Rannaro.

The whole last chapter makes me lose my mind crying every time I read it, it's such a beautiful ending, and that line just gives me chills. If you are in any way a fan of Severus Snape, read this story.

** "Just ... How does anyone ever figured out that a ... paste of some leaf, taken ... er, up the arse ...?" He laughed tightly, unable to finish.

"A bit of a stretch," Snape allowed, "but it was, at least, already established as a ceremonial plant. I wonder more about things such as tapioca."

"Tapioca?"

"Yes. Derived from cassava roots, which are poisonous when fresh. Who thought of grating them up, then baking the fermented residue? Why did they think the result would not also be poisonous?"

"Maybe someone was trying to kill himself," Harry suggested. "'Hey, I'll have some of this poisonous root! That should do it!'"

"That doesn't explain why it was grated in the first place."

"Perhaps it was also used as a pesticide? 'I'll have some of this poisonous root that's been scattered around the vegetable beds.'"

"Ah!" Snape's eyes took on a triumphant gleam. "Perhaps someone wished to poison someone else. They baked it into a casserole."

"Yes, it did come out beautifully thick, today, dear, didn't it?" Harry improvised, pitching his voice high. "No, go ahead and eat, I'll just put the baby down."

I might have quoted it wrong, but that's the ghist of it. It comes from /Lord of the Marauders/.
