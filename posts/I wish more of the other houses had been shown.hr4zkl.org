The whole series was heavily focused on Gryffindor (for obvious reasons of the main characters being from there) but i wish more had been displayed in the way of inter-house friendships and just student characters from other houses as well.

I think i saw a tweet (?) or something, somewhere that spoke of how Ravenclaw- Gryffindor pairings and Hufflepuff-Slytherin pairings are common around the castle- really wished this had been portrayed more as i felt all the houses were highly prejudiced and biased agianst each other, a little more house-unit could have been there. Alsoooo ..Has anyone else seen this tweet?- or is it the Mandela effect on me... I GOTS TO KNOW


** Imo, this sort of stuff would be better for a spin-off or something similar. Unless it actually added new main characters from other houses, it would just make the canon a lot more bloated for no reason. Like reading about Terry Boot's morning rituals sounds interesting, but it really wouldn't be as interesting as it sounds.

Shame Pottermore is so trash, that place could've been awesome for extra worldbuilding but /noooo, FLEAMONT POTTER/...
