** /Lighthearted.../ for some reason I'm having trouble pinning that down to a single interpretation... so you get multiple answers depending on how you mean it.

Never having to feel like Harry could possibly conceivably lose? most anything by Robst.

Hilarious amusement with a plot? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]] where Harry wakes up 11 and decides to make with the mayhem.

If Peggy sue isn't your cuppa tea then there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make_A_Wish][Make a wish]] where Harry accidentally the whole thing while attempting to vacation.

For an alternative viewpoint on canon we have [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] wherein Lord Voldemort must contend with the various trials of being Harry Potter so that he can achieve his life's greatest ambition... the DADA professorship.

or

[[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/][Perks of Survival]] wherein our hapless self insert finds that HE is now Sally Perks... and is pretty sure she vanishes before the OWLS. dun dun dun... paranoia and hilarity ensue.

*** The last couple fics I've read featured a lot of death and torture and even some rape. I don't mind this occasionally, but I'd like a well written stories that stays this side of the line on that stuff, like canon does.

I've read Oh God Not Again, it was a lot of fun. I've read The Black Comedy too and liked it a lot better. Is there anything else in this vein you'd recommend?

**** Well... given that you've read both of them...

Have you tried their authors' pages? Sarah (Oh god not again) and Nonjon (Black comedy) both have other works that have a similar feel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in doubt obliviate!]] is a lovely for want of a nail, wherein Harry is rescued from the Dursleys by Lockhart who raises him as his own son. Lockhart is an unexpectedly competent father, and the small changes he brings about lead to some interesting alterations to the canon characters. Examples include a more confident and sarcastic Neville who's parents are still alive and sane and is more than happy .

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Brown Coat, Green Eyes]] is a firefly crossover which is best summed up as Harry annoys Mal while trying to fix River.

** Lots of people recommend Oh God Not Again!, but it didn't really do much for me. However, I did laugh out loud several times reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die][Gryffindors Never Die]]. Ron and Harry are bitter, alcoholic, 58 year olds that get thrown back in time to their school years (I think 4th year). They have a really good time being young again.

** I second what [[/u/__Pers]] has recommended, and also offer these. The first four fit your criteria quite precisely (the first one is a little under 100K words, but it's close enough), although #3 and #4 are well-known enough that you've probably read them. The remaining recs fall short of your criteria in some way (most of them are shorter), but are similar enough in nature to what you are looking for that you may like them anyway.

Unless otherwise noted, these are all complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5356183/1/Al-Potter-And-His-Very-Epic-Plan][Al Potter and His Very Epic Plan]] was recently rec'd in another thread. It actually has a plot, in addition to being rather funny, and features a naive, but brilliantly manipulative Albus Potter.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/967557/Estora][The first 4 books in the Journals and Ice Cream Series]]. The 5th book is abandoned, and looks a little depressing, but the first 4 stand well on their own. They range from 19K to 41K words in length, for a total length of about 123K words. The fourth book, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8960718/1/Lorcan-Scamander-and-the-Year-of-Raging-Hormones][Lorcan Scamander and the Year of Raging Hormones]] is absolutely hilarious.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] is generally considered a must-read, so give it a try if you haven't read it before. Lord Voldemort seems to have ended up in Harry's body, but that's okay, since it gives him another chance to work in his favored profession: teaching.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]] is a classic light-hearted Peggy Sue.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10485934/1/Inspected-By-No-13][Inspected By No 13]] is not a very serious fic, but it's quite funny. Relatively short, at 18K words. Bureaucrats have a lot of power, when you think about it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9807593/1/Harry-Potter-the-Geek][Harry Potter, the Geek]]. I haven't read this one in a while, but I seem to recall that it was rather funny. A little shorter than what you're looking for, at 65K words. Harry embraces a number of internet stereotypes, with humorous results.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/What-Would-Slytherin-Harry-Do][What Would Slytherin Harry Do?]] is a series of one-shots that all take place in the same continuity, so I figured it was close enough to a story to include here. Very, very funny. The title more or less summarizes it. Somewhat short, at 44K words.

*** The only one of these I've read is Oh God Not Again, which I enjoyed a lot. I keep having Seventh Horcrux recommended, but haven't read it yet. The description of it leaves a lot to be desired for me, both the one you wrote here and the one on the fic. I'd love if you'd attempt to sell me on it though.

I think I'm going to read What Would Slytherin Harry Do? tonight, seems fun enough.

Edit: Meant to say I'd like to avoid stories without a proper ending, at least for the moment. Though that series seems very funny.

**** There are a lot of stories with a setup similar to Seventh Horcrux; Voldemort becomes Harry/Harry's brother (or something like that) instead of spending 10 years as a wraith. What sets SH apart is the execution. It's /funny/. Seriously, read 5 chapters, and drop it if you don't like it by then. Here are a couple of quotes, to give you an idea of the setting.

Harrymort recalling his original rise to power:

#+begin_quote
  With my original Horcruxes created and hidden away, I might have become as much a fixture of the school as poor, idiotic Binns. That dream was crushed by Dumbledore. His first official act as Headmaster was to deny me the position. After a very strenuous job interview, I might add. Offended and heartbroken, I cursed the DADA post and stormed out of the castle.

  So there I was: depressed, unemployed, and increasingly intoxicated. I slumped across the Hog's Head's bar, accompanied by a few of my old Slytherin buddies. We were reminiscing, telling racist jokes, and complaining about all the Muggleborns stealing our jobs. At some point, we got onto the topic of the abysmal education provided by Hogwarts. Turning away a young, eager, intelligent -- if slightly evil -- job applicant showed a startling lack of foresight.

  "Kids nowadays don't know anything," I slurred. "I bet the six of us could take out every one of the half-wits they're graduating and show them exactly how much they suck at defending against the Dark Arts. Then they'd have to hire me."

  That's the last thing I remember of that night.

  A few days later, I woke up in an alley with a pounding headache. By the time I'd gotten home and downed a hangover potion, The Prophet had arrived. In my drunken haze, I'd killed six Ministry workers and declared myself the Dark Lord Voldemort (I never would have picked that name had I been sober).

  Once you've done something like that, it's exceedingly difficult to get a job around children. I know. I tried.
#+end_quote

Potions class #1:

#+begin_quote
  Severus sneered. "The Draught of Living Death, sir. Ten points from Gryffindor for disrespecting a professor."

  Ah, Severus, my most loyal servant. It was good to see that, even a decade after my disappearance, he continued to attack my enemies. I suspected this would negatively impact my Potions grade, since I currently was one of my enemies. Nevertheless, his devotion was admirable.

**** Seventh Horcrux is one of those things you just have to read the first few chapters to be able to understand what the descriptions really mean. A mere sentence or two fails to properly convey just how hilarious reading about "harry" trying to console Hermione about how evil she is for trying to free the house elves.

**** That story is the polar opposite of dark. It's in a category similar to Black Comedy, but with lots more sex. The author mentions later that he got some inspiration from the BBC series Coupling, and I actually wondered about that a couple of times as I read it.
