Not light as in the opposite to dark magic.

Light magic as in /magic laser beams!/


** Not really the same but you made me re-think of this.

I'm pretty sure you can more or less modify certain charm depending your intent like you can make a big Incendio or just light a candle or increase an object's size by a bit or more.

So imagine a wizard who saw Muggle engineering machines or things like that and modify his Lumos to get a laser or his Aguamenti to get a water jet cutter (to use in fights obviously).

I thought of this some time ago and I'm still hoping to it in a fic; instead of the classical overwhelming powerful aguamenti that can extinguish dragon fire, let's focus on precision.

*** The Jet cutter would have fairly limited range though due to how the pressure would drop off with distance.

*** linkffn(The Arithmancer) has a few laser based spells if I recall correctly. /Lux cohaerens/.

linkffn(So, how can I Weaponize This?) has butter powered laser beams of destruction.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy
