I've only ever seen one and that was a walking dead crossover.

Side note, someone should totally write a post-robot uprising fic where a child, enslaved like the rest of the humans, discovers they have the power to shut down electronics. They become head of the resistance/find wizards and get them to help destroy the robots. That'd be awesome.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

It's pretty good so far, but it's short and the author is slow to update their stories since they're juggling about a dozen of them at any given time.

  Sophia Peletier thought she was good as dead when a crimson haired woman with a lightning bolt scar upon her forehead saved her. After that, well things got rather interesting. A plot bunny.
