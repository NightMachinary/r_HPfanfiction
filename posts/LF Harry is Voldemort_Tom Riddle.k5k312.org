Looking for fics where baby-Harry becomes just the horcrux or is entirely possessed by Tom Riddle. Everyone think he's still Harry Potter, but he's actually someone else.

I'd also accepts fics where it's not Tom Riddle but someone else like in Athy's Rebirth.

I'm thinking similar to The Seventh Horcrux.

Thank you!

** Not sure if this is what you were looking for/have not read yet but Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart. Harry absorbs the horcrux?j

And haven't read the other stories but I am just throwing this out there

** You can't really recommend this one without spoiling the twist at the end of the story, but HPMOR. Turns out Voldemort didn't try to kill baby Harry, and there's no horcrux possession. Voldemort copied his brain onto Harry's brain, and because of "infantile amnesia" Harry/Riddle forgot everything. The main character of HPMOR isn't Harry Potter, it's a copy of Tom Riddle who's been raised as Harry Potter. Quirrell and Harry in HPMOR are probably the two best versions of Tom Riddle I've ever encountered in fanfiction. Lots of people hate HPMOR's version of Harry, but it's not Harry, it's Tom Riddle.
