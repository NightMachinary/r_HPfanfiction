I'm looking for a fic that is either Harry Potter / Addams family with a Addams Harry, or just a fic that might described a Addams like Harry even if it is not a Cross over. It could be a pure Harry Potter fanfic, but other than describing the Addams family I couldn't quite find the right words to show what I am looking for. Hopefully complete, but it's okay if it's not. I just want something interesting.

  He's done it. He's just five years old, but he's finally done it. The Dursleys are gone. And now he's with a new family who seems just as twisted as he is. How strange.

** [[http://ishtar.fanficauthors.net/Family_Values/index/][Family Values by Ishtar]] is a Harry Potter/Addams Family crossover. It was started in 2006 with the last update in 2008 - so I would say it's abandoned now. It's epically long at over 100,000 words. I haven't read the whole thing (as I stopped the first time it looked like it would be abandoned in '07) but I thought it was pretty good up to that point.

**** I have definitely read fics in the 1M+ word range. I probably should not have used the word "epically."
