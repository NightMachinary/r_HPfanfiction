For me it would have to be Hermione (and one other who I forgot) hiding in an expanded locket (or something) around Harry's neck and using a hole in the thing to shoot out of. I just loved how ridiculous and if I remember my canon correctly, technically totally possible. Terrible memory though so I might be wrong.

Edit Oops. Typo in the title. Forgive me, I have like, a 102 fever right now


** linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw) makes seriously good use of the Fidelius charm.

*** It was Slytherin, Harry and friends vs Flamel, yeah. They were hiding Hermione so Flamel wouldn't force out the Philosopher's stone used to save her life.

Or was it Slytherin reborn as Harry?
