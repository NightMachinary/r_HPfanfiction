Not fics where an oc marries Draco, but fics with a full on new and believable cast of characters in the Harry Potter setting?

Something set in the 19th century would be especially neat.


** Er, I didn't get very far but linkffn(Alexander Quick and the Thorn Circle) was all OC set in the U.S. as far as I read, and it is fairly good

#+begin_quote
  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

  Todd Ollivander can't seem to shake his feelings for the new apprentice at his father's wand shop. It's not a good time to be distracted, as it's becoming clearer and clearer that Ollivander's is a major target of Lord Voldemort's during the First Wizarding War.

** A story with no actual familiar characters or plots at all? Like Fantastic Beasts movie? :) That would be amazing if more fanfics were written like that! Just totally original people in original adventures!!! :) :) :) :)

*** Yeah!

I've got one I'm working on myself about a goblin and a centaur who sort of become friends despite how insanely different their cultures are, and it's gonna deal a lot with discrimination of non-human people in the wizarding world and what these two think of it and all.

It's nowhere near ready for anyone to read but yeah. I just really like the idea of wholly original stories in the wizarding world.

** linkffn(Latet Anguis in Herba) and its 3 sequels. 600k words dedicated to an amazing cast of believable OCs in the year above Harry. Almost completely canon-compliant and yet Harry barely makes an appearance in the entire series.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.
