This particular fic has Harry sorted into Slytherin in first year. He's best friends with Tracey Davis who has a crush on him iirc. He dates Pansy in 4th year (the GOF equivalent), she then breaks up with him and immediately bounces to Draco after Voldemort's resurrection.

It was one of the smartest fics I've read personally, and I haven't been able to find it since I first read it. I think if you need any more details I might be able to provide some from memory.

Thanks for the help.

*** That is it, thank you. Even though it's abandoned I'm still holding out hope, it might be the most well done of hogwarts house in house politics being affected by the rumors permeating throughout Harry's years at Hogwarts.
