** Where's the best place to ask for reviews on my story? Is it the review centre? The rules are a bit confusing. What's the purpose of tagging? Can I leave reviews for stories I've already read? How do I know I'm not reviewing a story that someone else just got through last week?

*** The rules for each of the threads are in the first post of that thread... As for the review tags, you tag the last person who posted, and that's the person/story you review. Someone tags you and reviews your story in return. Those would probably be the best place to ask for reviews, although you can post your story in the thread "Pimp and Promote your story"
