I remember both Harry and possibly Nevile were changelings and harry was a winter court fae under queen mab. He had little horns and i think was under a glamour until a meeting in Dumbledore office. Snape was aware of the switch or new that harry was a fae and it would have been on fanfiction.net


** I think I've read this?

Harry ends up with like, a guide of sorts who crosses the boundaries between the fae and normal world who carries messages. There's a meeting in the Forbidden Forest with Voldemort, Snape, and /maybe/ Dumbledore?

I'll see if I can find it. I remember enjoying it.

** This sounds like a Sarah J. Maas / Horns / HP crossover. Fascinating too though, I hope you find it.
