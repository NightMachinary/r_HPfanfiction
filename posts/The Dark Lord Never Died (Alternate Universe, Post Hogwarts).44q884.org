[Promotion] It's an Alternate Universe, with Lucius Malfoy ruling a quite different Wizarding Britain in 1999.

** Damn, I'm hooked already. Really liking Hermione in this one, and Ron. The world you've built is pretty neat. Great start!

Edit: One thing I'm confused about though... Did Lucius succeed in convincing the world that the dark lord didn't die? From Hermione's thought process it seems like Lucius is believed to be the one who defeated him. How does that play into the title and Lucius's original plan, now that he is anti-Voldemort? The three factions you've got going here (Lucius and the Wands, the French Order, and the death eaters) are pretty interesting. Can't wait to see what you've got in store!

*** He convinced the world that the Dark Lord didn't die. And a few years later, he convinced Britain that the Dark Lord, who had "retired to research magic", delved too deeply into things man was not meant to know and went crazy, and Lucius had to kill him to save the country.

**** Ohhhh gotcha. What a crafty plan! I'm liking your clever version of Lucius way better than the whiney canon version. It's a nice (and sad) touch that Hermione holds him in such revere.

** Captivating and well written story so far! I love the changes you've made to canon, and the unique setting. Although, I might recommend improving on the title. Hopefully there will be frequent updates!

*** I'm updating it weekly, on Saturdays. The title refers to the one lie that started it all - what title would you recommend?

**** My first recommendation would be a reference to a place, name, symbol, group, or artifact that the story centers around. It's hard to make a good recommendation after only 4 chapters (loved the last update by the way), because I haven't seen enough of the story to know what the most important aspects are. Ideally it would be catchy/intriguing but also not a title that the reader can immediately recognize upon starting the story. Consider all of the canon titles as examples. I voiced my criticism because I felt like the current title is weakened by virtue of being a complete sentence, and further weakened by being one that is immediately shown to be false, so anyone who starts reading the story after being hooked by the idea the title promises will find that it's a different story entirely.

That being said, here are a few ideas from what I've read so far: The Wands of Britain (if HG focus), Purebloods' Triumph (if LM and political focus), Order in Exile (if AD/HP/Order focus), Infiltration/Exile's Return (if RW focus). Again, the title should ideally refer to the main conflict or character(s) or mcguffin, as well as sounding cool.

On another note, I'm about halfway through your Patron story and I think it's fantastic. After discovering this story, I wanted to read more of your writing. I especially enjoy the creative changes you've come up with. So much HP ff is derivative and repetitive, so it's refreshing to see the same story with a wholly original new twist. I was especially impressed with your ideas about the Dark Mark. Brilliant.

Edit: just finished Chapter 21... I've never been a fan of canon Severus, or thought that his redemption justified his actions, but your version just gave me chills. And your ideas about the Mark perfectly explain so much more about how he has acted, especially towards Harry.

***** "The Dark Lord Never died" is the fundamental lie all of the story, all of Malfoy's power, is ultimately based upon. It's the point of divergence. (And, ironically, true in a sense as well, since the Dark Lord didn't really die.) So, I think it does qualify as a reference. You name a number of good titles, though I'm not certain they are that much better, since the story is supposed to center on the conflict as a whole, as shown through the 4 POVs.

Thanks for the compliments for "Patron". It is my biggest AU yet, with lots of changes. And the most POVs too. I wanted a truly different pureblood culture, since I was fed up with the claim that canon purebloods have a "different but equal" culture - all I saw in the books was some bad copy of older muggle England, with Quidditch and a few magic spells added. I wanted to show a culture that was driven and shaped by magic, and has developed differently ever since it separated from the Muggle world over 300 years ago.

****** I agree, I don't think most authors, JKR included, make enough of the huge differences that magic would have created between pureblood and juggle culture, especially considering the centuries of separation.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Interesting premise. But i must admit not being overly interested because Harry is a secondary character. Nevermind that Harry seems to be paired with Ginny, which I tend to avoid.

**** Well, not liking the pairing or not liking that a character is not a central character is, in my opinion, a good reason not to read the story. I do the same.
