:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Canon Harry ends up in what seems to be an generally "better" AU. Potters lived, Voldemort isn't a problem yet, perhaps some other things. Alternate Harry ends up in canon.

Canon Harry doesn't react very well to suddenly finding himself in the Potter's home with his parents around. Lily completely misinterprets his behavior and sends him to his room. Harry proceeds to have some sort of panic attack.

At some point Snape (Perhaps a nicer/more reformed version? Perhaps even Harry's Godfather?) is in the same room as Harry. He recognizes signs of abuse and comes extremely close to attempting to take Harry from the Potter parents by force.

Does anybody recognize this fic?

  He had done it. This time, he had done it. His uncle had gone too far, and Harry had to pay the price for it. As he lay dying on the floor of his Number 4, Privet Drive bedroom, what unexpected force will save Harry? (Rated T, warnings inside, rating may go up later; AU).

*** Wow just read it and it was great! The suspense built into the story... I couldn't put it down. It's unfinished though, but it ended at a point that I could live with.
