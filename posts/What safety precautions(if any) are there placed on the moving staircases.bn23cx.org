It just seems kind of stupid to me to not put any safety precautions on them when yourin a school of magic teaching 11 year old up to 17-18 year olds. We've all been, or are kids, so we know how stupid, and petty we can get, or have gotten. So has JKR said anything about it, or is there something I missed in the books(which seems really unlikely, with how often I go back to read them).

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Presumably, the precaution is that Hogwarts is sentient enough not to move its stairs in a way that will endanger the students too much. But at worse, there's always accidental magic --- I think a student who fell off would most likely bounce right back up /Ã  la/ Neville when his Uncle Algie pushed him out the window.

**** This kind of feels like you're trying to rally the PTA to demand that the school administration institute more safety precautions. But we can't, obviously, because it's all fictional. What exactly are you trying to accomplish here?

I mean, if you're planning to write a fic that argues that Hogwarts is an unsafe learning environment, I would probably be willing to buy that, at least for the length of the fic.

***** I understand it's fictional, but if we can discuss all the other pointless crap, then we can discuss this. I'm just trying to figure out if anything was ever said, please don't make the "no reason to talk about fictional stuff" argument when you are on the HPfanfiction sub-reddit. You're either on here to talk about Harry Potter, or request fanfiction. So your argument is both flawed, and hypocritical. Also considering some of your posts in the past, I highly doubt you have any right to make judgement calls on discussing fictional universes.

If you have nothing better to say, then don't say anything at all. This comment reeks of arrogance, and of someone who feels they have lost something, so are now discussing on why i'm creating a discussion based on the HP universe in the HPfanfiction sub. It's honestly a little sad, and pathetic.

****** Sorry, I wasn't trying to be offensive. I am all for discussing fictional universes.

It's just that a lot of people in this thread have offered possible explanations for your question, but you seemed pretty dismissive of all of them, so I was wondering if there was a point you were trying to build up to.

The fact is that there really /isn't/ anything in canon about magical staircase safety precautions, so all we have to discuss are possibilities.

*** Kind of. Here's an exerpt from chapter 8 in the Philosopher's Stone.

*"There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot."*

From this it can be argued that they move, but even if they don't, Vanishing steps seem just as dangerous, and again it makes me ask what safety precautions are there.

***** How often would you need to change the layout of a centuries old magic castle. Not to mention that context says otherwise. That particular paragraph is describing how the stairs lead to walls, change only on Fridays, and that there are vanishing steps. Given the context, does that sound at all like it's talking about layout changes. No. Not at all.

** It's my headcanon that magical kids are just a lot more sturdy than muggles. Like when Neville was dropped out of a tower and bounced.

Add to that the fact that a lot of injuries can be magically fixed pretty much instantaneously, and the risks Witches and Wizards let their kids take seem a lot more reasonable.

**** That's not really the kind of thing I would expect to make it into the books, though, even if there were any.

Does anyone ever actually fall off the staircases?

And you know, the way I conceptualized them in the books wasn't anything like how they were depicted in the movies. More like you go through a door up a staircase with walls on either side, and you just end up somewhere you didn't expect. No physical movement involved, no chance of falling off.

But it's been a while since I read the books last, so maybe I'm misremembering how they were actually described.

***** Yeah in the books the castle's floorplan changes but the stairs don't literally swing around.

Even if they did though, safety precautions would be stupid. For a start they already have banisters; more fundamentally, this is a school where the kids play Quidditch. Danger is acceptable and even considered valuable.
