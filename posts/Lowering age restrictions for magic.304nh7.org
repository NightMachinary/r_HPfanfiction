It seems like every other story has Harry at some point argue for lowering the age restrictions on use of magic during breaks to allow students to defend themselves better. Does this really annoy anyone else, or is it just me?

It completely ignores the reasons for the age restrictions, that kids will always do stupid things and the likelihood of getting injured or hurt from accidents using magic is much higher for the average student then getting involved in a death eater raid. At school the student can get medical attention immediately, but during the break this is not the case, as one kid fooling around with some spells alone is very likely to get injured. The law already says that if the magic is used in self defence it is ok, and I doubt anyone is gonna be willing to die and not going to fightback against the death eaters for fear of the law. Just make it so there are no punishments for students if they are using it in self defence. And if the argument is that students should be able to train to defend themselves over the summer, offer a controlled environment of some sort where they can practice. Just some ministry building or room where they can go and train in.

** The biggest reason the restriction exist for, isn't to prohibit students using magic outside school, it's so that the risk of performing magic in front of muggles is very low. That what the restriction is there for. Performing magic in front of muggles is a major pain in the ass for the Ministry, they have to send the magic reversal squad, they have to send obliviators, they to have file reports, sometimes even send aurors and other times have hearings.

Most students also wouldn't be able to perform magic that would cause serious injury or devastating backfiring spells before the 6th year, by which time they're almost 17 years old.

From canon, it's perfectly fine doing magic outside school unless there are muggles present.

In front of muggles:

- Dobby doing magic with Mr. Dursley's guests in the room. Harry is blamed for it.

- Harry doing magic to Marge, also caught.

- Harry doing the Patronous charm in a muggle street. While there are no apparent muggles present, with the exception of Duddley but he knows about magic so it doesn't count. Umbridge was clearly targeting Harry here.

Instances of magic outside school with no reprecussions, and no muggles present:

- Hermione clearly states she's done magic at home on the first train ride before she went to Hogwarts.

- Harry in the graveyard fighting Voldemort.

- Harry, Hermione, Ron, Luna, Ginny and Neville doing large amounts of magic in the Ministry of Magic itself. You would think someone would notice.

- Harry doing Magic in the cave with Dumbledore.

*** I think even in the cannon there is the restriction of no magic outside of School. I seem to remember a number of times in the Weasley household were the kids complain about not being able to do magic, and then later when cleaning up Grimmaud Place. [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Underage_magic][Underage Magic]] goes into a lot more detail on it.

And I think that there are numerous spells which they learn early enough that can cause harm. Otherwise they wouldn't be able to fight back anyway. Either they can't perform spells that cause injury and there is no use in lowering restrictions if they can't fight back anyway, or they can do harm with spells hence they could also injure themselves.

No. It's a perfectly reasonable restriction on its face (also in name), but it exists to put narrative hurdles in Harry's way. Anyway, outside, in this case, doesn't mean physically. It means while not attending school. In other words: the holidays.

In the end it's only about conflict. It's a problem when there needs to be one and irrelevant whenever it doesn't matter. So there's really no correct way to write about it. If you need Harry to turn into Supermagicman over the summer, then find away around it. Or don't. Thinking about it too much just doesn't seem necessary.

** Your reasoning is very sound. The only time I see this being used is to give Harry and his friends additional time to practice magic so that they aren't so unprepared for Voldemort and the Death Eaters. *If* it means that the writer used this as a means to avoid making a superpowered-Harry fic, then I'm all for it. On the other hand, if this is used by the author to simply show that Harry is above the law then it's lazy writing.

** I've fallen victim to the hero-sympathy error and bemoaned the harsh and nasty Ministry for repressing proper development. It's the same error that led me to see Hermione as Harry's true life partner for a while.

The Ministry, if it were remotely real, would never remove the Trace, no matter what the excuse: the point of the Trace is to keep track of undisciplined magic use. If Harry wants to practice he can see a tutor, but the Ministry would want to know what spells he's casting either way. Whatever else is wrong with the Ministry, that's one of things they're doing right.

Perhaps, maybe, and only with Albus Dumbledore himself taking personal responsibility for Harry's spellwork, would they grant him a waiver on the enforcement of the Reasonable Restriction, but they wouldn't stop tracking his magic until they had no choice.

On a Statute-enforcement level it's a bit ridiculous that they don't apply the Trace to every magical citizen, and even reapplying it whenever they visit a Ministry-monitored facility, such as their offices, Hogwarts, St. Mungos and Diagon Alley. Of course it would restrict their freedoms and invade their privacy- their highest priority isn't the happiness of its citizens, it's maintaining the Masquerade that magic doesn't exist.

** In the fics I've read, he doesn't so much change the law as get an exemption from the minister for himself. These are also often time travel fics where he knows exactly what he's doing, magic-wise

** I think a lot of fan fic writers right from their age and lifestyle views, not on how a 10 year old acts, I can really what I was like at that age. I have a friend who works with little kids, and I ask her for input when I write mine
