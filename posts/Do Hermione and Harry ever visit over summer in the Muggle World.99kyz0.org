** Years 1-2, Dursley's have free reign to be abusive.

Year 3 is the same until the incident with Marge, and Sirius Black escaping keeps him confined to Diagon Alley.

Year 4 is where Harry might have the independence to visit her but doesn't.

Every time after that Harry is basically under house arrest because Voldemort is back.

Hermione could have visited, but she may not know his address, may have been prohibited by her parents, asked not to by Dumbledore, or asked not to by Harry. It could also just be the author had a temporary lapse of judgment.

******* I think the idea with that is that unlike Harry and Ron, she has an /ordinary/ home life. She has generally nice, supportive parents doing an ordinary job and living an ordinary life. They have no particular quirks or interesting features. The Grangers (Hermione's magic aside) are people you could bump into on the street, as opposed to characters you could see in a movie as are the Dursleys and the Weasleys.

Bottom line, showing more of their home life would be /boring/.

******** Personally i always liked "the well groomed minds" take on Hermione's life. Her parents are upper middle class dentist who spend almost all their time on work. Their intelligent daughter is raised by the nanny/au pair and the private tutors. The only time her parents spend with her is on the obligatory vacation in France.

********* Meh. I think even that is too "odd" --- I mean, I know it happens a lot in real life, but it's still a situation that has narrative weight, to an extent; there's tension, drama. Not much of it, but "rich parents not spending time with kid" is something that a /lot/ of movies have milked, so it can clearly be spun into a story. I prefer them to be absolutely what they appear to be at face value: nice, ordinary parents raising their daughter ordinarily.

(Also, if Hermione really was raised by a nanny, how odd that she wouldn't send /her/ to Australia for protection too...)

********** True but there is a narrative with Hermione's parents. That is the total lack of them. If she had a good relationship they would be mentioned.

Regarding the australia thing for me fits more with a girl that loves her parents as parents but not much more and has therefore no trouble with turning them basically in totally different people.

But i get where you are coming from.

** Like [[/r/DZCreeper]] said, Harry was in no state to be visited when he was stuck with a household of drill-making cartoon blaggards. It's not absurd to think Hermione might have occasionally visited the /Burrow/, however, though I don't think she'd ever sleep over there (because unlike Harry, she /likes/ her family, and thus would want to make the most of the few months she can spend with them).

They could meet in a random park, or the nearest McDonalds, or anywhere really. And it's not like Hermione would be too poor to spend 20 or 30 quid on that trip, especially considering that Harry has a vault full of gold at his disposal (to pay her back if necessary).

************** Yep i know about that.

I simply dont buy into the narrative tbh it doesnt make sense. To me it always seemed like Rowling wanted some dickensian childhood where the kids get rescued. That went wrong when she started sending him back every year for more abuse.

It went even more wrong when it didn't get any place in the story. Nobody ever notices or brings it up in any way. Neither at hogwarts nor before that: the weasley's, Hermione, any of the teachers, the school nurse, his primary school teachers, not any of the nosey neighbours nobody.\\
Not only that he is indeed starved according to the books that didnt seem to have any impact on his ability to play physically heavy sports or activities. He barely seems to hold a grudge and goes to the efforts of saving them in book 7. According to rowling his and dudley's children play togheter. It basically is a non issue except for the fact that it is happening. You could bascially just cut it out which for me makes it rather a weird part of the books.
