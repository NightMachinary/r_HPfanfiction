** Apparating would mean I didn't have to get up so early and take a train to work. No more walking in the rain unless I wanted to. Depending on the range, I could also go on holiday.

Being an animagus would also be cool, just because. I can't think of a real use for it beyond "scare the shit out of my cat" but dammit sometimes you don't need a use.

** Ability to create philosopher's stone. Immortality is very nice. I also break entropy because I can turn pure metals with low atomic numbers into gold, thereby creating mass/energy out of nothing (at the very least, I can then fuel a Hawking radiation power station by turning metallic hydrogen ingots into gold, then chucking them into the singularity (then use a portion of the energy emitted to make more hydrogen...)), thereby permanently averting the heat death of the universe.

Also, I now have a gold-plated deathstar.

**** Nope. Just a charged (so I can keep it suspended in a vacuum using magnets) small black hole (see for example [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_starship]]). Energy harvested from charged particles and gamma radiation emitted superheating an encasing orb around the BH, then extracting energy from the flow of heat outward. No other exhaust to speak of (other than dumping the waste heat into space, which just means radiators).

The hardest part will be making the black hole in the first place (target mass is about 606,000 metric tons (about two Empire State Buildings), and I need to compress that into a space having one ten millionth times the radius of a hydrogen atom)

***** *Black hole starship*

A black hole starship is a theoretical idea for enabling interstellar travel by propelling a starship by using a black hole as the energy source. The concept was first discussed in science fiction, notably in the book Imperial Earth by Arthur C. Clarke, and in the work of Charles Sheffield, in which energy extracted from a Kerr-Newman black hole is described as powering the rocket engines in the story "Killing Vector" (1978).

In a more detailed analysis, a proposal to create an artificial black hole and using a parabolic reflector to reflect its Hawking radiation has been discussed in 2009 by Louis Crane and Shawn Westmoreland. Their conclusion was that it was on the edge of possibility, but that quantum gravity effects that are presently unknown will either make it easier, or make it impossible.

**** I'd do a Horcrux if I can make clones of myself and then have us kill half of to turn the other half of us into Horcruxes, then using the Horcrux telepathy thing to unite us into a single Overmind. Also, then each of us has a total of one soul (half original and half another clone's), so we don't get the whole insanity thing.

** There's so many. Mind arts, disillusionment/invisibility, levitation, the summoning charm. If I could only have one, I'd probably choose Apparition. Being able to essentially teleport would be dead useful.

*** Hm...did Rowling ever say it doesn't? I mean if you assume the shape of a child, shouldn't your cells (which you have almost total control over!) kind of reverte in age, too? (I mean in Star Trek the Founders, who are shape shifters (sure: They are more impressive than "mere" metamorphmagi, because they can assume almost any shape and even travel at warp speed without a space ship!) are immortal (they can be killed, but it takes a lot to actually do so, so as long as you don't piss anybody off to sick the army on you? Well, you'll probably live forever!)

ps: Yeah, I'd like that power, too (I'd be a master thief with it and nobody would ever catch me because I'd rob stuff while morphed of course!)

** There are a lot of useful things magic can do, but we as muggles manage fine without it. And while imperio, mind arts, polyjuice, stunning hexes sound very useful, realisticaly my life isn't interesting enough for them to be useful.

So I will probably go for apparition (I was very late to work today, could have just apparated!). Or animagus transformation just for the cool of it.

** 1) teleportation, preferably apparition, but if I must take a portkey or the floo network, I shall. 2) cleaning charms.

I have no desire to live forever, but the ability to travel for free or get away in an emergency or attack would be awesome. Also, I hate cleaning, even just one good cleaning charm would be luxurious.
