Looking for fics where either the twins or golden trio/other friends pull pranks a lot or more than canon. Could be a chaotic Harry but idc I just wanna see more pranks. With magic the amount of pranks you could do is endless.


** linkffn(Harry's Revenge by pixiegold)

Overindulges in Dumbledore bashing but the Malfoy/Slytherin chapters are some funny stuff and the editor has edited it to make Harry more bearable
