I was browsing through ff.net through "most favorited" when I saw a lot of fics about Daphne and Harry. I was confused by this. Was there a point in the story where she was introduced? Or that Harry was interested in her? I certainly don't remember.


** Because she's basically a blank slate with which people can take a canon character and create an OC, and various fanon ideas about her have built up over the years.

  various fanon ideas about her have built up over the years.
#+end_quote

Quite ironically, many people who do ship Harry and Daphne Greengrass hate most of these fanon ideas associated with the ship (most notably, the Ice Queen persona, and others like glorification of Slytherins and the dark magic, Gryffindor and 'Light Side' bashing etc).

I think those people once liked these tropes and started disliking them once they got older and wiser, but they are still attached to the name Daphne Greengrass, so they ship it. Logically, take those tropes out, and Daphne is nothing more than a name. It is pretty similar to the obsession with Harry centric-ness, even if Harry is nothing similar to canon Harry. Never really understood it myself, but I think that is it.

It goes like this:

Harry was the protagonist of the original series. As the protagonist, you (the reader) project yourself onto him. You become Harry. Harry is you.

This is why people like Harry-centric. Why would I want to read about someone else? It's the difference between having an adventure yourself and listening to a friend tell you about their adventure.

It's also why people hate stories where Harry acts in ways they definitely wouldn't (in a negative way). It breaks the identification, you stop caring about the character and so stop caring about the story. Of course when Harry acts in ways they wouldn't in a /positive/ way (i.e. being more brave than they would be) then it doesn't matter, because people are fine with reading a better version of themselves.

This also, incidentally, explains why people who dislike slash aren't homophobic. If you're not gay, reading a gay protagonist breaks down the reader-protagonist identification. I wouldn't sleep with a man, and since Harry is me, if he is sleeping with a man then something is wrong with the story.

I suspect that people who are happy reading non-Harry-centric have weaker, or non-existent, identification with the protagonist. They maintain a more "third party observer" perspective when they read.

***** I prefer having such an identification with the protagonist, but I don't always have it. In the original books I mostly identified with Hermione and I felt more like I was following Harry's story than experiencing it through him. That's why I mostly read Hermione-centric fanfiction. So similar motivation, but different outcome.

I can see your point though, when I do read a story where I start identifying with a character, I get very annoyed when she suddenly does something utterly incompatible with my own personality. It's part of why I disliked HBP and DH.

When there's no one I can identify with and I still want to read it, I usually make up my own side character for myself while reading. Keeps me from going mad.

Or maybe they can relate to any well written protagonist while you either can't or won't. I don't see how Harry being the protagonist of the original story makes him more inherently more relatable, especially in cases where Harry acts nothing like the Harry in said original series.

If the main character acts in a way I wouldn't, of course I won't like it. But that's because I can no longer relate to that character, and that has nothing to do with whether he happens to be called Harry or not.

****** There's a difference between relating with a character and identifying with one. I don't just feel empathetic for Harry, I consider him my personal avatar in the Harry Potter world.

The extent to which this type of reader identifies with Harry does not depend on his qualities. His being the protagonist means he is me. I view him in the same way I would view a self-insert.

In a way your reply confirmed my original statement. If your identification with Harry is such that it can tolerate simultaneous identification with other characters, then it's not as strong as an identification as someone who can only identify with Harry.

******** It's not specific to Harry Potter, but I wouldn't say it's applicable to every novel either. I would say this kind of identification happens for any story that has a protagonist/hero. Lots of fiction doesn't have such a person. Literary fiction, for example, tends to be more about an ensemble cast and their relationships than about a single individual, and some stories told from multiple points of view (e.g. ASOIAF) also lack any single individual you can say is the protagonist (except, perhaps, Ned in GoT).

***** I think your whole explanation, while possibly relevant to some readers, is far too simplistic. It doesn't explain why Snape, for example, is my favorite character, even though I don't endorse abuse of authority over children or any form of bigotry, especially the kind that sanctions murder as a means to an end.

No one needs to project themselves onto the protagonist to enjoy reading the story. I can root for Harry without feeling he's in any way a stand-in for me. He most definitely is not.

#+begin_quote
  This also, incidentally, explains why people who dislike slash aren't homophobic. If you're not gay, reading a gay protagonist breaks down the reader-protagonist identification.
#+end_quote

So gay people are just too alien? You're opening a can of worms here.

Look, you may have your reasons, but considering the fact that the vast, if not total, majority of gay readers have had to imbibe heterosexual relationships as part of their daily reading and viewing fare - and that they still somehow manage to identify with and care for the straight protagonists in these stories - implies to me that sexual orientation in fictional characters is not the obstacle you imagine it is. And what if the character is a woman and the reader is a man? Does that mean the male reader can't relate? (Alas, often the answer is "yes.") Are you saying that, since I'm a female reader, Harry can't be "me"?

#+begin_quote
  I wouldn't sleep with a man, and since Harry is me, if he is sleeping with a man then something is wrong with the story.
#+end_quote

Nothing is wrong with the story. Nothing. (Putting aside whether the fic is well-written, as that's not the issue at hand.) I suspect this is just an infelicitous way of wording your point, but "not being interested in reading about characters engaging in gay sex" does not mean the story itself is wrong. It means you, for whatever reason, are uncomfortable reading it. It also means you need Harry to be more like you, or more representative of you, than I need him to be. When you say "people" dislike slash, you're not saying "people who are specifically obsessed with imagining Harry to be just like them, i.e., inflexibly straight," you're implying all slash-negative readers. This is an untenable conflation of a small subset of readers who project onto protagonists with a larger phenomenon - an all too often unpleasant phenomenon within fandom. Members of the dominant paradigm tend to assume their reactions are de facto "normal" because they aren't required to investigate or change them, but that doesn't absolve them of homophobic or kneejerk reactions.

The particular claim that provoked my skepticism - homosexuality feels wrong but that feeling isn't homophobic - has its own sort of redundancy, because it's a claim that gets made over and over, sometimes in the face of evidence to the contrary.

To be clear, I don't care if people don't read slash - or het or femslash, for that matter. People should ship (or not ship, in the case of gen fans) whatever their heart desires. "Wrongness," however, is a loaded word, and it's been flung at people in fandom for years, not just at fictional characters.

blank slate protagonists designed specifically to be easy self-insert are quite popular. Gaming industry heavily relies on this concept. Anime/manga is famous for it. Those are both genres that are famous for catering to their fan base. The entire romance novel genre is built on that principle and that genre was evolved via business decisions specifically built around forcing writers to cater to what people want.

#+end_quote

Try the vast majority rather and if you have a hard time believing that, compare works of fiction in any genre with underdeveloped protagonists vs. particularly specialized ones in popularity.

Look at all the ongoing whining about various groups wanting greater representation of protagonists that are like them. .

That the vast majority of people want to be able to self-identify with the protagonist and project on them, isn't even a debatable theory at this point - over a century of market research in sales of various media and advertising have confirmed this as a fact beyond any doubt.

TL,DR: The small subset of readers in this discussion is you.

Actually, if that's true, I find it pretty fascinating. I've spent my entire career in bookselling, including as the bookbuyer for my customer base, and a large part of that means matching people to the stories they want to read. A certain percentage of bookstore readers will indeed seek out the same thing over and over - this is obviously what a large market share of romance and suspense novels bank on - but the solid core of novel readers were more sophisticated (in terms of being self-aware and somewhat critical readers) about what they wanted in a good book and how they responded to it.

I do think there's a rise in people expecting and receiving stories that hit the same notes in the same way repetitively - trope fiction is spreading, and it's boosted by self-published authors - and that mainstream fiction and fanfiction are moving closer together in terms of how they tell stories.

I wouldn't argue that people project onto protagonists or want to like the MCs in books, or that I do it, too. Just that Taure's description seems far more specific and non-negotiable in terms of how they interpret the character. Whereas in the parts of fandom I inhabit, I'm used to seeing readers and writers being resilient and wide-ranging in their character love and willingness to try different things. The same people will enjoy seeing Harry written as gay, straight, evil, overpowered, slightly dim, smarter than anyone else, angelically innocent and horrifically abused (these seem to go together for some reason), wiser than Dumbledore, suffering from PTSD, happy patriarch of an enormous Potter clan, and the heir to Slytherin/Gryffindor/the elves /because/ Harry is their favorite character.

I am not so sure: we shouldn't forget that just because we aren't a part of a particular subfandom doesn't mean that it doesn't exist and isn't huge. This might be misleading due to overlap, multiple fics per author, and other factors --- including that readers aren't writers, but as a first approximation, go FF.net's HP category and filter by pairing (the bracket notation). I get:

HP/DM: 2.5k

HG/DM: 2.4k

HP/GW: 1.1k

HP/HG: 1.1k

HG/RW: 1.1k

HP/SS: .6k

HG/SS: .6k

Others were smaller. Considering that there is likely to be a lot of overlap between HP/GW and HG/RW (those being canon pairings) but not a lot of overlap between others, I suspect that HP/DM and HG/DM fics outnumber the other categories by at least a factor of 2, and SS/HP and SS/HG are plenty popular as well. Now, consider just what fraction of all those HP/DM, HG/DM, HP/SS, and HG/SS writers identifies with Harry... (My guess: very small.)

Filtering on presence and not pairing produces bigger numbers but similar ranking.

So, my sense is that it's complicated, and I am not sure how important identifying with the lead actually is to what fraction of the population.

** Started out with her being a blank slate. Room for OC'S, camouflaged self-inserts or one of the first characters that got fleshed out in Slytherin!Harry fics.

Nowadays she is mostly known as a cold, calculating, blond hottie that doesn't fall for, or can be redeemed from Death eater ideologies. She is also the go-to option when you want Harry to become this elite-pureblood gentleman or introduce him to high-class wizard culture in general, since the Greengrass family is mostly thought as a high-class family (or noble family in those Lord Potter fics).

As far as the original story goes, I think we know that she is part of an old family, has light skin color and hung out with Pany Parkinson. Thats it.

** It was my favourite pairing when I started reading fanfiction. Still is one of my favourites, to be honest. I started shipping it because it made Harry and Draco brother-in-laws, assuming Draco would still get together with Astoria Greengrass in whichever story I'd been reading. I find the idea of it amusing.

** I remember a fanfiction where she was abused and mentally unfit. She ended up helping Harry in potions in return for DADA lessons and they end up in a mediocre kinda happy marriage. I really liked it.

** Why do people ship <insert character> and Harry?

Because they want to. In my opinion /takes cover in vault 101/ Harry/Daphne is usually better then the hoards of Harmony and Honks shipping that are quite popular.

Since she is basically a blank slate authors can use her as a point of divergence, where Harry goes from canon to AU without actually changing his character, just his influences.
