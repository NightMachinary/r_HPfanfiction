Looking for a very specific book, read it multiple times can't remember it from adam. Lily makes a deal with a genie to protect her son, which unknowingly causes him to become half genie himself, on his seventeenth birthday his heritage comes through, along with letters from Lily and Snape explaining everything. It's a sort of romance with Voldemort? He captures Harry and honestly i just want to find it again if only for the satisfaction of burning out the other badly written genie fan fictions from my head.


** I...

What....

Sorry, the only fanfic I can think of that's remotely like that is a canon compliant prequel that ends with Lily's death, and so far as I'm aware, doesn't make Harry into a half-genie. Certainly no romance with Voldemort in it to speak of.

*** I'm telling you i'm not crazy I swear I have read it five or six times by now and I cannot find it and it bugs me to death! I'd look it up based on tags but adding ‚Äúvampire hot lady who absolutely used to smash tom riddle‚Äù would not help my case. And it follows canon literally right until he turns 17, but veers off with his inheritance.

**** I don't think you're crazy, I've just never read the fanfic you're referring to. Maybe look for Tom Riddle/OC or Tom Riddle/OFC?

***** I wish it was that simple. Honestly when I say i've tried searching for it a hundred times i'm not even joking, it's like it doesn't even exist anymore and it's driving me nuts üò≠üò≠üò≠

****** It could very well not. Sometimes authors decide to remove their works from whatever fanfic archive they have it on.
