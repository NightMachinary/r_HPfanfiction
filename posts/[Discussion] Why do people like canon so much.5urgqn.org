Sure, canon is what we base our whole entire Fanfiction on but I still don't see the reason to being strict to canon. I am assuming that many write Fanfiction as they don't like the original plot/pairing so why rewrite the book with only a couple things changed that doesn't affect the end result. I want to ask you redditors out there, what is your position on fanfics being canon compliant? What's the appeal in reading basically the same thing as the original book?

Thanks redditors.


** If I wanted to read something completely different I'd read an actual published book. For me fanfiction is about exploring the 'what if...?'s in a story. A point of divergence and exploring how that effects the characters and/or plot. Sure it may sound slightly boring, but it's pure personal indulgence and certainly not the only thing I read.

*** Yeah, and that divergence can be exceptionally fundamental -- what if Harry Potter was a Space Marine changes how /a lot/ of stuff works out -- but there's no point if it's different story with names stuck on.

It's a strawman to say being strict to canon means rewriting the book.

****** I have also read those. I'm one of those people who have read probably tens of millions of words of fanfiction of all kinds of things and it's quite hard to find something both high quality and new. I just really love new twists and looks taken even from low quality works and making new and interesting variations from a static base. Something about how so many awesome divergences from a setting that stays the same is just massively enjoyable

** I view canon as a template. It's a good template, sure, but it can be expanded upon, rewritten to fit other tastes - even improved.

As for a fanfic being canon compliant - I feel that this is not positive or negative by itself.

You want to write a canon-compliant story? Great. That means you feel there's something to say that goes parallel with canon events. Hopefully it's entertaining.

You want to write non-canon compliant fanfic? Well you get the added privilege of building upon /why/ your shit is different from canon, what it offers and how it makes your story good. The burden is on you to prove changing the template is worth it.

For me, results matter. Is the story good? Is it clever? Did I enjoy reading it? Did it entertain me? If some of the answers are positive I couldn't give a fuck on how the story relates to canon.

** On one hand, I absolutely hate canon rehash fics because I don't need to reread canon events hundreds of times. I especially hate them if the underlying conditions were greatly changed, such as Harry being raised by someone else.

On the other hand, I do enjoy missing moments from the canon, especially Ginny's POV during Year 6 and 7. Postwar gives writers even more freedom to work with.

My impression is that this sub prefers AU stories, while main HP likes canon compliant ones.

**** You have your main plot outlined, the ending planned, and most of the steps inbetween. You have to then make a few minute changes, and work on characterization a lot. And don't get me wrong, characterization is one of the more challenging things in writing to do, and frankly the most important, but you have to do all those plus the aforementioned detailed for completely AU or wildly divergent fics.

***** I can't see why you think the main plot is already outlined. In my own fics I have made up brand new plots which converge with canon events here and there but were certainly not already outlined for me -- other than I knew where it had to end. Although writing fanfiction generally is easier than writing original fiction, mainly because of the worldbuilding, there are very distinct challenges to making a new story fit into a prescribed set of events and I have often thought it would be easier to just ignore the difficult bits.

***** Not necessarily. I can see what you mean because obviously for something like my fic Not From Others this was the case (but then there is the challenge of making it seem believable and interesting when everyone has their own headcanons), but for something that is post hogwarts like my fic the Aurors I still had to construct a complex plot that was not prepped for me. My readers didn't know what was going to happen, yet I didn't break any canon rules. You could argue that was because it was post hogwarts, but I would say that any good canon compliant fics that takes place within the time frame of the books should also have another plot line that gives some element of mystery or suspense to the reader. If you're not constructing any plot yourself you're going to end up boring people. For example, you might want to show what happened to Dean during DH. Well, you could construct an entire new plot line that wasn't set out in canon. All you would have to include would be that at some point he meets Ted Tonks and Co, and that he ends up at Shell cottage and ultimately the battle. Theres all this extra time that you have to fill, and that is where your original writing has to be. I won't deny that I found NFO far easier to write because there was an established timeline for me to follow, but it came with its own challenges and there were points where it was tempting to ignore canon.

****** I actually would think canon-compliant makes a bit more trouble, since canon contradicts itself so often, and introduces really stupid stuff that would be vastly overpowered, if only someone would think of using them efficiently (House Elves, Unbreakable Vow, several spells, Taboo). So, if I want to stay canon compliant, I have to figure out how to explain why my characters don't call elves in for that problem, or decide that instead of killing the three Death Eaters they'll offer them the opportunity to swear an unbreakable vow to fight Voldemort and help muggleborns instead, or why no one wanted to use the taboo to track down the Unforgivable, etc.

But when I'm going AU I can simply say: My house elves can't do all that stuff, they are simple servants. There are no Unbreakable Vows. Taboo doesn't work.

But Imperiuse Curse, Veritaserum, Fidelius Charm, Magical Trunk, and Taboo are all extremely prone to abuse.

Fidelium Charm and Trace were also implemented inconsistently in the Books.

******** A rather large downside, in my opinion, since often, there is a need for quite convoluted explanations and excuses to make canon fit, which hurts a story. As an example, trying to explain why Dumbledore took a broom to travel to London in book 1 usually leads into "senile!Dumbledore" or "Manipulative!Dumbledore" territory. Much better to assume he was apparating or using the floo, but to an emergency he couldn't easily leave.

**** You're talking about writing a compelling story that people would recommend to their friends.

If the objective is simply to complete a story, staying close to canon reduces the amount of work you have. You don't have to explain to the reader how your world differs from canon. You don't have to come up with a plot. You don't have to figure out how diverse actors would react to circumstances and how their plots would conflict. You don't need to come up with macguffins. You don't need to think how events would change someone's characterization compared to canon.

It's a lot less work for a lower quality product.

Alternatively, if you want to write a higher quality story that's consistent with canon, you have all the work of writing an interesting AU fic, and you also have additional work to ensure that canon events happen on schedule.

***** I feel like if you're putting in the bare minimum you're putting in the bare minimum, whether it's canon compliant or not. Plenty of AU fics don't bother to explain all the differences. They just have Draco falling in love with Hermione and go from there, often without a constructed plot.

** I'm not a writer, but I'm a fan of canon-ish stories. I liked the characters in the books, I liked the pairings, I liked the magical setting, and I want to read more of it.

I want to read more of these characters, I want to see what they were doing while Harry was somewhere else. I want to see these missing moments that weren't important to the plot, but that shaped the characters nonetheless. (/I also like canon-divergence stories, where it's set in the canon verse and everything is the same up until a certain point, because then the characters stay recognisable. Like what if Ron and Hermione got together after Ron's birthday in sixth year? How would that change the Horcrux hunt? Would Ron stay if one of his insecurities was proved to be false? Or would he still leave because his fear for his family and Harry's apparent nonchalance would still be there?/)

I don't read fics that name, for example, Daphne Greengrass as a main character. I have no connection to that character, she is a blank slate and might as well be an OC. Same with fics that have the characters act extremely OOC, if the only similarity to their canon counterpart is their name, then it's basically an OC and I click out. I don't want to read what an OC would do in a certain situation, I want to read how Harry (or Hermione, Ron, Luna etc...) would act.

** Look, when the Canon was published, it opened an entire new world of imagination to the readers. And that's what I love about Harry Potter World. That it showed us a beauty of human imaginations.

An extreme example: I don't believe in religions. But I have read Bible, Gita, Quran etc because all of them shows us a world of imagination (whether it's real or not.)

As for canon compliant fanfictions, I usually avoid it. Because I have an imagination of JK Rowlings' word & world. I would prefer how differently other people captures their imagination of HP world, not JKR's imagination of HP world.

** There is a mentality in fandom: I love this work, so I have read it hundreds of times and know all the ins and outs of it. I know the recipe for Amortentia and could perform the wand movements for the Patronus Charm in my sleep. If someone says something that doesn't match my knowledge of the series, they're simply wrong.

Another mentality in fandom is: this work sets my creative juices flowing, so I'm going to see what I can come up with, using canon as a font of inspiration. Or I'm interested in seeing what other people can do when they take canon as their starting point.

Canon compliant fics attempt to appeal to both camps. So then because they are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue them out of my mouth.

** The way I see it, fanfic is to its canon is as original fiction is to real life. (If you prefer the SAT notation, "fanfic : its canon :: original fiction : real life".) Just as real life provides a point a common --- but not completely common --- point of reference for the readers of any fiction, canon provides one for the readers of a fanfic. Many of the same notions about realism (i.e., how a work of fiction relates to the real life) apply to the relationship between a fanfic and its canon.

In particular, when an work of fiction's setting and characters deviate from what can be found in real real life, including creation of fictional people (i.e., is there a point to this character?), technologies that don't exist in real life (i.e., sci-fi), or magic (i.e., fantasy), there has to be a good reason for it --- there must be a pay-off. The pay-off can be as simple as providing aesthetically pleasing descriptions, or they can be integral to the story, in that the story is not even remotely possible without the elements not found in real life, but there must be /some/ pay-off, because every deviation imposes a cost on the reader: reading time, cognitive (e.g., keeping track of what's different), emotional (e.g., people not acting like they do in real life), and generally makes immersion more difficult.

Analogously, every alternation to the canon setting, addition of OCs, or removal or modification of well-defined canon characters, it costs something, and the change has to pay off.

** I love the world of Harry Potter but found books six and seven disappointing. Therefore I like to read alternative versions of what could have been.

I dislike Ron, I openly admit it so I don't like fics where he is a good guy. He deserted Harry twice and treated Hermione horribly but somehow he is still the good guy at the end.

Snape and Dumbledore were forgiven, another strange idea that Rowling had. Snape was an utter bastard but hey, he lusted after Harry's dead mum so it's alright. Dumbledore was utterly incompetent. He had many important government functions, being close to a dictatorship (highest justice, head of parliament, head of magical UN, Head of special forces) he still did allow many Death Eaters to remain free instead of pushing for a trial.

The romance with Ginny had no build up. Rowling could have written it well but instead we have Harry being a jerk to Dean and stealing his girl with a potion coincidence (Felix Felicitas).

Molly knew about Harry's abuse and of course the first meeting where she loudly asks about the platform seems fishy as well. Still she's a good guy (woman).

Hermione stands always with Harry, unless it is beneficial for the plot not to. Being the rational, analytical person she is she wouldn't have ignored Harry in the summer of 95 or ignored his theory about Malfoy. Also her romance with Ron makes no sense. Treating a girl like shit is not a way to get her.

Canon has many faults and fanfiction can correct them. Therefore I see your point and don't get the love for canon either.
