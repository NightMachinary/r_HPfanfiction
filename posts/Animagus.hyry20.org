I'm writing a story and Harry's Animagus form is a major part of it, but I'm not sure which animal best suits him. I need help, any animal that fits his personality.


** It mostly depends on how your story characterises him.

Does he fly a lot? Is he super protective? Is he Slytherin or Gryffindor? Is he smart, or is he athletic? Is he especially loyal?

As cliché as it sounds, give me a list of character traits, hobbies, favourite animal, etc. or some lines from your story and I can give you some idea of what he would be.

(Or just go with the tried and true bird-of-some-kind/snake/stag/dog/wolf.)

**** Alright, I'm going to activate over-analysis mode for a moment.

Freedom and flight are closely tied together symbolically, so that puts my starting point at birds. From there, we add the craftiness - which to me would mean a /nocturnal/ bird, given the association between secrets/plotting and night-time. Wisdom plus nocturnal bird points firmly towards an owl of some kind.

Add the temper/strong will, and that would put him as one of the more territorial/aggressive species of owl. Did you know that Snowy Owls are quite territorial, as well as hunting aggressively?

Not to mention, given Hedwig, it'd be /amazingly/ poetic. It's almost like it's made to be.

**** Values freedom and hates being restrained both point towards birds, mostly for the obvious flight metaphor. I don't know if there are any birds known for aggression, but wise/crafty makes me think of ravens and crows, both noted for their unusual intelligence.

****** Elephants have been known to lose their tempers, especially at poachers. Same for gorillas. Gorillas actually have quite short tempers. Some great cats are just assholes and easily angered, like house cats. Crows have been shown to hold intergenerational grudges, attacking a man wearing the same mask as a man who messed with them, as part of an experiment, 20 years later, long after the first generation had died off. Honey badgers are notoriously vicious and mean tempered. So are cassowaries.

** As someone else already commented if freedom and flight are big components then you should lean towards a bird. Then you may want to consider a magical bird. Thanks to his lightning bolt you may want to have him be a thunderbird or stormcrow. Of course, like a few other fics you may go for dragon kin so either a dragon or wyvern. Or go to town and have Harry have multiple forms one mundane one magical etc. It really depends on where you want your fic to go and how Harry's forms either helps explain things about Harry's character of helps Harry accomplish the tasks you set up for him.

**** Then the question what animal works in the context of the plot. Would it be beneficial to be able to fly? Do you want something discreet, so he can sneak around? What does the story require of the form? I think it's helpful to start on this side, and then consider how to justify the animal for his personality.

**** I think it might be interview, twitter , or Pottermore canon. I'm not a fan of it though. I think it works better to have them separate.

The animagus form is the symbolic and animalistic form of the wizard themselves. Their personality and characteristics given the shape of an animal.

The patronus takes the form of the symbolic and animalistic form of the joy that creates the patronus.

Harry's patronus memories are based on his feelings on family, both found family and the Potters, tied up in his similarities to his father and his own self confidence, giving you the proud stag. It's possible that his patronus could still have been a stag if James had not been a stag animagus, as much of the symbolism still fits, but the connection to his father accounts for the shape.

Sirius then, finds joy in being Padfoot, in his time with his friends before everything went to shit. It makes perfect sense that his patronus would take the same form as his animagus.

Severus is more interesting. We have no indication that Lily had an animagus form, but its clear that his patronus is a representation of his feelings for Lily. I'd argue that Lily's patronus was also a Doe, and for similar reasons as Severuses. Lily most likely powered her patronus via happy memories regarding her marriage. Her patronus shaping to match James. Severus, who had little happiness in his life other than the times spent with Lily, was never able to separate those memories from the fact that she had chosen James over him, in no part due to his own actions, and so his memories of her were turned by that as well, giving him the Doe too.

​

I'd imagine that its not singular events of emotional upheaval that change patronus forms, but changes in the source memory. (In the case of James and Lily, I'd imagine that if James started using memories of Lily instead of his time with his friends to power his patronus, that it would likely self reinforce as a stag given Lily's doe.

​

A neat thought is that if two animagi meet and fall in love without showing each other their animagus forms, that their respective patronus would still change to match their lovers animagus, as the characteristics for ones patronus would be the same for the others animagus.

​

Anyway, just a bunch of headcanon to consider.

**** It's not guaranteed, but [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Animagus][according to Harry Potter Wiki]] it's fairly likely that both forms are determined by the same traits - the only real evidence either way is McGonagall, who has both a cat Animagus and a cat Patronus.

Notably, Patronus forms are subject to change if the caster is subject to emotional upheaval, such as falling strongly in love - Tonks's Patronus pre-Lupin was a jackrabbit, it turned into a wolf when she and Remus got together.

** Mongoose always works well for symbolism in destroying Voldemort.

House loyalty and going big and loud can always give you a lion, though its harder to play of as anything other than OP!Harry has to have the best of everything.

Birds are often the best bet. They emphasize an association with both freedom and captivity, the caged bird, etc (cupboard, smallest bedroom, prophecy, etc). Flight also works well in general for Harry.

More "common" birds are good choices, Tawny Owl, Wren, etc. Fitting with Harry's desire to be "Just Harry"

Buzzards double up quite well as the most common bird of prey in the UK that is also known for targeting the adder population.

Magpie are very intelligent birds,can sense danger and are known to become secretive when they do sense danger. They also like shiny objects like a certain boy who on multiple occasions had to be prevented from buying solid gold school supplies.

** is harry very socially isolated by his own doing? > non-social animal

is harry very opposed to any form of intense attention? > skew towards nocturnal as well as on the smaller size

is harry most happy on the move or at home?> wide range or warren builder

is Harry averse to conflict> non-prey animal

is harry very curious > skew to animals better known for intelligence/scavengers

it really just depends on what traits your harry has.

also harry has really an almost unique predisposition towards a flying animal due to his severe upbringing and how flight has truly become something he is good at based on his own merits.

that being said though really take a look if you are pushing harry into a bird for what his personality would suggest or just for the needs of the story.

it could have been very easily that harry would have been a very much an agoraphobic person based on having felt safety in his cupboard as opposed to the wider home.

harry also having very little use for a home and instead living with his people might be more of a nomadic animal as opposed to one that keeps a permanent nest.
