** Here's my comment from a similar question a few weeks ago.

linkao3(4913998) is the first in a fantastic Slytherin Harry series that follows the first three books, and it remains my favorite of the Slytherin Harry genre.

linkao3(13760487) is a story where Harry gets adopted by a muggle couple that has great characterizations of Harry, Sirius, and Remus in particular.

linkao3(12985506) is a sweet Pansy/Ron story where they get locked in a manner over Christmas together. Very fluff.

link ao3(12424344; 13912332; 15687453) are three story by the same author that are both excellent. Grey Space is an AU where Hogwarts doesn't start until fourteen, so Harry goes to Stonewall High. In Sleeper, Harry enters another world when he dreams-- one that seems just slightly...off. Proof is a post-war story in which Harry and company attempt to fix the Wizengamot, featuring Harry trying to bake (and, largely, failing).

linkao3(431269) is a post-war one-shot featuring Blaise Zabini learning about football, muggle culture, and what happened to muggleborns during the war.

link ao3(17475989) follows Harry Potter's life with his new guardian- Albus Dumbledore.

BONUS FIC:

linkao3(3652266) is slash, but it's not a major facet of the story-- and its shaping up to be one of the most enjoyable, and, I suspect, tragic stories I've read.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.

** Many authors write on both platforms. I would recommending finding an author you like from ffn.net and finding out if they have fic on ao3; if they do, look for their stories that are on ao3 but not published on ffn.net. Alternately, if it's an author that you like most of their work, see what stories they have bookmarked on ao3. You can filter out m/m relationships, or relationships in general and search only for gen fic.

  It is the night before Petunia Evans' wedding. As she stares at herself in the mirror, she is satisfied with her appearance. The dress is perfect, cleverly cut to give her curves, and she looks like a dream. Yes, the dress is perfection ... but what of the veil? She has promised Vernon and his formidable mother that she will wear the Dursley veil. It is an antique. A family heirloom. It is hideous. What she needs is a miracle to rid her of the ugly thing ... or perhaps a touch of magic.

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.

  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.

  In 1990, prominent Muggleborn research wizard Cromwell Albertson embarked on an ambitious project to interview six Muggle-born students -- before and after their life-changing discovery of their wizarding talent. He continued these interviews over the next nine years, a period of time which spanned both the Chamber of Secrets attacks in 1992 and Voldemort's second rise and subsequent persecution of Muggleborns in 1997. The Pensieve Projection that resulted won a Superbius award for artistic excellence in 2002 and has been required viewing in the Hogwarts Muggle Studies course since 2008.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?

** I suggest caution when browsing through AO3, friend. Unlike ffn.net it's a dark place where you'll be bombarded with the most depraved and evil written works you can possibly imagine. Before you use it, prepare yourself a page of a fandom and filter out all those things you don't want to be confronted with. Bookmark it and use it as a front page (and hope for the best).

I don't generally use AO3 for a casual read since I'm straight and there's far more slash than straight content there. Ffn.net has far more good stories for HP, I feel like.

That being said, I did come across a couple of nice stories:

This one's about Snape adopting and raising Harry. Very heart-warming. I generally hate Snape because when I first found AO3 I found a lot of stuff I could have avoided involving Snape if I used the rule I now utilize, that I explained in the first paragraph :)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/593693?view_full_work=true][Baby in a box]]

This one's amazing. Also a very 'feel good' type fic. Has Snape and an "OC" ;) as friends and a young Harry having a good, non-life threatening tie at Hogwarts.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3926626/chapters/8794045][Sine qua non]]

There's also another one called something like: home sweet home about Harry living and growing up in Hogwarts. Shortfic but I can't find it now.

It's not much. But all the rest I've got archived on AO3 are smut stories xD. Maybe I'll find some decent non-slash recommendations in this thread myself.

**** Agreed.

Like, AO3 /does/ have a very high proportion of explicit fanfiction compared to fanfiction dot net, but that's largely because fanfiction dot net removes explicit content while AO3 does not. And since AO3 is an actually functional website, you can easily filter out fic that's mature or explicit, and if there are particular things you're uninterested in seeing, you can simply filter works containing those things out via the tagging system.

***** Writers on AO3 aren't forced to use specific tags. If I remeber correctly they only have to use 4 main specifications and that's it. 'Major character death' is something you can read in every serious story. It doesn't prepare you for any of AO3's more disgusting stories.

What I said hete about being prepared was 100% honest and genuine advice. It wasn't meant to trigger AO3 fans. I've given this advice before in other threads and been thanked for it. In all of my time of using ffn.net I've never been confronted with the stuff I see on AO3 every time.

I've always felt that AO3 is the 'dark web/deep web' of fanfiction with their include all policy while ffn.net is the 'relatively safe' internet.

I'm not sorry if I triggered all of you AO3 fans who have no problem with seeing smut for pedophiles or other similary horrifiyng content in your search results when looking for a decent story. Personally, I don't like that.

Now if people are always so intent on proving why AO3 is the better website then I find it only fair to showcase what's not good about it. Don't get me wrong there's a lot of problems with ffn.net too.

At the end of the day it depends on how much you care about certain things I think. If I see something unpleasant on aO3 it sticks with me whereas others can just shrug it off. At times AO3 feels like a paradise for the dregs of society who get off on the most horriric stuff.

If you search by kudos or hits without excluding explicit stories you're going to see child prostitution smut and pedophilic content somewhat regularly as you browse the top pages.

******** Oh please. There's far more slash under the Harry Potter franchise on AO3 than there is straight stuff. This in itself doesn't bother me but look at tags like: Tom Riddle/Harry Potter, Harry Potter/Lucius Malfoy and they have more ahum.. 'stories' than many of the more logical/canon pairings.

What does bother me is how many are just pure rape/pedophilia smut stories. And there's a huge audience for it. Like unbelievably huge. Look for the most depraved/evil rape fic you can find and see how many tens of thousands of hita it has...

And it's not just men, a lot of women apparently get off on gay rape. And if nothing is done about this and communities are allowed to exist for such like minded people you're creating a culture that thinks it's okay.

This is a problem I expect the world will soon wake up to. A site with millions of users is bound to have thousands of criminals who have used AO3 as inspiration. And sooner or later someone's going to draw conclusions.

Also, downvote all you want. I wonder how many of you are of the audience I've just described.

** It doesn't make sense ... that's like “I used to read books on parchment, now I am switching to paper. Tell me some nice paper books you've read.” I don't use any one-site applications. Moreover, I have no clue what you would like to read, that's much more important than on what platform you read it.

*** Incase you haven't figured it out, you're being downvoted because your point is pretty stupid.

There are plenty of stories that simply aren't available on ffn because of censorship reasons. Therefore there is plenty of content only available on specific sites. So someone looking for good content on an unexplored site isn't at all unreasonable.

Also if someone doesn't feel the need to overly specify on what they want to read then that simply means whatever you think the best (not slash I guess) stories found not on ffn. Nothing really unreasonable.

**** I love how you completely miss what I meant, but you enjoy your power to downvote me too much. The problem is that I cannot care less about whatever my score is, I don't even know what it is and where I could find what does it mean. Anyway, to the matter.

I was not saying that the author of the original question was unreasonable in seeking stories elsewhere. Just to the contrary, I use three or four sites regularly (FFnet, AO3, SIYE, and I found a lot of good stuff lately at HPFF) and I have more stories from elsewhere. Which is why I was hinting that using those one-site apps is a problem, because you get severely limited in your choice. Download ePUBs and read those, so that you are building your own collection and you are not limited to the one site.

What I meant is completely unreasonable is to ask so generally. My preferred stories exclusively on AO3 are stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][mzzbee]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Forest_of_Holly/pseuds/Forest_of_Holly][Forest_of_Holly]], and [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Northumbrian/pseuds/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]], but it makes absolutely no sense to suggest those, because we have absolutely no idea whether she would like it, because she has not indicated what she is interested in. Seedy Dramione stories? dark!fem!Harry femslash with Bellatrix Lestrange? Who knows? She has not indicated otherwise, but then my choice would be completely useless to her.

***** Except it's completely fine to recommend those since the OP hasn't defined parameters for the kind of stories they want to find. It's not taxing in any way for you to recommend those three authors so the OP has a collection of stories that they're clearly willing to parse through in order to find stories of good quality on a site they haven't used before/often.

Newsflash, not everyone decides what they want to read based on cliched, tropes, and pairings. Some people can enjoy a story simply based on the quality of the work.

And the whole point of this post is that the OP desires to try stories from another location to stop reading from just one single source. It's not insane in anyway to look at the second most popular fanfiction site directly after you feel you've drifted through most of the quality stories on the most popular site.

I didn't miss your point. I understood the point of your post. I also didn't downvoted your post. But your point was and still is misguided and fairly dumb. I only brought it up because your comment was hidden and pretty much no one is going to read what you said because too many people that your non-recommendatkon you started with was counterproductive to what the OP wanted.

OP isn't bad at asking for recommendations because they didn't specify what kind of stories they want to read. That just means whatever you recommend would fit the brief. If you couldn't handle that much "responsibility" suddenly thrust in your hands then you should have just ignored the post and moved on instead of being pointlessly critical over absolutely nothing.
