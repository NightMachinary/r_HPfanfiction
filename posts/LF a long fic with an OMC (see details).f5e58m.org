:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's this one fic i only vaguely remember that had like, a lot of plot, and i think maybe spies? it was really long though There was this OMC who i think was in a relationship with daphne greengrass? or maybe pansy parkinson it's been a while. except he's also this really really old guy? like immortal style old


** nevermind, found it, the OC was actually cadmus peverell [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11208228/chapters/25035075]]
