Im trying to find a certain fanfic where Harry finds a spell to use before the third task called 'Kowe Kedavra' or something like that and ends up using it against Voldemort in the graveyard, killing him but also sending his soul back in time. He goes back to the Marauder's era and takes control of James Potter's mind. Does anyone know which one I am speaking of? I'd greatly appreciate it!
