I realize this throws everything in the air, and I'm fine with reading a story where Harry is alive, ordinary and in the sidelines. I just want to see someone's take on what Mr. Riddle would do when not hell-bent on killing one heavily protected boy.

Much appreciated. Bonus points if Dumbledore and the Order are agressively pro-active in resisting blood-purist factions.
