About a year ago I started to read a HP-fanfic where Harry goes back to privet drive with Hermione and Ron, they fall asleep and when Harry wakes up his parents and Sirius are alive and Neville is the boy who lived. But I can't find it, does anyone here know where I can find it or what it is called?
