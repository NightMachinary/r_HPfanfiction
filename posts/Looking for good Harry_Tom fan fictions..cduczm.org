Hey, I'm a huge fan of the Harry and Tom pairing, but I feel like I read most of the really good fics so I'm looking for some.

I'm really picky so bear with me. What I'm really looking for is M rating, and over 100k in words? Also, I know that Harry and Tom would never ever happen in canon, not in a billion years, but I really dislike it when fics aren't realistic. I'm not a fan of those fics where harry waked up one day and he's suddenly evil for no reason, or that Ron and Hermine were secretly using him for their own gain.

This being said, I'm looking for a realistic sort of story with a Harry/Tom pairing.

** Ugh. I know so many good ones (it's my favorite guilty pleasure). You'll find most of the good ones in AO3.

Sorry if the bot doesn't work. I'll just scream my head off because I spent like 20 minutes on that list if it doesn't, thank you very much. If it does work, let me know if you want more.. disturbing.. ones. ðŸ˜¶

Edit: Oh crap, sorry I didn't notice your 100k word requirement. I don't think any of these are 100k actually, but they're amazing in terms of quality soo..

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears?

  Harry Potter was nothing like the world expected him to be. He's slowly changing the game of how the world works; exposing secrets, lies, and plots no one wanted to know about but will have no choice but to accept and silently growing a following to right so many wrongs. Harry/Tom pairing. Ron and Dumble bashing.
