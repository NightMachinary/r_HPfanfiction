Somehow I just realised, that every time Poppy Pomfrey is mentioned in fanfics I don't think about a nice old Lady.... Nope.. apparently my brain goes straight to the one healer I trust above all others....

Nurse Joy from Pokemon

One of those cases where you go "Um brain? ...U good?"


** I picture a bustling, plump, late 40's/early 50's no-nonsense matronly type.

Like Jo Frost (the nanny) but shorter and less erotic.
