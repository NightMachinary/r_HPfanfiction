Our post flairing system has been changed many times throughout the last two years, so I just wanted to clear up what each of the flairs indicated. You will also see this when submitting posts.

- *Discussion* -- threads that pose a question or provoke a discussion about an element about HP or HPfanfiction ([[https://redd.it/70ri0x][example]])
- *Request* -- for a request for fanfics meeting a certain crieria i.e. Hermione-centric ([[https://redd.it/40xevb][example]])
- *Fic Search* -- for searching for one specific fanfiction that you cannot remember the name or link of ([[https://redd.it/7t6pzu][example]])
- *Recommendation* -- for recommending a fanfiction that you yourself have not written ([[https://redd.it/7zkm5k][example]])
- *Self-Promotion* -- for promoting YOUR own fanfiction ([[https://redd.it/7y1f7g][example]])
- *Prompt* -- a writing prompt ([[https://redd.it/6nth3s][example]])
- *Meta* -- regarding [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] specifically (this post)
- *Wiki* -- regarding the [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] [[/r/hpfanfiction/wiki/index][wiki]] ([[https://redd.it/6c5tgl][example]])
- *Misc* -- for something other than above

Please flair your posts properly, [[https://redd.it/3e71xm][*especially the difference between Requests and Fic Searchs*]]. Doing so allows people to sort by flair (see sidebar) and allows people to see what they want to see with RES filters.

I hope this helped clear up any confusion, thank you!


** I can absolutely guarantee I will screw this up if the urge to establish another post.

Just an fyi.

**** The joke is that a) I'm poking fun at myself and b) it's been over a year since I made a post.

** I would add a note to this that you can also clear out the dialogue box at the bottom and type in whatever else you want if you feel like making your own custom flair. For example, back when the Rose Christo saga was going on and I was keeping track of all things related to that, I changed the "Misc" flair to read "News". I thought that seemed more accurate and appropriate.

I appreciate this sub for the fact that it lets me customize my flair like that - most other subs don't do that. However, I would advise others to save that ability for special occasions and not goof around with it. It's there if you want it, but use it responsibly.

*** I tend to use it to turn 'Prompt' into 'Mini-Fic', because my prompts tend to be...yeah.

I suppose that's not really searchable, though, is it? Maybe I should stick to Prompts for people searching around?

**** I think it's still searchable since it's still considered a "Prompt" flair (same color and everything); all you did was change what it said inside the flair. When I search for the "Promotion" flair in the sidebar, posts that have been custom-flaired "Self-Promotion" also come up. (Although I note there's no option to search for "Prompt" in the sidebar; maybe it replaced the old "Suggestion" flair before I joined this sub...)

***** I just tried it; it's not that it's the same color, it's that it contains 'Promotion' in the flair.

So 'Prompt', 'Prompt/Request', 'BIG Prompt', etc, will all appear, but not 'Mini-Fic' since that doesn't contain the word Prompt in it.

*** LF adds the "Request" flair automatically for people who might forget to flair, but if you're the type who always remembers to do that, it isn't necessary.
