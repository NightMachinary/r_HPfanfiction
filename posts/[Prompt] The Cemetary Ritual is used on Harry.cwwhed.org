Maybe Luna and Dobby (the servant) make plans to restore Harry

#+begin_quote
  Five years after Voldemort's victory over the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter is a man on the run. But what happens when he is thrown into his twelve-year old body in a freak accident? Non-DH compliant. Complete.

** And why should the need arise for Harry to be restored? Like, will it be before or after the defeat of Voldemort. If its after the defeat of Voldemort I can imagine some kind of really awesome Dark Lord Harry scenario, who already was defeated once by his great Nemesis Draco Malfoy years ago, but now has made plans to come back and take whats his/take what he wants once more

  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane. Still, it's the only game in town...
