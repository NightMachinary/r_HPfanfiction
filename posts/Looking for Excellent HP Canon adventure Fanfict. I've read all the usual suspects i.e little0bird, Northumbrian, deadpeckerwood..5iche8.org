I've read a number of HP fanficts and am having no luck at the moment with finding good adventure ones that have canon pairings. What I've read (well everything that i can remember) and what i thought of it

Backwards with purpose I II III. - Good but thought Harry was a bit OTT

Everything by Little0bird- Fantastic particular enjoyed Firewhiskey advice

Everything by Northumbrian- Fanatastic loved/love James and Me as well as Strangers

Most of Kezzabears stuff- Great, the angst sometimes gets annoying but the humor makes up for it

Some of Brennus- Medicore, i didn't like the Dumble bashing or the writting style

Taking Control- Enjoyed the start but it got a bit stupid towards the end

Winters after the war- Amazing, best HP fanfict i've every read

Choices- Very good, i wish the author kb0 would finish it.

St Margarets- Not bad but im from NZ so found those stories involving the country funny

Hopefully that gives you an idea of my tastes. Im a bit over romance and angst ATM so am mainly looking for adventure or mystrey as the main theme, romance is ok as secondary


** Sorry to toot my own horn, but you may be interested in some of my fics. I write exclusively canon-compliant stuff. In particular, you may enjoy Not From Others and The Aurors. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/]]

** /Seventh Horcrux/, linkffn(10677106), is my favorite fic with canon pairings.

[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is another top favorite of mine, check out [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5bf1gs/lf_complete_stories_where_hermione_isnt_a/d9oc0z1/][its description]] here.

/The Changeling/, linkffn(6919395): Slytherin Ginny, brilliant character development, and I expect it to be finished eventually.

/Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince/, linkffn(5677867): Year 6 from Ginny's POV, it almost feels written by JKR herself.

/Not From Others/, linkffn(11419408): Year 7 from Ginny's POV, best in its category IMO.

/The Dark Lord Never Died/, linkffn(11773877): Extreme AU. A very smart Lucius Malfoy kicked Dumbledore and his Order out of Britain in 1981, so Harry and the Weasleys grew up in France instead. The story picked up almost 20 years later when they finally graduated and were combat ready. Ron was sent to Britain as a spy by Dumbledore, and met Hermione, a loyal wand leader in service of Malfoy's Ministry.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

** We have very similar tastes. You might enjoy CreativeQuill, although her stories are all pretty old (I think pre-HBP, or at least pre-DH). She was my favourite fanfiction author for years. Her Chasing Rainbows trilogy or Evanescence would be a good place to start.
