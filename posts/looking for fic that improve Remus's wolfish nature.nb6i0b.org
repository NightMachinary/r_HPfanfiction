so i am looking for fic(s) that delve more into Remus' lycanthropy.

frequently you get harry (And others) becoming anamagi to run with him, but i am looking for more than that, being cured of the curse, an improved permanant wolfsbane, or getting control over the wolf allowing him to shift whenever he wants (and with no pain)

It's part of a series, so I recommend starting from the beginning instead of from here. The author has a bunch of stories set in this world.

  “Imperius...Werewolves...You Know Who...” The last words of a dying man force Remus Lupin into a dangerous investigation at the infamous Feral Institute. Sequel to Oblivious although prereading isn't vital.
