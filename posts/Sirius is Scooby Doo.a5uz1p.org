Sirius learns to talk in Dog form, and ends up getting changed from a Grim into a Great Dane by James/Remus as a prank, and "Would you do it for a Padfoot Prank" whilst he's stuck in Dog form becomes a thing, and then after he breaks out of Azkaban, instead of going straight to Hogwarts, he loses some of his memories and ends up as Scooby Doo. He gets found out when Remus ends up as the Werewolf in one of the Scooby Doo episodes whilst under Wolfsbane.

** You could start it out as Sirius ends up escaping Azkaban, looses his memory, and ends up finding something on the shore of England that sends him back in time, because Scooby Doo is set durring the 70's. Makes it a lot more fun because Scooby (Sirius) has at 'least' ten years of memories telling him he's a dog, albeit a talking one. Plus, Sirius being a Hippy (that's what Shaggy WAS) would be hilarious if / when he gets guardianship of Harry, and tries to teach him the wonders of marijuana.

** I never ever thought that I'd see a Scooby Doo crossover with Harry Potter. I really have no idea if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but very impressive!

*** That could be funny, Permanent Dog Sirius, but I was thinking more "Transforms and Swims in Dog form from Azkaban causes him to get amnesia due to extereme hypothermia, forgetting that he's actually a Wizard and how to transform back, forgetting his name, and thinks he's just a talking dog, gets found by Shaggy Rogers, and goes around solving mysteries with the Gang"

**** Ah yeah, I thought you meant he was stuck forever as Scooby, haha. Wanted posters all over Diagon showing pics of Scooby. Harry is all “Why are wizards obsessed with Scooby Doo this year? How weird”
