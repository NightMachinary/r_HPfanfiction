As the title states I have read a fair few Harry Potter fanfics and can't think of any off the top of my head in which the twins are bad/bashed there are plenty with other Weasley bashing but most don't include the twins why is this ant what are some the do?

Edit: fixing punctuation


** There is Hermione time travel story, in which an adult her is put into an alt universe her. Everyone is evil, and the twins are psychotic killers. They take over Hagrid's hut and it becomes their torture building.

  Hermione is unexpectedly swept into a dystopian world of opposites where Dumbledore reigns as Dark Lord and Muggle technology and the Dark Arts have revolutionized Britain. A Light wizard resistance led by Tom Riddle and the Malfoys has been left to a nightmarish fate. Can Hermione, posing as her darker incarnation, help save a world more shattered than her own? HG/DM

** There's The Real Us by Seel'vor (I think that's the spelling), which bashes all the Weasleys but actually makes Dumbledore and Snape completely good and onboard with Harry and Hermione. I'm not linking it though, because the entire story starting at first year has questionably explicit scene between minors.

****** That's the main reason I didn't post it. I also don't care, although I think there's a lot of people who overreact to it. There is a way to do it tastefully, or at least in a way that isn't pornographic/smutty, like in a coming of age story, which I don't think anyone should be upset about. Then there's actual smut written about children, which I can understand people being upset over, but since there's no real people involved I don't care if people read or write about that.

******* That tends to be my reaction. There's no moral issue with a completely fictional story detailing that. The line is crossed when someone is hurt or a child is actually involved. Nobody should be offended by mere words on a page.
