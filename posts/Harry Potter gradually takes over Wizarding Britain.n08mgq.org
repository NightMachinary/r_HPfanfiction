:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's been a long while since I've seen this fic so the most I can give you is a foggy description.

It starts with Harry after the war, feeling ‘empty' or the like, even when his son is born. Then he joins the Aurors and secretly becomes a new Dark Lord with over half of his men in the Aurors as well. Using the panic he's causing and trying to subtly kill his wife and children in Diagon through indestructible Inferi, Harry manipulated his way into becoming the Minister of Magic, while also charming Purebloods during a party and letting his magic loose to show them his power. In the end, he's overlooking his army and he has the Deathly Hallows symbol on him, while he's thinking that he's death or something.

I hope someone knows what I'm talking about because I've been dying to read it. Sorry if the storyline is a bit jumbled, I can't remember the exact order events are in! Thank you in advance.
