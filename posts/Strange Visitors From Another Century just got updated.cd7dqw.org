** Is that another story where the same guys who founded a school to teach people somehow never managed to teach them their "real knowledge", and, therefore, are more powerful than wizards with a thousand more years of progress behind them?

*** More or less.

That said, HP canon seems to be big on the whole 'ancient lost knowledge' thing, and I rather doubt the Ministry classifications help with keeping that knowledge around.

Old is better is a recurring element in the novels (the protective enchantments of Hogwarts being a thousand years old and therefore incredible not the least, even if it is proven horrifically wrong). The many enchanted artifacts that persist to the present time is another note of 'old is better'.

Perhaps it is merely survivor's bias? All the old stuff that is still around is awesome, but all the crappy stuff long since turned to dust and was forgotten. For all we know, enchanters make stuff to surpass Ravenclaw's Diadem or whatnot all the time. Thing is, we never see these things in canon so we can only really assume that old magics (and therefore wizards/witches) are better because we never really see any modern equivalents. The closest we really find are Dumbledore's Deluminator (or Put-Outer, as you will) and, interestingly enough, Riddle's Horcruxes as lasting, impressive pieces of magic.

Enough of my rambling though (it should be horribly disjointed by this point anyways, as I'm typing this on my phone *shudder*) I'll drop my own opinion.

New magic and wizards are greater at mundane things than the Founders. Basic spells, wand work, potions, all of that has moved forward tremendously. At the same time, the battle magics for use against armies, enchantments based around runes (which the Goblet of Fire, at least, semi-supports along with several other artifacts carved with Runes seen through the series) and other heavy-machinery type spells have been forgotten simply because they haven't been needed in centuries.

So, for me at least, modern wizards are better at more delicate things. When you need to just put the hurt on an enemy though, those ancient wizards of old can dish it out with the best of the modern wizards, if not better.

Eh. Rant over, throw counter-arguments as you will. I'll certainly be interested in opinions like that. Cheers all

**** Personally I always preferred the idea that hogwarts is so powerful because when kids cast magic they release ambient magic and as they grow they release less and they learn to cast better which helps to power Hogwarts defenses. Also I feel like dumbledore being headmaster has a lot to do with it being one of the safest places. I also feel like old magic would take longer/require sacrifice/something newer that can take its place was developed and the predecessor was forgotten. Like in linkffn(realignment) >!dumbledore uses a transportation spell that wasn't warded against because it was older and forgotten or grindelwald had a spell that healed him but sacrificed hundreds of lives. So old magic would be great if you have the resources/time.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

**** I really don't like the idea that the founders knew more than modern wizards. It goes against logic and is basically a shitty relic from LotR. We know that modern brooms are better. That new spells are developed that are better than older spells. That new potions are invented, and that Dumbldore found 12 uses for dragonblood, for example.

I can accept that wards and curses can grow in power over centuries. I use that myslef in my stories - old wards on manors are more powerful than modern wards, but only because so much time passed; modern wards of equal age would be far more effective.

But I much prefer for ancient magic to be obsolete. Like in my Tom Raider stories, where ancient magics are of historical interest, but that's it (with some exceptions).

  The destruction of the time turners in the Department of Mysteries throws Harry, Ron and Hermione a thousand years into the past. There they meet the Founders of Hogwarts, who are not at all pleased about what has happened to their school. They decide that something must be done.
