I just remember a scene where she's on a dungeon-like lab and is showing pictures on a board.


** I would expect following reaction from Voldemort:

Voldemort: “Well, my fellow Death Eaters, this extremely important piece of information actually makes our plans much easier. We will first build enough self sufficient shelters, then seize the control of Britain's and America's nuclear weapons, and fire them all against their intended targets.

Death Eater A: “But my lord, what would that give us?”

Voldemort: “Imbecile! Didn't you pay attention before? The Russian and Chinese counterattacks will destroy our enemies here, and 90% of the Muggles will be gone within a matter of weeks. The world will then be ours!”

*** I honestly don't remember his reaction, In fact, all I remember is that the fic isn't H/Hr, but Hermione is still friends with Harry. I read one that has somewhat the same plan as you suggested, but he baited the governaments to protect their missile silos and went for every nuclear plant and forced them to meltdown. In that fic, Harry was able to freeze only a couple in Germany. Now that I think about it, it might've been Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power. But I'm pretty sure this scene isn't from it. Though I might be wrong.

** Ooh I know a story with something like that, haven't read it in a while but I do remember this scene. Voldemort banishes Harry at the end of book 5 to another dimension, and kills all the others that went to the ministry with him other than Hermione. Voldemort seems to become a bit more sane once Harry is gone, eventually getting to the scene you remember.

linkffn(Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen by The Mad Mad Reviewer). It is tragically unfinished and I can only assume abandoned after so long, and it is even worse considering how close to the end it is.

*** The scene in this one where Voldemort gives Harry "The Talk" is honestly one of my favorite snippets in all of fanfiction

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.
