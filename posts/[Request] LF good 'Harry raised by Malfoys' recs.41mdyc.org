I went looking for some myself and wound up reading one where Harry is 'adopted,' but then it turned into a Veela!Draco, Mate!Harry fic, which.... Not what I was looking for. My Googlefu failed. So I figured you guys are stronger in the Force than I am, why not ask you?

I prefer multi-chapter, but I'll take what I can get. I don't mind incomplete, though obviously complete would be awesome. No Harry/any of the Malfoys, please, as, if he's raised by them, then it becomes icky....

I have tried to read /They Shook Hands/, but it didn't hold my interest.

Also, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like it if you could put a little note about why you think it's good, please? Not required, but I love hearing you guys' thoughts. :)


** Have you tried Linkffn(Enveloped in the Darkness) in my opinion it is good fic. It isnt quite what you are looking for... But it does have the Malfoys as a sort of family to harry. Since you asked, I enjoy this story because it is a rare breed of dark harry story where he doesn't run to the light at the first opportunity, he has reasons for siding with Voldemort, and for the most part Voldemort stays relatively true to character.

Edit: You may also like Linkffn(Growing Up Black) again, harry isn't raised by Malfoys (though harry and Draco act like brothers/ extremely close cousins and do become family eventually). I enjoy this fic because of its unique concept (since you asked again).

  Harry was left at an orphanage after his parents met their demise. There, he finds nothing but suffering until he rejoins the Wizarding World. Dumbledore may hope for Harry to be a kind soul, but he's made mistakes. And what he gets is a future Death Eater. Harry is Dark, Harry is ruthless, and he is siding with Voldemort.

*** Well, I don't normally like Dark Harry, but then, he doesn't normally get sent to an orphanage, either.... And I would enjoy an actually more in-character Voldemort. I'll give them both a go. Thank you! :)

** linkao3(Harry's Cousins by speculating) has my vote, well written with believable character development.

Another story you might be interested in is the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/205724][Boy Who Existed]] series which is kind of horrifying actually, since the Malfoys are very manipulative and Harry makes terrible decisions as he gets emotionally abused.

  The Dursleys have never wanted Harry, so when he fortuitously stumbles across a book on Wizard Family Trees, he writes a letter, hoping to find another family to take him in, hopefully one that won't mind when he does 'freaky' stuff....WIP

  #+begin_example
      I was working on some nascent Lucius/Hermione projects, and I got a little distracted\.\.\.\.  This idea grabbed hold of me and wouldn't let go, so I decided to follow it and see where it would lead\.  \(I haven't abandoned the Lucius/Hermione stuff, just set it on the back burner for a while\.\)  Surprisingly, I'm having a lot of fun with it so far\.A couple of notes/warnings\.  Lucius and Narcissa are VERY prejudiced, and I didn't try to change that \- that's Harry's job\. ;\)  So there's a lot of 'Mudbloods' and 'filthy Muggles' and just, generally, uncharitable thoughts toward Muggles\.  Lucius, in particular, is rabidly against Muggles\.  I smoothed a few of Lucius's more, uh, unsavory aspects, but not his anti\-Muggle prejudices\.  Abraxas isn't exactly a nice fellow, either\.Technically, this is Lucius/Narcissa, but there's no sex or anything in this one, of any kind, and they're just married, their pairing isn't at the forefront\.  No super\-powered Harry, no Lord Potter, no creatures\.  Despite my slight alternate character interpreting, I tried not to go too out there\.I\.\.\.hope that's all I had to say\.  I would love to have some feedback on this, so please feel free to leave a comment\.  I'm very aware that this isn't the only fic of its kind, so if there are any common pitfalls/annoyances in this kind of fic that you can think of, I'd love a heads\-up\. :\)  Thanks, y'all, and I hope you enjoy\.Brand new shiny title card generously created and donated by ferryberry\.

** I'm in the middle of reading this and I really like it so far. I also love Colubrina's other fics. Linkffn(Like Brothers) have Harry raised by Sirius, but he's at the Malfoy's most of the time.

*** Oh, he is? From the summary, I would have thought it was a mostly Sirius-raised one. I will have to check this one out, then. Thank you! :)

**** Mind you, I've only just started it (on chapter 24), but so far it sounds like Sirius is much closer to his cousin this time around and spends a lot of time with her and her family.
