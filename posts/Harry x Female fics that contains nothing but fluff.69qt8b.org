*** I would like to point out that while Harry and Luna are indeed signed up for the same package delivery service, at this point there is only limited romance in the story. It won't be until at least Harry's 4th year that I will be introducing any real romance into the story featuring Harry (Percy, on the other hand, is fair game). So you'll have to wait until the Yule Ball for anything other than hand holding, and even then it won't be until much later that romance takes center stage.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.
