I am looking for something that either focuses on Voldemort's initial rise to power or something that has as central theme the First War. For the latter request, any main character is fine as long as the story revolves around the respective character's perception of the war and the romance is preferably kept in the background (unless to contrast it with the war).


** I remember reading a fic long ago. It was where Harry told Dumbledore to fuck off in limbo, touched the representation of Voldemort's soul, and time traveled to 1943. He tried to steal from some Barrett dude, went to Hogwarts, became friends with Tom Riddle, and saw Grindelwald's duel. I can't remember much else.

#+begin_quote
  A canon compliant, no slash, serious attempt at a TMR JR origins story, inspired by things in the books that remain unanswered. Read the long-ish note at the beginning of the first chapter to find out if this is a story for you. Rating for much later chapters. Genres are more accurately Supernatural, Tragedy (we know how the books go), Humor, Adventure, Romance and Drama.
