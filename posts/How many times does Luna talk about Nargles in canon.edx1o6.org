** Luna doesn't actually talk about Nargles particularly often. I think the only time is when she and Harry are under a batch of mistletoe, and Luna mentions that it's likely infested with them.

The movie has Luna mention Nargles more frequently, but that's likely because "Nargle" is a funny word that's still easy to pronounce. It'd be a lot less funny if Movie Luna blamed "Bithering Humbdingers" for stealing her shoes.

While it's true that Luna never misses an opportunity to mention what's in the Quibbler, it's usually at least somewhat context-sensitive: She mentions Fudge's army of heliopaths at the first meeting of the DA; Luna compares believing Harry's testimony to that of eyewitnesses of Crumple-horned Snorkakcs; Zacharias Smith struggles at Quidditch and she thinks he's suffering from Loser's Lurgy.

*** The Quidditch match Luna commentates is the best one CMV

****** That is an excellent point.

Though one wonders how Luna's commentary would have gone if Ron were flying.

** Fun fact: in the books, /Harry/ talks about Nargles more times than Luna. Luna only mentions them once, as [[/u/CryptidGrimnoir]] notes:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Mistletoe,' said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over Harry's head. He jumped out from under it. ‘Good thinking,' said Luna very seriously. ‘It's often infested with Nargles.'

  Harry was saved the necessity of asking what Nargles were by the arrival of Angelina, Katie and Alicia. All three of them were breathless and looked very cold.
#+end_quote

Harry mentions them on two occasions. One comes shortly after:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Mistletoe,' said Cho quietly, pointing at the ceiling over his head.

  ‘Yeah,' said Harry. His mouth was very dry. ‘It's probably full of Nargles, though.'

  ‘What are Nargles?'
#+end_quote

The other is in DH, of all places, when the trio is speculating about what happened to Luna:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Then she'll be in Azkaban, I expect,' said Ron. ‘Whether she survives the place, though ... loads don't ...'

  ‘She will,' said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the alternative. ‘She's tough, Luna, much tougher than you'd think. She's probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and Nargles.'

** There's a lot of this nonsense in fanfiction.

Moody (?) /once/ mentions "Merlin" in conjunction with swearing, and so everyone start any and all exclamations with "Merlin,...", even muggle born or muggle raised. It's ridiculous. Harry or Hermione, having been immersed in muggle culture for 11 years, unaware of magic, immediately uses "Merlin" in exclamations after joining the magical world. After 11-12 years of muggle-style swearing, it takes /years/ to acclimatize to wizard-style swearing, if at all. It's like the author needs to remind us that it's a magical world. Even Draco uses "God" as an exlamation the first time he shows up on the train.

Then there's Hedwig, being fed bacon at all times, even though owls don't eat bacon and apparently cooked food makes them sick (or just dead).

And I'm getting /really/ tired of Lupin's "furry little problem".

*** Or Sirius-related dog puns. Or Sirius being a womanizer (he had posters of girls on the walls but so did I). Or having him be some sort of happy-go-lucky guy post-Azakaban even though in canon he's anything but. Honestly, anything about Sirius is usually annoying and with no real basis in canon.

*** I'm getting tired of the Fred and George Weasley twin talk, like they might do it occasionally, but not every time they show up.

I'm also tired of the "Be serious!" "I am Sirius!" Joke, it was funny at first, but so old.

Whenever I use Fred and George I hardly use twin speak with them, and when I write Sirius, I don't use the but I am Sirius joke, because I'm so tired of it.

** Once from memory in the books and that's it, like Cryptid said more in the movies. But I actually wonder when I start reading a lot of shit these days if people have actually read the books or only just watched the movies as worryingly as that is.

*** A lot of people haven't read the books for a long time, but read fanfics that follow the stations of canon, so they are under the impression that they do remember the books, even though they really dont remember them at all, like I had to explain extremely basic stuff multiple times, but got downvoted because it contradicted what commonly happened in fanfics.
