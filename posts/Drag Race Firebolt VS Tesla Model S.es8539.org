Given the numbers we have about the Firebolt's performance, the Tesla would probably win.


** They have roughly the same top speed, but the Tesla has faster acceleration. Tesla would win.

I'd still much rather the broomstick.

Also worth noting that the Tesla was made twenty years after the Firebolt.

***** That instantaneous transportation is range limited. It's fine for everyday needs but relying on range limited teleportation and speed limited brooms instead of developing acceleration limited means of transportation becomes more and more of a problem the longer the distance you want to travel is. If someone developed a magical acceleration limited method of transportation (let's say, a flying car limited to 15 m/sÂ²) it'd beat brooms over distances beyond a few miles and portkeys over distances beyond a quarter million miles, it'd be able to do Moon and back in a day, Mars and back in a week, Jupiter and back in a month, Alpha Centauri in four years and Andromeda in a decade. Put a two way teleporting vanishing cabinet in it and you can always go back home after your piloting shift is over.

*** Tesla:

And [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jc-N0_Iwe4][this video]] reports 0-155 mph in 24 seconds.

Firebolt:

At first glance that seems definitive in favor of the Firebolt, but car acceleration is traction or torque limited at low speed, and becomes power limited at high speed. Broomsticks... who knows, but they might be constant-thrust or even constant-acceleration (unaffected by air drag). In that case, the Tesla would be quicker off the line. But I have a hunch the Firebolt would still win the 1/4 mile.

Or brooms might be chunky-salsa-rule limited at low speed and power-limited at high speed, in which case they're UFOs and the Tesla is utterly annihilated.

If we knew what the Firebolt's top speed was, we could work out the power-to-drag-coefficient ratio for the constant-thrust case.

Wizards > muggles, all is right in the world.

** Now that Arthur Weasley has retired, he can work full time enchanting Muggle items. Instead of low end Muggle cars like Ford Anglia, the much improved Weasley wealth allows him to work on luxury cars such as Tesla and Porsche.

The all electric power train of Teslas especially proves to be a challenge, but after 2 years of hard work, Arthur has successfully charmed the first ever Tesla Model S Performance version.

It can fly, go invisible, has expanded interiors to accommodate up to 14 passengers, and can be transported via portkeys.

Ron is very enthusiastic about the new [[https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck][Tesla CyberTruck]], and has preordered 7 of them. He and George plan to add enchanting cars as a new business line.
