I know the most obvious answer is Voldemort, but please humour me.

I like to believe things would be a little different if Sirius had survived and Arthur had died, as per J.K.'s original plan. Maybe we would see a lot more of angst!Ron fics instead of indie!Harry fics?

What about you? Keep in mind I'm thinking about those who were alive at the start of Book 1.


** Quirrel. Had he survived with Voldi in his head, things could have gotten real a lot faster.

Cedric. Another viable source of confirmation that the Dark Lord is back.

Sirius. Some father figure would have done Harry some good in sixth year.

Dumbledore. Much later overall takeover of the Ministry, maybe even never. Dumbledore could have led the search for the Horcrux, making stuff like breaking into Gringotts a lot easier.

** I really believe Arthur should have died as planned. I think the fandom would view Ron's actions in Deathly Hallows differently had he actually lost his dad recently. I'm not sure about fanfic (fans can just create an alternate scenario where the character did survive.)

*** Interesting thought. That would have been extremely tough on the family, and the kids might have moved home to help Molly cope. Bill and Fleur might have not lived at Shell Cottage, for example, and that part of the story would be altered. Ron would probably be very hesitant about leaving his mother alone, and Harry might be too for that matter.

When you imagine Arthur dying as planned, should Sirius have died as well? If not, I feel like Molly would have moved into Order headquarters (which would continue to be at Number 12 Grimmauld Place) just to have people to fuss over. I'm sure fanfiction would be affected if Sirius had survived the fifth book, although he might not have made it through the final battle like Remus and Tonks.

** Quirinus Quirrel. He would probably become Voldemort's right hand man if the stone shenanigans had been successful or a spy for Dumbledore like Snape. We never really saw all of Quirinus potential, he could have been a great wizard for all that we know or a Pettigrew 2.0. He has lots of potential as character that some fics make use of. I think if, had he survived and done lots of significant things in cannon, we would be seeing lots and lots of Quirrel fics. Possibly in the same volume as Snape's ones.

** Dumbledore has to be up there. If he lives then Harry doesn't leave Hogwarts, you don't get the Horcrux hunt so all those fics are dead. You'd get a lot more mentor Dumbledore Fics. His death marked the point in the series when Harry had to leave Hogwarts with him surviving then none of the Grindelwald stuff comes out so we wouldn't have greatergood! Dumbledore. Even if that isn't how the books address the issue it has created a whole subset of fics within the bashing lot.

Pettigrew is someone that I doubt would change much but it would be interesting to see some redemption Peter stories exploring why he joined Voldemort and if it was willing or he felt he had to. Did he try and protect his friends, did he avoid doing much during the war. Does he genuinely regret what he did? I don't think Snape regrets the death of James Potter only Lily and yet the Fandom is willing to write plenty of redemption fics for him. Would Harry ever reconcile with the last living marauder?

the difference is that the narrative does present snape as atoning for his wrongs (and i do think he regrets participating in james' murder), but peter choosing anything but his own well-being is entirely at odds with the character in canon. like a suicidal voldemort

**** I think you're being very generous with atoning. Snape does some good but I can't see it as anything but selfish revenge. Do you believe Snape does what he does in regards to spying because its the right thing to do or to get back at the man who killed Lily? Pettigrew was a friend who sought to survive. Yes he was out for his own life but you could write a spin of events where he was trying to do the right thing but was extremely misguided, it doesn't have to be perfect this is fanfiction. The question is did he do it because he wanted to or because he felt he needed to. You could look at the 'just following orders' defense for him. Is it acceptable to commit morally wrong acts in defense of your own life. Would Peter have survived if he stood against Voldemort, is it okay that he was a coward? If you see his spell hitting the gas pipe as an accident then the explosion was much bigger than intended you could spin the deaths of the muggles as accidental. It isn't impossible by any means to write a fic exploring the inner conflict and guilt of Peter Pettigrew and what he would do if he had another chance.

***** In the first war it isn't impossible to write this fic. However when you take into account that Peter was the one who went out and found Voldemort and restored him to health, a body, and power and started the second war, it becomes impossible to say that he was "just trying to survive". If that was the case, why not move away from Britain? Why not leave it all behind? Peter restored Voldemort on his own initiative.

Did he want Voldemort back or did he want the protection Voldemort could provide? Is him wanting to survive regardless of the cost to others unforgivable? Probably but it could be interesting. Peter is a deeply flawed person and first and foremost a coward who in his quest to survive constantly makes poor choices when all he is doing is trying to live.

  I'm writing about shades of evil. You have Voldemort, a raging psychopath, devoid of the normal human responses to other people's suffering, and there ARE people like that in the world. But then you have Wormtail, who out of cowardice will stand in the shadow of the strongest person. What's very important for me is when Dumbledore says that you have to choose between what is right and what is easy. This is the setup for the next three books. All of them are going to have to choose, because what is easy is often not right.

I'm not. What I am doing is replying to your earlier comment. I am suggesting the possibility of redemption fics for Peter. Snape has those and I disagree with them. I repeatedly say could simply because I don't think Peter does do anything to redeem himself but it would be interesting to read. Snape has over a decade of no Voldemort but spends it as a spiteful petty man protected by Dumbledore. He is not a good person. What there is in cannon that you have latched onto isn't there for Peter perhaps as Peter has so little space given to him. Snape was a bitter twisted person in cannon who when there was no need to do anything CHOSE to be an arse. Peter joined Voldemort because he thought he would die. He spent a decade as a rat doing no good no harm when he could and then he only went to Voldemort when Sirius and co went after him. You can spin these events however you want, its fan fiction.

This isn't about Snape being a good person this is about is Peter on the same sort of level. I see Snape as worse as you can tell but that isn't what this is about, its about possibilities and your first comment denied the possibility of a redemption of Peter.

...yeah, you are.

your first comment used the existence of the many snape redemption fics. to argue for one for peter. it's like asking why there are many fics. about voldemort seeking immortality but none for bellatrix, even though she's evil and would probably want to be with voldemort forever or something. canon sets a precedent for one, and not the other. i didn't say it was impossible to contrive some motivation for peter, my point was that it's no surprise that snape is more redeemed, given how they were presented in canon

as for your double standards, your rationale for peter is that you can *make up* a reason for his redemption, but snape is ~definitively doing what he does for 'selfish revenge', when there's, explicitly, a lot to suggest otherwise. how is that not applying different standards?

******** You're missing the point by a country mile. This thread is about the possibility of fics. What would be popular if cannon was different. This isn't your thread about Snape. I suggested that If Pettigrew lived he would have fics about him as people would want to explore his connection to Harry's parents and about his guilt and involvement in the death eaters. I point out Snape's flaws and Pettigrew's potential not to pick sides but to show parallels. Your first comments suggests that nobody would do it, I disagreed pointing out the similarities between the too. We can pick and choose bits all day long but I believe that had Peter lived then more people would have written about him whereas you don't, I pointed out similarities between Peter's and Snape's stories and you took offense.

To be fair, though, we only know it'd tried to kill Harry because of a command given by the shade of Tom Riddle, the same Tom Riddle who'd probably been the first person since Salazar to actually find it and talk to it, and only when said shade was ... hmm, let's go with “alive”.

As such, while I do not rate the chances of it stopping and listening to Harry if it managed to live past the point when the shade got killed (however that would happen without the basilisk's fang), I could potentially accept it happening in a fanfic.

Either of Lupin or Tonks, with the other one dying, would make for some angsty fics of baby-raising and interesting interactions with Andromeda and Narcissa.

/Just/ Lily Potter surviving and not James is one I've seen before a few times, although usually in AUs. There's a lot of material to play with there with the Pureblood champion Voldemort defeated by a Muggleborn after the killing of /her/ Pureblood husband, the Potter heir.

I also think Luna's mother not dying would open the door for Luna to be a completely different kind of character, as her mother would a) not be dead, which is tragic and would have affected both her and her father, and b) is a blank slate in canon, so could be characterized whatever way the author saw fit.

Myrtle not dying would lead to a really interesting alternate world where the basalisk potentially was free longer under student riddles control.

As such, having any significant deaths be reversed would have had a great impact on fanfiction, but not for the positive.

I think the most interesting stories might have come about if Lily had lived while still making Harry the chosen one; it would mean that James had sacrificed his life to protect his son in a way that drives the story quite differently.

**** From a literary standpoint she could be in griffindor with Harry which given hiw isolated the hogwarts schooling is does make it easier to believe that a romance would be an option.

***** You could also take Sophie Roper, Sally Smith or whatever-her-name-is - Runcorn. They could've all been in Gryffindor according to the wiki.

But it doesn't matter, I could just write [random name] [random surname] into Gryffindor, nobody gives a shit. They are all essentially OC's, the only difference is that they happen to have a name. If you need a Gryffindor for Harry to romance, write one. If you don't make Perks an issue, she isn't one.
