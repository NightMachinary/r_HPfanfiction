Looking for fics that are the first of their kind. That really set the standard for tropes. Thanks.


** Dunno about first of their kind, but I think it was Cassandra Clare's Draco trilogy that started (or made prominent) some of the stuck characterizations of Draco Malfoy (bad boy, sarcastic instead of just mean, +intelligence). Her stuff is easy to find even though it's all been 'removed'

** /Nightmares of Future Past/ is one of the very first Peggy Sue fanfics, featuring a character going back in time, and the related Tropes.

**** It could be the the first peggy sue as someone else said. But as far as time travel, in general, it's definitely not. I remember reading a bunch of time travel fics way before 2005. It's one of my not so guilty pleasures.

***** Yeah, there's more to time-travel than Peggy Sue--which is go back to the younger body, being Overpowered and then saving everyone.

There's a bunch of fanfics featuring someone--usually Hermione--going back in time to the Marauder Era. Never read any one of those all the way through.

** I was pretty late to the HP fandom, but I think the Sacrifices Arc was pretty influential for a lot of tropes. I don't know if it was the first for any of these, but I'm sure it propagated a ton of them effectively.

Evil/manipulative Dumbledore.

Wrong boy who lived

Abused Harry

Mentor Snape

Politics: Did a decent job imo, with age appropriate language, and no excessive formalities or rituals. Other fics often miss this.

This sort of Drarry relationship: I am not sure how to describe it, I've read only a few other slashfics with this pairing, but I see similarities. Co-dependent, with an abused Harry looking for comfort. The Malfoys, mostly Draco provide a refuge.

Not a fan of this particular pairing, so I could be totally wrong here.(any good Harry/not an antagonist and also age appropriate with plot?)

Old fans feel free to correct me.

*** Not going to lie, that trilogy is like the hardest chunk of writing to read on FFN. I would rather read HPMOR in a 24 hour period than subject myself to Sacrifices again.

*** I was reading it while it was still being posted and remember people talking about "Doing the cliches right." I never finished that one, and didn't read a whole lot of that pairing to begin with, so I could be remembering wrong.

One of the first time travel fics is Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past (linkffn(2636963))

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

** I think Oceanbreeze7 claimed to be the first to write fics which did the whole characters watch/read the series. It was set in Avengers, and I can't confirm it anyway, but just a heads up.
