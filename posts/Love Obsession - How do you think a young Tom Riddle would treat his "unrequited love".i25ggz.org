I feel like he would be obsessed, and it would not be "love." It would be a desire to "own" something, or other desires that he confuses as love. I'm asking this because I'm writing a fanfiction where Journal Horcurx Tom thinks he's ""iN lOvE.""

This I not meant to be romantic. Its meant to be romance twisted into a horrorifc...abomination, not unlike Voldemort himself.

This is meant to be upsetting and or disturbing, not a love story. However it can be romantic or sweet at times, but the overall theme is meant to be disturbing.

What do you think? Thoughts opinions? Suggestions? Fanfiction recommendations that you feel are a good example?

Thank you! ^ _ ^


** I always write it as obsession. Some disorders/areas related to that which might be interesting to read up on, and which I have done research into for my fics, are obsessive love disorder and the yandere trope.

In my mind, he is constantly thinking through the lens of ownership and trying to be the one the person he is interested in relies on so that they cannot leave him. Very possessive and, in an ideal world, would not even allow that person to interact with others - certainly not without him around. There may be sweet/romantic moments, but they are always just an attempt to manipulate the person and make them give in to what he wants. Also very ends/goal oriented, like he wants the person for a specific reason, ex. their power, money, status, or other ability to help him with his plans for world domination.

At least for the way I write him, I don't think he would even entertain the idea that he is in love tbh. My headcanon is that, since he was so often told he was crazy growing up, he read up on psychology while he was still in the muggle world, so he knows he is a sociopath, and he understands how to manipulate other people. I also think he would be aware of the fact that he cannot really feel emotion/love, or at least think that was the case - whether that is the case I think is really subjective depending on what you think "love" is. If love is putting another's happiness above your own even if that means them not being with you, or sacrificing your own hopes/dreams for them, I don't think he would ever go for that.

My latest fanfiction for him is a Tom Riddle/OC story, The Untold Years. I think it has a lot of good examples of this mindset already though it is still a work in progress and creepier/crazier things are coming soon. linkffn(13549064).

I don't want to spoil anything if you are interested in reading it - but if not (I won't be offended), I would be happy to give some examples from it, including upcoming escalations in his obsessive ways I am thinking of putting in. He is my fav character to write and I would love to talk more about him with another fan :)

  Between Hogwarts and the First Wizarding War, there is a time in Tom Riddle's life that no one talks about. There are plots and lies that not even Dumbledore knows. And there is a woman. Yes, there is a woman as deadly as Tom himself, and he cannot wait to wrap her around his finger. Or: How Tom Riddle went off the deep end, and who he took along for the ride.

*** Thank you for your insight!

Though it is a bit frustrating not to have more voices. 40% upvote rate oof

**** Yeah, Tom Riddle doesn't get the love as a character I think he deserves. I find him to be fascinating, but I understand why he is not popular as I don't think JK wrote Voldemort with clear motivations or an interesting rise to power. In the books/movies, he just seems like an archetypical big bad who is evil for the sake of being evil.

As far as I have seen, he is a relatively rare character to write/read in the fandom. Most of the activity tends to be Tom Riddle/Hermione fics or Tom Riddle/fem!Harry. Personally, I haven't found most of those stories to be compelling because they usually get pretty OOC with at least one of the characters in my opinion. Don't get me wrong though, some of those stories are amazing! Just not my cup of tea generally and I will admit I haven't read much fanfic myself over the last few years so hard to think of recs that aren't already among the top reviewed stories on FFN/AO3.

TBH, if you are planning to write a Tom Riddle story, unless it is one of the above pairings which are the most widely read in that niche, you might not get a lot of feedback/fan interaction. I have found it easy to get discouraged from writing when I focus on reviews, etc. since I only write Tom Riddle/OC.

***** As someone who's had to deal with abuse and neglect, not unlike Harry and Tom, i can really understand both of them. I hate to admit it but if I had magic and was powerful I would probably become a dark witch because of that. But there's the part of me that understands that pain and hope are two sides of the same coin, that makes me like Harry as a character. He's an ideal. I used to get in alot of fights at school and was an obstinate child. It was because I was smart, and angry. People who are like that, and that are in bad situations, have two routes they can take, as show through Harry and Tom.

Anyway I'm getting a bit rambly, I just love Tom and Harry, especially if they're shown as friends, because it reminded me of myself and where I've come from and the possibilities I can chose.

I no longer blatantly disregard rules, have broken my antisocial nature, and because more "human" in a way.

I'm not sure if that made much sense...

****** Yes, that makes perfect sense and sounds like an interesting take :) I definitely encourage you to write what is in your heart, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want any advice during the process! I would be happy to beta or give feedback on any of your writing if you'd like.

I would just say to be aware that, with fanfic, it can be frustrating because many people don't review/comment/interact even if they do read and enjoy your work, so don't get too caught up on the numbers.

** I was always a sucker for "villain falls for one sweet person and would do anything short of becoming better for them" stories. I wonder if I should create a story search post for them because I'd love to read some with Voldemort.

*** Yeah, that would be a good idea, link it in this post so others can reference it.

But are there any scenarios you want to request or idea to explore? I'm open to any opinions and wants
