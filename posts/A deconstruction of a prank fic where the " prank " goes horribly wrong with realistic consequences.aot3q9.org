Maybe pranking Fudge counts as assault. Or maybe Cho suffers a severe allergic reaction to the cream used to turn her face into that of a hag. Go nuts.


** Canon. Black lures Snape to the Shrieking Shack, and James has to risk his life to save Snape. Snape owes a life debt and increases his hate of the Marauders even more. Lupin's illness is now less of a secret. The prank is potentially the catalyst that pushes Snape toward the Death Eaters. Potentially drives a wedge between the Marauders and makes them suspect each other during the Secret Keeper/Potter murder mess. Snape's hatred for the Marauders and Gryffindors carries over, at least in part, in him becoming a bully in turn to the students. The Snape/Marauders grudge colors the events of POA through OOTP and leads to some bad outcomes in general.

** Canon. Sort of. It's horrible. :( I hate Fred and George for this. It's from OOTP.

  a week after Fred and Georges departure Harry witnessed Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves, who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier, and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth, 'It unscrews the other way.'

  *To cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from his sojourn in the toilet; he remained confused and disorientated and his parents were to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up the front drive, looking extremely angry.* 'Should we say something?' said Hermione in a worried voice, pressing her cheek against the Charms window so that she could see Mr and Mrs Montague marching inside. 'About what happened to him? In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him?' 'Course not, he'll recover,' said Ron indifferently. 'Anyway,'

They did lasting mental damage to Montague, that his PARENTS showed up for him over it A WEEK LATER, and nobody gives a shit!!! Not our "heroes", not Fred or George. It's just some passing thing that they did purely because they wanted to cause chaos for Umbridge!

*** Montague willingly joined the Inquisitional Squad, voluntarily working for a woman who was working for an obviously corrupt regime and tortured students (unless Harry wore gloves and Lee Jordan for some reason also did, everyone would have seen the scars).

And given that Voldemort's return was unquestionable (Malfoy wouldn't shut up about it, the sudden smear campaigns and the Ministry trying to silence the truth), it was also clear that working for Umbridge directly helped Voldemort.

Now, Fred and George probably didn't think that far, but with the benefit of hindsight, their actions were not unreasonable for a collaborator. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEvyEM0JdSc][The Allies were quick to execute them in France for similar transgressions after all]]

** There was a good Dursleys fic or something where they were visiting Hogwarts and a prank accidentally hospitalized one of them (I don't remember which one) because muggles react to magic differently. There was another Angry!Harry fic with something similar as well.

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

** Mentioned in “James and Me” by Northumbrian linkao3(James and Me): the narrator, then thirteen (or how old exactly is later matter of discussion) Muggle girl gets a beautifying cream from James Potter (son of Harry) and it makes boils all over her body. It is more complicated, but no spoilers here.
