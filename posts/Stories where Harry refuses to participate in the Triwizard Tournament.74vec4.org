There are many stories where Harry tries to get out of the tournament but he always caves and takes part. I am looking for stories where he absolutely refuses to participate either has to suffer the consequences or Barty does.


** Well, Harry does participate in the First Task, but he refuses to partake in the Second Task in this story. It's funny as hell, and written by the same genius who wrote "A Dramatic Reading."

  One-shot. Harry suspects the Second Task will involve hostages, but he still can't find a way to breathe underwater. In his desperation, what other options might he devise?

**** Blank-slate Slytherin who is sympathetic in most fanfics?

Also, say what you will of Cursed Child, learning that Astoria softened Draco's heart and rejected pure-blood mentalities was actually very nice (And among the only things I liked about that play. How I hated that play!)

**** I like her name, and JKR saying good things about her in interviews and CC helped too.

And I'm getting tired of Daphne the Ice Queen, how about Astoria the Ice Princess?

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

  When Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire Dumbledore gives him a choice. Either participate in the tournament or lose his magic and leave Hogwarts. The Headmaster would never have guessed that Harry would lash out angrily and choose the latter. Minor Ron and Dumbledore bashing at the start. Wizarding War on a quicker timescale than in canon. H/Hr. My first FanFic. Complete.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
