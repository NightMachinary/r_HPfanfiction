Hi team,

Really under the weather today today I was looking for some light fic reading to get me through. I'm looking for something finished, long (50k+), light-hearted (doesn't need to just be fluff, but no 200 pages of angst or horror) and preferably set at school.

I've read literally everything in the "most commonly recommended fics" page.

** I've been reading linkffn(Weasley Girl) lately. Perhaps the best canon-flavor out there, without being in any way a canon rehash.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

** An OC-centric fic is definitely off the beaten path. I know you might be skeptical of stories that don't follow Rowling's characters, but my suggestions below are some of my favorite pieces of fanfiction. I love these four Slytherins as much as I love the Golden Trio.

Start with linkffn(Latet Anguis In Herba) to get to know the characters.

And then jump into the excellent linkffn(Shade to Shade)

** Since it isn't on that list, I think you'd enjoy linkffn(6919395) /The Changeling/ and its sequels. It's Harry/Ginny where Ginny was sorted into Slytherin, but the first fic mostly focuses on Ginny figuring out /why/ she was sorted Slytherin rather than romance. Annerb is excellent at writing character relationships and a believable slowburn romance. It tends to stick to canon for the first book, but it's all from Ginny's perspective. The sequels all happen after the war is over, so is pretty much entirely original. (Annerb also just has a large quantity of well-written Harry/Ginny fics, /Changeling/ is just her most well-known fic.)

linkffn(12578431) /The Chessmaster/ series has three completed books and is on the fourth, and the author usually updates at least twice a month, if not every week. The premise is if Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all sorted into Slytherin, and it has fascinating worldbuilding that diverges from canon.

linkao3(8125531) /Hogwarts, to welcome you home/ is a post-DH story where Harry becomes the DADA professor.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][/boy with a scar/]] is a series of one-shots that explore various "what ifs". They tend to feel a bit same-y after a while because they hit stations of canon a lot, but they have happy endings. I highly recommend "he will have power the dark lord knows not" (Squib!Harry), "the kids who chose themselves" (both Harry and Neville are dead and there is no chosen one), and "the last son" and "the brightest witch of her age" (Ron and Hermione as the Chosen Ones, respectively).

Entirely unrelated to HP, but if you're a fan of Great British Bake-Off at all, this is a hilarious one-shot where someone, doing the classic "challenge Death to a game for your life", challenges Death to a Bake Off. linkao3(17050883)

Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.
