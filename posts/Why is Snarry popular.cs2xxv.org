I have nothing against Slash pairings. Infact I quite enjoy some time travel Tomarry fics and can see the appeal in Drarry.

But how can a pairing between an ugly 30+ teacher and a student be so popular? Especially when most people picture Alan Rickman as Snape which makes the whole thing even more disturbing. I mean I have seen multiple fics with a 4th-6th year Harry being practically forced by magic or some such into sexual acts with a teacher. Not to mention that it is extremely creepy that Snape was in love with Harry's mother and then dated her son. (who is of another sex(which is easily fixed by making him bi but is still a further leap you have to take for Snarry to "work"))

So Snarry shippers can you tell me why you like the Pairing?

PS: I don't want to offend anyone. I just told you my opinion and wanted to know why so many people completely disagree with me.

PPS: This has kind of escalated into a discussion about Pedophilia and for some reason Alan Rickmans attractiveness. I'm really quite the hypocrite when I condemm Snarry fics for Pedophilia since I massively enjoy fics like Historical Importance which feature a massive age gap between Harry and Voldy. So yeah... keep it down with the "you are a pedophile" comments...


** I don't like the pairing, but I don't know dude, I would not call Alan Rickman ugly. I guess as a hetero male I don't have the deepest insight into the attractiveness of other males, but he looked pretty good to me:

Also, I am a bit baffled that you seemingly are ok with Harry/Draco and Harry/Voldemort, both of which need SO MUCH work and so many "leaps" as you called them, to make them plausible. At least to my mind Harry/Snape is by far the easiest to grasp concept of those three pairings.

And you using the examples you did, shows me you were struggling to find arguments. Because a teacher Snape forcing Harry into a relationship is not a usual trope with this pairing lol. No idea what fics you supposedly read, but they are not ones of the top 80% of fics featuring the pairing. I mean, if you search for the pairing and sort by reviews on ff.net of the first like 100 results 95 play post-Hogwarts, giving your argument the last push towards death.

***** I think their actions are more or less equally bad. However, I think that Snape's DE actions is entirely redeemed in the end (I'm far less certain about his behaviour while he was a Hogwarts teacher, but that's not something I'd put him in Azkaban for or similar, but rather just fire -- perhaps give him a single year of probation to see if it was fallout from his other work or if he's truly an asshole teacher), while Draco has yet to go through the path to redemption.

But despite all this, Snarry has inherent flaws that has little to do with Snape's moral standing -- their history is far more antagonistic, Harry is the son of a childhood bully and past love interest (this especially can be a major danger to a healthy relationship). They also have a huge age gap.

And as you said, Snape has been on the path of redemption for many years, being a spy for the light. While Draco, if allowed, would have gladly become a full blown Death Eater. At least in my head canon, because his character showed no signs of change to the better over time.

And lastly, age has never been an argument to me against a relationship. But I know it is for many others, so I give you that one :D

That might make the fic more /interesting/, but it doesn't really make the ship more /plausible/ which is what I was getting at.

FWIW, age matters little for me (beyond "are both adults, or both teens? all right, we're good"), but is a common argument people use. Given that I don't actually read Snarry generally, I was merely trying to be objective. :P

He singlehandedly reduced the number of applicants for highly qualified positions like the Aurors by a big margin (66% if you assume a normal distribution of grades). Do you have any idea what kind of impact that had? How many deaths could most likely have been prevented if you had more Aurors, Healers and the like, especially after a bloody civil war?

There are smut fics on ao3 that have Harry being turned into a kid, adopted by Hermione and they then start a relationship when he is still in Hogwarts. You saying all Harry/Snape fics feature pedophilia is basically the same as if I used those few fics to argue that all Harry/Hermione fics do too.

  *An Introduction: (or Why Snape/Filch is like Escargot)*

  It strikes me as telling that when I first sat down to write this essay, I contemplated titling it "In Defence of Snape/Filch." After all, in the wizard-swapping world that is the Harry Potter slash fandom, this is one of the rarest pairings when it comes to characters who have actually shared scenes in canon - and is perhaps the one that provokes the most negative reactions in lieu of simple disinterest. 'Ick' is the term that tends to come up the most, I believe.

  This obviously gave me pause, and yet as I further sorted through the tangle of why I love this pairing so much - rereading canon scenes and favourite stories alike - it became obvious that Snape and Filch don't require a defence at all. Rather, in the tradition of many of the finer things in life, this pairing is simply an acquired taste.

  Like certain unpronounceable dishes on the menus of fancy French bistros, it may look strange, it may look frightening, and you might wonder who in their right mind ever came up with that combination. But with a bit of courage and the right cooks, you may find yourself hooked after only one bite.
#+end_quote

--------------

#+begin_quote
  *But Isn't Filch...Ugly?*

  And here we have it, the crux of things - the protest to which this instinct for a defensive treaty arises.

  The answer is: Yes.

  With an addendum: But so is Snape.

  *Or rather, they're both men who are more likely to resemble someone you'd meet in the street than someone you'd find on a Hollywood screen. Like the song says, you don't have to be a supermodel to do the animal thing. People of less than stellar looks have sex too, and in a written media like fanfiction, a mental picture should take the backseat to compelling imagery and well-written emotional motivation.*

  And to be honest, the lack of pretty is one of the factors of this pairing that appeals to me the most. In many other pairings, there is an effort to give Snape a "makeover" so that he compares to his partner. His hair isn't greasy - it's just cauldron fumes. His nose isn't really all that big, and his teeth are white, and he's hiding a magnificent body under those robes.

  To take this even further, I think it's fair to say that most popular Snape pairings require him to change drastically inside as well as out. After all, as it stands in canon, Snape doesn't like Harry or Remus or Sirius or Hermione. To bring them together in anything resembling a healthy way, Snape usually has to make amends for his past behaviour, see the error of his ways, and suddenly become a whole lot nicer if he wants to keep his partner. Which, while it can be very well-written as character development, is a trifle unsatisfying at times.

  Is it so far-fetched that Snape might actually want to be with someone who...well, likes him? Someone he, true to Slytherin form, can feel just a tiny bit superior to, and therefore trust not to hurt him?

  A short-lived series of private lessons took place after Christmas in Harry Potter's fifth school year, during which Severus Snape attempted to teach Harry the skill of Occlumency. The lessons were finally cancelled when Harry was caught prying into Snape's memories, discovering the strangest things: there was a Prophecy about him, his dad was a bully, and Severus Snape had been in love with Harry's mum. Naturally, Harry now has a million questions. Snape would prefer to answer none. The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes. The same question rises in every soul: "For what, for whom, must I kill and be killed?" ...Or, a classic approach to stubbornness.

*** I don't want people to be offensive and speak out against Snarry. I want people who like Snarry tell me why they like the pairing, because I don't understand it.

The thing with Rickman was a side point. My main point was: Why do people ship a relationship between a 30+ year old teacher and his student, especially when said teacher obviously preferres women and had a weird obsession/crush on the mother of said student. And adding to all of that why do they do it in such weird a/b/o or creature fics that force their relationship.

It's an easy way to create an obstacle to the relationship, and quite frankly, a lot of people like it BECAUSE of the taboo aspects.

What's more unusual in mainstream stories in this day and age is combining teacher/student with underage, but even on AO3, just 10% of Snarry fics are tagged underage (currently 1155 fics out of 11510 total). Most Snarry fics take place post-Hogwarts. I think you're allowing a minority of fics to color your impression of the entire ship.

It's interesting that you talk about evidence, and yet you haven't responded to any of my comments that clearly pointed out why your cherry-picked a/b/o examples are not representative.

Maybe you'll understand better why posting a few story links is not 'evidence' if we turn it arround a little? Here's what we would find if we applied your own standard of evidence to a pairing /you/ like:

If we search for Harry Potter/Tom Riddle fics on Ao3 and sort by kudos, on the first two result pages we find:

- 9 fics tagged with "underage" or otherwise clearly depicting a daliance between underage Harry and an adult man.

- 2 fic tagged with mpreg

If we abided by your methods, then we must judge that HP/TMR is a terrible pairing typified by 'pedophilia' and mpreg, and your own preferences regarding the pairing are so annecdotal as to be ignorable.

That is not what I believe, but it is essentially what you have said to everyone in this thread who pointed out why your examples are not representative of the Snarry fandom.

** While I find this ship implausible (and outright unhealthy considering their history) in regular circumstances, I have read a few fics making it more plausible. Fem!Harry/Severus (or "Snarriet" as it's referred to by some) is more plausible, but remains unhealthy (even moreso given whose daughter it is -- how much of it is merely projection of his past love interest?).

The only way to make this ship plausible IMO is to throw Harry back in time to the Marauder era, before they have a history of antagonism and Harry to Snape is just another person and not the son of his past bully and childhood crush. It's also the only way I can see the relationship become a healthy one. This is also the only kind of Snarry I can personally read (or rather Snarriet, since I don't usually read slash) without finding the idea offputting.

However, no matter how implausible or unhealthy a ship is, why practice ship shaming? There's people who love reading Tomarry fics, and I find that ship far more offputting myself. There's people who find Snily disgusting and it's one of my favorite pairings. The way OP is worded is just asking for a flamewar.

** I know exactly how you feel there, personally the -only- way I could go with that is something like a time-travel fic with Harry going back to the marauder's era and closing the age gap, and even then I still don't see the appeal... I'm not even a fan of the "Snape is Harry's father" thing... I just can't picture Snape ever being an acceptable parent without a complete and utter rewrite of his personality... after all, even being in love with Lily wasn't enough to get him to avoid falling in with the crowd that explicitly hates everything that she is. I know both of those categories seem to be pretty popular, but I'm with you on this one, I just don't see it being particularly plausible. although if anyone has some examples of a well written one, I'd be willing to at least give it a shot. I feel like it would take an exceptionally good writer to make it even remotely believable for me without a pretty serious AU rewrite... dramione/drarry kinda fall in the same category for me... dramione I've read a few that made it work, but they all fell into the category of draco abandoning his family's views entirely, either with his parents killed, imprisoned, or disinheriting him, and the whole thing usually feels pretty forced just to make it work...

** You know what, I may be 19 days late but I want to answer anyway.

I ship Snarry because I find the dynamic (when written well) to be amazing. Opposing personalities, yet complementary at the same time if they would quit hating each other long enough to get to know the other. Going from hate to love is very satisfying to read. Hot to cold, and usually quite passionate (because they're both passionate people) I ship Harrymort for the same reason, but that's even harder to do well.

I can think of only one oneshot ("Truth" by Thisveryinstant) that I've read that is an actual plausible crack at an encounter between them while they still hate each other. And I am very picky about which fics I read - the ones you alluded to about forced or coerced/Dubcon sex aren't my cup of tea.

** Well for me personally it's the older man/ younger man kink that I like. But also Snape kept Harry safe and tried to do his "best" at repenting for his sins. His guilt and stubbornness can be admiring characteristics. Also sometimes the hard outer and gooey in the middle can be very hot, which would Snape be in this case. Harry melts his hard outer shell and frozen heart to get a loving partner is something I love.

But think of it like this. Snape who got the worst end of the stick. Abusive father, bad decisions in his younger years, being nearly killed by a werewolf, enslaved first to Voldemort and a bit to Dumbledore and so on. One wishes for him at least to have one bit of light in his life or at least the satisfaction of doing what he really wants (potions). Meeting his end because of a misunderstanding adds to that. Also he gives everything so that Harry can win the war. His character doesn't really help but considering his circumstances it is very understandable.

So you can see sometimes in those tropes Harry being the little bit of light Snape has or the help that he needs for his emotional scarring. Their relationship most of the times doesn't start easy but that's normal.

But then I found some good fanfics that had Snape and Harry nearly like in canon but evolved their relationship giving insight into their possible thoughts and desires.

I always pictured Harry as 16-17 though. Definitely on the frowned upon side, but still technically above the legal age of consent. Also, I was a teen at the time and went through a phase of the idea of dating someone older, particularly a teacher, being hot.
