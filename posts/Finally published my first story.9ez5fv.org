The story idea has been rattling around in my head for about 15 years and I finally took the time to sit down and write it.

I was considering it complete, but now I'm getting more ideas for some extra chapters or, more likely, a sequel story, but I'm not sure if that'll happen or not.

Anyway, I'm just excited to finally get it out of my head and wanted to share it.

** It's a really nice atmosphere and tone, but you need to work on your dialogue. Particularly grammar. When dialogue tags (") close, they don't end the sentence. You need to use a comma before them if you have something like "said ron" afterwards, or a period if you're moving onto something entirely new. Things like exclamation marks and question marks can be used interchangeably here. Consider getting a beta to give your work a read through.

Also try to resist using dialogue as exposition - 'I'm just so excited to see their new flat!' feels a bit false. Something more natural sounding might be 'I want to see how they're settling in!' Or 'let's see what you've done with the place!' I'm also not sure Hermione is quite this excitable in canon. Your dialogienis nearly there and certainly far better than most fanfic, but it still doesn't quite flow in my opinion.

That said, the rest of your spelling and grammar is fine, and you have a nice balance of dialogue and narrative.

Edit: this is a great post to show what I mean - [[http://pleurocoelus.tumblr.com/post/177979880896/drrockbell-jawnwats-prismatic-bell]]

*** Thank you so much for the constructive feedback! I'll definitely work on my dialogue for the next one I do, or maybe go back and rework some of this story too. Thanks!

  It's been several years after the final defeat of Lord Voldemort and it's a time of peace in the magical world, but not everyone can leave behind the wounds of the past.
