*** There is some evidence with scouring charms etc that they are being taught household charms along the way. However, tradition might be the answer, it usually is. Though they have house-elves, traditionally household charms might be considered amongst the unimportant things for one to learn, you have a slave-race there to do it for you after all.

** I could make a very long winded argument about why education must go beyond everday skills, but that would neither fit the subreddit nor my time schedule. I'll just say that this notion that education is purely there to make you as efficient and productive as possible has led to a deterioration of many values we as (western) nations claim to be built on.

I don't think that the wizarding world chose to do that. But I will say that the probability of a spell being useful to you in some way is higher than the probability that a mathematical formula is.

The problem with this argument as a whole is that we barely read about any lessons. Most of what we see in lessons is used later in the series and/or has some impact on the story. I would think that Hogwarts teaches a similarly broad set of knowledge and skills as our schools do, but we only ever see what is useful to Harry (and Harry specifically). Plus, the absence of Household Charms, Wizarding Studies (Ministry Bureaucracy, Gringotts banking,... for example) and other useful classes lead me further to believe that Hogwarts is educating on a broader and academical spectrum.

Similarly, we only get what is directly relevant to whatever shenanigans Harry and co. are involved in, not any of the background that makes the magical world come to life. There is a reason why the Hobbit and LOTR are only four books with 11 (?) others acting as filler and background information for Middle Earth - it takes a lot of writing to even begin to explain how a society works.

*** I do agree with you, please don't misunderstand this post. I'm not saying that the idea is right, I'm merely suggesting an alternative reading for the problems we naturally see in the education provided at Hogwart's. Particularly addressing the lack of certain classes we tend to argue are essential.

You're right that the limits of the narrative drive us towards seeing the classes through a lens of foreshadowing which naturally creates the impression that the classes are practically orientated for a wizard or witch's survival. You're probably right that the lack of those classes does indicate that they are working within a curriculum based on principals of providing people the fundamental tools. Though certain things, such as the Household Charms are covered in other areas.

Perhaps I should revise my original suggestion and instead propose that they educate to a rather antique model of what is needed which privileges survival (they have a major class practically dedicated to self-defence after all).

** Yeah, the problem with the education system (at least in the UK) is that its origins lie in the industrial revolution. They didn't want to educate the masses to help them, they educated them to be better workers in the factories. This philosophy of education for the sake of employment, as opposed to being better individuals is still ingrained in the modern system.

Ever been discouraged from becoming an artist, dancer, writer (as in my case) by a teacher telling you "You won't make any money." ? That's because of the aforementioned.

I read this in an article a few years ago, which I can't find anymore. It was a psychologist talking about their experiences with a child who wanted to become a dancer. Their parent had brought the child in because they couldn't sit still, the psychologist asked the parent to leave, flipped on the radio and watched the girl jump up and start dancing. They told them to get her enrolled in dance lessons as she was a born dancer. They then went on to talk about what I've discussed here and how hard it can be for those kids that don't conform to the future of a 9 to 5 desk job.

Of course when I read to my husband about this thread, he brought up how young children are when they go to Hogwarts, leaving them with only a middle school level of reading and math.

*** As someone who does want a desk job, the education system didn't really help me much either. I think it's more accurate to say that the education system is suffering from being too general, with even good sized schools (mine had near 1000 students) not being able to provide a good selection of optional courses or much in the way of hands-on experience. I mean, I had to take an art class where I learned color theory (why?) and a physical education class where I stayed in the background while the more athletic kids threw dodgeballs at each other - I realize physical activity is important, but a yoga class option would have been a lot more beneficial to a non-athlete. On the other hand, there was nothing about managing personal finance or the need to network.

**** My school became a sports college. We had PE everyday and near the end of school when I was in 'Fuck it' mode, I purposelessly lost my PE kit and just read or drew whilst all the hyperactive kids ran around screaming.

My husband had it even worse at his school with peer pressure revolving around PE. At his school you HAD to like a football team. And I mean you HAD to. If anyone asked and you said you didn't like football, everyone would turn against you. He like me, preferred to sit and read in the corner and had to constantly try and not get his book stolen. He even had a former student turned teacher run up behind him and try to kick him in the back of the ankles to get him to run faster. Yeah. Also worth noting my husband is Asthmatic.

Size isn't a good thing for me because of Autism and social agoraphobia. My school was was very overcrowded and to this day walking in crowds send me into a rage.

I'm into the arts and we only got one lesson of art a week. Just one. And the art course wasn't very integrating either, I like Anime and Manga and so didn't take it for fear I'd be bullied into realism. I'm self taught and while I get A LOT of flack for being a self taught Anime artist who doesn't like studying nudes (they give me anxiety), I feel much more of a sense of accomplishment.

What would have been a good thing for me to learn would have been animal husbandry. I currently have 5 rescue Pigeons and a Seagull and am in training as a dog groomer.

*** Very, very true, the program of rote learning has never been removed from the UK education system, to its detriment. At the same time people end up in that weird hinterland where they can't see the practical uses of their skills.

Absolutely, primary level education for reading and maths, but then again one might ask whether the wizards would see a great number of advantages in those fields anyway. Reading and its ilk might well (given their history) still be connected to the clergy and the grammar, rhetoric, and logic of the medieval universities, emphasising those skills and their pursuit beyond a basic level would put them into the awkward position of interacting with the social memory of muggles who they remember as persecutors. Not to mention, amongst those real people who argue against the modern school system's lack of applicability for jobs maths is often brought up (somewhat incorrectly) as a particularly significant problem.

**** They are getting higher levels of reading. They have to read fairly complex books in theory of the magic before actually doing it. They write essays all the time. They get math for sure. Potions is all calculating ratios. Astronomy would also include theory about light, the various planets, the stars, etc. Even in the Middle Ages, we had a pretty good understanding of space. It wasn't perfect, but there was plenty of good information. That's physics right there. Which more or less depends on calculus.

They have classes in runes. So not only are they regularly doing readings in English, but also a different language and writing system. Divination, especially when using star charts and the like, is fairly heavily reliant on pretty good math skills. I'm under the assumption that those sections are not “look up online what your horroscope is” but rather, “here's how all the houses are set up. Derive from your own info what the rest is.”

I kind of take issue with the idea that education needs to be math class, science class, reading class. By the time you're in middle school, I feel like it would make more sense to have a more integrated curriculum, which borrows heavily across the aisle to get the job done.

The best school I've attended have been like that. Yes, they had the discrete subjects, but they borrowed from other subjects regularly, and encouraged us to draw our own connections. English class had at least two major projects (one for poetry, one for prose) where we had to get together in groups of 2 - 4, and perform. The poetry one, we had to record a video. The prose one we had to reinterpret a play and move it to a different setting.

In Drama class, the teacher emphasised dramaturge work. Basically it's all the research that you do before a play, so that you know what you're on about. It involved multiple trips to the school library to check the reference books, websites, and whatever else we could find about the plays we studied.

In English class, we had to write a persuasive argument using any scientific concept we wanted, as long as we had primary sources to back it up. In marine biology, the teacher encouraged us to use whatever methods we could to process the information. My friends and I did an interpretive dance about the water cycle, so that the different states of water could make sense on a molecular level.

That's why I get a bit miffed when people say that the wizarding world is turning out people with a 5th grade education. They may not be calling it by our names, but they're certainly doing plenty of learning. In my head cannon, it's all integrated.

I think that all the basic year one and two classes have everyday use or are good to know about (history of music sounds useless until you get ready to argue with a goblin, and given how many witches and wizards prefer to fly places, knowing astronomy can be really useful in not getting lost). Third year electives are to help students find things that interest them so that they can get jobs later that they enjoy, and they can drop the subjects that aren't relevant at all to their chosen careers in their final two years.

**** It wasn't till high school that PE felt like a good use of time. Until that point, the teacher would basically have everyone run a few laps, then throw out some balls of various types. If you didn't want to play the sports, you could walk or run on the track. So basically, I'd be walking circles slowly, and chatting to my friends. The second that bell rang, I'd be the hell out of there as fast as I could. I fucking haaaaated it.

Then came the high school PE. 1st 2 semesters were theory. You learned about how the muscles worked, why they get sore, the sorts of foods to be seeking out, and general knowledge on keeping healthy. Second half was the practise. The teacher would introduce one new thing every week, and asked that everyone try it out. First week was swimming. Those who didn't know how were welcome to learn, or walk the shallow end.

Also, the first 10 minutes was warm ups with stretches and junk so that the muscles are nice and ready for action. Last 10 minutes were cool down stretches.

He took us into the weight room and had us all try various weights, and showed us proper technique for building muscle. It wasn't my bag, but it was still highly interesting to learn about. What I liked is that he never tried to shame someone for being out of shape, or not knowing how to do something. Even though I don't necessarily use all the things I learned (I'm not a fan of weights, and I don't think I'll ever be), I still know how if ever I want to.

He was a very good teacher and I still think of him fondly.

** Indeed, wizards and witches are fine with learning and even inventing specific spells and potions, but they don't seem all that interested in delving into the underlying principles, do they? They don't, for example, devise a standardised unit of magical power, or probe the underlying mechanism that enables wizards (and not muggles) to access magic, or mathematically describe the precise nature of each spell. Not in canon, anyway; there are some interesting explorations, eg linkffn(The Arithmancer).

This idea fits rather neatly with linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality), which has a protagonist who does want to discover the fundamental laws. Though he finds it vastly more difficult, not to mention dangerous, than he initially expected.

*** Theoretically one might argue that appears to be precisely the job of the Unspeakables, they are the researchers in a magical world which emphasises secrecy when it comes to knowledge. Presumably given that resources for magical people are practically infinite the thing which should really be worth most is knowledge.

Thank you for the recs, HPMOR I have read, though not /The Arithmancer/.

  turning birds into goblets may not seem massively useful
#+end_quote

The turning birds into goblets thing is incremental. Taure has done a writeup and I can't recall it very well, but essentially, everything they learn in school leads them to learn more advanced forms of magic later on. Simple charms in third year lead into more advanced stuff in fourth and fifth year. Simpler transfiguration in the first five years lead into advanced transfiguration in the latter two years.

As for few people /needing/ to know to calculate the volume of a cone, you're being rather short-sighted. The purpose of learning that isn't to memorise random formulae (as is the case with most things in basic mathematics), but just to test your arithmetic and multiplicative abilities. The formula is just there as something to improve your memory.

*** I am aware of that, however, I felt that it might be a point someone might pick up on so I wanted to address it early on.

I am not really being short-sighted as I don't agree with that particular pedagogical theory, it's illogical and presumes that people will have their tasks set for them before they reach an age at which they can decide for themselves. It's one which is spouted quite frequently though, so in this case I'm asking whether it is possible that the wizards and witches have gone down that road, illogical as it may be.

******* Neither. I was referring to my original point which is that wizards may have chosen a mode of education founded on only teaching the skills perceived as necessary. I disagree with the principal as I regard it as too restrictive and logically inconsistent as it assumes that a child's desires and interests will not change or grow if you introduce them to a wider range of possibilities. The road I am refering to is the pedagogical school of thought which limits what you do to only those skills which are deemed to have an immediate use.

Though that isn't to say our current form of education couldn't do with a radical overhaul which moves away from the rote memorisation of the nineteenth century.

*** Honestly, I would have been more than happy to stop at algebra and move on with my life. It's extremely useful to know how to figure out x when given the rest of the info, but frankly struggling for the C in calculus was a goddamned waste of my time and energy that I could have been wasting on increasingly more specific forms of microbiology.
