Obviously I've already tried to understand the whole “Who really wrote My Immortal” debacle (and failed miserably). RN I'm listening to a yt video on MsScribe. What should I look into next?


** There's the Gryffindor Tom saga that unfolded on this sub a while ago

** Oh man [[/r/hobbydrama][r/hobbydrama]] is full of that.

Here's one on the Snapewives [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/d4wwir/harry_potter_fandom_married_to_severus_snape_on/]]

One on Cassandra Claire: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/de0204/harry_potter_and_ya_literature_the_cassandra/]]

One on Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/9n4vge/fanfic_community_popular_author_turns_out_to_be_a/]]

They have a great write up on the My Immortal saga as well, if you haven't gotten your fill: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/cylwll/harry_potter_fandom_goffick_harry_potter_and/]]

And I'm sure there are more I'm forgetting. The older posts were better, but if you sort by best of all time you're sure to get sucked into an amazing rabbithole. [[/u/iwasonceafangirl][u/iwasonceafangirl]] has some of my absolute favorites.

** Ah, you share an interest of mine. Try Cassandra Claire (or Clare as she's known now). There's a write up on the Way back machine from BadPenny. It'll whittle away an hour of your time.

Try the tale of Thanfiction, it may be more recent then what you're looking for but it's... Something. You're better off reading it then me trying to explain it.

** I could've sworn this was posted here originally in response to this, because I specifically came back to tell that OP “fuck you you absolute monster for gifting me this because I literally just spent like six hours reading this instead of sleeping, and I hate myself for it now.” But I can't find that comment, so I'm leaving this here to make other people suffer my fate.

It's an unbelievably extensive dive into the Msscribe controversy, seems like the seminal one, if you haven't had your fill yet.

*** I think I am reading a very boring fic as I also read through all of that rather than the fic.

To imagine this all was happening while I cautiously printed some fics from fiction alley to be able to read them while the internet connection was offline.

**** Lol that was more attention grabbing than a lot of the fics I've read. I also missed it, but I was like 11 when that shit started, so pretty glad I did :)

***** I'm so sad that it's actually true.

I think the saying is that fiction needs to be realistic, while reality doesn't have such demands.
