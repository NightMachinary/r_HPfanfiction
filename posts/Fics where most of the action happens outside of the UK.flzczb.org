As the title says, I'm looking for fics where most of the action takes place outside of the UK. Could be as generic as him living there (Harry Brown by mjimeyg), he could be training up/recruiting allies to return to fight Voldemort (When a Veela Cries by E.C. Scrubb), he could be travelling the world to live (The Wise One by FarenMaddox), he could go to school elsewhere (It's My Life by Fyreheart), or he could be trying to find artefacts there (The Valley of the Kings Massacre by Disobedience Writer). [Links at the end, btw]. Whatever works. It's just that most of the plot must take place outside of the UK.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

*** Heh. I'm assuming you got downvoted for Snappy's involvement in those fics. Is his transition from bitter twat to parental figure dealt with at all, or is it one of those "Snape was a nice guy all along and a perfectly suitable parent that Lily totally would've made Godfather" fics with no growth toward that point?

No criticism and thanks for both recs either way, I'd just like to know which end of things I'm dealing with. :)

***** Those were genuine questions - I'm curious about the answers. I'm not really anti-anything specific in this fandom myself, I'll read whatever when its done well and in an interesting/fun way.

And probably, but that's more my preference coming in to play. I'm a person of ridiculously broad tastes and interests in everything and I try to get everyone else on the same wavelength whenever possible. More breadth in searches = more stuff to read.

I'd highly recommend The Wise One that I linked in my description post at the top of the thread. It's such a good fic with such good travelling and such a good relationship between him and Sirius (and the OCs they meet), that I can't help but fangirl over it. :)

****** So with both I recommend, there's a very very /very/ small window of time (like a few paragraphs) where's he's bitter and nasty but once he sees that Harry needs "help", he turns into a decent guy. So yeah. Snape is a bit out of character. There isn't really any transformation from Snape in cannon to good parental figure Snape.

Both stories more focus more on Harry and Snape's relationship as having a father-son type bond. Less so on character development.

I'll take a look at The Wise One once I've gotten through all the fics I've saved up (I've got sooooo much to finish (â§â½â¦) ) it sounds quite good!

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU.

But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of ValbonÃ« were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
