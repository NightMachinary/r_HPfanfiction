I'm looking for any story where harry actively refuses and questions the customs of the wizarding world, from having demons torture the inmates of azkaban to why can't they where pants instead of robes and everything else like the pureblood propaganda to why is dumbledore working three full time positions there will have to be neglect somewhere whether purposefully or not to why is the magical world stuck in the 18th century even if electricity doesn't work with heavy magical influences it can still be used I mean they have grimmauld place a magical heavy home with the friggen fideolous (not sure of spelling) ward right next to muggle homes that use electricity or baring that why are they not using paper and pens instead of animal hide and feathers any stories that have this as one of the main focal points thank-you.


** Dumbledore is not working three full-time positions.

- Headmaster of Hogwarts

Yes, Headmaster is an almost fulltime position. I agree with that.

- Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot

We don't actually know what this is. Given Dumbledores aversion to power it is probably a moderator of discussion in the Wizengamot and a voice of reason. Yeah, it takes time, but I don't see it taking more than a few hours a week at most.

Don't forget that the magical community is < 100 000 magicals in England. Their whole government is located in 10 levels in one building. That is the size of a small-ish city.

- Supreme Mugwump of the ICW.

The ICW was founded with the premier function of keeping magic secret. That is their goal. They don't even step in when Voldemort takes over the British ministry.

The only time they do step in is when MACUSA raises its threat level to their highest and pictures of magical stuff are posted in newspapers.

We again don't know what the actual functions of the ICW besides protecting the Statue of Secrecy are. We don't know how often they meet. What topics they discuss. Or what the function of the Supreme Mugwump is.

Are this really full-time jobs? A lot of medium-sized town politicians work a job beside their function, why can't this be the same for magical Britain?

With the smart use of a time-turner Dumbledore could easily manage those three functions.

Also, technology is ahead in magical Britain in many cases. In the 1970 they had

- Portable video phones, accessible to schoolchildren (mirror)
- Every singe houshold had a Floo fireplace, where they could not only communicate but pass objects through
- Cars and planrs are largly irrelevant when you have floo, apparation and portkeys.
- International travel is posaible for masses (See Quidditch World Cup) and fast (ICW delegation including the British Minister arrive within 12 hours after a death in Fantastic Beasts to New York)

The clothing doesn't matter. Their treatment of creatures is bad, yes.

It's the same thinking that Rowling is criticising - considering yourself oh so superior and not trying to understand the other side.

Yes, the magical world has its faults. They imprisoned Black without a trial for example - but they are not as backwards as you make them out to be.

Edit: Also, the size does matter. Let's assume thay 3% of the society does actual hard research. In the US that would be 9000 people. 9000 people can achieve a lot. Im magical Britain that's 30 people.

Also, read the stories by Starfox5, he questions everything in the magical world.

*** That is not the point i'm making. Bare brass dumbledore is an old man magic may increase your life expectancy but still 130+ is old, and if he needs a time turner in the first place that should tell you a lot. Like you said being a headmaster is a full time job when someone working for the icw and does something on the side it is o.k. When a headmaster works as the head of two bodies of government and may needs a time turner it is not o.k.there WILL be neglect in one of three areas. Do you think if he wasn't running a school a lot of the biased laws would have still gotten through. I would say almost certaintaly not because he could have explained and networked more, show more people his point of view and just in general been better at this job. You can't expect to make differences in goverments while being a headmaster of a school. Second i still don't see any real changes to the culture once again they have to change not become muggle like, but at the very least evolve. I mean can you honestly say you can't see ways to improve the wizarding world. Tradition, culture and other changes with the times yet they have not.

**** Also a mirror and floo does not mean they are ahead of magical britain they have superior ways of travel if where your going you've been there before (apparating) or has a floo. And the mirror isn't linked to a network just a person/s what about when you want to talk to someone else they can't just give you their number no it is a whole dog and pony show to either tweak the mirror or get a new one and to tweak it you have to have quite a bit of background in runes i believe.

***** And you don't believe a body that has to meet reguarly and contains some of the worlds most important people isn't a full time job. What do you think their doing having tea and crumpets no i got it their measuring each others beards. Use your head 300,000 people or three trillion they have to still moniter their people and also the muggle side of things to see how impacts would be made and also probably have to give and get reports from their respective bodies i dare say dumbledore gets more work from the icw position than the prime minister gets for his and i believe the prime minister is a full time job. Correct me if i'm wrong but once again high up goverment positions ARE full time jobs like ministry of defence or leader of parliment and wouldn't you know dumbledore has TWO high up goverment. Positions oh and is headmaster. I would like to point out once again hermione a young fairly intelligent girl with a few extra classes was struggling with it and getting little sleep, and you believe and old man no matter how powerful can keep up with three full time jobs without neglect. All i ask is for you to really think about the whole, don't nitpick parts and take it out of context to try to be right.

******* That is because i write how i speak. Just because i have different writing styles than you doesn't mean it is wrong. I am neither a writer nor do i care. Why you comment on this alone is frankley a little stupid. Writing just to say i am a mess at writing does not look well upon you it just shows your shallow enough to comment on it. If you have questions about the argument i will be more than happy to write back otherwise once again stop being so shallow.

#+end_quote

You wrote three huge paragraphs of run-on sentences, nearly incomprehensible text due to an honestly depressingly impressive amount of spelling/grammar errors.

I couldn't read more than two sentences into your /first/ paragraph (read: First response) before giving up, and you're questioning why this guy /only responded referencing that you're writing is a mess?/

Sure - "That is how [you] write and how [you] speak", but that doesn't mean that the rest of us have to deal with it.

If you want to make some kind of point or response and expect those reading it to respect it for the - hopefully - well thought-out response that it is, then you need to equally put that same respect into making it /fucking legible/.

******* Yes, but three full time jobs. Don't forget the two goverment jobs that dumbledore sits are at the highest position in their perspective field carrying with it a lot more responsbility.

Do you think the head of parliment could do another full time job without neglect let alone two. Time turners can only get you so far just look at hermione when she only had a couple extra classes.

She was also young and could take the stress better than a 130+ year old man.

  why is dumbledore working three full time positions
#+end_quote

he is the most powerful good wizards and he ended the war against Grindelwald by himself. Everyone would want him to work for him and if he wants to they wont stop him from taking multiple offers. In a world where buisy students gain time turners, you can be assured high ranking ministry officials who are busy get them to.

#+begin_quote
  why is the magical world stuck in the 18th century
#+end_quote

Its not, the customs seem to be mostly the same. Robes are just part of their culture and outside of places with uniforms, you dont seem to have to wear them. The quills they have are superior to pens because they can be enchanted exactly the way you need them

#+begin_quote
  having demons torture the inmates of azkaban
#+end_quote

Dementors exist, you cant kill them and they have to be fed

Magic seems to have superior alternatives to almost everything the average person had in the 90s the only thing where its really lacking is the treatment of sentient non-human races a problem we dont face

*** Dumbledore is still only one man and hermoine only with a few extra classes was coming apart at the seems. No matter how powerful, old or wise as he is he is still limited by how a time turner works not to mention how old he is having three full time jobs two of them being in the goverment will lead to neglect time turner or not. There is no evidence that you can't enchant a pen nor is it evidence to why the wizarding world is stuck in the 18th century as people more intelligent than i have said 'a stagnant society is doomed to fail'. And with transfiguration you can trap dementors for a while and runic arrays could make them last longer or permanant. They are demons that literally eat you souls they should not be around people. Period.

** Just going to say i'm getting bored of everyone here only taking small parts, but not answering all the other points i've bought up bad grammer or not.

I have written all the answers to these questions and with the runes i made a logical conclusion based on rune products being rare meaning there is a good chance it is a difficult subject.

I am no longer answering questions i have already answered if you all are too ignorant to not go back and read what i have written that is your fault not mine.

Once again with dumbledore he has high positions in goverment if your too igonarant to understand what that means i can't help you.

The biased laws that death eaters or sympathisers push through daily like umbridges werewolf laws or bribes that lucius gives. If dumbledore wasn't neglecting his position and tried drumming up support full time he would have better chances would all bigotory and bribes stop no but a lot would.

Next 'that is not a setence' is not an answer. Since you still highlighted it you still got the context so all you were doing there was being petty.

I said dare say as in possible. Not definite, but definetely possible.

And hermione may have been an overachiever, but she was going fine without those two extra classes the next years which makes my point still clear. A couple extra classes was still too much for a young woman so extra full time jobs will definetly still get neglect.

So you are saying every wizard establishment has a floo and you know the name of all of them do you.

Yes a patronous instant messaging that is advanced as in kids and teenagers wouldn't be able to do them normally, and i believe wasn't invented yet. A galleon which you have less spaces to use than this sentance. So far home phones still leagues better.

Sure he could network with teenagers which can't serve the goals he needs at that time not to mention he doesn't. Most would also either not understand or find it a little creepy. If university yes. What equates to a high school no.
