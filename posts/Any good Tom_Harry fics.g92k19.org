**** (; (; go forth my little duckling

I actually created the subreddit myself because I love Tomarry (especially time travel). There was an existing [[/r/Harrymort][r/Harrymort]] but I wanted one specifically for Tomarry lol. It's not very active but there's a lot of recs that can keep you occupied for /days/

** Same ish world different outcomes

A Single Change [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/427321]]

Consequences of A Binding Ritual [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/293936]]

There is explicit stuff but it mostly happens in the last chapters. I just thought it would be a good one to recommend.

The Black Bunny [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1176279]]

Haven't read this in a while but there is more explicit stuff in this.

Schooled [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/384445]]

Pretty good one that has a little bit of the marauder generation and Harry generation in the same age group. With Tom Riddle era as teachers? Still really good. Also explicit.

These are what I could find at hand.

**** Um sure. Though I don't have anything for Harry Potter besides the times when I still thought “dumbledore is good, Voldemort is evil. Ginny and Harry should date.” I still shiver. I look back at it and can't even continue it since my views have changed so much.
