Rather it's the whole world or one person, idc.


** In California Dreamin', I have one specific Muggle find out about the magical world. It's not the focus of the story, but it's a thing that happens. This carries through to a story set after that one, The Ghost of the Redcoat.

**** I also post on FF.net, but AO3 will always be my first home and where new stuff gets posted first. I'm pretty much expecting my stuff to get taken down by FF.net one day due to the explicit nature of some scenes. I have the same pseudonym on both sites.

Be advised, some of the formatting on CAD is a little weird because when I first uploaded to FF.net, I didn't know that it took out the "***" I use as section breaks. I apologize, but I haven't gotten around to editing all 39 chapters to fix it. :(

** I'm going to throw linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh) in here, because although it's not anything like the main point of the story, muggle/magical interaction makes up at least half of the story so far. It's also an important part of one of the main arcs. Plus it's just such a damn fine story.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
