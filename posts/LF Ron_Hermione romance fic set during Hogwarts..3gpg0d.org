  "I've had this jumper forever and -" "Give me one good reason why this shouldn't be destroyed?" "I kissed you in this jumper" A few moments on times when Ron and Hermione seem to be getting somewhere, and Harry interrupts. Such fun! Disclaimer: not mine, please read and review :D

  Calm, rational discussions have never been their strong point. When a pre-wedding fight shows them that they need to get it together, Hermione suggests couples counseling with an innovative new method. Ron reluctantly agrees, and now the two of them are going to learn about each other in a way never before possible.

  I've catalogued every other expression he has into my memory, sorted by mood and time of day. I can literally read his face like a book...except for that one incredibly infuriating look. COMPLETE!

#+begin_quote
  In which a hurt Hermione confronts Ron, trying to find out why he's suddenly giving her the cold shoulder after she'd invited him to Slughorn's Christmas party and he'd seemed to accept. Just because I wondered why she didn't. Half-Blood Prince what-if.
