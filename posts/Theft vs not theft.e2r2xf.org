I think we need a rule for how long before something is abandoned and what happens to it then. If you go a year without an update I think the story becomes free meat for anybody looking to write something. Of course you still need a mention of the original author but permission from them shouldn't be needed if they don't do anything for more than a year.


** I think a year is not enough time. I would say after two years. The author might be going through an illness or block. Also, if another person took up the story then he/she should credit the original author. I've seen stories titled “Ending of (original author's name)'s story”. I've also seen even after five years the original author “come back from the dead” to finish their work. Maybe the fanfic sites could post rules regarding abandoned stories. Just so everyone is clear.

*** Even two years is too short. Check out [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/bws14z/whats_the_longest_hiatus_youve_gone_through/][this thread]] in which fanfiction authors reported their longest hiatus times.

Bottom line, the only polite choice is to get permission from a fanfic author before attempting to continue their story on your own.

**** If three overtures are ignored with at least a month between them and you direct readers to the original you should feel fine about it.

Alternately, you can just call it fanfic-fic and not worry about it. if they come back to it, yours is just an AU

** I didn't update for a year because I was pregnant and had a difficult pregnancy. Then when I had my son my husband was gone for three months on surgical rotations in different states. When he got back we were getting ready to move to a different state and buying a new house where he was starting his residency. Just because there hasn't been an update in a while doesn't mean a fic is abandoned. Life happens.

You should ask the author. If someone messaged me during this time I would have answered and explained it was not abandoned I was just taking care of myself and my newborn. I would have explained I was moving and having to do most of it myself because my husband was in his last year of med school and was out of state a lot. What you're suggesting is someone need not have asked me and just began writing. Frankly, I find that exceptionally wrong. A lot goes into writing, its not just the work it's deeply personal, so if someone just took that from me it would have hurt. I went back to writing as soon as I was able to and unfortunately it was over a year.

It takes minutes to just message an author and ask them. If you like someone's fic enough to want to take it up and write for it- then like/ respect the author enough to ask them if it's abandoned/ get their permission.

** So you wanting a year or any set time is unreasonable... people have a lot of things happening to them and each fanfic is case by case... there's an author of a very popular huge Fanfic that's had major health issues and missed a long time because of that, for others there are computer issues, muses leaving, real life issues, etc

If you are wanting to "adopt" a fanfic... message the author about it, check their page and the actual story most authors have a little disclaimer about if you can take their work and move from it... at the end of the day If you aren't given permission, I personally would take inspiration of ideas(leaving a nod to said work and author for the idea) but make my own story because that's only right.

** Eh, in terms of legality, your position is the same whether you wait one year or 50, and in terms of politeness, you should always ask before outright adopting and continuing a series. OTOH, if you're just writing recursive fanfic, knock yourself out, I reckon.

** Tbqh, imo you can parody off of anybody else's fic, as long as you give credit to the original idea.

It's a fanfic, if you're going to be angry about someone taking a shot at writing from you taking a shot at writing, then think about how Rowling feels that there is 800k fics out there.

Just put it all in perspective man

** There is a rule. It's called copyright law.

In the USA, it's property of the originator until 70 years after date of death in most cases.

Of course, on FFN, no one's stopping you or moderating the site, so go for it.

**** Not always, actually; there are exceptions to copyright law, especially for things like parodies. And plenty of authors give blanket permission.

And it bothers me that you state that fanfic is /about/ breaking copyrights, as if breaking the law and getting away with it was the primary goal, whereas in 99+% of cases the goal is to tell a story.

***** The goal is of course to tell a story doesn't mean it's not copyright infringement. To add on authors can give their permission all they want it's not their books anymore it's the publishers and Your statement on exceptions for parodies is false. it's just harder to prove in a court of law if you change a few names around, etc... and even if not, it brings buzz around a product and it's allowed

I love fanfiction, but it's copyright infringement. Its just three things 1.its not a direct copyright of work.

1. People don't use the fanfiction to make money(most don't, I know some have patreon ,etc), so it's not worth big companies making a big deal out of it and suing when all they would get is angry fanbase and huge lawyer fees

2. Pretty much no one reads fanfiction without knowing about The subject, normally by buying the books, TV shows, or whatever it is. So they've made money

I think you'll find it depends on the country. For example, I live in Australia, which has [[http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1968133/s41a.html][this]]:

#+begin_quote
  COPYRIGHT ACT 1968 - SECT 41A

  Fair dealing for purpose of parody or satire

  A fair dealing with a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, or with an adaptation of a literary, dramatic or musical work, does not constitute an infringement of the copyright in the work if it is for the purpose of parody or satire.

***** I also think you misinterpreted my statement, when I said all fanfics "just about" break copyright that meant that the majority break copyrights, ones on like brothers Grimm's fairytales they aren't in the copyright realm... not that all fanfics are about breaking laws

****** Since HP is by far the largest fandom in the world, and JKR is apparently ok with non-commercial fanfic, it seems very unlikely that "just about all" fanfics are violations of copyright. With the number of other authors who similarly don't mind, I doubt that even "a majority" is correct.

******* Again first off JK doesn't outright own Harry Potter, her publishing company owns Harry potter, time Warner owns movie rights, etc... she owns intelectual rights and a huge huge chunk of the money....

Just because you're not making money and not getting sued doesn't mean it's not copyright infringement...

Example for you is the website hp-lexicon.org

The creator of lexicon decided to write and try to publish a book on all the stuff that was on his website and he was sued for copyright infringement , and lost.... it was still copyright infringement before he tried to make it a book too... the big guys just didn't care.... he was forced to modify his book, before it could be publish.

******* I will say duly noted about the parodies my apologies for the misinformation but I feel parodies are few and far inbetween

I just think we should call a duck a duck. Fanfiction is copyright infringement... it's why Rainbow Rowell had to change names, locations etc in her very obvious what if harry and draco were in love fic, she got published... it's why lena phoria (popular dramione writer)Took down the fanfic she made about Harry Potter, she modified into a book that was published...

But even stuff like people on twitch sharing video games is copyright infringement, it's just that makes companies money so they like that... there's a lot of infringement that's allowed because it makes companies money or because it doesn't make the company lose any money...

companies for the most part only care about copyright infringement if you are reproducing music or movies , or ideas and costing them money
