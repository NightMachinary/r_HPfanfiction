anyone here read or know any fanfics where when there's the troll in the dungeon it plays out differently? like someone other then hermione has to be rescued or someone gets seriously hurt or killed during the event or it just ends differently? Also maybe the troll appears somewhere else? A thought i had was it actually enters the great hall during the feast and then everyone panics and the teachers have to fight it out and save the students

anyone know any fanfics?

Not quite what your looking for, I think. But it has a troll, in a different situation than canon...Also, try adding the 'request' flair to your post

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

*Summary: The Dursleys didn't raise Harry Potter to be a very good boy. Mildest of fusions with Sherlock Holmes*

 

This is a great story in it's own right. Their are two brief interactions with the troll.

  Where there is a Moriarty, there must also be a Holmes. Now let's see if she is up to the task. AN: Based on 'Business' by esama. Reading that first is required to understand the story.

  An older and more experienced Harry and Hermione return to their first year at Hogwarts. Their goals? Assassinate Death Eaters, destroy Horcruxes, and deal with Voldemort's hidden contingency plan... by any means necessary. And maybe they'll fix a few other things along the way.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
