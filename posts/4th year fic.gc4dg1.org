:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Okay so I don't remember a lot of details but I vividly remember a scene where the second task is an underwater escape room type thing. Also that the whole competition was way more dangerous than in canon so the champions decide to work together to survive. I think they discover who put Harry's name in the goblet early on too. Pls help x
