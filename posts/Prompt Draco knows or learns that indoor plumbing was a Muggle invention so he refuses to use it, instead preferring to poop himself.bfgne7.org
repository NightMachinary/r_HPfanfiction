** Considering how dangerous this mentaly could be : "Clothing? You want me to wear something invented by MUGGLE, I'd rather go naked", I find it more likely that Draco and every blood purists would consider that every invention in the world (or at least the one used by wizard) were created by a Wizard who fooled the Muggle thinking he was like them.
