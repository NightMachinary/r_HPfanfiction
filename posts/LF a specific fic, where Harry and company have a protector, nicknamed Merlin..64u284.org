I must have read too many fics and they all blend together. Try as I might, I can't remember anything beside this: there was a mistery person helping our guys out called Merlin. All canon, as far as pairings go(probably). It might have been a time travel fic.

I remember, that after all the shenanigans every year someone would jokingly tell a story of how they are THE Merlin, and one day the realI person came forward. If anyone knows it, please help me.


** linkffn(Backwards with Purpose: Always and Always) IS the fic.

**** I couldn't get past the first 5000 words or so. It reads like it was written by a twelve year old. That's just my opinion though so take it as you will

***** Read the first chapter. It's too cheesy for my liking. I love good romance and fluff, but that was just cheesy.

****** ^ Basically these. The fic is typical, "Harry's Friends are super important" fic, of adding relevance to characters, almost on par with the main character himself. For some reason, every time I see Ginny in anything, I get physically disgusted, it's just something about adding her in that feels all too like addressing a third-wheel in a group of friends, it just feels awkward every time someone attempts to give her "A moment to shine". Of course, I hope someone does more with the character, and maybe even makes her actually complementary to the plot, rather than being in the backseat, while feigning being in the front seat, all because she's Harry's girl.

**** The start is a bit rough, but if you can get through it, sure. Some people give it shit over the fact that [[/spoiler][they try to maintain the timeline up to Voldemort's resurrection, but those people are /wrong/ because some degree of maintaining the timeline is necessary for foreknowledge to be as useful as possible]].
