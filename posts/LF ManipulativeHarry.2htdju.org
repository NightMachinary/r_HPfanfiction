** There's this one that I can't remember the name of, it fit this perfectly, basically harry has a twin sister and his parents are alive but then the sister dies because his parents save his brother instead of her in a freak accident, and he gets progressively darker trying to figure out a way to resurrect her, he gets very manipulative and arguably evil by the end.

**** I'm pretty sure its this one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]]

It's an interesting story for sure though I found the ending to be pretty bad.

** I think you might like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4438449/1/Path-of-Decision][Path of Decisions]] by lulu42. What I love the most about it is that Harry is pretty much average when it comes to magic and gets by using his brain.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10267302/1/][Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise]] was pretty good. Hasn't been updated in a few months, July 21, but it's still worth a look.

** On the humor side, there's

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/][What Would Slytherin Harry Do?]] by Big D on a Diet: Harry is a Slytherin, and takes full advantage of it.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6050866/][Harry Potter: Hero of the Wizarding World?]] by J.K. Prachett: The books were only loosely based on what actually happened. Harry is a hedonistic Magnificent Bastard.
