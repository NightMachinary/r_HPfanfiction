LF Ron's story where he is the main character in his own story/adventure with Harry being only a minor character in the background or absent entirely.

Extra points for not Gryffindor Ron or even entirely different school Ron :P Thanks!

Please no smut/romance/hurt/comfort. Don't care about pairings, but preferably *not* Ron/Hermione!

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU
