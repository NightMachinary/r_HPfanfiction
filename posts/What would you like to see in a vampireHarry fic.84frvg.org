What creative pros and cons could there be to being a vampire?

What kind of things in general would you like to see? Or definitely not see?

Would you even be interested in a fic where Harry is a vampire?


** No slash (seriously, why do most creature fics have gay pairings?)

I would prefer a Harry who doesn't let being a vampire define him. My biggest issue with most werewolf stories is that the MC doesn't just accept being different, but suddenly only the werewolf side and the pack matters. It would be much better if the characters tried to live a normal life to the best of their abilities instead of romanticising an uncurable curse. And how that effort affects friends, love and family.

For example, Vampires supposedly do not age so Harry now has to make a Philosophers stone for his family since he does not want to inflict the downsides he has to live with on loved ones. Alternatively, he tries to land Tonks since her magic could be used to stop her from ageing as well.

Or him getting bullied by discriminatory laws and going full Mossad on the Wizengamot could be a good plot, killing one member at a time until the bigots are weeded out.

But by far my biggest interest would be a vampire Harry vs other vampires who want to force the "Vampire way of life" on him but he doesn't fancy the idea of sleeping in coffins or terrorising Transylvania.

As for Strengths/weaknesses, I'd go with the usual sunlight and silver (garlic never made any sense to me and sounds like a recipe for accidental death) balanced by fast movement and near immortality.

** Tragedy.

If Harry becomes a vampire, it should be by choice, and the reason he chooses it is for leverage needed to defeat Voldemort. Harry would be willing to sacrifice his future for that. When he wins, then discovers that he has survived, and may not have needed to make this particular bargain, it should haunt him.

That's how I'd write it, anyway.

This. I was halfway through the last book of The Hollows (a series that has demons) before I realized that I'd begun seeing demons as /people/, who also eat and take a shit and read books when they're bored. Like humans.

The series also has living vampires (Have a soul and thus can walk in the sun, are "on edge" when they don't drink blood but will survive) and undead vampires (die in the sun, have lost their souls and temporarily absorb blood from the people they feed on. They also don't have feelings, but they remember loving someone, just not /why on earth/ they ever had feelings for anyone). Vampirism is a hereditary virus in this series, it's passed on from living vampire mother to child.

In the end I started viewing vampires not as immortal superhumans that were something to ether marvel or fear, but as humans infected with a virus. Who happened to drink blood, like humans drink coffee or orange juice. (Which does kind of take away from the magic of the idea.)

** No slash, need more luna as a vampire. Still want harry and others to be themselves, else its just a random vampire character in hogwarts.

Any vampire powers put in the story should be there for a reason, and be consistent with powers. Don't make them die in sunlight just because, make it so many story aspects cannot happen in the day. Don't give harry super strength then make him unable to just punch everyone to death. Don't make him able to turn into a bat then never use the power. It is ok to pick and choose what vampire powers or themes you want to use and how much power you want to give them. Super overpowered characters are rarely (but not never) fun to read about.

There have been 2 vampire fics i have liked, neither has harry as a vampire (so far) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11552218/1/Valeriana-Natassa]] , and one i dont remember much about anymore but harry was trained or living with the flamels and rescues a vampire girl, pretty sure its a dead fic but i remember very little about it.

** If there were pros that outweigh cons I'm pretty sure Voldemort would be one. I hate the idea of uber Vampire pimping nonsense. It is a curse akin to a horrible disease. Canon never explicitly states what Vampirism entails.

- Potential Vampire at Slughorns party seemed a bit ... slow. Not in the moment. Was it one off or are vampires in Harry Potter universe generally a bit ... mentally challenged?
- Unable to be in sunlight. Nocturnal creatures.
- Can they carry wands?
- Do they still have magic?
- Can they have children?
- How often do they need to feed?
- Do they feed only on blood?
- Does it need to be human blood? Can they subsist on other types?
- How tolerant is society of Vampires considering the negativity werewolves endure?

If I were to read a Vampire story it would need to deal with the points I raised. I don't mean it can't be a positive story, but no sparkly Twilight shit.

** Would I? Yes, definitely. However, vampires need to be treated as what they are; predators of the human race. I've been a big fan of Chris Farnsworth, he writes the President's Vampire series, and the MC in the series states that he isn't human. He is a monster. He feeds on the blood of humanity.

Now I'm not saying be all Twilight-Sparkly vampires that are all good heart-ed and have angst and all that. Vampires are monsters, they're suppose to be terrifying for us, humans. So make Harry terrifying/horrifying. Whether he embraces and enjoys being a vampire or not, the other human characters should be very wary of him to downright scared. From Ron and Hermione to the Death Eaters, they should be horrified of him.

The cons are, as somewhat said above, are that we see a lot of twilight-like vamps, where the vamps are "good" people. No, try not to do that. Vampires should see, humans as livestock; like how we see chickens or cows etc. Harry should grow/become, in my opinion, to be apathetic to human concerns. Because, he is so much more powerful that humans.

Another good source of inspiration would be the Witcher series, in terms of vampiric powers. The high vampires and elder vampires have enormous power. They can slaughter whole armies and not break a sweat. It's up to you if you want to make Harry that strong.

Eh. Just as there are people who don't see chickens and cows purely as food, I think there should be vampires who aren't great big gits.

I really dislike the idea of vampirism changing a person's personality completely. Harry should not suddenly see humans as livestock just because he became a vampire. It would probably take a few hundred years for Harry to turn apathetic.

I love their vampires. The idea of Harry turning into that final form Dettlaff gets in the Witcher 3 sounds great. /That/ would be fucking terrifying and would definitely let the reader know just why people are terrified of vampires.

However, in canon, people aren't that terrified about them. One gets invited to Slughorn's party.

** i love the peril and risk of being a "dark" creature! i read one fic i really loved that involved Harry desperately trying to hide his need for blood and almost atarving, but alas the story didn't continue on with how Harry would manage to hide his vampirism in Hogwarts. i don't really have any other preferences though i definitly prefer no slash over slash! i get kinda ticked at how many stories go from "oh no im a vampire!" to "mmm being a vampire means im so sexy n have 9 wives wow!!" in 2 chapters flat. where's the drama? the danger? the plot so easily loses the stakes ..

** I've tried my hands at vampire!Harry several times. I think the most important thing to keep in mind is to not marginalize vampirism. Too many fics do that and Harry gets coddled. Like, bullshit like magical rings that allow him to go out in daylight, or only needing to drink animal blood once a week/month/whatever. Those are cop out mechanisms, and at that point, why even bother?

I want an uncontrollable thirst for blood, and a need to feed often. I want a badass Harry who doesn't just wallow in his misfortune. I /want/ things to be different, but I want there to actually be drawbacks to being a vampire, but ultimately it still has to be Harry. Like, there's a reason Voldemort didn't chose vampire as his path towards immortality.

As for the don't... I feel like these kind of stories are often sidetracked by pairings. Vampire don't have to be sexual predators. And there's the aforementioned sparkly vampire nonsense like feeding on animals.

*** I don't know if you can have an in-character Harry who has an uncontrollable bloodlust and /not/ have it be a complete angst-fest.

Personally, I'd throw out many of the common expectations one might have with vampires. I find the typical stuff kinda boring. A vampire that can't be out in the sun, that has a crazy need for drinking blood? Meh. It's all predictable, really. I want to read a story where Harry doesn't take to vampirism like Remus does to lycanthropy. No moping. No letting it define him. Have it just be something he is. Like Hagrid. He's a half-giant and there are both positives and negatives to it, but his problems don't revolve around the fact that he's a half-giant. I'd like to see a Harry that just keeps moving on with his life and only occasionally has issues with his vampirism.

I like the way the Witcher handles them.

***** Is there? I haven't ever found one. I've seen a million stories where his vampirism is suddenly the main and often only focus in the story, where I can see the "I can't be around you, I have no control over myself" trope coming from a mile away. Know any decent ones that don't have it be a main focus?

****** As I see it, there fandom falls into 3 different flavors of vampire!Harry

1) the brooding sparkly twilight vampire kind that often includes Snape for some reason. Usually lots of leather.

2) the ones that try to be all ye olde timey with vampire covens, sires, childes, ancients, etc. Usually pretty boring.

3) the ones where someone (usually Dumbledore, with the help of Pomfrey) try to "save" Harry and do what ever they can to have Harry have a normal life at Hogwarts. Usually pointless.

What you're talking about usually falls into category 2. It doesn't really matter though, since there are no decent vampire!Harry fics regardless of the category they fall under. Not a single one that I would recommend.

I do agree that the stories tend to focus too much on the actual vampirism parts of the story. The plot should be more than just "Harry is a vampire". He's still a person, and the story should still feel like an actual story, not just a list of things Harry now has to do to manage his condition.

No, not at all. I find those incredibly boring. That's the exact opposite of what I'm talking about. The stuff that involves that usually means the main focus is vampires. I dunno, I suppose I'd like the vampirism to be like... his scar, in a way? It's there, it causes trouble from time to time, but it's by no means the focus of everything Harry does. It isn't mentioned in every chapter.

** I think a big issue with any creature fic not just vampires, is trying to stick with a mythos absolutely. This is Harry Potter, Centaurs live in forest because reasons.

Mix up some of the mythos, but be aware of all of them. Make actually being a Vampire something Harry wants to learn about. And don't be afraid of changing the "rules" of what a Vampire is. Just make sure you are consistent with your own made rules.

Is Garlic actually bad? Silver? Moving water means I can't take a shower? When the school finds out he could have fun with it, "Ohh no Garlic! Malfoy you have defeated me!" And then punch him in the face.

Sun kills you? Bet there's a spell for it, easy fix. Like magic makeup, in fact make him have to buy a teenage girls book of magical makeup.

Harry is a tough kid, however much you believe the Dursleys abused him he has his moments of sass and defiance being a Vampire just means he has something now to deal with but he is still himself.

My favorite sass is the toilet bit in the first book to Dudley, the kid who played Harry Hunting with his friends.

Maybe threaten to drink Dudley's blood then have a nice Blood Pop when he runs away.

Last tip, don't make Harry a "special case" vampire. Different from all other vampires. He's not Blade he is Harry Bloody Potter. Unless it is a Blade Potter crossover then I guess it's okay.

** Harry's oppinions of fighting should change (no more Mr. Nice-Guy-Who-Uses-Disarming-Charms!), he shouldn't feel bad about killing deatheaters (I think he shouldn't become unfeeling and inhumane either - I think Harry would hang on to his humanity, with the exceptions of being more ruthless in fights and not feeling guilty about things he can't change all the time!), Harry shouldn't shy away from his fame anymore (Vampires are social butterflies most of the time, they are rich, too!) and maybe he should even use sex to his advantage (vampires are sexual creatures - or at least seductive, that's how they hunt and lure their prey after all!)

Not slash! Too much creature-Harry-slash (or Harry with a person who is a werewolf, veela, vampire etc.) stories already IMHO!

Harry would probably start looking for the origin of vampirism (and werewolfs, veela etc.) to better understand his condition (even if his sire tells him many things!)

Harry should IMHO retain his magic because gaining speed, extra sharp senses and superhuman healing is a bad trade off for magic IMHO even if you are immortal as well!

Weaknesses? Hm...none maybe (magic can compensate for most things, so surviving sunlight? Parlor trick! Garlic? Nope, never works, just annoys vampires as it can overwhelm their sense of smell and silver/wood? I don't know...I thought silver was for werewolfs! Holy water? Bah, believe doesn't change water (sorry, Atheist and you can look at "holy water" under a microscope and it's still water...only dirtier if tons of people push they dirty hands into the bowl!)

Hell, burning to ash should be a weakness, but then again which vampire wouldn't put out the fire if someone sets them on fire? Being cut to pieces? Yeah, that should IMHO kill anything!

Would Harry be allowed back into school and would he even want to? Would he age to maturity...can't think it'll be fun to remain 13 or something all the time (16 or 17 ok because you can pass for an adult, but younger than that? Harsh!)...unless you go by Dracula (the Bram Stoker novel) where the Count gets older and younger (probably coupled with feeding...so if he's well fed he appears very young and is stronger, but if he hasn't fed recently he looks older)

It would be interesting how he becomes a vampire:

- 100% willingly (as in: He's looking for vampires to be turned or meets one and asks to be turned - as an ace in the whole when fighting (if we are totally reasonable and Deatheaters aren't incompetents than even the weakest DE should IMHO be able to cut Harry to pieces!))
- in distress (he's dying (from an attack or even from an illness!) and the vampire is saving him because he can't take him to a hospital in time)
- a vampire feeds on him and turns him (maybe even on whim and only later learns who he/she turned!)

Also: What are the implications, especially since Harry is a beloved hero (or a deranged villain, in book 5)? Especially if Harry's family really has a seat on the Wizengamot (can a vampire retain that seat?) etc. :)

What I'd like:

- more magic (especially enhancement rituals - most Vampires get stronger through age, but there should be some who speed up the process! - and blood magic! Hell, he could gain a vampire mentor (or several) as his standing in their world increases...maybe there are truly ancient ones who take an interest in him?)
- politics (ministry of magic/ICW, but also vampire clans etc.)
- other creatures (vampires usually have servants - in Vampire the Masquerade drinking vampire blood doesn't actually turn you, it makes you into a strong, durable and immortal servant while still being weaker than a true vampire...not to mention that there's veela, werewolfs, dryads, demons etc.)

ps: While others might hate on Twilight: It's not that bad (the main character is a little retarded IMHO, but otherwise it's an interesting read - I had to read Twilight because I was giving a speech about Bram Stoker's Dracula when compared to modern Vampire-Literature and the teacher thought Twilight would be a good and well known example!)...vampires are still vampires for the most part (sure, the sparkle stuff is annoying, but it can be ignored for the most part!)
