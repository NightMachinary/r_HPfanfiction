** I say read as many as you can. I understand that we're only here for so long - and I'm not asking you to disclose any specifics about your situation - but to me, living life to the fullest means engaging in all aspects of it, including wasting time on media that turned out to be horrible. I know we have a tendency of wanting to only read or see or listen to the best - I certainly do - but in the end it's not about some giant checklist of things you can mark as done. So read them all, or as many as possible, and enjoy the journey, including grumbling about poor character development, along the way.

** I'd skip Faery Heroes, Harry Crow, and Can't Have It Both Ways.

I liked The Golden Age, Elizium for the Sleepless Souls, Breach of Contract: Twelve Signs, Equal and Opposite, The Prisoner's Cipher.

I also enjoyed A Black Comedy, Seventh Horcrux, and even Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion, but these are comedy or crack fics so your enjoyment depends on whether the humor clicks with you or not. I'd recommend Seventh Horcrux in particular though.

** There's only a handful there that I consider readable: The Prisoner's Cipher, Equal and Opposite, Breach of Contract: 12 Signs, Sherlock Holmes and the Ravenclaw Codex, A Black Comedy, The Denarian Lord (and the whole trilogy), the Unforgiving Minute, and Elizium for the Sleepless Souls.

** In Heart and Soul, the author waves away Fleur's entire personality during GoF by saying something trite about her 'mask of indifference.' So the story is pretty much H/Hr/OC.

** The best I'd say are Delenda Est and the Denarian trilogy (for general reading), A Black Comedy (for humor), and The Pureblood Princess and Hope (for fluff/romance).

Stages of Hope and Equal and Opposite are both quite good, too.

The rest you've listed I've either never read or were forgettable.

** Forget about *Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness*, *Faerie Heroes*, and *Harry Crow*. Of these three, *Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness* is by far the worst. It claims to be canon, but its characters couldn't be more OOC, and its plots couldn't be more implausible. [[/spoiler][Demelza almost strangled Neville to death because Ginny went to discuss DA with him in the middle of the night?! Snape tried to feed Neville/Ginny/Luna to werewolves in the Forbidden Forest?! Hagrid abandoned the three to die there because Snape ordered him to?! Victor Krum rescued Neville from the ministry execution chamber?!]]

*** Nothing can be worse than Harry Crow, NOTHING! Even my Immortal allows the reader to at least make fun of the material. Harry Crow is just the worst. It's 700k words of bland Stew, Gary Stu.

***** Mostly Lord_Anarchy's recommendations + Seventh Horcrux. Delenda est starts out very addicting, interesting and great, but it becomes very boring and sluggish to read. I had to drop it because I simply couldn't bring myself to finish the second half.

******* I stopped reading after chapter 22 when robst does another randition of how curvy and hot is Emma Watson at 12 and Harry shows that he can even Gary Stu other dangerous goblins for M'lady. After he easily bitchslaps Dumbledore in the early chapters I assumed that even Voldemort will be dealt with in the most unsatisfying way. The possibility of inner turmoil due to scarhorcrux was removed in the first chapter. Any schooltime bully was bashed into pieces. Snape is scared of him. Every single wizard is scared of him because he has complete power over 99% of all the money in the wizarding world. I could only imagine him making arrogant speaches for the next 80 chapters until people kill themself out of guilt. Does any oposition actually show up in the later chapters?

edit: I just realized that you were talking about Delenda est. Sure the Draco and Dursley part was great. What put me off so much is that the role of main protagonist shifts so heavily into Bella's favour. I liked the assertive strong Harry from half one that leads people to victory. Now he just follows. I loved reading about Bella from Harry's perspective, but I can't really stand reading the story from her point of view.

******** Allow me to rant with you about Harry Crow: How hot Emma Watson is, but NO WE ARE PERFECT and chaste and far too innocent to do anything, even though we experience a perfect and true love and you are so fucking sexy, but we are too young, and would never tarnish ourselves with sex, even though I jsut killed a buncha people for you, my helpless damsel.

** I'd say read at least 3 chapters of everything. Many fics have a bad summary and an awful first chapter, you usually know if it's any good by the third or fourth chapter... That being said there are alot of, IMO, bad fics on the list, but you'll have to find them yourself ;)

But if you'd want to start out with something good do read The Resistance of Azkaban and A Black Comedy.

** I read about halfway through Isolation before realizing that Draco was probably suffering from Stockholm Syndrome and then I was utterly unable to continue.

People have already mentioned Harry Crow, I mostly agree with them, not going to rehash it.

I really enjoyed Delenda Est until the second time they time travelled, which was just too much. He'd spent so much time establishing himself and then he was going to have to do it all over again? Nope, didn't want to deal with it.

I just stopped and read Christmas on the Die Llewelyn Ward because the summary looked interesting. Good fic. Even if you don't like it, it's a five to ten minute read; you won't have wasted any significant time.
