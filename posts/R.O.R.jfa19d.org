I read an omake ( in Make a Wish if I remember correctly) where Harry absorbed the power and abilities of the Room of Requirement. What would be a story based on it if he did this in first year? Of course it have to be perfectly controlled, no accidental activation of the ability. (That could be another fic and total crack with hilarious scenes)


** I'm struggling to picture what this means in the practical sense. As in can he make things like books appear at a whim?

**** oh wow. Being able to do the light sabre thing is cool. I wonder if he could do things like Iron Man's bleeding edge armour or something

***** Well he can summon things from another universe.... I assume if he really wanted to he could summon the infinity stones or mjolnir maybe even lucifers wings from the sandman comics or even a flaming sword (one of the sandman ones that can kill even God)

** Being able to summon food = no more starving over the summers.

And with summoning books and such Harry can study or do homework while locked in his room.

If he can summon gateways, or even open windows, he can go visit his friends over the summer (by broomstick if needed).
