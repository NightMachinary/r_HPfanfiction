I am pretty annoyed about this. I was reading The Final Straw by Belleropon30 and was on Chapter 19 of 36 and suddenly it is no longer there. Does anyone know of another source for this FIC I tried Archive of Our Own but no luck. I don't know if this is a case of the "Author" having stolen someones work and being forced to take it down, or if it is a case of them leaving the community or another hack of FFN. Please help I was really enjoying the story. (Edit) adding the details from the summary from my browser history.

A 6th year story. Harry takes a look at his life and doesnt like what he sees, so he decides to declare his independance of Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix and fight the war on his own terms.

** I have a copy. PM me your email and I will send it to you. My copy only has 35 chapters, but it ends with The End, so it's probably fine.

** Well, I'm not entirely sure if that's what happened or not, but the story could have been taken down because it was not posted by the original author. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/712211/][bellerophon30]] (this is the link to his author's profile) originally wrote it back in 2004-05. +Some time ago, I don't know when,+ According to the date on his author profile page it was two years ago that he removed all his stories, changed his author's name and deleted his profile text.

By the way, if /The Final Straw/ was to your liking, it may also pay off to read his second attempt at the same general idea in the story /The Brave New World/. He also wrote a third epic length novel that curiously never got a proper title, so I only knew it as /As Yet Untitled/.
