** My collection of good and competent Dumbledore fics (except for those already recommended):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): He utilized Hermione's information very effectively.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]], linkffn(4101650): Another time travel, and despite my strong misgiving about some earlier plot elements, Dumbledore did very well here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), Faced with a Ministry that was openly colluding with Voldemort and Hermione lashing out on her own, Dumbledore managed to bring this difficult situation under control.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867): Dumbledore didn't appear much, but offered several good piece of advice to Ginny.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: This Dumbledore was totally manipulative Greater Good, and the kids even figured that out. However, his Order was a brutally effective organization, and his plan worked.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10132530/1/His-Mother-s-Love][His Mother's Love]], linkffn(10132530): It took some prodding from Harry, but he came clean with Harry and gave him a viable plan to win the war.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12446118/1/Intersecting-Realities][Intersecting Realities]], linkffn(12446118): A somewhat older, dimensional traveling Harry met the local GWL. After some discussions, the local Dumbledore began working well with the GWL.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467): Dumbledore took the Basilisk more seriously, and together with Amelia Bones, mostly solved the canon plot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment][Realignment]], linkffn(12331839): Dumbledore saved Tom Riddle from a time traveling Harry Potter, and together they also defeated Grindelwald.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): He was generally good in this one, but since the author still decided to rehash canon stations in Years 1-2, he sucked during those two years. But Dumbledore would kick serious asses in Year 3.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11102515/1/Uncle-Quentin-s-Spy][Uncle Quentin's Spy]], linkffn(11102515): After a slow start, this Dumbledore first neutralized Umbridge, then crashed Death Eaters's party in DoM.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** linkffn(9824342) - Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure, a good Dumbledore gets sent back to the past and a dimension over in a bumbling Dubledore's place. A little slow paced and first of a series.

Hope ya don't mind too much, but while he's only had a small bit piece so far, my Dumbledore will become, if not /good/ since I'm going to try to go with a lot of greys- he'll actually be one of the antagonists I believe, scarily competent most of the time in the future, he's had a wake up call. linkffn(13025986)

*** So I'm reading your story now.

Honestly it's a LOT of cliches. The ‘all of a sudden I distrust Ron and Hermione' and ‘Harry is Lord of multiple houses including Griffyndor'

But this line frustrated me.

‘He was upset that they no longer seemed to trust him to know what was best, he was Albus Dumbledore after all. '

No one thinks like that. No one. It's pretyy much number 1 or the cliche for this type of story. (And I read most of them as they're my guilty pleasure)

Your writing style is good but you're hitting all the cliches right now

ALOS a particular bugbear. ‘He had made every move for the greater good' Dumbledore thought that way as a child. He watched his friend who believe that kill his sister and then take the wizarding world and the muggle world to war with that phrasing. It's not something that it's realistic to have him believe. It would be like someone nowadays talking about work in German society stating ‘Abeich macht frei' The phrase is too loaded.

Er, I appreciate the criticism, just wish it was for my story, Ron Chee here, and I just started writing The Sub Rosa... and Ron and Herms haven't yet made an appearance, I doubt I'll have him be a lord either. Also my Harry will have suffered less at the hands of the Dursley's, probably be more trusting, then again, it is a somewhat criminal organization of the downtrodden. In any case I doubt him and Ron will be best friends I'll try not to bash him.

I didn't quite write that, but your advice is good for me, may have to edit my Dumbledore a touch. Not sure if /no one/ thinks like that- but in any case my Dumbles is getting another wakeup call in the next chapter and /won't/ think like that in the future for sure.

Aside from that... well, I see my Dumbledore as an old man past his prime that just wishes to be Albus or Al- sort of like Harry wanting to be just Harry, but no one else stepped up to the plate so he was forced into all these positions of power, forced to be a general when all he wanted was to teach kids, but becomes too busy to do any position justice.

I'm not entirely sure he only thought that way only as a child- actions speak louder than words- miserable childhood for Harry, but he's protected, leading him by his nose by a convoluted suicide plot that I doubt he was a hundred percent sure he'd survive- maybe mostly sure, not to mention storing dark lord bait at a school without even an age line to keep kids out and other little things like that.

One thing I will say is that Dumbledore's use of the phrase always struck me as /wrong/ though, he distanced himself from Gellert when he realized the costs involved- after his sister... And he defeated the dark lord Gellert became, I imagine the phrase would bring up a lot of painful memories, and that he would do his best not to be like that... then he goes and does things for the greater good, though his greater good is superior to Gellerts since he does seem to have good intentions.

Then again, we all know what the road to hell is paved with.
