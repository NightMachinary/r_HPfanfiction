** Not sure how Snape could marry a muggleborn and still be a death eater. I mean wouldn't his friends want to kill his wife?

*** Voldemort wouldn't want to kill all Muggeborns, he wants to insert rules. Hell Tom Riddle is a Muggle born. He can make an exception. Remmenber, if all were Pureblood the decay in power will follow suit, then who will they blame? Maybe a huge percentage, but not all. Is fan fic so...you can give him a motive and a goal. Or maybe he just wants to kill eveyone but himself.

**** Actually, Tom is a half-blood. A muggleborn stems from two non-magical parents. He also hates all things muggle with a passion. That and 'mudblood' seems to be a constant companion in his vocabulary.

******* Still. I don't think killing his "Wife" will be wise for the Dark Lord pawns if he doesn't gives the order. But hey Merlin or the first wizard in history had to be a muggleborn so...none of them are truly pure of muggles.

******** You seem to be assigning logic and reasoning to a violent terrorist organization. In the second war they sent all muggleborns to internment camps so I don't like Lily's chances of livings through the first war. By marrying her Snape would be considered a blood traitor. I suppose you could make it work I just don't see it as likely.
