Instead of trying to un-fuck the colossal build-up of emotional baggage that so many fics. try to do...just have Severus and Lily never meet before Hogwarts. For whatever reason, Severus didn't want to approach because of a Muggle (Petunia), they just were never there at the same time, etc. Their friendship can only begin under those specific circumstances, they bonded over magic and Hogwarts in the abstract, devoid of specifics. At Hogwarts, he'd be a Dark Slytherin, she a Gryffie mudblood. They wouldn't interact the same way they did pre-Hogwarts when it was just them and the abstraction of magic. You can justify him not being on the Marauder's radar as much, since the reason their enmity persisted was because of James' jealousy of Severus' relationship with Lily, and their initial meeting on the train when it was just him and James, which happened because he sat in the compartment w/ Lily. Ergo no life grudge. You can even still develop a relationship w/ Lily, with a different dynamic. Unlike in canon, where she just pretended he wasn't Dark and he didn't understand why she was against it, they'd start off knowing where they clash, wouldn't expect anything of the other because of their personal history, etc. The same things they liked about each other during their friendship would still be there. So, instead of best friends--> enemies, or best friends-->enemies--> lovers in fic., which isn't emotionally intuitive, they can progress enemies-->lovehate because they interact because of whatever circumstance--> lovers/w.e.


** It's an interesting idea. I actually really like it.

Another option I'm using in the story I'm writing, Severus never really had the feud with the Marauders because James wasn't a jealous weirdo in my fic. James just knows Lily, at least in the beginning, as that annoying redheaded prefect. I still can't decide whether I want Severus to be protective of Lily because he had feelings for her or because they have a brother/sister type of relationship. In my experience, most relationships with someone you know from that young of an age are closer to Brother/sister than romantic partner. I have a best friend who lived across the street from me growing up and we've always seen each other as a brother/sister type of thing.

** This is a great idea. However, there are some things I'd like to be clarified...

What do you mean by "bonding over magic and Hogwarts in the abstract"? By this I understand that this relationship is purely borne out of necessity, with a newbie witch needing guidance, and okay with whatever source it comes from- like the weirdo Snape kid from the other side of town.

Also, your entire post seems to be a rough summary of an epic re-imagining of canon that you want to read, complete with a wonderful marriage of Arcane Might and muggle science in the style of not-so-snobby HPMOR.

*** I meant that they have fundamental differences and wouldn't be friends otherwise save for in that specific scenario. Not unlike Albus and Gellert. Their relationship was based on grandiose idealism and mutual genius, but it was divorced from the reality of the other's methods/personalities. The more they (Sev & Lily) ignored those differences, the more it built up to eventually combust when they were put into a different social context. It was more in response to all of the fic. I see that change an element in canon, that usually start from the same places. 'What if Lily forgave Snape after SWM'. Why would she? At that point they can't communicate at all. You'd have to have Snape drop all the social infrastructure he has and make a complete 180. Also, that's boring. 'AU where Lily and Harry survive, but James dies and they get together'. Again, not emotionally intuitive. Just like 'AU where Dumbledore forgives Grindelwald for Crucio'ing Aberforth' makes zero sense. 'AU where, on his death bed, Snape is thrown back into the past'. There are so many things wrong with that I can't list them. The point of an AU is that circumstances can change, but characters can't. Best friends--> broken trust/enemies--> lovers isn't intuitive. Best friends to lovers is a trope that usually requires trust, stability and fluff, none of which are things I associate with Snep.

** I don't understand what you are trying to do. The friendship with Lily was more innocent before the shitstorm that Hogwarts created. What is so wrong with the two bonding as children over the wonder of magic before Hogwarts begins to tear them apart.

Trying to change the dynamics of that shitstorm. He'd be healthier if he weren't relentlessly bullied and had some measure of control over his environment. I argued it wouldn't escalate with the Marauders bc he wouldn't have first interacted with James and Sirius, nor would James have targeted him bc of Lily. Severus first responded to James when he made a snide comment about Slytherin and Sirius joined in, I don't think he'd just walk up to a group of popular four boys and provoke them, he'd be more sensible. Lily and Severus' relationship is obviously hugely important to the characters/narrative, but it can develop in a different dynamic. And they don't have to be torn apart. They can start apart, and glue together.

**** James and Sirius came into the compartment by happenstance. With both of their dislike if Slytherin, it would only be a matter of time. It has nothing to do with Lily's and Severus' friendship, it's basically down to the ridiculous emphasis on Hogwarts' houses. James and Sirius didn't even look twice at Lily in that moment.

***** JKR said that Snape's relationship with Lily was a factor in James' behaviour to him. Snape came into the compartment because of Lily, where J & S were. No Lily, different compartment, they never cross paths, never clash over Slytherin, no 'Snivellus'. Yeah they dislike Slyths, but they singled out Snep. No reason to suggest that wouldn't change if you change the scenario.

****** Later on, not at the beginning. James and Sirius cared nothing about Lily at that point. It was house rivalry bullshit and childish name calling at first. When James started zeroing on Lily did that layer to the animosity was added. Hogwarts was meant to be a haven from the hell that was Severus' home where Lily was his only beacon of hope, instead it drowned him. Perhaps without Hogwarts, Severus might have been different. Then again, if James and Sirius hadn't been pricks, perhaps things would be different.

There are too many variables in the equation that lead to canon events. The childhood friendship was happiness, why take that away?

******* Magic was his beacon of hope. He liked Lily, but he'd still derive happiness from magic, and he'd associate with his other like-minded Slytherins. And I'm not saying his relationship w/ Lily has to be taken away, just that it would come later. Instead of breaking apart, they can come together, so happiness in the long term. I'm not sure what you disagree with, exactly? The reason Hogwarts was bad for him was because of J & S, which began circumstantially. We don't know how long James crushed on Lily, and you can say it also encouraged them that he associated with a Gryff, a member of their house, so they'd see him around, which would spur on their bullying. And Lily's Gryff friends don't like him, nor he them, so they'd talk/argue about him, again fueling the fire for their bullying. This AU makes things exponentially better for him.

And I'd argue their friendship causes more emotional frustration/damage to him in the long run, because of everything mentioned. I'm not sure why you'd prefer him to be bullied and eternally unhappy at the lack of closure his relationship with Lily caused. It ruined his life.

******** He was happy to find someone he could share everything with, that he didn't have to hide. Lily was hope that he wasn't alone, that he was worth being around. That childhood is important, take that out and that takes away from him.

********* Lol. Mate. Those one/two years aren't that much. He'd find people at Hogwarts soon enough. Like I said, his friendship with Lily arguably /ruined/ his childhood, not improved it. His relationship with Lily set him up to be crushed/disappointed. He'd find Slytherin friends. He needs space to pursue who he wants to be (a Dark wizard), around people he chooses to associate with, in an environment he can control. He /couldn't/ share everything with Lily, and they held on to their relationship until they couldn't communicate and it became toxic. She also wasn't very supportive of him, even from the beginning.

********** It was his desire to fit in and desire to protect himself and perhaps wanting to know more about magic that lead him to the dark arts, plus the pureblood idiots he was housed with.

His childhood friendship was innocence and gave him hope, but circumstances led to it's break. Regardless, he still had love, he still loved and though it caused him great pain, Severus would go back and change to just remain at Lily's side. Without that childhood connection, I think Severus would be lost. Sure he talk about his home life, he felt ashamed by it and of course he didn't want to tell her that she would face prejudice because of blood, he didn't want to ruin it for her. Lily was a saving grace for him.

*********** Magic gave him hope, not Lily. Lily was just circumstantial. He liked the Dark Arts, because they represented power. He was always going to be in Slytherin anyway, so always influenced that way. He's always going to be capable of love, that wouldn't change just because Lily isn't in the picture? I'm not sure how you can claim his relationship with Lily was good for him, at any point in his life. It permanently stunted his emotional growth, and lead to frustration when his romantic feelings weren't reciprocated while she associated with people that were abusive to him. How would he be lost? What did she do for him? She constantly criticised his Dark Arts, and like I said, his relationship with her catalysed a lot of his abuse, effectively isolating him. He would have made other friends without her.

************ Riiiight. He had his first friend in Lily, actually his only true friend for quite some time. Magic gave him a way out of his home, Lily gave him hope that he is worth something. It was their pride and naivety that drove them apart. Severus was an insecure young man who just wanted to be worthy of his existence and he had that as a child with Lily. Love is a great and terrible feeling, with the love Severus had for Lily it was a blessing and burden. It truly shaped him, take that foundation before Hogwarts and he just might have closed himself off from everything.

Severus wanted to be a Slytherin not for the propaganda but for what the house stood for, those with cunning and ambition. What his original ambition was, we do not know, but it probably involved keeping Lily in his life as that he wanted her in the same house.

If given a second chance, Sevwrus would choose Lily. That shows just how important she is to him. Their friendship, her being apart of his life made it worthwhile. I believe he would be emotional stunted without their childhood friendship. With her, he began to learn, though regardless he is a prickly fellow.

You are disregarding other factors that make up his character, other people who shape him. Lily showed him love and hope, during a crucial development stage. Severus came from a neglectful and most likely abusive home. Lily was his sun, a reason to hope for a better day. Magic was a means of escape. This was for the betterment. Hogwarts is was suppose to be wonderment for the both of them, instead it became a second hell, but it wasn't their friendship that did them in, it was what they let others fill their heads with and do that help sever them. Severus wouldn't be the character he is without ALL of his life experiences.

************* We're arguing in circles. She was his first friend, because of circumstance. Nothing suggests he wouldn't have made other friends. She was his only true friend, yet they couldn't communicate because of their massive differences, and his relationship with her likely isolated him because of what it caused. Magic gave him hope to escape from his family. His ambitions ran counter to Lily, and he didn't want to give them up initially, even for her. Clinging to a singular childhood friendship when you're drifting apart isn't healthy. Don't romanticise their relationship. The only reason he's dependent on her, is /because/ of his relationship with her. He wouldn't have closed himself off, he was already hopeful before Lily, and made friends in Slytherin. /He/ pursued her. We don't ever really see her pursuing him for his own sake or being supportive of him. You're not examining the consequences of their experiences. Hogwarts was a second hell /only/ because of J & S and all the frustration his relationship with Lily caused, which was /because/ of their relationship. He'd choose her, because his life and circumstance made him emotionally dependent on/obsessed with her.
