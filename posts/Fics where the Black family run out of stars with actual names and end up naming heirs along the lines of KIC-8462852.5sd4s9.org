** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Carinae][Eta Carinae]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_(constellation][Virgo]]) are actually pretty decent names, but it would be utterly hilarious to have a name like in the title.

Blacks died out in the canon Series, that tradition now lived on in the Malfoys.

*** Even the Malfoys are known to re-use names, with Lucius being the main one being re-used. Sort of like how some men are "John Smith the 13th". Seeing as how they are French in origin, it always surprised me how they did not use more French names, and instead, used mainly Latin ones. Heck, the Weasleys have more French names now, due to Bill marrying Fleur, with their descendants than the Malfoys do (Victoire, Louis, Dominique).

Actually the name 'the golden compass' has a pretty obscure origin too, you'd have to be pretty well-educated to get the reference.

**** After doing a bit of digging, some magical families that are Pureblood may have originally claimed to be "descended from the gods". i.e., the surname "Gaunt" originally meant "of Gontia", and Gontia is an ancient Celtic goddess. So, too, is Morrigan, an ancient Irish deity whom the Sayres (another Pureblood family) claimed descent from.

As such, the Blacks, being Pureblood, and likely related to both the Sayre and Gaunt families at some point in the past, could always start naming new kids after the gods / goddesses from which they claimed descent from. One Sayre descendant (Isolt Sayre) even renamed / called herself "Morrigan", after her supposed goddess ancestor.

** you'd assume that having functional models of the galaxy would force wizards to start naming stars earlier than muggles. though some of the main constellations and brightest stars might remain the same.

**** i guess it depends on how much depth of history a magical culture with multiple magical races of varying sentience has. since it'd be odd for a muggle to name a star 'toast' or 'brick', or alan.
