** linka03(Souls Touch, and the Future Changes)

​

also believing in 'pureblood supremacy' would be counterproductive for him considering he is a half blood

there are many 'anti muggle' fics

in linkaoe(The Orchard of Shattered Dreams) harry is a psychopathic murderer and hates muggles despite being basically a muggleborn

also linkao3(Bizarre Happenings (Temporary Work Title)) is harry raised by death eaters and is crack but kind of wholesome

  Prompt: What if Harry Potter did not grow up in the abusive Dursley home? What if he grew up with his loving ‘family', who decided to adopt him after deciding that the boy was better off in their hands?I wrote this because there aren't enough Parent!Voldemort stories along this line. Might end up cliche, might end up dark- idk, who knows? It's a Work In Progress.------------------------------------------------------------------I do not own the characters, I only own the changes in the plot. All characters belong to the illustrious and beloved J K Rowling, without whom, we would not have ever delved into the world of Harry Potter.

  What if Severus Snape had taken pity on Harry Potter? What if he had told him the truth at the end of his sixth year? The truth is that he is a Horcrux and that as part of Dumbledore's grand plan, he will have to sacrifice himself to kill the Dark Lord.Well, the trouble was, telling him the truth seemed like a great idea at the time, but it really didn't go the way Snape wanted it to. He realised that the minute Albus Dumbledore mysteriously dropped dead, but by the time Harry comes back to Hogwarts as Head Boy for his final year, the rest of the world know it too. His new tattoo has as much meaning as the baby Basilisk around his shoulders and nobody, even those he was formerly friends with, wants to mess with him. Now that he has Harry on side, can Voldemort win the war that so many said he was destined to lose? Only time will tell.UPDATES EVERY WEDNESDAY by 8pm GMT.

** Sectumus prince on ffn has a couple of fics where Harry is adopted by the black family and hence is raised by blood supremacists. It provides a plausible reason for a highly improbable change in harry
