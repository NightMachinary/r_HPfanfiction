** This is fanfiction! Canon or fanon, movie or book doesn't really matter, it's just a bunch of puzzle pieces to fit together for whatever story you have in your mind.

That is one of the things I like about fanfic, canon is what you need it to be. And there is such a large pool to draw from! Want to make a crack fic based on one of her tweets? go ahead. A line from one of the movies is the start of your canon divergence fic? awesome! Need to discard book 6 to make your fic work? Fair enough.

If elements from both the movies and the books are needed in your mind, then go for it!

*** There are various scenes from the movie that fit better symbolically, but I still feel like the book should be the primary base.

**** Oh, when I am arguing on whether something is canon or not the books are what I try to use for the most part, but I don't feel that it needs to be the end all, be all, for writing fanfic.

** I mean realistically, the movies did that sort of thing because the Cruciatus Curse is (1) a bit over the line in terms of how its described in the books to show explicitly in movies (you never hear the sort of crazed, agonized screams described in the books) and (2) actually not very visual as spells go and since movies are /visual/ medium this means the writers and director need find some way to better illustrate the torture.

You could also be a bit more tasteless and say its part of the whole sadomasochism-aspect of Bellatrix (or dominatrix if you prefer) that was highlighted in the books but really blown up in the movies. There is also something to be said that, at least in the movies, the entire concept of blood supremacy, classicism, and elitist-snobbery is forced to take a back seat to more visual depictions of "the bad guys" (ex. black cloaks with pointy hats that look suspiciously like KKK outfits, the shape/color of all the bad characters wands, flying dementors with cryokinetic abilities not seen in the books, etc.).

Carving 'Mudblood' is an easy way, both in the movies and fanfiction, to remind people, "oh yeah, these people are also racist, and not just murdering psychopaths and cowards," rather than explaining it through characterization or world-building which take time and planning.

*** Was about to say, never heard anyone complain about authors mixing book and movie canon... It's fanfiction. Next he is going to complain about authors describing characters and locations like they were shown in the movie and not how JKR described them in the books...

Also, am I just reading very different stories than OP? Because in the hundreds of millions of words of HP fanfiction I have read in the past 20 years, I don't think the carved arm was mentioned once. At least not that I can remember. And he makes it sound like its a very common trope.

**** I see the carved arm pretty frequently, so it is the fics you are reading.

****** Only thing I have on the top of my head is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11344172/1/][Magic Through the Gate]] an okay stargate crossover that was cut short (author finished it up before it really started because of some flames). Hermione gets a magical tattoo to cover it up.

No others come to mind right now, but I can give a general picture of what I read so you can compare. I mostly read Harmony stories, and I would say it comes up fairly often in angsty (and not so angsty) post war stories, and also a bunch in year seven rewrites.

******* Well, I do read a lot of Harmony. But angst and rewrites are things I try to avoid at all costs, so maybe thats where the difference lies.

And thanks for the fic, sounds interesting and I thought my recent crossover binge had exhausted the crossover section at ffnet but hadn't stumbled over this one yet. Even if it got cut short and is only ok, I will give it a read to extend the binge.

**** A sign of a good fic is that the author has a good knowledge of canon. So when they start haphazardly mixing trivial scenes... Well it shows their prep work.
