*** This is a great fic, but he never ends up with his future wife in it. I think the author planned that for a sequel which never happened. It is a great Draco in the Muggle world story, but there's really no romance.

**** Oh, right. I thought, it ended with him being interested in a Muggle girl. I read it quite a long time ago.

#+begin_quote
  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
