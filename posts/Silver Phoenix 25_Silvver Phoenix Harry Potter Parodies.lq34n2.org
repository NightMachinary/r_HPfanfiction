Does anyone remember the Silver Phoenix 25/Silvver Phoenix parodies that were originally on [[https://fanfiction.net/][fanfiction.net]]? Here's a description from tvtropes:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/622731/1/][/Harry Potter and Some Sorcerer's Rock/]]/ðŸ“·/ by Silvver Phoenix (previously Silver Phoenix25)

- Recommended by: Rozzy
- /Status/: Complete
- Synopsis: A parody of /Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone/. In the words of the author: "I'm insane, as is my writing. You have been warned."
- Notes: Also recommended on the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterHumorCrack][Harry Potter Humor/Crack]] page.
- Comments: This fic is okay on its own, but the sequels (Harry Potter and the Chamberpot of Secrets, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of a Cabana and Harry Potter and the Omelette of Desire) are some of the funniest and craziest fanfics I've ever read---and I first read them a long time ago. The sequels were taken off fanfiction.net due to gratuitous (and hilarious) celebrity cameos, but can be found in all their glory at [[http://www.silverphoenix.5u.com/][Silvver Phoenix's website]]ðŸ“·. Highlights include Gangster!Twins Lil' Fred and Big G, Harry temporarily joining the Spice Girls and John Stamos being trapped under an overturned laundry basket.

Silvver Phoenix's website doesn't exist anymore, the Wayback Machine for their website just showed me blank pages, and while I remember saving the fanfics to a thumb drive like 15 years ago, I really, really don't think I have that thumb drive anywhere anymore. I also don't know how to contact the author directly. Is there any chance anyone else has the sequel parodies saved somewhere, or maybe someone knows the author and could put me in touch with them to ask for copies (just for personal recreational reading)?

Last ditch effort here! Thanks, all!
