** But, does it, or does it not eat beacon?

*** Eating a beacon would probably kill it.

As all birds of prey are also opportunistic scavengers, yes. If it smells like food, they'll most likely eat it.

** So Harry's second friend (with Hagrid number 1) prefer to use sight and movement to hunt, contrary to the horned owl who prefer to use hearing and silent flight.

It is also an opportunistic eater, where it eats even unusual meat as long as it is available (insects, carrion fox...).

Older individuals are more successful in their hunts then younger ones but have smaller "bounties".

It will use human construction as perch.

Even in the permanent day/night of the Artic it will prefer to hunt on the theoretical night. Otherwise, it prefer to hunt around dawn & dusk.

It is a parasitic eater, as it will steal the result of a hunt from both animals and humans.

.

I didn't read all the article but I think I got the gist of it.
