I'm looking for a couple of fics (I'm 99% positive it's not the same one) in which---

- Dumbledore is the bad guy and has been drugging Alice and Frank Longbottom to keep them in St Mungos, this is why Alice always gives Neville the lolly wrappers. Does anybody recognise this fic? That's literally all I remember about it and it's driving me a bit mad not being able to remember anything else!!

- the Malfoy's are good(ish) and it's either Ginny or Harry that's in a relationship with Draco (I think) and the Malfoy's have some creature blood in them. Somebody (maybe Blaise?) needs a potion and the only way to get some of the ingredients is via a snow elf who Draco knows and they send Fred and George to get the ingredients because she wants identical twins to run some experiments with. There are also some succubus and incubus characters, two of their names are Forrester and Cerris and Forrester has a thing going on with Tonks to train his abilities. Percy and Audrey have a small child who has to be rescued from the ministry and I think it's Arthur and either Bill or Charlie who do that and they meet up with a woman who pretends to be the mother of the child. Is this familiar to anybody? I've been looking for this fic for ages but can't seem to find it anywhere.

Thanks in advance :)

Goddamn that sounds familiar. He was having a mediwitch or healer at St. Mungos drug them for him.

**** Hmm. I'm 100% certain I've never read that but the summary would fit perfectly. Must be a different fic I'm recalling.

Also I'm pretty sure a broken hip could be fixed in about 8 seconds by magic.

**** Nah, Becoming Neville doesn't feature Dumbledore meddling. It is a really great fic though!

I think this trope has been popularized by Robst? It may appear in "Knowledge is Power" linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4612714/1/Knowledge-is-Power]]), but there are - I'm quite certain - other popular fics that contain it (if I think of others I will edit this comment later). In any case it is a common plot device in Dumbledore bashing stories that he has been poisoning the Longbottoms in order to control his backup boy who lived Neville.

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.
