I hate when authors include in their stories basic information about the universe or the characters, like "Sirius Black, his godfather had spent the last 12 years in Azkaban after been betrayed by..." Why are you telling me this?? I already know. This is a fanfiction, there's no need to explain basic info about the books or movies, we all know. This is not an original work, we are consuming your story with the context very well established.

I don't know if I'm the only one annoyed by this...


** If you are setting a scene, such information can be useful for the overall flow (Sirius Black felt good. After a decade in Azkaban, he could finally kill the traitor and make sure his godson was safe). If it's just an infodump, that's bad writing.

*** Setting the scene is all well and good. When authors mention the same scenario over and over and over again, in every single chapter of their 150~ chapter epic.... kill me now.

** A paragraph or two to set the scene and establish when and where the story is starting is fine. But when authors feel the need to summarize the plot of the entire series up to that point, I look for something else to read.

*** It depends if the previous plot is changed. If it has significant AU elements, I'd rather the author have the fic start with an overview/summary of the previous years, instead of feeling like they're making stuff up as they go, such as a fic starting in year 5 mentioning that Harry didn't destroy the diary when you're already 200k words in.

** It's not as bad as recreating a whole scene without adding anything.

Choosing the wand: "After all, He Who Must Not Be Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great". I lost count how many times I've read that with nothing new or original added. Or seen the castle for the first time, stern professor, sitting in the stool with the Hat...

I see those, skip them and wonder if I really want to keep reading.

*** When people write down the entire Sorting Hat song. We know it already!

On the other hand, respect to the authors that come up with their own Hat songs. Bonus points if it rhymes.

** Personally I am annoyed by the opposite. I'm looking for stories that stand on their own two feet. Using reader knowledge of canon to fill in gaps is lazy writing. If you're writing a post-OotP story, no need to summarise the events of books 1-5, but you should not be relying on the canon HBP/DH. If you're going to introduce Slughorn or the Deathly Hallows, you need to introduce them properly.

*** I completely agree. Writers can also take the oppertunity to alter prior events as they like - an easy low effort way to smooth over apparent inconsistencies in an AU setting.

** I think it's somewhat in keeping with the style of the original. Especially in the earlier books, Harry periodically summarizes what happened last time. To your example, at the start of GOF he explains why he didn't immediate think of asking Sirius about his scar because Sirius is new to him blah blah blah.

** JK Rowling does this in her own novels;

1) She explains Quidditch at least 3 books in a row

2) She explains Sirius and his stay in Azkaban more than in just 'Prisoner of Azkaban'

3) Certain spells are explained over and over again

Others mentioned setting the scene and I'd agree it can be used for such. I agree it can get annoying. I am currently rereading the books and I have to remind myself often that these are children's books and the repetition is on purpose (mostly).

Just my 2 cents

** So, while I can see the argument against it for the Harry Potter fandom because it is clearly the largest and best known fanfiction fandom, in general I actually prefer the author to give a quick summary of salient points. Why? Because not everyone who reads a fanfiction actually knows the source material. I was into Stargate fanfiction before I'd ever seen any Stargate canon and I wouldn't have been able to do that if no fics explained any of the background worldbuilding, and I'm sure there are folks who get into Harry Potter from fanfiction as well.

Whenever I read McGonagall's speech about four houses and them being students' family I immediately shut the story.

** Personally I consider it a /good/ thing. It might be saying things I already know, but 1: not everyone does, 2: skipping it makes for worse writing since it relies on your existing knowledge for critical details. Incidentally, the canon movies have this problem as well at times.
