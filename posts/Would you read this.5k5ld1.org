*** Even though you're making Harry the main character, it sounds like this is more of a TSoTINF story than a Harry Potter story, so you're going to have to expect a /much/ smaller audience. Accept that if you want to write this story.

**** Oh no, the Harry Potter story will play a huge part. One of the main problems Harry faces is the corrupt Ministry, and Voldemort is still a very big foe, along with many other things.

Honestly, it's mainly still a Harry Potter story only with a few major changes.

** I would give it a shot. You have enough to draw me in, after that it depends on the writing.
