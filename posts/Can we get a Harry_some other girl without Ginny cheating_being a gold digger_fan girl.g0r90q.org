In almost every fanfiction where Harry and Ginny break up and Harry ends up with someone else it was because Ginny cheated, was unfaithful or just a bitch. Can we get some fics where the relationship just ends on good terms? It ends because the fires gone not because someone fucked someone else?

No slash because A. I don't read slash most of the time and B. Slash is a major pusher of this trope to justify it, it isn't the only one that does it, alot of Harmony does this as well but still.


** linkffn(Grow Young With Me) has a summary that didn't impress me when I first read it, but the actual story is really well done.

Harry is widowed and raising his three children alone, devoted to them but really hurting. A quirky waitress (with her own issues under the surface) takes on the self-assigned job of drawing him out of his funk, and they slowly fall for each other. But even if she can win over his children, even if he can let himself love again after losing Ginny, there's still a side of his life that she's not supposed to know about. And the more she sees his home and his in-laws, the harder it is to keep a lid on exactly what he does for a living, how he can regularly drop his children off with their grandparents on the other side of the country, and why he has genuine /cauldrons/ in his cupboards...

**** I really recommend the story, though. Abby gradually teasing Harry out of his silence is lots of fun to read, and the children are precious. Only caution is that it's incomplete (but not abandoned).

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

Every fic of hers I read that involves Ginny seems like it's either lightly or medium bashing her - I think they definitely don't fit the OP's request.

Novocaine, Grow Young with Me, and Hope and Healing all fit though. Haven't read the others.

** linkao3(Fun Too by Andracute2)

It's Harry/Pansy but focuses on Pansy. It's smutty in the beginning. The break down of the relationship between Ginny and Harry is actually interesting but not talked about too much. The author doesn't update often and it's not finished.

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Metamorphmagus) They were basically never actually together when they dated, and just gave up. Although the DP has much commentary on the number notches on Ginny's headboard since, and a full-blown meltdown when Harry kisses Tonks.
