I know people are a little annoyed at the introduction of Fleamont and Euphemia as Harry's grandparents, but it does open up the possibility of writing about Dorea and Charlus's grandchild(ren) and giving Harry second cousins. Have any fics been written recently that involve Dorea and Charlus' grandchild not being Harry?


** Offtopic reminder that Charlus and Dorea as James parents never made sense. Alphard got blasted from tapestry for leaving Sirius gold, Dorea would be blasted for allowing Sirius to live with them faster than you can say "blood traitor".

***** I'm posting a gif. Its not supposed to be a good argument.

I choose not to argue about these things because at this point, one could make anything up to explain it. We know so little about the Black family that any author with decent storytelling skill could form you an argument for why Dorea Potter isn't blasted from the tapestry for giving Sirius sanctuary.

I'm not sure if Pottermore has more on this since I tend to avoid that website like the plague, but last I checked we knew merely supericial facts about anything that happens with the Blacks pre-books. So if one of the great authors out there steps forward and gives a good reason why Dorea is still on the tapestry, you'll have a hard time arguing against it.

And even if there is some Pottermore-canon out there for this, it really doesn't matter anyway. Who gives two fucks about canon if the story is good?

****** That's looking for additional explanation to force your headcanon to work, when it contradicts making perfect sense canon.

I've read many fics with Charlus and Dorea as Harry's grandparents. Some of them were good, but only one took only Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina took on itself explaining this problem.

Its not canon.

You forget the simple fact that one could argue that you thinking the reason Dorea is still on the tapestry can only mean she isn't the one that gave Sirius sanctuary is already headcanon. Because, lets face it, Rowling's world is paperthin and headcanon begins the moment people ask questions. There is no such thing as additional lore in this world. Every theory as to why the Potter nee Black is still on the tapestry is full on headcanon.

I'll give you that: Your explanation is one, very logical deduction. But it is only one of many explanations that could/ do make sense.

Also, I repeat: who gives a shit about canon?

********* When did we change from grandparents to parents in this little discussion? Anyway, doesn't matter...

And what I mean by "who gives a shit?" is that if an author has a nice idea, canon shouldn't be thrown in his way. Fanfiction, /especially/ HP fanfiction has every right and need to act on some original ideas. 700k stories later, canon seems really "done".

********** Edited. I meant James' parents.

And really, canon is mostly "done" in terms of rehashing plots and not in terms of setting or background information.

But fanfics with original ideas that strays from canon are perfectly fine (well, usually they're not, because they fail at realising this idea). Problem is that Charlus and Dorea as James' parents is not an original idea but one of those stupid cliches that came out of nowhere, like magical cores, arinthmancy used for spellcrafting or Snape being Draco's godfather.

** The thing is, these two characters don't have anything going for them other than being Harry's grandparents. All we know of tem are their names based solely on a family tree that shows up in a single scene of the Order of the Phoenix movie.

the only reason people wrote about them to begin with was because they "were" Harry's family. Without that, what is there to say, really?

*** I don't expect people to write about Charlus and Dorea per se, they're old and dead, but the fact that they aren't Harry's grandparents opens the door to there being more Potters, who are parts of both the Potter and Black family, the two most written about families in FF.

They have potential to be very interesting OCs.

** I wouldnt mind reading this but i dont really care what JK has to say charles and dorea are harrys grand parents. Pottermore in my opinion is not strict canon. Ive said this before, strict canon is what is published in a book of the same world. Not these glorifed tweets and "articles" that rowling maybe took a five minutes to write.

It is canon that Sirius states that he and Harry are related via Dorea in some way. It makes more sense to have her as a grandparent than anything. Also reason she wasnt blasted off the tapastry could be the fact that she was married to a pureblood, and she didnt get blasted off because of that as well for housing sirius. We also need to note that just because you are blasted off the tapestry, does not mean you are cast out. Otherwise sirius could have never declared harry heir to grimmald place, the seat of Black ancestory.

*** Dorea was born in 1920, died 1977 in the case of wizards, she died young. The James' parents were said to be old when they had him so Dorea being his mother doesn't add up.

*** I'm not really trying to make an argument for what is or isn't canon, nor am I particularly interested in whether or not it's canon, I just think it presents a new and interesting plot point that hasn't been used yet i.e. Harry having extended family that is a mix of Potter and Black. There's /sooooooo/ many things you could do with that.

I'm actually pretty surprised by how annoyed people got about this issue when it came out. If you want Dorea and Charlus to be Harry's grandparents, just write it that way.

** I once wrote some "first chapters" for a lost cousin of James who comes back to take care of Harry. To this day I'm not sure what to think of them, but I realized that after the introduction of the "new" grandparents, Charlus and Dorea were free to take over the role of what essentially would have been OC's later on. Link to the three starts: [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30842834/CP_1.pdf][1]], [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30842834/CP_2.pdf][2]], [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30842834/CP_3.pdf][3]], if you're interested.

But it is widely "agreed" that Charlus and Dorea are James' parents. I'd wager that the Potter history article on Pottermore was not well received by the community. I personally think that Pottermore as a whole is not helping fanfiction, but thats just my opinion.

I suppose so. I suppose that it is also widely "agreed" that Dan and Emma are Hermione's parents.
