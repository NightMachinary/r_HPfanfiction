** Voldemort fell, and the world seemed frozen in time. The first student to break ranks and rush for Harry was Hermione. Screaming "You did it! You won! Oh, Harry!" she smothered him in a hug. He managed to gasp out "Er-my-nee - stop - can't - breathe-" before the sound of splintering bone enjoyed across the Hogwarts courtyard, and Harry Potter's ribs pierced his heart.

** My daughter when she was 2 had to be coached through how to give hugs without crushing bones. I seriously thought she was going to do it. She's 10 now and has learned how to express her extreme affection without actually causing harm (most of the time). This could be a real thing.

** Had a discussion about HP/Worm crossover ideas a while ago, and it occurred to me that if Hermione were to have a trigger event, it'd be during the Troll Incident. The circumstances---physical danger brought about by social isolation---suggests a very bone-crushing power set: [[https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Victoria_Dallon][Glory Girl's]].
