Aside from Tomarry, that could be a great idea for a Albus-centric fic. When the killing curse doesn't work on Harry, he realizes that Tom Riddle was a redeemable person and things didn't /have/ to turn out this way.

How he goes about fixing his past mistakes I don't know. I mean, at that point they're in a war, Voldemort is disembodied, and everyone is afraid to speak his name. So maybe a time travel fic, and Albus could fix his mistakes with young Tom Riddle /and/ deal with the Dark Lord Grindelwald at the same time.

I think it'd be a pretty action-filled story.

Edit::

Okay, consider: He takes baby Harry with him to the past, because he's heard the prophecy in full and thinks that he's the key to Voldemort's defeat. And it turns out that love /does/ defeat Voldemort and is the 'power he knows not'- Harry grows up with Tom as a brother and teaches him how to love others, so Voldemort never becomes real. Albus' choice to raise both boys with love and fix his past mistakes was the key. Haven't figured out the Grindelwald plot yet.

Edit 2::

I think the Grindelwald plot has to have something to do with the Hallows. Harry has the cloak because Albus brought it back with them to remember his parents by. Tom gets the ring when he confronts his birth family- he doesn't kill them, though (character growth ftw). And either Albus gets the death stick when he defeats Grindelwald, or Grindelwald gives up his war somehow and it ends on a weird note where its sort of implied that he realizes that he can't undo what he's done but he wants to (the same place Albus was in at the beginning of the fic). And the three of the Hallows are reunited, but do not belong to the same master. Big ohana means family vibes lmao.

*** Main issue there is that if you have Dumbledore travel back to redeem Tom before he goes bad, you have to have a reason why he didn't already go back and kill Tom, either when he was a helpless child or when he was already a murderer but still couldn't stand up to Dumbledore. If it was an option he'd have done it during the first war, before he knew Tom was redeemable, surely?

**** When you're right, you're right. He would have, and also there's nothing in canon that allows that kind of long distance time travel.

The simplest answer for why it wasn't an option is that time turners can't go back that far so Albus never considered it. But then there'd have to be something that happens so that he /can/ go back with Harry.

Maybe Albus /made/ an object and that's what he was working on that October 31st that Voldemort attacked the Potters? Hearing the prophecy drove him back to his alchemy background and the research that he used to do with Nicholas Flamel, looking for an answer to take on Harry's burden so that he wouldn't be stuck with the 'neither shall live while the other survives' bit. He wanted to go back to before the prophecy was said, to before Voldemort was too powerful to handle, and end things himself.

So his first plan with the whatever-it-is-time-traveling-object is like you said, going back in time and killing him. But then he has his whole realization that Tom is redeemable and decides to use the time travel to raise him properly instead and face down a different Dark Lord.

**** Tom Riddle: Abused at orphanage Begs every year to stay at Hogwarts request denied Becomes Dark Lord

Severus Snape Abused by father Asks to stay at Hogwarts each Summer Request denied Joins Voldemort (for a period of time)

Harry Potter Abused by relatives Asks to stay home Request denied Reason given = blood wards = Petunia only family he has But James Potter is a Pure Blood All Pure Bloods are related Dumbledore should know this He plans since childhood for Harry to die by Voldemorts hand.

My thoughts are that these events were planned. Things went wrong when he touched the ring. He was cursed and would have suffered a slow death. He asked Severus to kill him.

His initial plan was for Harry to weaken Voldemort and he would step in and finish Voldemort off so he could claim glory.

There are two dark lords

one is Voldemort

and the other is Dumbledore.

he has no plan to save Voldemort before he became evil because that was part of his plan.

****** I have another theory that you might find interesting. As said before it is well known that all Pure Bloods are related. This means that incest occurs. Incest is known to cause genetic defects in real life. (Theory) Now when incest in the magical world occurs the defect that happens might be the inability of offspring to use magic. It is known that the death eaters despise those unable to use magic and the prospect of a child being a squib might be left with a similar (though likely milder) form of disgust.

The child is left in the muggle world never knowing of magic. They marry and possibly have kids and the kids have kids and so on. Then one day a squib comes across another squib falls in love and marries. They have a child capable of using magic. The child is a muggle born. (If we were going by real life standards magic would be a recessive trait. Not part of the theory but interesting none the less.)

With this in mind we can say that Muggleborns do not exist. And there is a very real possibility that Dumbledore knew this.

(Forgive my memory it has been awhile since I read the books so I might mess up some information)

Voldemort decended from the Slytherin line and years of inbreeding had occurred. As a result his mother had nearly lost her ability to use magic. She married a muggle and had a child. The muggle cleansed some of the genetic problems that would have resulted and the magic bypassed the recessive genetic problem.

Voldemort became very powerful. This is different from the squib thing but it shows the similarity to the situation.

** Voldemort was hurt so much in his childhood he just wanted people to fear him so they couldn't get close enough to hurt him. I don't think he would have enjoyed ruling over others or being a leader. I think he just really enjoyed the idea of everyone fearing him so he could do whatever he wanted to do - which is mostly punish those who hurt him.

Harry never really hurt him. He just didn't understand how Lily's love was the answer to his own trauma.

But based upon book canon and the fact that he hurt other children at the orphanage I would consider Tom to be a sociopath. I don't think his driving force was revenge. I believe Tom enjoyed hurting others and killed and practised dark magic bc he could.

** I'm unapologetically anti-tomarry, and I still can see some sense in that explanation. After all, the reason Voldemort even went after the boy in the first place was the prophecy naming him as Voldemort's equal - if Voldemort was simply curious how that can be, then his desire to know what that is about and the desire to just kill the boy and be done with it would conflict. He woud lack the purity of intent to actually finish the job.

And if the Unforgivables require that someone be absolutely sure they want to use one, that would have been enough to at least sap some power from it.

Now, even weakened Cruciatus had some effect on Bellatrix, so I'd expect the Killing Curse to still do something, but it would be subtler than merely "And then he dropped dead". What the effects would be is up to the Author of one of many fanfics exploring the consequences of the Killing Curse, of course.

  What if when Voldemort heard the prophecy, he decided that not only would he go after Neville and Harry, but every child born in that year? What if he decided to kill all children born the year before and the year after as well, just to be on the safe side? Harry Potter is the only boy who lived through the Purge, no one knows why.

He also amasses his group of supporters, his Apostoles.

And then, he dies for the sins of others and rises from the dead.

**** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23263648][*/The Incantation of the Oak-Priest/*]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/relic_crown/pseuds/relic_crown][/relic_crown/]]

#+begin_quote
  A fifteen-year-old Tom Riddle slips through time, pulled by a scarred boy into a seemingly idyllic future. Harry Potter falls with him into a reality untouched by Voldemort's reign. Taken into the Potter household, the two form an unlikely bond -- but between centaur magic, governmental plots, and the darkness at the heart of the Forbidden Forest, this new world is not as it seems.(In which Tom learns to be kind, Harry learns to be cruel, and ancient magic sings to them both from the woods. Meanwhile, a war of metal and secrets brews in the shadows, threatening an end to the fragile peace.)
