So, as the title says, I'm looking for fics that do interesting things with Prophecy. Can be The Prophecy (One Ring to Rule- I mean, Neither Can Live While The Other Survives), a Prophecy (not the main one), or the act of Prophesy itself (as in Faery Heroes, where someone works out how to fake it in an interesting way). I'm aware there probably won't be much, but I'm curious what is there.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** There is a fic where Percy is a prophet. It's actually the part two of a series where Snape kidnapped Harry when he was three and took him to Remus, The secret meaning of flowers.

***** Ah, okay. So, a nicer, less bitter Snape than canon, then. Does he grow into that, or is it more of a "You're hot. Let's bang." level of development? (No criticism either way, I just like to know what I'm getting into).

******* This is really good. Read the first two and I'm on book three now. We have far too few artist-dreamer-soulful-type Harry fics. It's basically this and Ingenio Ab Artifex (which is basically the Lie-I've-Lived-esque Kerouackian Beat-Poet version). :D

** Bobmin's Sunrise over Britain and its sequel, Sunrise over Britain (both on [[https://fanficauthors.net][fanficauthors.net]] - login required), have Hermione as a seer whose prophecies are important.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Ultimate Force by DarkKing666) is a cross with Ah! My Goddess, in which the Norns take Harry in to put the prophecy back on track.

linkffn(Best Laid Schemes by Don Sample) is a Buffy the Vampire Slayer cross, in which Sirius tries to protect Harry from the prophecy.

linkffn(Second World by deadlandmarshall) is a James Bond cross in which Solitaire comes to James with a prophecy concerning Harry.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Alien Reality by Pwn Master Paladin) is a Stargate SG-1 cross. Voldemort knows the prophecy, so he sends Harry to a universe without magic.

linkffn(Mutant Storm by Bobmin356). Cross with X-Men. Harry's mutant power manifests under the stress of hearing the prophecy right after the Department of Mysteries battle.
