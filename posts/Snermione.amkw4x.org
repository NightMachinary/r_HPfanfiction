Looking for a new read. I've read both *Pet Project* and I recently finished *Camerado,* both of which I /loved/. I've tried *Inevitable*, which was okay, I liked the plot but I didn't wind up finishing it because, when it comes to a Snape/Hermione fic, this one just jumped into it wayyyyy to fast. I really enjoy the slow burn with these two, the long, drawn out, build up is far more interesting. I also began and read most of *Chasing the Sun,* I didn't wind up finishing it because once Hermione and Snape got together it was sex scene, after sex scene, after sex scene. Which I do enjoy a good smutty chapter but what both *Pet Project* and *Camerado* did beautifully was that there was only one major sex scene which satisfied that aspect of the pair without going overboard.

I tend to like reading the fics where Hermione is still in school, but I'd be interested in reading a Post-Deathly Hollows story. NO PREGNANT HERMIONE, I just don't see how Snape would really ever want to have children of his own.

Thanks!


** I recommend you "Post tenebra, Lux" by Loten !! :) 10 years after DH :)

** linkffn(The Professor's Discretion by Twelve Years in Azkaban) Very slow burn, its more gen than romance and I don't believe much happens even at the end though.

*** Oh. My. God. I literally just finished this story and I honestly don't know what to do about my feelings. I think this has ruined all other Snape/Hermione fics for me -- they author depicted them SO accurately that I'm not sure any other story could even compare. Thanks for the recommendation!!

** I like stuff by hold_en on a03. Could use a beta but not a ton of sex and the plots are always more original.

  The Department of Mysteries has its own set of entrance criteria, but as Hermione is about to discover, it's not slaying a dragon. It's not even wrestling a troll. It's something far, far worse.

** linkffn(unfinished business by Ramos) is amazing. Written pre-dh (and iirc pre HBP too.) Hermione dies in the middle of potions class. Her ghost stays behind.

Also, anything by Shiv5468 is really good, all of it was pre DH, but her Big Name Death Eater series is hilarious and awesome, and so is A Snape Is For Life, Not Just For Christmas.

linkffn(cloak of courage by wendynat) again, it was a WIKTT marriage law fic which means it was for sure pre HBP, and I'm pretty sure pre OotP even, but basically it's Hermione gets tempted by the dark arts because reasons (and damn good ones) so Snape steps up to help her get through all the shit she's dealing with to stop her from becoming someone she would hate.

  Hermione Granger dies in a potions accident during her final year at Hogwarts. She's not thrilled when she comes back as a ghost, and really not happy at the idea of spending eternity haunting Severus Snape's classroom. This story is being reposted.
