There's nothing quite like a good cry over a well-written fic, and I want to know what story has given that emotionally charged cry to you.

Edit: And, because I believe in trading... My favorite [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3667037/1/Gravity][D/Hr fic]] and a fluffy [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=816&chapno=1][Hr/R fic]] and one of my favorite [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/8][H/Hr fics]]. (I should mention that these make me tear up once in a while but are not soul-wrenching! haha)

*** I will whole-heartedly second Cauterize. It was surprisingly touching for something minimalistic.

A quick and worthwhile read.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The_First_Day][The First Day]] - Some of these chapters will absolutely destroy you. The tale starts immediately where the last book ends and stops exactly one year later. It took my soul to bits. One of the best FanFics I've ever read, and goes really well with canon.

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308510][Christmas in Prison]] Oneshot. I posted this here awhile back. It's my headcanon for what happened at Malfoy Manor with Luna, and probably my all-time favorite oneshot.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308522][The Satellite Heart]] Drarry Real World/Dreamworld AU, but very accessible to people who do not normally read this ship (I do not). It offers a really fresh view of canon Post-Hogwarts and an amazingly fitting AU Post-Hogwarts as well as being quite hilarious and gut-wrenching at once.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][Some Kind of Beauty]] One of my favorite next-gens that takes an all-encompassing look at the next-gen Potter-Weasley clan through Rose's eyes as she grows up. Not too sad, but definitely one where I fell in love with the whole cast of characters, so I have to put in here.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=296549][One and Only]] Victoire/Teddy/Molly. This one's very strictly a romance drama, which I don't often read, but it's done so so well. Beautiful language, definitely emotionally charged.

** So, I read HG/SS. This is one hell of heart-wrencher.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7400212/1/Speak_Softly_Love][Speak Softly, Love]] - The terribly tragic story of Dolohov, courtesy of the ever brilliant [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1613119/Silens_Cursor][Silens Cursor]] (of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade_Cause][Renegade Cause]] fame). Lengthy, but insanely well-done.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7069833/1/Geminio][Geminio]] - Another exquisitely well-written one-shot, this time written by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1400384/Portus][Portus]] and centering around Moody. Also quite lengthy, but definitely worth your time and onions.
