:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It may have been deleted, since I read it about a year or two ago (on AO3) but I thought I'd give this a shot anyways.

The main part I remember about it is that Draco has to fix his finances and to do so he basically works up this complicated spell that does the math for him automagically. Somehow he gets better at it and it escalates to being able to sort of see what's happening to Harry? As though looking in on him from a window? That's how I always pictured it anyways. I would assume there's a reason for why he can see Harry in particular but sadly I don't remember. Or maybe he CAN look anywhere and chooses Harry because it's a slash fic.

Meanwhile, I'm pretty sure Harry is working in the Auror office. This doesn't really narrow the options down much, I know.

I think I remember it being pretty good, too! It would be a real shame if it were in fact deleted.

If this rings any sort of bell, I would much appreciate it if you put your wildest guesses in the comments as that means more things for me to read either way. I'll let you know if it's the same or not.
