I've been playing around with an idea for a fic today. In it magic works in a similar way to Charmed in that all witches and wizards have a primary magical ability and the rest is spell work. But I'm having trouble with who would have what power.

At the moment I have harry with the power of reflection, hermoine with a perfect memory (so she can case countless spells), neville with plant speaking, dumbledore with control over fire. But I'm having trouble with the rest, has anyone got any suggestions?

Thank you

Here's a table of [[http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/comicsalliance.com/files/2010/05/periodictable-2.jpg][powers]] if anyone needs it but feel free to make up you own.


** I really LIKE this idea. I'd suggest you under-power the canon spells and potions to make the powers count for more. Animigus forms should be power related, or the power itself. So, character suggestions:

Voldemort's power could be the power to see people's greatest desires and fears, that's why he was able to recruit so well. Since Harry's power is reflection, he's not a Horcrux, the Mirror of Erised is. Each one of the Horcruxes exploits the desires or fears of those who come near it.

Ron's power could be to slow down time, and he can move at normal speed (if he moves too much too quickly friction starts burning him). Hence he is able to do advanced analysis in a short period of time and move like a chess piece.

Snape's power could be resistance of other powers (not total resistance, but Voldemort has trouble reading him, Dumbledore would have trouble burning him, hint at the power with Hermione being dense at potions).

Draco's power could be misdirection, he can forcibly make people unfocused in general or not focused on him, he evades getting in trouble for all his bullying this way. It's also a personal part of why he hates Harry, cause using his power on him makes him suffer. Lucius' power in turn forces people to pay attention to him.

George's power could be telepathy and Fred's power could be "switching" in which he teleports to where someone is and they in turn teleport to where he was. They use this for ridiculous pranks and it's later useful in battle.

Lily's power could have been inspiring hope. James' power could have been a sort of shield (not true Reflection like Harry). Sirius' power could be deception (he can plant false ideas in other people's heads). Peter's power is lying, and he tricked everyone into thinking his power was revealing the truth.

Lupin should not have a power (this provides even more context as to why wizarding society refuses to accept werewolves). Tonks' metamorph ability is her power.

Care for more suggestions?

*** Under powering spells was what I was going for, with classes more focused on developing abilities. Something along the lines of building on your power, to strength your magic.

Your Draco is perfect, it works so well with the Malfoys persona. I might expand it to Lucius, as a family inherited ability and as an older wizard Lucius could have evolved it to do the reverse.

I think Lily should have the shielding ability, and James have flight. Peters ability sounds perfect, and the idea that the werewolf virus removes abilities is brilliant.

I thought Snape should have some sort of shadowy power, he can move through shadows, manipulate them.

*** Duplication for Fred/George and Transmutation for McGonagall sounds superb.

** I like the idea that Harry's power is an exaggerated version of what protected him in the series. Whatever you select shouldn't range too far afield so much as be a reinterpretation of what we've seen.

- Hermione's gift is book affinity- she can understand written works to the point that she intuits what the author intends, making even poorly-framed explanations useful to her. She transcribes Binns' lectures in order to integrate the knowledge.

- Ron can eat just about anything, even if he doesn't enjoy it.

- Seamus has a gift with fire

- Molly Weasley has Mother voice

- Arthur's power is a trust aura- he appears innocuous, even harmless, allowing him to operate within the Dark Ministry when his allegiance was fairly obvious.

- Luna has the shield of innocence- despite everything that could have been done to her, no one ever really hurts her, physically.

- Voldemort had vocal compulsion powers that were often mistaken for mind reading, They also boost the strength of his spoken spells- why else would he bother, seeing as speaking spells out loud is often seen as juvenile?

- Dumbledore actually could read minds from an early age, which sped up his learning curve tremendously.

- Ollivander... wand whisperer. (I'm going to write a whole story about this someday)

- Ginny has a gift for throwing powerful curses.

- The twins are a near lethal combination of Fred's ability to convince people to take what he offers and George's capacity for turning anything into a disposable joke.

*** Ooh, what would mothers voice be?

I like Dumbledore as a mind-reader, but perhaps as a secondary ability? fire for me seems like his number one talent.

Seamus should have some sort of explosive ability.

Voldemorts ability is spot on with what I was thinking

Rons is great, cant believe i didnt think of it.
