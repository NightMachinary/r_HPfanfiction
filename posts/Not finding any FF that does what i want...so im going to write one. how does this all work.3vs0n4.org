** If you post a fanfic and ask for commentary - don't blow off the people who make comments even if you don't like the comment.

(I once read a first fic from someone who consistently misspelled the name of a secondary character - not a big deal except this character was on every other page. They also included one of my biggest peeves: a young adult character on a restricted income living in "big city" with a personal vehicle & driving everywhere in "fifteen minutes". Not only didn't the writer appreciate my comments, the rest of his/her readers jumped all over me for being "critical". Well ok)

***** Harry is somewhat rich, yeah.

It's just that most people, for whatever reason, take the movie versions as some sort of “superior canon” and in the movie (the first one at least), though there was some gold there wasn't too much of it. Add to that the fact that the prices and incomes in the books can seem a bit inconsistent at times---then again, we only really see the price of the Firebolt, of Harry's wand, the size of the lottery and the Triwizard Tournament winnings, and Madam Weasley being able to buy relatively much stuff for one galleon and a change---and it's really hard to tell how much money Harry really has.

That being said, I think the weird exchange ratio of galleons to pounds is caused by the fact that neither wizards nor goblins kept up with the time; there was a time, after all, when one pound was equal in value to one pound of silver.

****** I think there's a trend in fanfiction, too, for those who want to explore a Harry who has money problems to say he has just enough money to pay for school. That was never in the books, I'm pretty darn sure. And with the "Word of God" we have from JKR about Hogwarts not charging tuition and Harry's grandfather inventing a popular name-brand product it seems to me he's comfortably rich- not on Malfoy's level but enough that he's in no danger of running out of money as long as he spends it wisely. And then of course he later gets all the Black estate from Sirius.

******* Yeah, that; and if people really wanted to make him richer there's nothing to stop them from making it an AU story where Fleamont didn't sell the company that makes this particular product and after a time they got even richer (to be honest, I find the fact that /that particular product/ is what made them rich, relatively or very, to be hilarious).

Honestly, I'm not sure why would money be that much of an issue for people writings stories in the first place, since Harry's money is in galleons and his ability to spend those at all is a problem, and should he try to exchange those he'd only get pounds and then whatever other thing he'd be doing the problem wouldn't be money itself but rather being able to spend it without some adults going weird and calling the police about there being a free-running minor with a lot of money since it's the nineties.

If that's the case, you could always have Draco accidentally fire a stunner out of nervousness, but have it go wide and hit a cloaked and petrified Harry instead and knock him out the window. Dumbledore manages to hit him with a spell that saves his life from the fall, but his quick movement makes the DE's react and blast him out the window too, which kills him.

******** Why not make it so he fights the petrifaction so hard that his magic breaks it but blows him out the window? The big issue with promises -> magical vows is that it would look weird to have one work against Harry in the beginning of the story but then never mention them again. Now, if you somehow work one into the story later, say near the climax, but have it work FOR harry this time, that could be ok. From what you say though it sounds like you just need a way to knock Harry out of the fight early, which can be done any number of ways that don't require having to somehow explain to your readers how Harry accidentally made a magical vow.

As a side note, if magical vows really did work that way, then magical children would be losing their magic left and right since kids are dumb and don't always know what they're saying. I remember reading a one-shot where thousands of children and adults all over Britain died when Harry got married because they all made magical vows to marry him at some point. It was kinda horrifying since it was focused on Ginny smiling as Harry made his vows to someone else when she just slumped over dead in the audience from her childhood vow kicking in.

** If you do time travel, I suggest not using the time turner approach, because it's either too limiting in their actions or creates paradoxes.

Sending memories/soul back has the limit on how far they can go back. Usually the limit is their first year at Hogwarts. But other than that, there are no restrictions on what they can do.

My favorite form of time travel is actually dimensional, where protagonists create a portal to a different universe that runs parallel, but not perfectly aligned in time. A great example is *Para Bellum*, linkffn(9754483), the sequel to *Delenda Est*. This story holds great promise, but hasn't been updated in almost a year. Other good examples include *Deepest Reflections*, linkffn(3959072), sequel to *The Darkness Within*, and *Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925).

As for the protagonists, I suggest sending more than one. It just makes more interesting interactions. That's one of the reasons *Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650), is such a great read.

**** So there are a couple different ways to do time travel.

There is the stable time loop version, where the time travel has always happened so nothing is changed, e.g. how time turners seem to work in canon or the movie interstellar. That can be limiting in what your characters can do but also can have a pretty interesting story.

Then there is the version where the time travel itself creates a branching reality so paradoxes aren't an issue. The original reality can either cease to exist at this point if you don't want to deal with it again, or it can still exist if you want the character to travel back to it at some point a la dbz. This is probably what you want for your story based on what you've said about your story, and it gives you the most flexibility. You can do this with an actual person, or with memories.

Then there is the one where a character travels to an alt dimension that is either ahead or behind, which isn't really time travel but accomplished the same thing. This is similar to the time travel creating a branching reality except the alt dimension already existed before the travel.

I've also seen a version where someone travels back in time, is able to actually change things significantly, but must make sure that their future self still has a reason to go back in time, even though this clearly creates a paradox since the changes would make the future self to do the travel a different person so their actions should be different so it doesn't really make sense that this would be able to happen. I can suspend my disbelief and enjoy the story with this, but I still think it makes more sense if the time travel itself creates a new separate reality so you don't need to worry about paradoxes imo.

** I wouldn't mind reviewing your story, but really, if you are considering writing a fic you need to be aware of exactly how time-consuming it is. Set a schedule, and don't blow it off, because it'll happen again.

Also, plan your fic well. Many writers are the kind who write best when they have ambiguous paths to take, but that doesn't mean they don't plan.

There's also all sorts of other tips from writers here, if you care to search past threads.
