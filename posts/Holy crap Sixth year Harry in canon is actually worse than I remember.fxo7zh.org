Because of the quarantine I have been rereading the series and I think I must have mixed canon with canon at some point because Harry and the others are even worse than I remember Every time something to do with teenage drama or quidditch or the malfoy argument comes up I am just screaming in my head that there is a fucking war going on- I am going to cut myself off here Are there any fics that fix the last 2 books No hinny no harmony no fem Harry no bashing


** During my most recent reread of the 5th book, all I could think of after Harry get's the vision of Sirius being tortured was "Damn Harry you are stupid! Listen to Hermione and the other members of the DA goddamnit! Stupid fucking Gryffindor! Rushing into things again..."

But I think J.K. really portrayed the way teenagers act really well. Just when you are older you look at it from a different pov. and think, damn these kids are stupid. Even Malfoy has more of a grip of the actual situation than Harry during the 6th book. Ok tbh, it's hard not to if you literally have to assassinate you headmaster who is very capable.

*** I think I was Harry‘s age when the 5th come out, even reading it then I was thinking gee this is stupid.

One of the main points after book 4 where Harry seems to spiral down hill in stupidity. Doesn't seem to mature with age.

**** To be honest, I'm a year older than what Harry would have been, and I don't think I would have immediately gone "fucking roadtrip to deaths door" if I thought my father figure was in danger.

Then again, I'd probably have no idea that it was occuring

** Every teenager (me included, when I was that age) is stupid. Give yourself a nice evening, rent (or find on Netflix or whatever people do these days) “Romeo and Juliet” (1968 version by Franco Zeffirelli with Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey), and then tell me they were not stupid. Of course, they were.

*** It's not about being stupid and making mistakes and stuff it's how he is t thinking about the consequences of what he is doing Sirius died because of his actions and yet he is content on just continuing on the same path Years 1-5 show them maturing but then hbp it's like he regressed

**** I agree with the notion that HBP is on the lower half of the canonical books ordered by quality.
