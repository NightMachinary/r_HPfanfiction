Like Umbridge the worst ministry person absolutely awful and everyone knows it. But for example Barty Crouch Sr. pretty shit too and I think people kinda forget about him.

So who is your least favorite character whose awfulness is forgotten?


** Harry's neighbors who saw one underfed boy working all day and being shouted at and said nothing

*** I sometimes wonder about this. Petunia and Vernon were obsessed with appearing normal so maybe they tried hard not to make it obvious to the neighbors that they were bad to Harry. It can be difficult to notice what your neighbor is doing if they're actively hiding it.

(I need to reread the books if they ever did something so blatant to Harry outdoors. Canon and fanon writings can get mixed up in my head.)

**** I definitely confuse canon and fanon, too! Here's some abuse from books where neighbors could see what was happening:

CoS:

> Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan.

The paragraph immediately preceding this one takes place by the hedge, but Dudley ran to the house. It's not clear to me where this incident took place. It could be that it happened near the sink while she was washing a frying pan. It could also be that Dudley snitched on Harry and she came outside with the frying pan. In any case, the neighbors would be able to see this punishment:

> While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice-creams, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses and re- painted the garden bench.

OotP:

>he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat.

This also isn't even including the more implicit stuff, like one little boy looking beaten down and miserable all day while the other boy is a bully whose violence is never discouraged.

**** I saw a really interesting take on this in a fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]]. The author hypothesizes that Dumbledore got her the house to watch over Harry and, as a squib, Mrs. Figg couldn't hope for better than having an assigned post where she just needs to live. If Harry was removed from the Dursleys' care, she would be out of a home. It may not have been intentional, but she had a strong motive not to push too hard to have Harry taken away.

** None other than Cornelius Fudge. Everyone seems to forget that Umbridge's reign of terror at Hogwarts was only possible with his active support. No doubt he was behind the smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore in the Daily Prophet. More people should call him out for sticking his attack dog on them, the coward, instead of facing the reality of Voldemort's return and installing some safeguards to prepare Britain for war. I just really, really loathe that despicable cretin for making Voldemort's life so much easier and I feel like more people should too.

** Snape. He told the Dark Lord to kill James and his son and only spare Lily. So he thought after that Lily would return to him for comfort. So it's like that he wanted a married woman's son and husband dead so you could be with her. That's just sick. He bullies an orphan, a kid with major self esteem issues and a muggleborn who is constantly bullied by the students of your house. You put your life in danger but it was not because it was the right thing to do but because you wanted revenge. You yourself go to the Whomping Willow (nobody forced him to. He went on his own accord) and after James Potter saves you, you try to paint yourself as the innocent victim in front of Lily and discredit James.

*** I don't believe that makes him awful, he's complicated and at the time this is happening, he's scared. Imagine you're in that position; you are an outcast in a society that despises your existence, but someone takes a chance on you. You get to be like everyone else for a while, but you come so close to almost killing a student and you hate yourself even more. You fight in a war, but are treated with suspicion even by your own friends, and that war ends up destroying those friends. Now you have nothing left and go to ground. One day the same person takes another chance only this time you are wracked with guilt, and your magic AIDS gets discovered, so you resign for valid reasons, and go to ground again but when the war starts in earnest again, you are there to help and fight again, only this time you lose your last friend and the last link to a happier time. You go undercover at great personal risk to help the war effort. The relationship you find yourself in, is complicated and messy and potentially toxic and you regret it. So, finally, at this point when the world seems most bleak, you run to the place where you feel most useful, only to be told that that was a mistake, and after 5 minutes you realise the truth and go running back to your wife. A few months later you die in the war that claimed all your friends.

Thats called being conflicted and being human, and i'd like to see others in the same situation try and make any different choices. Its very easy to cast aspersions about morality when you are an outside observer, but not when you've been pushed to breaking point. People are far too reductionist these days.

** Draco Malfoy. He said an orphan that he would die at the age of 11 that he would die like his parents. At 12 he wished for a student to be killed. At 13 he tried to give Harry information about Sirius Black and his betrayal and taunted him, trying to make him go after a supposed mass murderer. At 14, he tried his best to discredit Harry and even gave personal information about Harry to Rita Skeeter. At 15, he docked points from people because he didn't like them and from Hermione because she was a muggleborn. At 16, he almost used an unforgivable on another student(Don't give me that he was forced to bullshit). He was gleeful to be given the task to kill Dumbledore. He just realised that killing wasn't so easy. He almost killed two people. And Voldemort never forced Draco to use the cruciatus curse on Harry. It's just who he was. He was a racist, a pureblood supremacist, a bully, arrogant and an arsehole. His awfulness is forgotten and all Tom Felton fangirls start crushing on him. He suddenly becomes a a person with a golden heart hidden beneath his sneers. I have a question. What has he done to deserve forgiveness? He does marry a pureblood. (If JK wanted to show him change so much just make him marry at least a half-blood and use it according to your plot's convenience). He got much more than he deserved. He got a happy family, a job at the ministry and was never sent to prison.

** I feel like saying anything but Draco here is nuts. Looking at the fandom, you would think he was a fourth member of the trio who courageously turned his back on the death eaters, I've seen it stated as if it were canon that he was second in the class a bunch of times. Like. There is literally nothing in common between the Draco in the books and the fandoms version of him. It's truly bizarre.

He was proud to be a death eater, everything he ever said and did was to hurt someone else, the only thing we know about his grades are that they were bad his first year and he showed up in potions year six, which could mean he got his potions owl or it could mean Snape let him in because he wanted to keep an eye on him.

No, I am not a misandrist, I just feel that your speculation which has no basis in canon doesn't really matter in this situation. I'm not trying to put down Ron and imply he's a bad person for attacking Ginny. I am just trying to say that this sub needs to stop attacking Hermione for doing the same things Harry and Ron do. If Ginny actually attacked her brothers, it would be better for my case in defending Hermione.

Also, I feel you need control of your temper, since you reach a lot of absurd conclusions in your haste to defend Ron. Insulting me by saying I'm discriminatory towards half of the population is extremely hurtful and offensive. I've been put down and assumed to be many things because I am black. I've been called a coon, a ni**er, a knuckle dragger, an ape, and so many other names. After I got accepted into an elite STEM high school where everbody was rich and either white or Asian, I was constantly told that I wasn't worthy enough no matter my grades and how hard I worked to be the best. I can swear to you that I would never try to put someone down the way I have been put down before.

#+begin_quote

I did it, and I still really like her character. The only thing I would judge a male!Hermione harsher for is accepting Ron's disgusting treatment of him. I could get why canon Hermione did it, since from a young age, girls are told that the boys who pull on their hair and call them names actually have a crush on them.

#+begin_quote

Again with the name calling. At least it wasn't offensive this time. Look, I will admit that there was a time where I basically worshipped Hermione. I wanted so badly to just keep my chin up when other people were deriding me, to be outspoken even when no one wants to hear what I have to say, and to fight against injustice even when others think I'm silly. But I grew up, and realized I'm my own person and that I don't need to idolize a fictional character. I think that's something you need to realize, since your obsession with Ron is unhealthy. Almost every one of your comments that I see have to either jerk off Ron or deride Hermione. The way you lash out and insult or try to hurt someone at any perceived injustice against him is a bit concerning. I honestly do not mean to offend you, and I'm truly sorry if I did. Good night!

That just seems like it's glossing over her flaws because you extremely dislike her. Regarding Ginny, it's never been said that she's hit any of her brothers, so she most likely mastered that hex without hurting anybody. You're reaching very hard just so that Ron and Ginny can be "equal", so stop trying to say I'm the one who's glossing over people's flaws.

I'm sorry I don't have encyclopedic knowledge of the books. I was wrong to not have checked the book first, but I'd hardly call that moving goal posts. Also, that quote was stating that she was shaming him, so it's not that different from shaming the whole family.

The "control your temper" comment was just because you insult people if they dare call out Ron's faults, even if I'm just trying to say that every character's faults should be judged the same. I don't know why that's so offensive to you. I really didn't mean to be insulting, and I'm sorry.

I also find it quite hypocritical for you to act like I'm the one who insults you, when your replies to me have been extremely aggressive. You can call me a misandrist and say that if Hermione bashing annoys Hermione Stans ike me, it's even better with literally no provocation, but if I say that you have an uncontrolled temper after you say stuff like that?

**** In case you weren't noticing, we were only discussing Hermione this time. There's no need to bring up every single character who has questionable behaviour whenever you bring up just one. Ron and Harry have been massively criticised in other posts.

***** There is a need to do that, because every thread that is about Hermione has to mention her being "abusive" when both Ron and Harry have done the same thing. Harry and Ron are never criticized this sub. There was one post about how Harry was a pretty bad friend, and it was downvoted to hell. Same with that thread that talked about how Ron was pretty shitty towards people. Both of them have around zero upvoted. Compare that with the multiple threads discussing how Hermione is a horrible person who brutally attacks innocent people like Umbridge and Rita Skeeter. Those threads all have at least 30 upvotes. Don't try to act like it's equal, because it's not.

****** Fanfic isn't equal either. Ron-bashing has been done to death and fics where Harry is smarter, more cunning, more popular, hotter, etc are equally pervasive. The reason why Hermione is generally "left alone" is because fanon amps up what canon provided and her super-fans do the rest. Bringing up her ignored or glossed over flaws is fair game, and if annoys super-fans like you, all the better.

** Honestly, Crab and Goyle. Yes they are portrayed as walking brainless morons, but they caused a lot of damage that the trio of them and Malfoy got away with.

** My least favourites are Barty Sr, who was, at /best/, neglectful at home on top of everything else... but also Snape for the reasons people usually dislike Snape, Fudge for the reasons people usually dislike Fudge, and Lupin, for much the same reasons already stated in this thread.

Further to previous answers, Lupin also never tried to contact Harry, even after he entered Hogwarts, until he became a Professor and was forced into proximity. Never wrote, even when Harry was announced as a Triwizard Champion. He doesn't seem to particularly care about him at all.
