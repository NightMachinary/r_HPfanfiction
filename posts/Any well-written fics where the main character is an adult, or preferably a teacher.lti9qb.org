Basically anyone who's actually experienced with magic

I've had a vague idea for a fanfic for a while now and I've been thinking the main character would be a teacher, but I don't have a good understanding for how much magic an average adult wizard would have available to them.

Bonus points if you can give me a fic with well written action stuff and/or some good class scenes, because I need all the help I can get with writing things lmao


** I think how much magic an average adult has is a bit subjective and it depends on what kind of school you want to make Hogwarts. Some make it a the only school in the UK, some make it for the elite, some say it's good by UK standards and crap compared to the rest of the world.

I do recommend linkffn(Just A Random Tuesday) which takes place during OotP from McGonagall's perspective. It shows her dealing with unruly students, her fellow teachers and how the teacher's life is /never/ done. One of my favourites and very in character.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

** Iinkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower) is fantastic. Swung by Serafim by the same order. I don't know if you'll like the story but it's Snape centric so there's a lot of scene of him planning classes and just being a teacher which would help.

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

** The premise of my fic (I apologize for the self-promotion - I have no willpower to stop myself) is that the MC is a teacher, and there are quite a few class scenes. I can't claim that it's well-written, since it's mine, but it meets the other criteria.\\

** I recently finished reading this one fic called ‚ÄúYou and I‚Äù on fan fiction net. The main character is not a teacher but a healer. It's an OC fic, the OC is a healer and she meets Harry in St. Mungo's after Albus broke his leg. It's honestly one of the best OC fic I've read

  Post- DH/ AU. Healer Sadie Lewis never knew that fixing Al Potter's broken leg would lead to such a profound romance with his father. Harry/OC, Ginny/Dean, all other canon intact. Rated M for later chapters. All reviews appreciated!
