***** Hell yes!

My advice is sometimes you have to push through the bad to get to the good, if you have a bunch of stuff planned for the chapter after the one you are struggling with, you could always either push a subpar chapter (in your opinion) or give a stub with a general outline of what you mean to happen, and then move on.

Mind you the closest thing I get to writing is here on reddit, so my advice should probably be ignored.

  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Holly/Harry/we're not sure what'll happen. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in subject to entanglement).

After you conjure them, they would be actual people, with feelings and everything, even if they were of an animal-level intelligence.

******* Well, from what we know from the birds and snakes and water and flames and whatever conjured in canon, it doesn't just have a likeness, it is the actual thing. Harry interacted with the conjured snake. It reacted. So if you conjure a human, you conjure a human, that can react and feel and think like any other human. And if you conjure a human of animal-level intelligence, then it is still a human. There is nothing in canon that would suggest it would be different, as far as I can remember at least.

Also birds, snakes, etc... those are lower year spells that aren't freeform Conjuration which is notably an offshoot of transfiguration.

********** A conjured person that's no smarter than a turkey and only does what the wizard who commands it to do is exactly that. Also your comparison is crap. If human-sized sex dolls were anonymous, free, felt real, looked real, self-cleaning, self-warming, and could store themselves in a pocket dimension unless needed, you can also damn well bet they would be a common adult toy. The canon HP verse leaves out that side of life but it doesn't take much imagination to see that what is possible is likely also in use.

*********** You don't see a problem with conjuring someone that looks and feels like a human, that can feel pain and fear, and basically raping them? (under something like the imperius, if we add your "only does what the wizard commands" point) As long as it has consciousness, and can be afraid, and needs to be forced - by magic or physical strength - it is problematic.

I can agree that a more real feeling version of a sex doll would be more popular, but I think you shouldn't disregard the creepy factor. You'd be fucking someone/something that looks and feels like a real person, but nothing is inside.
