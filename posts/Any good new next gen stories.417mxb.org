It's been about a year and a half since I last search for some next gen stories... anyone know a good one published since then?

I really don't care for the characters (beyond the fact that I tend to favour Scorpius) as long as the story is well written, so any suggestion is welcome.


** Linkffn(Clash by shezwriter)

Scorpius isn't the focal point of the story, but he plays quite an important role.

  James Potter and Scorpius Malfoy are enemies, everyone knows that. So when a Malfoy is put in Gryffindor, sparks soon fly. But with dark magic rising, the Malfoy family in trouble, and the Muggle and Magical worlds set to collide, old rivalries may have to be forgotten. Various pairings. Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?
