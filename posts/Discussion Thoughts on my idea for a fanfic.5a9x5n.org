** Just keep asking yourself so what? What differences would it make? How does that snowball? If you can keep justifying things then fine but it has the potential to get iffy. If Harry isn't friends with Ron then he isn't there when Sirius goes after him meaning nobody stops him killing Peter who then doesn't flee to Voldemort who helps crouch Jr, who then enters Harry into the triwizard, which leads to Voldemorts resurrection which leads to Umbridge etc. Are you looking to rewrite cannon with Draco or something more interesting?

** I'm not sure if you're joking-it's actually a pretty popular premise! It seems like you've been thinking about it for a bit, so why not try writing it?

*** Not joking haha! I've been out of the community for a year or so now so I'm not sure if it's still popular. I'll give it a shot now!

** What makes it different other than the older brother? There's hundreds and hundreds of these fics. Why would this be different? What is the hook that makes people want to read your story over another Harry befriends Draco story?
