** The issue of being orphaned at a very young age is that your parents aren't around to make a younger sibling. Adoption is possible though. I vaguely remember one where Harry grew up with the Lovegoods, can't think of what it was called...

*** Harry Familing his AU self is pretty common. Whether that is his 'just won' self going back and being an elder brother to his 11 year old self or adult!harry going back and being his own adoptive dad.

Because.... magic?
