#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

*** Yep. A damn good fic. Shame updates take so long. At least the next chapter will be big.

**** I don't plan on reading any of the future updates, actually. Having the Flamels be the Clintons is just so utterly ridiculous, the fic shattered my suspension of disbelief.

****** Yeah. According to Dumbledore, the Flamels are off playing politics in America. At the end of chapter 23, Harry ends up in the oval office, and the President tells the Secret Service guards that he needs his wife, outright telling us that the President and First Lady are the Flamels. During the 90s, that would be the Clintons.

******* I would like to think that in a world full of magic the idea of a non-Clinton!President in the 90s isn't too much of a stretch.

******* Ah. Well, not necessarily. It could still be two different people. Maybe the Clinton's never took office during that time in that universe.
