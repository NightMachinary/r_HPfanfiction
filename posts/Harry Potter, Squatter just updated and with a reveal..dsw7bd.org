Harry Potter, Squatter is probably one of the best crossovers updated at this moment and it got an update that is very meaningful. We finally know who Harry's mother is and it's not anything surprising, since the hints were given in the third to last chapter and it finally got confirmed.

This fic is so adorable and amazing, I can't possibly recommend it enough.

** Four thoughts after reading that chapter.

1 - I didn't see that coming.\\
2 - Looking back, there was foreshadowing for this revelation (and I missed it!)\\
3 - It explains so much...\\
4 - ...and now I'm going to have to wait for the next chapter!

*** I was 99% sure after the poker and mahjong game night. She was even mentioned by name. This made me positive, that she was the godly parent. Now, I'm just happy I was right.

**** I know he's supposed to be young, and it's a young perspective/outlook, but I think it just personally makes me feel a bit uncomfortable?? The manner he speaks can be conflicting at times, and what he should/shouldn't know based on the age they're trying to portray. For example:

"What... was that?" he asked, in awe. "That thing you did, with your arms," ...."That is called a hug."

&

Harry shook his head. "There's something written at the foot of Mister Statue, but it's written in strange characters, like the guy was drunk or something."

_____\\
For some reason, he's never seen a hug before, though he must have seen his guardians hug Dudley many times, or other parents and children after school. But he know what it means to be drunk and how it could affect writing? And would say characters instead of letters?

I think it's just little things, but they pile up for me. I love the idea of the story, but maybe I've just read too many stories with more mature children -- so reading one that doesn't, it annoys me a bit. It was the same with one that got recommended awhile back, the one where Harry gets adopted by a band of gypsies -- it just gives me the same feel/vibes.

***** Heh, interesting. That's very informative and I understand your reasons. For me they don't break the suspension of disbelief, but I do notice those mistakes.

Also, after all the Harry's yearmates are secret political geniuses, I actually enjoy the naivety and age appropriate behaviour of this Harry.

****** i think the naivety fits his characters in this story. my problem is that sometimes he knows how to run but doesn't know what walking is, and that irks me. It's a pretty good story overall, when i tried reading this new chapter, i left in the beginning because of the hentai dialogue.

******* Yeah the hentai thing runs a bit more than it should as a cheap gag, which is a bit in appropriate in the first place. Overall it feels like a clumsy way to try and get a laugh and let Apollo say he's really old. I still like the story overall, and I feel like it hits a lot of good emotional marks, but yeah it can get a bit lost in places.

**** You seriously asking me that? I mean, when Harry gets trained in the art of war by Athena, you'd think she would teach him roman martial arts, nets, spears, etc etc, or at at the very least, modern version of martial combat. Instead, he get's handed Chinese martial arts from ancient China. You have to understand, the greek gods adapted to America, so thus, must adapt to the modern world of MMA and martial arts such as judo, jiu jitsu, kickboxing, and many more related to UFC.

Martial ability is about evolving, not staying stagnent.

This is far too influced by anime when the guy came along and gifted Harry with hentai porn.

And kung fu is far too limited in a fight. More acrobatic and gymnastic than actual fighting ability.

***** You're referring to this passage:

#+begin_quote
  "As a mortal, and especially as a demigod, you may not have the option of total pacifism," Athena said, brutally honest. Harry's shoulders dropped, and he looked at the ground. Everyone was pushing him to fight.

  "Here is something that may help you," Athena said, causing Harry to look up. The Goddess of Wisdom pulled a book out of thin air, and handed it to him. "In the Orient, there is an order of monks called /shaolin/, and their philosophy will be of interest to you. They train their entire life in the martial arts, learning many different styles of combat, both in hand-to-hand and with various weapons such as staves and swords. They are known the world over as some of the deadliest fighters."

  Harry stared at the book. Those guys sounded awesome, but still... fighting. He'd always been the victim. He knew first-hand how much it hurt, and he didn't want to inflict it on anyone else.

  "However," Athena went on to say, "they are also among the most peaceful. Their religion is called /Chan Buddhism/. It prohibits violence, so they will go out of their way to avoid it. However, when all other options are exhausted, they can protect themselves."
#+end_quote

Let's recall that over the course of this story, Harry's been influenced by Hestia to abhor violence. Athena is using this example to explain to Harry why he needs to learn to fight, not necessarily that he needs to learn to fight /that way/.

All of Harry's other lessons with Athena after this involve learning to think strategically and use his mind.

****** Also, Harry got the knowledge of martial arts thanks to Hephaestus' gift. So he probably will use his fists mostly in close combat, because he got some skills from a godly source already. Why go through the extra work of training him specifically for the spear, when he already has a good basic knowledge of unarmed fighting? That's stretching him too far. Let him learn martial arts until he is solid enough with it, then suggest to him to learn an additional weapon, if unarmed, archery, knife fighting, fire magic and the lasso aren't enough.

***** I think your issue is with overabundance of Eastern culture in Western media, rather than in this fic in particular. Any anime or Eastern references are kept in tone and normal. What we had is a God from an Eastern pantheon and a hentai comic in over 120k words (novel length).

****** No, my problem is that the western gods aren't jealous of eastern gods teaching harry their martial arts. It's not bias or racism, or some such, but simply that the greek gods are very territorial of their possessions and proud of their culture. For Athena to hand a book on Kung Fu to Harry is just... wtf?

******** Actually he raises a good point, remember how the other gods give Hestia strange looks when she suggests having an 'out of pantheon' god teach Harry magic, and only really get a bit more chill when it's revealed to be a 'rogue' god with no pantheon? It does seem a bit strange that Athena wouldn't use any other western example there.
