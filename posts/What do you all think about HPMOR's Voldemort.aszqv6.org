Most of the criticism I see about /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ seems to be aimed specifically at Harry himself. I rarely see Voldemort mentioned, especially considering how prominent he is in that fic compared to most others. To be honest, for me he stands out as one of the most memorable Voldemorts that I've seen in the fandom - this nigh supernaturally competent villain that I genuinely felt would be a threat the country and more if returned to power. Or maybe I'm just looking back with something like rose tinted glasses, and he wasn't nearly as impressive as I remember.

So I was just wondering; what are your thoughts on the character?


** He was a competent Voldemort who seemed to have things figured out, and I felt that many readers and the story itself lauds him on this competence, overcoming the original canon Voldemort's failures and ineffectualness---he split is soul into a hundred random objects and put one on a spaceship, he realized his dream of becoming a Hogwarts professor, he was pro-active instead of sitting at the back of some dude's smelly turban for the whole year. He's made a genuine threat by an author who made up that "If Frodo has a lightsaber, then Sauron neesd a Death Star" quote.

However... the part of me that enjoys Harry Potter's universe for the original style and whimsy, doesn't see HPMOR's tone and objectives fitting into that framework at all. I personally don't like Eliezer's soapbox-y opinions, and they don't fit into Harry Potter, nor do his characters really /feel/ like HP characters. Perhaps that's due to the author admitting he never finished the books, and based a lot of his worldbuilding on deconstructing the original setting. The whole tone seemed disingenuous to a long time HP fan. (And ignoring that Harry is OOC af, Hermione is some troll-unicorn-hybrid, and Draco is a rape enthusiast... like wtf is up with that.)

That's the crux of the issue: I might have seen HPMOR Voldemort as threat, a genuine obstacle, a clever character, I didn't /like/ his character. Voldemort, to me, is defined by his flaws and failures, his psychoses and hypocrisies. He might be a dumbass who eats Idiot Balls for breakfast, but his weaknesses and fallibility is what I find interesting about his character. HPMOR Voldemort, after the first glance and the big reveal, wasn't that interesting except as a mouthpiece for counter-rhetoric to Harry James Evans-Verres-Yudkowsky-Potter-Black.

*** Very well said.

One thing I would add is that Yudkowski's Voldemort breaks his own rule regarding retaining conflict. This rule is most commonly expressed to mean "don't make your hero OP" but it also applies to mean "don't make your villain literally invincible". Notably, the Death Star had an exploitable weakness.

In the original books, the wizarding world has no real interest in space other than observing it through telescopes, even though magic is eminently well-positioned to allow wizards to go to space (perhaps the very ease of doing so is why they have no interest in it - it's not an accomplishment). To break the setting by having one wizard using space without adjusting the setting to have other wizards doing the same is conflict-breaking. On top of that, Voldemort's use of space ties back into what you say about MOR destroying the character of HP magic. Wizards in space is just tonally wrong within the HP world.

**** I also wish that if Yudkowsky had given Frodo a lightsaber, he'd also given X-Wings to the Rohirrim, which leads back to your point:

Harry (JPEV, pbuh), Voldy, and Harry's sidekicks are much more intelligent than their original characterizations, but everyone else in the wizarding world is dumb. Is it realistic for Harry to be the first person to try to study the magical world with scientific methods? Had no one before Harry ever thought about converting pound sterling to Galleons and made a fortune through arbitrage? On most first impressions, the arbitrage economics lecture with McGonagall either makes Harry look like a Cool Indie Protagonist or a Insufferable Brat, and people either keep reading or drop the fic.

But on a second impression, it reinforces how Yudkowsky went about with the worldbuilding, picking and choosing what he wanted in order to create a backdrop and proving ground for his rational protagonist, who discusses his personal talking points. And the purpose of the antagonist (Voldemort) was for him to deliver the rebuttal...

... and that's not what Harry Potter is about. Those aren't the themes the HP universe was meant to explore or examine. The tonal weirdness in HPMOR goes deep.

***** To me, fanfiction is not about copying the original. It's about taking inspiration from the original and doing one's own thing. In that light, I find HPMoR to be one of the most admirable examples of fanfiction I've found. It's decidedly /not/ about the same themes as the original. It unashamedly does its own thing.

â€‹

Nearly any other fanfiction, you can find a dozen more just like it and hundreds more that are similar as far as tone and feel. HPMoR is quite unique unto itself. I find it quite refreshing, even if the author does come off a bit preachy at times. True, it has flaws, but what doesn't?

***** Harry in HPMOR is a total SI Mary Sue created as a Yudkowsky's ego-trip. The world of HPMOR could never have been less dumb, because it's sole purpose is to make Harry (and the author) look clever and rational in comparison. At least all those Ebonies Dark'ness Dementias Raven Ways and Hadrians Peverells of the fandom aren't so preachy and smug.

******* Well... yes, but they are a different kind of smug. Your usual Indy!Harry is smug in universe, because he is so much cooler, richer, smarter and has a bigger di... magical core than other characters. These fics are usually badly written wish-fulfillment fantasies without any kind of message or ideas they want to communicate. HPMOR Harry, on the other hand, is projecting "I'm so above you, peons" to the readers as well, because he is a stand-in for the author and the author is clearly very smug about his superior intellect.

*** To me, Voldemort is defined by who fanfiction made him to be. My idea of Voldemort is so disconnected from canon that calling them the same character is quite a stretch. Nowadays, fanfiction is just a fanfic of a fanfic that is a compilation of other fanfics and fanfics.

I think a lot of the fanfiction community has mostly forgotten about what the characters are like in canon which causes that feeling of them not being the same.

**** I re-read the original books on a regular basis, so I notice and can't unsee it when characters don't act or sound like they should. Some characters I give a pass, since they are basically OC's in the books (Daphne, Ernie, Sally-Anne) or have such minor presence that my brain can't tell when they're off-model (Percy, Dean, Tonks). For this reason, my favorite fanfics are the ones where the characters stay the truest to the books, or diverge from them in an organic way, eg, Harry adopted by Sirius turns into a nice kid who is the most loyal friend ever, and not a pretentious Lord Potter-Black.

Voldemort is one of the most distinctive characters of the series, and I can immediately spot it if he sounds off and acts OOC. Even in an AU setting, there are basic personality traits that a proper Voldemort should have, and if he doesn't, then my brain just cannot register him as Voldy. And that's why I can't get into HPMOR---the writing and characterization has so many obvious and subconscious tells that show the author was unfamiliar with the Potterverse.

Dumbledore and Snape are also good litmus tests on seeing how well an author knows their canon.

****** Voldemort had a prototypical vilain-tempting-the-hero monologue in book 1, so he was a standard Disney villain even then. The only examples of him /not/ being a Disney villain were when he was still Tom Riddle in the memories that Harry witnessed.

******** Probably the only reason he wasn't cackling is that he didn't have lungs enough to waste air while stuck on the back of Quirrell's head. For that matter, most of his appearances in books 4-7 didn't involve cackling or mania either.

But the defining characteristic of a Disney villain isn't an evil laugh, it's the tendency to indulge in dramatics and provide exposition about their evils plots instead of immediately taking action to secure victory.

***** I swear I am not exaggerating. I didn't have much as a kid. But I had a library with the Harry Potter books. I would check out 1 and 2, return 1 and get 3, return 2 and get 4, return 3 and get 5, return 4 and get 6, return 6 and get 1. Repeat. That was my time. I read these books more than any other series. The other series were Twilight, Eragon, and maybe a few others I can't recall at 2:30am. I haven't read these books in a very long time now though. My grasp of the factual knowledge of the series is ridiculous such as there being 759 pages in Deathly Hallows book in the library, the hissy hissy little snakey song, or any number of minor details I can't recall while drunk, but I feel that my knowledge of the specific personality of the characters has dropped.

Snape definitely is a good test, but I feel a better one is Ron. He is so different from canon that the two are very different. Gred and Forge are decent ones too.
