I'm looking for some nice fics with a powerful (read magically strong) Harry.

Except for yaoi and abandoned fics, anything goes.

Bonus points for fics longer than 200k words.

Thanks a bunch in advance!

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

Meh. Everyone has different tastes. I love Blindness and I find Strength of Steel Wings boring and frustrating.

** linkffn(Second Chances; Congregation of the Asp; The Horcrux Three) is powerful! Harry Daphne Hermione Neville team. It is not immediate but by the end of the second book they take on Voldemort and win so yeah. Power is scaled up, pretty different magic system I think. Also in the first book its portraying Daphne as a Hermione wannabe, however that changes pretty quickly, I'm pretty sure that was a mistake by the author and he didn't edit it or something.

*** Ah, I'll probably give it a read. I'm not really interested in anything but a one vs. one scenario. I mean, I get it, Voldemort is supposed to be powerful, but if Harry needs others to actually be able to take him one, then Harry isn't really powerful imo.

**** they take him out pretty easily though and harry is powerful, actually yeah im pretty sure harry is the one fighting voldemort alone but his friends are healing him and supporting him. Kind of like in an RPG where the tank is fighting and then the support classes are buffing him and healing him.

***** Yeah, but then he's not really fighting Voldemort alone is he? I've no interest in a protagonist that needs help fighting his battles. The only fic that does this somewhat decently is The Refiners Fire. Which isn't good, because the rest of this fic is pretty much cringe central.
