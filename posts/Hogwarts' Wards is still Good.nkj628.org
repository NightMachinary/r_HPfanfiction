** Wards are fanon, but the fanon does usually state that they're just blocks on things coming in or out (ie. you can apparate in, but not out), not blocks on what you can do inside them. I don't think I've ever heard anyone say Wards can stop people killing each other inside them.

But really, the simplest explanation for the lack of security - it's a school. People probably come in and out all the time, so setting blocks on them would likely make things more complicated than would be convenient.

Plus, culture. In the UK, it would be considered odd for a school to have more security than a receptionist and a big fence around the perimeter. Most of us wouldn't ever consider schools to need to be fortresses of security - we haven't had a school shooting in 25 years. There are literally panicked news stories about the schools that have metal detectors in the "Oh my god, what's wrong with this school that they'd need them?" sort of sense. Since Harry Potter is basically supposed to be "Real World Britain, but with Magic!", it tracks that Rowling'd keep that same culture going in her series as well.

*** Huh, I couldn't sworn it was canon. Maybe its because I read too many fanfiction.

**** No worries. But no, the word 'ward' is only mentioned in canon as a medical area allocated to a specific type of patient, not as part of any protective magics. Those are only ever called 'Protective Magics' and as far as I know they've never been described as being able to prevent people from killing each other inside them either - the closest I know would be the fanon 'duelling wards' that make spells non-lethal.

**** I almost sure the word 'wards' never used in canon aside from referring sections of St. Mungo.

** PS : 6th year, it could be also because they are at the Astronomy tower. Where Dumbledore could apparate so it could mean the wards didn't reach that far

*** Dumbledore didn't apparate there. He and Harry flew there on brooms borrowed from Rosmerta in Hogsmeade.

** Well, as mentioned by Avalon1632, "Wards" is a Fanon word (with this particular meaning at least), and even though the things it describes does exist in Canon (Magical Protection), there is nothing there even hinting at the possibility of identifying "Bad Guys". But even if a Ward like you described did exist in Canon, I doubt it would be put over Hogwarts.

First of all, it's because it's not really possible to identify a "bad guy". Sure there may be some obvious cases (Voldemort, Bellatrix, . . .), but most of the character in the series are nuanced.\\
As an example, I would totally identify Snape as a "bad guy". He is a spiteful man who take pleasure hating mocking his students, and seems to like the Dark Arts a bit too much, not to mention his past as a Death Eater. And yet, he still took enormous risks to not only protect Harry, but also the other students, and played his role perfectly has a double (triple? Quadruple?) agent until the very end.\\
On the other side, I would probably say that Dumbledore is a "good guy", who was an educator at heart and did his best to protect and raise his students. And yet, he is also someone who worked for "the Greater Good" (no matter how he probably hated this sentence), and was sometimes forced to take terrible decisions. Even if we ignore the whole "I placed you with the Dursleys to protect you", I could totally imagine Dumbledore, in an AU where Voldemort takes someone elso blood, deciding that there is nothing that can be done to save Harry, and that at the very least, he should give him a clean, mercifull death before he is corrupted by his connection.

Another problem is that Hogwarts is a school, which means it has to be open. Bad guys are parents too and it would be very impolite to ban them entry during an emergency just because they are assholes. Not to mention that their children could also be assholes, but it's not like you could refuse them an education without any reason, especially because bringing them into the school is a chance to put them back into the right path.\\
Another problem with Hogwarts is that there are a lot of people. In GoF, Crouch Jr/ Moody complain to Harry that he had to turn off his magical lying detectors, because there are too much people lying (about homeworks, relations, or pretty much anything). The same problem would exist with a ward able to "screen" the thought of people. I wouldn't say that Ron or Harry are bad people, but both of them probably had pretty violent though every time they had to interract with Draco.

Finally, there is the problem that mentalities change with Time. We don't know much about the Founders, outside of the fact that Slytherin didn't trust Muggleborn (something that I believe was way more justified in his time than with the Bigots seen in Canon). We don't know what they would consider good or Evil. Hell, Gryffindor was said to really like Duels (both magical and mundane), so for all we know, none of the Founders may have considere Murder as Evil (after all, the other guy /really/ deserved it).\\
But even if we don't go as far in the past, someone like Phineas Nigellus Black must have had a very different definition of Good and Evil compared to Dumbledore. So unless the "wards" are updated at each generations (which could bring a whole lot of problems by itself), the system is not maintainable.

â€‹

So yeah, I don't think it would have been possible to put this kind of wards at Hogwarts, even if the possibility existed in canon.
