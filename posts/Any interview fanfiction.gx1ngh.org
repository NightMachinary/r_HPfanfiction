Hi, I was wondering if there were any fics written in the form of interview with Harry or others for the Daily Prophet, the Quibbler etc. Thanks in advance!

  One-Shot An unusual, darkish, Azkaban Harry story. Told entirely first person by Harry, as he answers questions to tell of how he came to be there, and who really killed Voldemort and Dumbledore. Not for everyone: Read notes at start.Rated M language.
