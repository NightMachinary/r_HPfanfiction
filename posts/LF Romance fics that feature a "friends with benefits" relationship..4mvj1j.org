All pairings are welcome with the exception of slashes and pairs that have a wide age gap. Preferably completed and resolve stories. I also prefer the plot to compliment the relationship but i really don't mind it the other way around. Setting could be at any time granted it isn't a time travel fic. Oh and /please/ try not to give me fics featuring 14 year olds going at it. If you can try to put the minimum age to at least 5th years unless the fic is worth it, I'd deeply appreciate it.
