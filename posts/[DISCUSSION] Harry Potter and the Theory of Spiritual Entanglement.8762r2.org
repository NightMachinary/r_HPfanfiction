So you know how the whole idea of Horcruxxery was to have them as anchors? And how /nobody/ had done more than one before?

What if having multiple Horcruxes had them all interconnected? So essentially until you have all of them broken at once, you'll have a bunch of small anchor fragments floating around and attaching themselves to dark magic items?

Harry's scar kind of fuses with his soul, making him having to die as well before Riddle can - but Riddle has to die before Harry does. So it's basically millenia of cyclical reincarnation and resurrection until Harry gets all of the anchors, Riddle, and himself destroyed at once.


** Well the “ritual” (I think that's what it should be labeled) was supposedly hard to find?? And I GUESS splitting your soul is supposed to be a really bad thing(but SAM WINCHESTER had NO soul and he was fun as hell, I don't see a problem here) but idk dude. Interesting questions you pose

** It's pretty clear from canon that that's not how it works, but it's an arresting thought.
