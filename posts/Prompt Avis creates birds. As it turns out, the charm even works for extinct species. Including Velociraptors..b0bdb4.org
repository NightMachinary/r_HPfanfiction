After watching Jurassic Park, a muggleborn hogwarts student accidentally unleashes prehistoric terror.


** Depends on if you mean actual velociraptors of the Jurassic Park ones.

Actual ones wouldn't be that scary.

Also this is a world that has dragons, basilisks and blast ended skrewts. I doubt the actual horror. Hagrid would probably have a pack in the Forest ready for demonstrations in student lectures within a week.

**** I mean, if a 15 year old casts it at another 15 year old, then it can just be cancelled out using finite? Or just cast one of your own and watch the Dino warfare.

I'm sure Madam Pomfrey can fix some ripped bellies and shove the intestines back before dinner .

** If we're assuming scientifically accurate /velociraptor mongoliensis/, you'd be looking at a bird-ish looking critter roughly 7 feet long and about 1.5 to 2 feet tall. By Hagrid's usual standards, positively adorable, but disappointingly small. /Deinonychus antirrhopus/ would be about twice that size. Better, but still not big enough.

To get the kind of height you see from the wildly inaccurate animals in Chrichton's novels and Spielberg's films. you have to hit up /utahraptor ostrommaysorum/, who would be in the ballpark of 5-7 feet tall IIRC, and approximately 20 feet long.

I'd definitely be interested though :P

*** Even /mongoliensis/ is a fast-moving, well-armed, pack-hunting carnivore, smaller than most ratites - one species of which is the only bird species verified to have kicked a human to death - but more /motivated/ in their violence.

And anyone who deals with poultry on the regular can tell you just how full of rage and hate birds can get at the slightest provocation or none at all.

**** Oh, I know. I was just trying to look at it from /Hagrid's/ point of view rather than that of, y'know, a normal person. Dunno why, though.

Fast, aggressive, well-armed and mean-tempered, yes...I imagine Hagrid would learn that the hard way after being disappointed by their underwhelming size.

...Which, now that I think about it, is rather a funny scenario to contemplate.

***** *Cassowary*

Cassowaries (), genus Casuarius, are ratites (flightless birds without a keel on their sternum bone) that are native to the tropical forests of New Guinea (Papua New Guinea and Indonesia), East Nusa Tenggara, the Maluku Islands, and northeastern Australia.There are three extant species. The most common of these, the southern cassowary, is the third-tallest and second-heaviest living bird, smaller only than the ostrich and emu.

Cassowaries feed mainly on fruit, although all species are truly omnivorous and will take a range of other plant food, including shoots and grass seeds, in addition to fungi, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. Cassowaries are very shy, but if provoked they are capable of inflicting injuries, occasionally fatal, to dogs and people.

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.
