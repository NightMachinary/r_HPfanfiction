Snape urgently needs money to settle a debt from the first war that Dumbledore really shouldn't know about. While shopping in Knockturn he comes across a former student selling illegal potions. When he finds out how much money those badly-brewed potions make, Snape decides to show him what a real potioneer can do and they team up.

At the next Order meeting Mad-Eye Moody mentions "I got a new case, someone's making these blue colored euphoria potions, really nasty addictive stuff..."

** He operates under the pseudonym of "Half Blood Prince" since no one really knows who he is. He gains a reputation in the underworld and start rolling so much money that his gang of thugs become a threat even to Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Snape also has it easier because he doesn't have a nagging wife and a crippled kid so he just goes along with it.

Eventually the story follows quite similarly the plot of Breaking Bad. Snape eliminates most of his enemies one by one, leaves his fortune to Harry, goes to save his Jesse from the Death Eaters. It ends with a bunch of Death Eaters, including Voldemort killed, Snape mortally wounded and Jesse riding his broom towards freedom.

** Breaking Dark. I was thinking that linkao3(The Venom Peddler) was going to be like that, but it went in a different direction.
