Hi everyone! I've been reading Harry Potter fanfiction for about six years now, and for six years I have been dutifully filtering out Draco Malfoy wherever possible. This very well may mean I have missed out on many great works, but I've been okay with that. Why? Because across the vast divisions of space and time, canon and fanon, Jo Rowling and knowing when to please stop - to me, Draco has invariably been an annoying piece of shit who deserves worse than he gets.

I haven't even been vaguely interested in redemption, reimagination, or character development in general on his end, and the works I've read that feature him more than peripherally have only further reinforced my defecatory impressions.

But! Six years of reading means I've mostly worked my way through the good stuff and so I am reluctantly condescending to give him a shot. I'd prefer not to sift through the stool, though, so for my excretory experts, my fecal fans: find me a find; catch me a catch. Show me the light at the end of the tunnel isn't just the probe coming in hot.

...poop jokes aside, I'm sincerely interested. Hit me with your favorite fic! One only, boys and girls - give me a list of ten to choose from and I will make it a point to read none simply to spite you for not reading through the whole post.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** linkao3(survival is a talent)

Before I get the usual replies regarding any soulmate au fics, I should clarify. Soulmates in this fic are not instantly in a perfect relationship. It just shows compatibility, but it doesn't guarantee that they will even become friends.

Draco, in this fic, starts off exactly like his canon counterpart. Bigoted, arrogant, overall a pretty garbage person. But thankfully he gets a positive influence in his life - Harry - in his second year, before he can make any irredeemable choices.

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** Well, although I do quite like his character arc in the Innocent series, he's very different from canon (for good in-story reasons), and his older brother more or less takes his place as the designated Slytherin jerk. So it might not be the best example, even though it's a great series.

Perhaps a better option for your request would be linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions), which is good for a laugh regardless.

** I recall enjoying Draco's characterization in Escape.

linkffn(11916243)

It is at the end. The fic features a more 'light' Snape (he is being a got to non Slytherins because he know the dark lord is coming back, and thus needs to keep up his cover.

Anyway Draco basically... Fails to cut it at being a murdering psychotic terrorist. He isn't a better person, but it turns out genocide wasn't his thing.

Snape sees this and, when he starts to back out in a way that would get him killed, brings him to the good guy side and asks them to hide him. They do it for Snape, not for Draco.

Basically, they went with "he is a bad person, but not an evil murderer". That always felt close to canon and isn't done all that often.

I also recall a fic Harry/Draco have a hidden friendship/riverly. Draco wants to make Harry his minion, but Harry wants to give him an out. It was a slow redemption, thus didn't feel like whitewashing the character. That one involved Greg turning to the light (although not being bright enough to realize it) and having a relationship with Luna.

Draco there is very much similar to canon, just with some slight changes to make him a bit more likeable.

** My favorite fic is The Man Who Lived, which is about Draco 12 years after DH. It made me fall in love with the idea of Draco as a character and the potential directions - redemption, depression, relapse, wisdom - a good writer can take him.

  Astoria was never a fan of Hermione Granger, but pretty soon, she would be gone, and Draco was going to need all the help he could get. Rated M for future chapters.

A fun little one shot is this: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16416197]]

PS. I found the problem series in a post on reddit for another person, so there are others people who can benefit of your "joking" post. Writing this you actually made a post where people who read fics on Malfoy can easily find others fics to read. So... joke's on you. You are letting them spread. No reason to stop.
