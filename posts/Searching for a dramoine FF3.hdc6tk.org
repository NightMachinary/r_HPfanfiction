Either the war was lost or the death eaters are back, I forget. To protect hermoine, Harry brings her to Draco. She lives in malfoy manor. Pansy and Draco are good, although toeing the line while living as death eater children. I remember a scen where Draco finds Hermoine in the manor by tracking her wand. He comforts her while a murder happens in front of them. Pansy ends up with Ron.
