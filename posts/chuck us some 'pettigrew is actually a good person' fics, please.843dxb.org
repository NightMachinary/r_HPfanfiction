** From what I remember linkffn(The Well Groomed Mind by Lady Khali) kind of counts? Don't want to spoil too much, but his interactions with Lily and little Harry made him a little into doing-bad-things-but-still-good-at-heart kind of person? Again with question mark because it has been a while since I read it. Actually, I'm going to reread it right now.

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.

** After_the_Rain (a_t_rain on LJ) had one of my absolute favorite Peter-centric stories; her work actually shaped a lot of how I view the Marauders, especially Sirius and Peter.

*Running Close to the Ground*: /They call themselves the Death Eaters' Drinking and Cynicism Society. They are bored, world-weary, damaged men, too resentful to obey without question and too afraid to rebel. One of them spends his nights dreaming of the past as he waits for the order to kill the last of his childhood friends. His name is Peter Pettigrew. And he still has a touch of the old Marauder in him./

** linkffn(12682621) has something that just barely fits the criteria - Pettigrew still sold out Harry's parents, but he helps Ron prank his brothers (he's pretending to be a rat who can turn into a human instead of the other way around) and generally is not an asshole for the duration of his stay at the Weasleys'.

HPMOR also has something similar to your prompt, but it's so stupidly executed that I'm not going to bother linking to it.

** Just read 'the deathly hallows'.

Pettigrew has a redemption story where he is killed by Voldemort after letting Harry and company escape from the Malfoys.

The plot is quite similar to 'the deathly hallows' part one and two (the original movies), but the author has sprinkled in some AU scenes in the story.
