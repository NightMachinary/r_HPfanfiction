In which harry is calm and collected. He has the respect of his year mates. Students and teaching staff listens to him and respect him. He is powerful and smart. No bashing. Enimies are turned allies or potential friend. And before you recommend i have already read 'Renegade' fanfic.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)
