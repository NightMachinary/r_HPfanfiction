Like say if The Dursleys Buy Paint or some other resource to upgraded there house harry can use magic to use the Resources to say paint the house with his magic doing something that is like a Cross between transfiguration and a Switching spell to repaint the house ?

With him using his magic to do something like [[http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Civilization_Advancement][Civilization Advancement]] and the more he uses it the more area he effects like he starts out being about to effect a a wall in the Dursleys house, then a room , then The whole house , then the whole street, ect with the area that he can effect and the changes he can make getting bigger the better he gets at his Civilization Advancement magic.

A bit like How harry uses his magic to Upgrade and change his Island later in the story Core Threads By: theaceoffire linkffn(10136172)

  A young boy in a dark cupboard is in great pain. An unusual power will allow him to heal himself, help others, and grow strong in a world of magic. Eventual God-like Harry, Unsure of eventual pairings. Alternate Universe, possible universe/dimension traveling in the future.
