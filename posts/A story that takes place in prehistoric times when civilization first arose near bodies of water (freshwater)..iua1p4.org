A story that takes place in prehistoric times. A wizard takes a group of Muggle farmers out into an area far away from bodies of water such as lakes or rivers. He provides them with water with Aguamenti for their fields and for them and fire with Incendio. He refrigerates their food with Glacius, the freezing spell. He increases their food supply with Engorgio, etc. So they love him and become dependent on him and he takes advantage of that.


** Well, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enki][Enki]] was the ancient Sumerian god of water, knowledge, mischief, crafts, and creation, basically you could say he was an "Anunnaki" (Wizardkind), that used his innate powers and longevity to create the one of the first cities in the world.
