Hey guys.\\
There's a common thing that i noted while reading fanfics, that created some questions.

In canon during DH, Harry used the Imperius and the Cruciatus curse.\\
But in fanfictions, even with the Dark Harry trope or Grey Harry we rarely see him using them, he most of the times uses non canon curses or more simple ones like confringo, while in need of information he usually uses ligillimency or veritaserum, but why ? Because canon Harry is very "Light" even if he can be ruthless when angered.\\
I know that he dont uses the killing curse because of his morals and because was the spell Voldemort used to kill his parents, but Avada Kedavra is fast and with no pai, technically is more honorable than use the cruciatus against someone.

Imperius takes over all of the target's will making him into a puppet, even so Harry used it, being maybe even worse than the killing curse.

We know that magic is intent based, so this means that in his core Harry has a sadistic trait to be capable of hurting someone with the torture curse.\\
And maybe he has in his nature a good portion of will to dominate and enslave others because of his power to cast the imperius curse.

Why do you guys think that even in darkharry fanfics the writers dont make him use more the unforgivables ?\\
They're pretty powerful and unblockable, so focusing on those more edgy and Indy Harry would't make sense he using them more ?


** Well remember that they are unforgivable and since he not an Auror or hold any type of official position without prior approval using them could be grounds for Azkaban. So that's probably why most authors don't have Harry use them much. As far as the torture curse goes you truly need to mean it and as seen in OOTP at the ministry he really wasn't able to do that.

Now here's a fic where harry uses them quite a bit.

*** But he as able to use a very powerful Cruciatus during DH\\
And if is justo because of the laws, then why in these DarkHarry fics he make even worse things and just roams free, this does't make much sense.

**** People like overlooking Harry's throwing around unforgivables in the final book because he killed Voldemort in the fresh ray of dawn on May 2nd due to esotoric lore.
