It should be close to the actual name (sounds/looks similair). I'm thinking of Veronica or Donna for Ron, but what I should I use for hermione and harry??


** I despise stories with the name Harriet

Heather is all i can really think of but it dosnt really sound like Harry

** The Evans granparents used flowers names for Lily and Petunia so you could use Rose or Holly and call it an Evans tradition

*** Going with that tradition idea, Ivy and Hazel might be good names? Ivy for her green eyes, Hazel also for the green of its leaves, and just because it sounds nice, not too 'flowery,' as it were.

**** Ivy and Holly also qualify as 'common' names for Petunia to sniff at in Chapter One of PS.

** Hattie, Holly, or Mary for Harry

I like Veronica for Ron

A google search came up with Hector, Leo, and Hermes as options for Hermione.

*** I agree with Veronica, it matches nicely with Ginevra. Maybe the same way Ginny never uses her full name, Veronica is used to being called Ron- and her full name is only ever used when her mother is yelling it after she does something stupid.

** Draco becomes Dracaena for me (pronounced Dra-SEEN-a), which is the name of a genus of plant and comes from the Greek Œ¥œÅŒ¨Œ∫Œ±ŒπŒΩŒ± -- drakaina, "female dragon".

For Hermione, I agree with everyone who said Hermes, that sounds good and fulfills my love of etymological links.

*** Rhonwen is so lovely. I was trying to remember it when I saw this thread a while ago but couldn't, thanks for reminding me! I know the Wealseys are very english in their naming but I love making them a bit more Welsh when making up genderbent or middle names for fanon.

** That's the least of all your problems. People who will reject you just because of stupid name are morons. There is still Brogan Snape in linkffn(Snape's Daughter by Tribi) with hundreds of reviews and there is no possibility you can choose anything worse. Care more about plot, character development and similar stuff, not about freaking names.

  Bill was scanning her too, no doubt checking for curses, "it's as if," he suddenly mused aloud and startled Snape, "as if all of the James was drained from her..." -Harry becomes a girl and Christmas comes early for Draco. fem/Harry AU Book 6

** Harriet, Herman, and Ronalda üòÇ

In all seriousness, if you do write it, please actually have the gender swap change something in the story. So many fem!Harry authors just shit out a rehashed canon or tired old tropes and expect them to fly since Harry has a vag now and that's sooo different. Ugh. It's the primary reason i avoid fics of this type.
