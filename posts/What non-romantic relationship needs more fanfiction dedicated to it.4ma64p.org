It might be a weird pick, but honestly, I'm gonna go with Draco and his friendship with Crabbe and Goyle. In all my years of fic reading, I've come across only a couple of fics where Draco is friends with these two instead of a Slytherin blank slate. I get why, seeing as neither Crabbe or Goyle are fleshed out characters, but I feel like there is plenty to be done with what's there.


** As ridiculous as it sounds, Harry and Ron. Not enough love for that bromance unfortunately.

*** Nothing ridiculous about it. The sad fact of the matter is that Ron gets shit on a hell of a lot in fanfiction, because of one instance of completely understandable jealousy and one instance of a freak combination of fully justified anger at the lack of a plan, an insufficient diet, being on the run, recovering from an injury, worry over family, having Voldemort's soul around his damn neck, piss poor luck in apparating directly into a group of Snatchers and finally, Harry and Hermione deciding to relocate before said Snatchers were dealt with.

*** On the flip side, there aren't many fics that focus on Harry and Hermione's friendship, either. Generally speaking, she's either paired up with him or pushed to the periphery (usually with Ron, as tends to be the rule in these fics) in favour of whoever's paired with Harry. Few writers ever really expand on their canon friendship.

**** Arithmancer is a good example of friendship between the two done well I think. She's genuinely helping him, and they've gone through ups and downs up until now in year 5. One of the better Hermione-centric fics anyway obviously, but I think it's also because she generally has believable friendships/relationships with the other characters

**** I think that the first chapter could stand alone but this entire fic is wonderful. It says that it's HHr but it doesn't really go much further than alluding to it, I feel that the depth of their friendship is really explored in the fic. There are some really great moments with Ron too. linkffn(2073486)

  After a humiliating incident, Hermione ponders the nature of trust. Trust is a curious thing. It's like a window, fragile and easily shattered, but as long as the frame still stands it can be fixed and made stronger than ever. HHr

** Definitely more Fred, George and Ginny, as well as Fred, George and Ron. From what we saw in the series, Fred was definitely the rougher of the twins (slamming Ginny's puffskein with a bat, giving Ron a lifelong phobia) but nonetheless I'd have liked to see their sibling relationship more.

I'd loved to have seen more of the awkward friendship between Luna and Ginny, as well as seeing Arthur and Molly's general reaction to Luna, compared to other family friends.

Neville and his gran!

The teachers! God, like, Sprout, McGonagl and Flitwick playing cards in the staffroom, complaining about Lockhart, Trelawney, Umbridge or whomever while Snape reads his book in the corner and occasionally joins the conversation.

Books could undoubtedly be written about the strange alliances between Hogwarts staff, and I want to read them.

** Dobby and Winky! Am I the only one who would love to read a bunch of cute little friendship stories about those two having little adventures, maybe some mishaps caused by drunk Winky not controlling her magic well, or Dobby trying to wean her off of butterbeer, or her running around after him when he slacks off on his duties to help Harry with stuff? Wouldn't that just be the cutest little platonic friendship ever? Seems like whenever I try to find fanfiction about them though, all that comes up is either them as side characters with super minor parts in human-centric stories, or freaky deaky butt stuff.

  There's only so far you can push anyone before they'll push back, and Harry's been pushed too far. Between that and Dobby's form of mad proving contagious, things are about to get violent. ABANDONED.
