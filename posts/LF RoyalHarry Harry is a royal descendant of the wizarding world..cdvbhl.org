No AU! Just regular wizarding world but apparently Harry is royalty. Slash or straight but slash is more preferable.


** I'm not sure how this would functionally be any different than Canon or the myriad of "Lord Potter" fics? (Canon already has the whole celeb thing going on and Lord Potter tends to do the whole 'blood inheritance power/status' thing).

What is it that you are going for? Just a royal title? I'm pretty sure I saw a few Lord Harry fics that have him as a descendant of Merlin and thus functionally wizarding royalty....

(I've seen quite of 'Harry interacts with the muggle royal family', which I don't think you are requesting here.)

Now that I think about it, didn't StarFox5's thief AU have Harry as a bonnified prince?

  Tied to a tombstone, being tortured by Voldemort. Harry wanted it to end. His mind, his soul cried for someone, anyone to help him. He hadn't expected for someone to actually answer. Now he will learn the truth about the Potter bloodline and prepare himself for the war that is at their doorstep. However, unlike what he had thought, he won't be facing what is coming on his own.

*** I dont really know anything about England's royal family so I want it to be just the wizards. No muggles at all.

Politics is good too. So if Harry is the prince the noble houses will be confused if theyll still go for Voldemort or no.

  Major Non-Canon A/U, Harry is treated for abuse and massive injuries by John Watson as a John Doe. To help solve the mystery of the battered boy John calls in his partner Sherlock - whose father has much more information about his patient than John ever thought possible. Turning to an old acquaintance, Siger Holmes contacts the Lord of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Wallace...Harry's rightful guardian.First several chapters will be covering Pre-Hogwarts years, story starts with Harry at age four so it'll be a while before any sort of slash or real conflict happens. Very political fic with lots of twists and turns. Because the plot-bunnies won't leave me alone!
