In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind by Newcomb]], we're treated to a duel between Dumbledore and two wizards. While the two fight the way we would expect, flinging spells and dodging them in return, Dumbledore wipes the floor with them by using magic in an entirely different way. Harry tries to learn this as well and succeeds a bit.

What I'm looking for is fics that draw a distinction between the "old-fashioned" use of magic by casting spells, and a more intuitive or different kind of wielding magic.

In Nonjon's A Black Comedy, Harry does something similar with his magical arms.

linkffn(What you Leave Behind, A black comedy)


** Well, you've pretty much got it with What You Leave Behind. Another option is Taure's linkffn(The One He Feared). Maybe linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) fits in as well.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.
