I don't have the talent to write anything like this on my own, but I think it would be cool to read fanfiction about magic on other continents. Idk if there have been other posts about this as this is my first time looking through this subreddit and i didn't see one on a quick glance (and I'm kinda a reddit newb anyway)


** Try the [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/Alexandra_Quick_Series][Alexandra Quick Series]]. I've read only the beginning on this one, but it should match your request criteria perfectly.

*** Rest of the series is pretty great too, eventually you get to see more of the way wizarding America is structures, as well as different smaller cultures within it (Native Americans for one and in the new book we'll get to see more Ozarker culture).

** No link cause mobile.

Dumbledores army and the year of darkness is book seven as seen by Neville, in Hogwarts. Also amazing.

The Snape chronicles are the saga of Severus Snapes life, birth to death in book seven. Stunningly well written, adds a lot to many characters.
