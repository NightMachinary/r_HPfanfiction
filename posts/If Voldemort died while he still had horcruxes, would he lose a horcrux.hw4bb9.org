Can he be resurrected from a horcrux without losing a horcrux? Or could you just keep killing him until he runs out of them?


** Based on canon he doesn't lose a horcrux when he dies.

IIRC He created the diary, then the Gaunt ring, the diadem (all while he was at school), then the locket and cup.

He accidentally created Harry when his body was destroyed. But since he already had a horcrux when his soul left his body it became a wraith rather than pass on. But none of his previously created horcruxes were used up/destroyed.

In the graveyard when he was resurrected he did not do so using a horcrux.

So basically once you have a single horcrux you will not pass on. And IMO unless the ritual to provide your soul/wraith with a body requires a horcrux one won't be destroyed. If that created body is destroyed it will act like your original body did (eg your soul will just not pass.

So IMO he would only lose a horcrux if someone intentionally destroys it or it is needed for a ritual to return his soul/wraith to a body.

** I think that the idea that a horcrux is spent on each resurrection is just pure fanon. I don't think there is any evidence for this in the canon.

On the other hand, I have my deep suspicion, that the idea that Voldemort has to be resurrected to be killed, is a pure fanon as well (with the obvious intent to force GoF happening). There is not much about the substance of horcruxes (horcruxi), but we have this:

#+begin_quote
  “Well, you split your soul, you see,” said Slughorn, “and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one's body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form ...”
#+end_quote

If one's is kept earthbound only by the presence of Horcruxes, then obviously destruction of all of them, would allow it to leave to wherever-essence-of-humans-go.

**** I understand that (and I really think the one to be blamed for Dumbledore's inaction is Ms Rowling, not manipulative!himself ;)), but whenever I read “we have to let him get resurrected in order to kill him” I grind my teeth.

Although, the argument can be made, that until CoS Dumbledore truly and honestly didn't know that Riddle made even one Horcrux (that is actually how the book put it).

Interesting titbit is that they probably /had to/ let CoS happen (at least Ginny be given the diary), because otherwise they really wouldn't get hold on one of the horcruxes.

Sure, from a meta standpoint JKR is to blame for all character inconsistencies and the implications for how they act. Is Dumbledore really manipulative or does JKR just write his character poorly and not understand the consequences of his actions? Does Harry suffer brain damage at the end of DH or does JKR not realize that Dumbledore and Snape were actually awful to Harry? Etc.

However, when trying to understand character motivations and actions you have to go by what's in the text itself, not what the author says. Death of the author and all that. If you want to actually criticize the author for how poorly they wrote the characters, then you can, but that's seperate.

#+end_quote

I think neither. JKR first and almost only concern is the plot. Whatever is necessary for the plot and action in terms of characters, magic, or whatever else is provided (e.g., no other means of magical transport other than brooms were properly introduced until Floo in CoS, so Dumbledore flew to London on his broomstick ... she just didn't think it was necessary to introduce faster mode of transport; hence all those complains about non-sensical actions of Dumbles in PS). When she needs it for the action, she almost frees Sirius, and then when it is not necessary (or because it was necessary in OotP) she just forgets about him and she lets him rot in the Grimmauld Place. That Dumbledore (highest judicial authority in the magical Britain) ignores all human rights of any Englishman ... Magna Charta (“jury of his peers”), Habeas Corpus (both were made law before the Statue of Secrecy, so they were supposedly grandfathered into the magical law order) is just completely forgotten, because it doesn't serve her plot. Phases of the moon are moving, three adults (one a married wife at that moment, IIRC) leave one year old baby outside in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b795vp/monthly_weather_report_for_uk_on_october_1981/][the English November]] et cetera et cetera. You have to suspend your disbelief and to enjoy the plot.

I don't think it is because she would be a bad writer, she just honestly doesn't care that much for the world-building unless it serves her plot.

******* That was an example, the point bring that they're two seperate conversations. You can argue whether or not Dumbledore is manipulative and whether or not JKR is a bad writer, but you can't say "well yeah he /seems/ manipulative in canon but that's just because JKR is a bad writer. He's not actually manipulative." You see what I mean?

Well, maybe you don't, since you went the opposite direction and said he's not manipulative /and/ that she's not a bad writer while providing many great examples of her poor writing ability.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

In other words, she's making it up as she goes along and makes use of contrivances, deus ex machinas, and anything else that will move the plot along regardless of set up or how inconsistent it is within the world or with the characters. This is called bad writing.

#+begin_quote
  You have to suspend your disbelief and to enjoy the plot.
#+end_quote

Nah, mate, you don't get to tell me what I have to do to enjoy the plot. Suspension of disbelief is completely subjective. Everyone has a different limit for what they can suspend their disbelief for. For some people, they won't be able to get past the fact that there's magic. For others, it's the fact that wizards have been able to hide from Muggles in the modern age. For some, it's easy to ignore everything and just enjoy the ride.

However, there's a huge difference between suspending your disbelief in a fantasy setting, and the story setting up rules and breaking them, setting up characterizations then throwing them away, plot holes, etc. Those can actually be proven, and regardless of how you feel about it or how much you enjoyed the plot while you were ignoring them, they are flaws and show signs of bad writing.

#+begin_quote
  she just honestly doesn't care that much for the world-building unless it serves her plot.
#+end_quote

If the plot relies on the world-building, then that. Is. Bad. Writing.

Also, for the record, I love Harry Potter. I wouldn't be here if I didn't. That doesn't mean I can't criticize JKR for where she went wrong, and just because I criticize her doesn't mean I won't give her credit where it's due for the good writing she's also done.

In any case, I'm not going to go through and criticize the whole series right now or anything. I will leave you with a fic that does a great (and humorous) job at poking through a lot of the holes that pop up throughout the series. Linkffn(Force Interrupt)

I think this is the crux of the matter: how much it really matters? And not only that I am not willing to call JKR bad writer before I sell those many millions copies of books she did. I was again listening with my wife to the audiobooks with Stephen Fry (only! Sorry Americans but he is so much better than Jim Dale, it isn't even funny) and I found myself again and again really enjoying and smiling all the time. She may be horribly sloppy on this large-scale level (why, oh why, they even put Harry back to the Privet Drive after the death of Dumbledore, when it was just for very limited time and his recovery was obvious to be extremely dangerous? Whole Battle of Seven Potters is complete nonsense logically), but she is absolutely perfect on this lower level of individual conversations, small events, and everything.

I can understand that they have to strip all this which made her stories most alive in films (because of the time restrictions), but I have never read any fanfiction which would be this alive, low-level funny with the everyday life.

And perhaps this is what matter more than the bloody age line.

That's you prerogative. You don't have to be a successful author yourself in order to criticize others. Success and making money doesn't equate to quality, and the inverse is true as well. Honestly I'd say it's embarrassing that such problems got past the editor of a major publication company but not a bunch of amateurs on the internet.

In regards to everything else you said, like I said before, I'm willing to give her credit where it's do. She does have some great writing in the series as well, most of the time the characters are well written, as well as the relationships between them. Some scenes, like the DOM duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort, are excellently done, and for the most part the plot is well constructed and follows along logically. However, where there are plot holes, those holes are gaping. Where there are character inconsistencies, they're major inconsistencies. The world-building is almost like she's constantly introducing us to the world without bothering to expand on it, and what she does show us has pretty severe implications/consequences that she doesn't seem to realize exist, or just ignores.

Anyway, I'm rambling. Let me put it this way: if you could choose between the Harry Potter series we got, or a better HP series with no plot holes, consistent characters, better world-building, etc., which would you choose? Personally, I'd choose the better one. So why not point out these mistakes and learn from them? Why not call them out to show authors and script-writers that we do notice them and that they do matter to give them motivation to improve their craft? Why not be better?

What I was trying to say is, that it is surprising that even after all these years in some aspects we don't have much which would be at least as good as her books. And that serial writing is evil (that's my /Carthago delenda est/), because “Books aren't written - they're rewritten. Including your own. It is one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh rewrite hasn't quite done it.” (that's by Michael Crichton based on similar older statements), because with serial writing you just won't make that seventh (or even third) rewrite.

As (I believe) Dumbledore puts it, even if his body is destroyed, the main piece of the soul remains on Earth. Now in Chamber of Secrets, it appears that Horcruxes can also come alive if they feed on the life energy of a person so I'm wondering whether, if all Horcruxes were to do that, would that make the person mortal again but with (in Voldemort's case) eight bodies.

** Per canon, no. On Halloween 1981 Voldemort 'dies', all his horcuxes are intact and he becomes a disembodied wraith. Horcruxes seem to be designed to simply prevent death while resurrection is handled separately. Voldemort spends the next decade trying to get a new body. Simply having a horcrux actually kinda sucks if your minions don't know what to do after you're defeated.

The diary complicated things a bit though. The diary indicates Voldemort can be resurrected through the horcrux itself, with the caveat that the horcrux is a 'save point' and only resurrects Voldemort to the point the horcrux was created. The horcrux appears to be used up when using this method. And Dumbledore says the diary was likely created as a weapon, different from the rest. It's unclear if the rest could be used this way. Though given the effect the ring has on the trio during their camping trip, it would probably possess someone given enough time.

The diary nearly succeeds in using Ginny's lifeforce to resurrect a 17-ear old Tom Riddle. Not ideal, but certainly better than a 50-year old Voldemort in his prime. But this would have teenage Tom and wraith Voldemort running around at the same time. Do they not want to share? Do they seek to merge, Voldemort's mind in a fresh body?
