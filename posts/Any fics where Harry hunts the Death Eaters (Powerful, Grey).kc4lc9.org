So comrades, as the title says, I'm looking for a fic where Harry is powerful (but not a reincarnation of Merlin and 100x stronger than Dumbledore, that doesn't make sense) and gets tired of Dumbledore's peaceful approach.

​

I don't complain if I have Ron / Molly bashing (I'm weird, I like bashing fics)

Preferably without overly manipulative Dumbledore, perhaps just a slight bashing of Dumbledore, for example, he is against Harry's violent approach and tries to dissuade him from being violent.

​

Without H / HG

If there are any couples, it would be H / DG

​

That's it dear ones, forgive my grammar, English is not my first language!


** Betrayal linkffn(9095016) - Hermione accidentally leaves with Ron during the horcrux hunt. Years later, Harry is basically The Punisher with magic.

The Unforgiving Minute linkffn(6256154) - Time traveling to the day of the 3rd task, Harry has a few hours to defeat Voldemort.

Also, I think Wind Shear linkffn(12511998) fits your criteria - 20-year old Harry accidentally ends up in the past as the first war is starting to heat up. He about on par with Voldemort and Dumbledore.

  Winner of the DLP February 2013 Apocalyptic/Dystopian Fiction Contest! Attempting to hold the trio together, Hermione grabs Ron just before he Apparates, accidentally abandoning Harry on the Horcrux hunt. Four years later, Harry is a changed man.

  Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** If you don't mind the violence/death, linkffn(The Purge by Redbayly) is a pretty good one! There was another one along the same lines on AO3, but I can't find it.

  When a man is pushed to the end of his tether, be prepared for violent retribution. The magical world had better prepare itself for the turning of the tide. If the magical government cannot be trusted to protect its people, then Harry Potter will just have to do it himself. Trigger Warning: Graphic depictions of violence.
