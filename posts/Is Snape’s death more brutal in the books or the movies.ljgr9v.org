** The scene itself the books definitely cause he gets bitten multiple times by nagini and left to die rather than just a cutting curse like the movie did.

** Books because of the added element of desperation from Snape. Movie!Snape almost seems to not really understand what is happening.

Book!Snape is staring at Nagini, wrapped up in a protective bubble, and Dumbledore's orders are ringing in his head. 'When Voldemort is overprotective of his snake, tell Harry'. He's practically begging to Voldemort to let him go finish off Harry for him.

**** Same as movie. Voldemort thinks Snape is master of the Elder Wand and needs to kill him to claim it.

****** Because he couldn't, voldemort was arguably more powerful than Dumbledore. Any attempt to fight or flee would have been useless, and possibly would have driven voldemort to read his mind. If that happened he would have learned of the plan they had to defeat him.

** if we look at the movies in a whole, i would say snapes death hurts more there. only because snapes character was much more likable in the movies. if we are looking just at the death SCENE, then the books.

**** i just feel like the mood in the book is set a bit better. the fact that it was in the shrieking shack, the conversation set before the death, harry's reaction. i dunno, it just felt a lot more sad when i read it rather than watched the scene

******** To me that was a place of hope almost. It was built to keep a werewolf in (lupin) but became a place of his friends coming to him and working hard to become what he needed at that time, a place where harry found his Godfather and learned the truth and then where he met sirius often and felt loved. A place he had hope that he would get to leave the dursleys and then voldemort tainted that too and you learn the truth on snape and harry watches one of the last links to his mom (no matter how shitty the person) die as well to the guy who's responsible for his shit hand in life. Thats my feeling anyway
