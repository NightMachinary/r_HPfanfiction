Hey, I am searching for Harry-centric fics where Hermione plays only a minor role. Would be nice if it plays in Hogwarts and no slash please :)


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): Hermione was mentioned a total 7 times, and already got thoroughly bashed. Two thirds of the story happened at Hogwarts.

Hermione generally doesn't play major roles in other works from this author.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

*** I already read most of his works. I can recommend this for everyone else though.

Edit: didn't this fic contain bestiality ?

**** Yes, but does shagging in animagus form really count as bestiality?

Hermione was killed off in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/][For Love of Magic]], linkffn(11669575), very early on, and the story goes through Harry's Hogwarts years.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
