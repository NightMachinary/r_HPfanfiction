** Draco Malfoy isn't the main focus of my fic, but he does get a kick in the pants in the way of about 10 hours of sensory deprivation with the absolute belief that he's about to die. It's mainly a story about Harry living up to his potential with the assistance of a bunch of dragons from another world.

  HP/Warcraft crossover with no knowledge of Warcraft needed. Harry in his 5th year could have used a few friends with actual combat experience. A lot of folks on Azeroth during Cataclysm would have been better off anywhere else. If you think HP cannon needed more Dragons, this is the fic for you! Features HP/HG/? Ship and a Cursed!Dumbledore.
