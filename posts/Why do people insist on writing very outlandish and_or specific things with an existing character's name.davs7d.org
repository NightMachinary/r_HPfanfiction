Like "[Prompt] Harry is born in Austria on April 20th 1889 and is refused entry to an art school in Vienna. His friend Joseph Weasley betrays him by invading the Mars Colonies while his sister Marigold Susan opens up a dolphin sanctuary in South Sudan"

If you want to write a story about an angry Austrian with a fabulous moustache dealing with Martian politics and a perfect sister who loves dolphins, just make an original character. Or better yet write an original story. Why do you have to use the name 'Harry Potter', if the story or the characters have nothing to do with the characters from the Wizarding World?

This bothers me more than it should.

Since I'm flairing this as discussion, what are your thoughts?

** HP fanfiction has a built in audience: HP fans.

Writing fanfic instead of original fic is an easy way for an author to get hits and clicks on their work, because the readers come into the story invested in the characters, enough to want to read about them. Compare this to the learning curve of original fiction, where an author has to "earn" the reader's sympathy through coming up with a backstory and setting, giving the characters believable motivations, and writing their thoughts and feelings in a way that a reader would want to care about their successes and struggles. With fanfiction, JKR has already done all the hard work to make you care about Harry and pals. And the fanfic author has the training wheels to lean on if they're not good at writing believable characters. (See the proliferation of bad Mary Sue OC's in fanfic, such as Ebony from My Immortal.)

For the less ethical author, they can use fanfic to build up a readerbase and segue into original fiction, but "file off the serial numbers" and change the names to publish their fic as a novel. Or they can write original stuff on the side and advertise it through their fanfic profiles.

The worst I've seen is an author who cut their fic off at a cliffhanger and posted a note saying that readers who wanted to find out the ending, had to buy their original novel when it was published.

Why in the world is that unethical? If I want to get into writing fiction I will start with fanfiction, a place where, as you said, a lot of legwork is already done and I can focus instead on my main plot and characters (the world is already there). Once I feel I'm good enough (and have gotten more experienced) at that I can switch to fully original fiction. Of course I will advertise my fiction in my fanfiction Author Notes.

When I read a good story, the first thing I do is check the author's other fics. I like the way this author writes fiction, I want to read more of this author and I will damn well buy his books if I find his writing style to my taste.

Why in the universe do you think this is unethical? Because a single douchebag made a dick move with his clifhanger?

Do you not see the issue in using JKR's character outlines/backstories and worldbuilding concepts (magical school in a castle divided into color coded houses), then changing the names from Harry to Hardin in case anyone noticed it was too similar? That's what it means to "file off the serial numbers", as in the case of the Wattpad fanfic "After" and its mainstream publication.

It may not be prosecutable after all recognisable names have been switched out, but on a creative and ethical level, it's a no-no.

JKR didn't invent the idea of a magic school, and all the other stuff is pretty much just taken directly from British public schools - e.g. my own school had four houses named after the school's 16th century founders, each one associated with the colours green, red, blue and yellow, with an annual inter-house cup and inter-house sports.

Think of characters as different geometrical shapes with different colours, and let's say Harry is a green sphere. Now drawing a sphere is hard so some people may draw an ellipsis. Some people might have wobbly lines. Some people might make it a red sphere, some people might make it a green square.

You opened the fic in the first place because you wanted to read about Harry and his pals, and you thought it was going to be a fic about Harry. That was the first advantage for the author to write a Harry Potter fic instead of putting out an original novel that would have been lost in the void because you, as a reader, were interested in reading about something familiar.

The author then milks your goodwill (established and nurtured by JKR) to get you to read the next couple of chapters, because you want to find out what happens, because you want to see if Harry gets with Fanon Daphne (OC love interest in disguise), or what Fanon Voldemort (OC psycho villain) has been up to. The reader retention effect doesn't apply to everyone, but the ability to get their foot into the door of a broad, pre-established reader market, is why the author published their work as a fanfic in the first place.

Nah, it's more like they hand you the brown triangle and keep telling you it's a green sphere, and when you point out that it's brown, they scratch their head and go, "No, mate, look at it, it's as green as a fresh-pickled toad!

I share the same opinion, frankly.

However, the defining characteristics of what makes Harry a Real Harry will vary reader to reader and writer to writer. This makes it so there's no point in trying to question a writer or their MC not being Harry Potter, as many of them will believe otherwise, even if he is an Italian Prime Minister or a mustachioed Austrian chancellor. It sucks if you came in expecting Harry, and the tags/summary didn't indicate that you were going to get a full-on Hadrian or HINO ("Harry-in-Name-Only").

At that point, you either drop it and move on, or suspend your disbelief for the sake of the unique premise.

So you anticipated the /correct/ answer to your question, and are still disregarding it? Weird.

An example: LessWrong, author of HPMOR, said somewhere (his blog, most likely) that the only reason Methods of Rationality is set in the HP universe is specifically because this would permit him to spread his message of rationality to the biggest number of people with minimal effort spent on marketing. I think he also said that he'd have made it a Twilight fanfic, had that franchise been more popular, but I'm not sure on that one.

So yeah, people will (and they often do) set stories in the HP universe just because of the in-built reader base. Whether that's a good thing, I think, depends on the actual story.

I have not read HPMOR, but from what I understand it is still set in the world we know, no? There is still Hogwarts, wizards, magic... a ministry perhaps? Dumbledore and Voldemort still exist too don't they? If the author had written in it in the Twilight universe, would everything except the names be the same? Could he make it a Twilight story by just pressing CTRL+F and changing "Harry" to "Edward" (or whoever would be the main character)? If the answer is no, then even though HPMOR /might be/ a bad fanfiction of Harry Potter, but it's still a fanfiction of Harry Potter.

In philosophy there are the concepts of "real" and "true". A coin is usually spherical. This is "real". When you tilt it back and look at it then, you'll percieve it as an elliptical shape. This is "true" in that particular moment in time. But if you go up to people and say that a coin has an elliptical shape, nobody will accept it. (take this part with a grain of salt, I took philosophy for one year in high school and it was in a different language) So your perceptions may change how you process information, but your views on the source of information doesn't change the source of information itself.

In conclusion Harry Potter is a British Wizard, who lived a certain life. He is not an Austrian painter with a sister who opens dolphin sanctuaries.

** Because they can.

People write fanfiction for a myriad of complicated, and often deeply personal, reasons. They write it because they want to explore an answer to a question they have. They write it to help them think through an event or choice in their life that has no easy answer or explanation. They write it because they want to feel a part of a larger community. The list goes on and on, and each fanficition is wonderful in that it is the answer to a question the writer could no other way of answering. By it's very nature fanficition is exploratory, it pushes and often breaks the narrative along it's fissure points and reveals a new and interesting view of the narrative.

And guess what? That new view of the narrative, it may not be for you. That's ok.

Anyone who's been in fandom knows the content one can come across is varied from things that make you laugh and things that deeply disturb you. But that's the great thing about fandom, it can always make you feel. Personally, I always get a good laugh at of fanficitions I come across that are "bad". Because I was there, I wrote what I would now laugh at. I'm not ashamed of it, writing it made me a better writer. Just because it's not your cup of tea doesn't mean it's not someone else's.

I've been to academic conferences on fanfiction and if there's one thing I've learned its that you can learn just as much from a "bad" fanfic as you can from a "good" one. I'll keep this brief and just say, live and let live. Fanficition has long been looked down upon by others, let's not start gate keeping each other.

**** Because they literally can. Again it's really just as simple as what that individual is expressing or exploring through that fanficition. Speaking from an academic standpoint my thought is that when people write fanfiction that is OOC and an obscure alternate universe it's because they want to write, and to have people read their writing, but are afraid of the consequences. Meaning that they're afraid no one will read it or perhaps that they receive negative feedback. A lot of this kind of writing is very exploratory in nature and these individuals either have little experience in writing or just want to push their boundaries.

Claiming that it's fanficition gives a writer a certain reprieve from critical analysis that they would likely otherwise not be afforded. The terms "fanon" and "canon" were coined for this purpose, as this is not just a Harry Potter fandom occurence but occurs in every fandom. Every fandom has this, in the Harry Potter fandom it occurs quite a bit since it is a larger and more active fandom in addition to being a good sandbox to kick around in. (Meaning there are more world building and bending opportunities)

As long as no one's pulling a Cassandra Clare, who cares? Everyone was new to fandom at some point, and everyone's written weird/bad fanficitions. As long as they're behaving it really shouldn't bother you to be honest. It's just people having their own version of fun.

Game of Thrones exists purely because GRRM didn't like that he couldn't read about what made Aragorn a good king. Also that was not the original definition of fanon, fanon originally way back in the early 2000's meant to create content within the fandom. I will concede that the meaning has likely shifted, as internet language does.

Cassandra Clare, for brevity's sake, wrote the Mortal Instruments series by stealing someone else's HP fanfiction published it and made a crap ton of money which she then used to sue and harass fandom creators. Basically, she took it to the real world and it had serious long lasting effects on everyone involved. People lost large amounts of money fighting legal battles, her fans stalked and harassed these people at their real jobs. It was very serious just all around awful to watch. This was back when there were websites that only hosted HP fanfiction and sites just for fanfiction didn't really exist as of yet. There are archives of all the drama as it was a really big deal at the time, if you're interested in the full story you can find it in some fandom archive. She is an awful person for what she did, and I hope she rots in hell.

I've been in fandom for a long time now, and honestly it's supposed to be fun. If you sit and think "God who would write this" about every weird fanfic you come across you're going to make yourself miserable, honestly. If you talk to people who have been in any fandom for 10+ years you'll find that it's just about letting people have fun, whatever way they have fun.

Exactly. My point is that GRRM went and wrote his own story with original characters, world and plot. Now imagine that Jon Snow's name was Aragorn, Westeros was called Middle Earth and Drogon was named Smaug. Even though the writing is very good, that would make me go

The thing is, to me, he still kind of is. As long as it's Remus, I keep all the emotional attachment I built up over the years. He'll retain some appropriate characteristics to remind me of his remusness every so often despite him being fundamentally different in most ways.

Im sure Livius is a fine chap with a lot of meaningful fears and hopes and dreams - But I don't know him yet, and I don't inherently care about him succeeding. And if my aim were to write something fun about maths and ancient rome (and i really should have chosen a less silly example ;) ), he'd do fine.

** Fanfiction is fanfiction.

In fanfiction, you take parts of canon and wrap it around with your fanon or your head canon or something entirely new, and you write a story.

Every author takes a different amount of canon into consideration. Some completely bypass it, only taking characters and names, while others have their entire fanfics rooted completely in canon.

There's nothing wrong with writing mainly based off of your own imagination. There's also nothing wrong with writing based off of something that's already been offered.

The point is, fanfiction is not canon. It is fanfiction. Anything can happen in fanfiction, but canon is already set and done. There's no sense to arguing about canon in fanfiction, because, really, that's not the point of fanfiction is it?

Maybe the person just really loves the character of Harry Potter, but not so much everything else. That's honestly all there is to it.

The point is that some people may just really love the idea of one Harry Potter who's got a completely different personality in a completely different world.

I don't understand why people argue about whether certain fanfics should be written. At the end of the day, it's all imagination and it's all creativity. In fact, the more a fanfic strays from canon, the more I applaud it. Good job for making a whole new universe on your own! That's insanely difficult. That's insane creativity. It's amazing.

Then maybe you'll go, “if they made a whole new universe why not just write a whole new universe? Why are they using the Harry Potter name?”

Ah, so maybe your problem is with the idea that a writer is using Harry Potter clout to gain views in a completely non-Harry Potter fanfic.

In this modern age, you can easily tell when an author is trying to gain clout. They post their social media handles, Tumblr, Twitter, GoodReads, Kofi/Patreon, or Amazon bibliography. They complain about view stats and readers "not doing their part". They hold chapters hostage until X arbitrary milestone is reached.

In my view, canon is already there. It's kinda sorta good. If I truly want something exactly like canon, I'll go back and read all seven of the HP books.

Fanfiction will always be different. You need to accept that. Every writer is different, every writer has their own creativity. You can't just ask for everyone to be JKR copycats.

If you don't like Hadrian, don't read Hadrian. That's so simple. Find a fic about Harry, not Hadrian.

There're hundreds of thousands of fanfics out there and every single one is different. Not everyone is going to be a Hadrian, just like how not everyone is going to be a Harry.

You're not going to like every fanfic just like how you're not going to like every novel that's out in this world.

But even if you don't like something it is still not okay to make the case that such a thing should have never been written.

Honestly that's my whole point? If you don't like it, cool. Whatever. But don't go around saying that people shouldn't write this or that. No one's forcing you guys to like fanfiction that's completely different from canon. But also no one's forcing you to read it.

(something which is, curiously enough, not too contingent on good writing ability, see the MC in My Immortal - it's pretty much the worst fic in existence, but objectively seen, the main character feels alive when you read it, because she's just an author insert and the AN read exactly like dialogue and hold the exactly same attitude)
