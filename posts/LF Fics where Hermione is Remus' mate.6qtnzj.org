Any length is fine. I'm looking for fics where Hermione is Remus' destined mate/bonded (or whatever you call it). I read one a while back that was actually extremely well written and I would love to re-read it, though I would also like to read others. In this one, towards the end, she is captured by Fenrir Greyback and both Remus and her kill him. Thanks for your help!

Edit: Clarity.

...Oh, but by the way, do you mean mates in the same way that Harry and Ron are mates, or mates as in animals?

I think it'd be funny to have a fic where Harry and Ron comment that they're 'mates', but everyone misinterprets it as that they're gay and bonded to each other.

*** Haha. That would be funny, I would not be surprised if there is a crackfic to that effect.
