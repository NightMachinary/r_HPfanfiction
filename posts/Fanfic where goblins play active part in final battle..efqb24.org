:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So this fic i'm looking for has a scene that I remember where Harry requests the help of the Goblin nation to help in the fight against Voldemort. The only way in which he can do this is by defeating Ragnok, the goblin king in combat mano-a-mano. He not only does this, but goes in without a wand or shield to help him, explaining that if Ragnok chooses not to use a shield even he wouldn't, earning the respect of the goblins in attendance.

Post this I remember the goblins "teleporting" using some tower like structures onto Hogwarts grounds during the final battle. Also noteworthy are the so called goblin elite (basically larger goblins strong enough to take down trolls solo). Also remember a scene where Voldemort instructs his followers to take down these structures so that more goblins reinforcements cannot come through.

Any idea which fic i'm referring to? Or are two scenes that I described from two different fanfic??

I've been searching for these fics for a long time, but have not been able to find them. Any help would be appretiated.
