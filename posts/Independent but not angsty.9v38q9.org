Hey y'all, I recently read Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar, which had it's angry bits later on, but I really liked the first part with a relatively care free Harry doing his thing. Any stories like that?

** Oh God, Not Again! it's on ff and ao3, not sure how the linking bot works but the author is a sarah with some numbers. it's a time travel fic so Harry is independent from the very beginning of his first year.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
