So I remember from the third book that Hermione's Boggart was receiving a failing grade from Professor McGonagall. I understand wanting to do well and always doing well, but failing a test as your greatest fear is rather immature, and considering Hermione is supposed to be the most mature of all of them, I find this rather unrealistic.

I think it was meant to represent failure as a whole, and the test was the most common median to represent that for a 13/4 year old girl who prioritized studying and learning. Like how Harry's fear is fear, represented through a dementor. Hermione's fear is failure, represented through failing a test. Now I am not a teenage girl, but I doubt they can truly comprehend failure leading to something incredibly serious to their or someone else's life, so it's showed through something more simple she understands. I think this suits her character for more than failing a test, and nothing more, being her greatest fear.

It does make me wonder how Harry would have visualized fear if he had never seen or met a dementor before...


** Technically, Hermione's boggart is McGonagall telling her she failed /everything/, which is already a little more serious than failing a test. But in the end, it doesn't really matter whenever Hermione's Boggart is "/the personification of her fear of not being a good enough witch/" or just an immature fear. It was not during her OWL or NEWT but during 3rd year, half the class had immature fear like "a giant eyeball", it's not really a problem for a kid to act as a kid as long as he grow out of it.

** i think the "harry's greatest fear is fear itself" spiel is bullshit. Harry's greatest fear is the actual soul-sucking demons that almost killed him.

*** I think Remus might have been trying to reassure Harry when he told him this.

And on that note, even if Harry is truly most afraid of fear, and of being afraid, it would make sense for the Boggart to manifest itself into a Dementor because they suck out happiness, leaving behind fear and despair.

also, I wouldn't say a dementor is fear. if someone was afraid of fear itself, wouldn't their boggart be... a boggart? even JK said that she made boggart to represent depression. not fear.

** I read somewhere that failing grades just represented for her possibility of being expelled, loosing all her friends (her only friends), her wand being snapped, being Obliviated, and kicked back to the Muggle world with significant lag on other muggles of her age.

*** That would be an interesting plot point - perhaps in that case, Hermione struggles with the spell, and we can hear Boggart McGonagall start saying that they've clearly made a mistake, she's not a witch, they'll have to Obliviate her and send her home. Of course, that also relies on Boggarts having the ability to speak or at least mimic human speech, and I can't remember if they do that in canon.

** "Greatest fear" is patently false* in every case we see. It's more like "the first scary thing that springs to mind".

Harry would rather hang out with a dementor than Voldemort.

Ron would dive face first into a pit of spiders if it would prevent his mom from dying.

Hermione would much rather fail her test than admit to Ron and Harry that she was grown in a vat and has no parents.

etc

edit: Not necessarily patently false, as we see Molly see what is probably her worst fear, but that doesn't falsify this hypothesis; the deaths of her family are very likely in the near future so it's definitely present in her mind at the time of her boggart encounter.

*** Yeah, Neville sees Snape instead of... oh, I don't know... Bellatrix Black. Is he /actually/ more scared of an abusive professor who harangues him, or the woman who tortured his parents into a catatonic state where they no longer recognize him, and could do the same to him or anyone else around him, or did he just have class with Snape so Snape sprung to mind?

** Abstract concepts as fears are a bit difficult to visualize so I guess it goes with whatever the victim seems to think it would show up as as that fear. She is a teen who is very academic so school is the thing her mind goes to. Harry's fear of fear is interesting and I suppose Lupin was probably right in thinking it would show up as some version of Voldemort had Harry not seen a dementor. It's always interesting to wonder what an abstract concept would look like as a boggart. I wrote a fan fic where my characters greatest fear was the unknown and he was in Lupins class. The boggart was so confused as to what to turn into, it screamed and hid in the trunk it came out of. Kinda hard to visualize the unknown.

*** A mass of darkness would be how I would visualize the unknown, if a boggart can turn into a full moon, or a giant spider, I'd think it could stretch itself thin to block out the lights in a room, or vanish into the ground and become a shadow creeping up behind you.

** I don't think that is immature... I think that is very disturbing. She has to have some very strikt parents to have such fears, because no child should fear failure more than death.

I mean she saw Fluffy, had a run in with a devil snare and a troll, was nearly killed by a basilik and also was in the compartment with the dementor.\\
Harry fears the thing that almost had eaten his soul.\\
Ron fears the giant spider that almost had eaten him a year prior.\\
Hermione had some near death experience too but her greatest fear is still that she isn't good enough.

This has been part of Hermione's character from the beginning.

To be fair, Fluffy is scary but can be tamed. A Devil's Snare can be fought with fire. Ron and Harry saved her from the troll. She was paralyzed instantaneously by the Basilisk--as soon as she knew it was there, she was petrified. Lupin sent off the dementor.

All of those monsters can be fought. Failure is not something that can be fought, as it quite literally means the fight wasn't good enough.

**** To be fair for Hermione being expelled would mean being obliviated and thrown back into the muggle world where she never fit in. That's a pretty logical statement for her. She might prefer death to spending the rest of her life as an outcast never knowing magic and having weird things happen around her so she is guaranteed to be hated or feared

** I don't like the fact that in book 5, the fact that Hermione failed this and Harry didn't is used as proof that Harry is a Defense prodigy and should be the one to lead the DA. Harry had just spent several months practicing against boggarts in order to overcome his fear of dementors and this is Hermione's first ever time seeing one, since she did not get a turn in when Lupin had the class face it either.

And Hermione's fear of failing is perfectly understandable, especially when you consider that by third year she is starting to understand the power and influence the pure bloods have and that as a Muggleborn she will need all the help she can get to succeed.
