Almost finished reading all my current fanfics and I need more fanfics to read. Rated M fics are alright and preferably over 80k words and Hogwarts era. No slash though. No specific pairing requirement (ofc are ok), but bonus points for Harry/Daphne, Harmony or Harry/Ginny. Thanks!


** I really enjoyed HP & the Summer After the War. There's a sequel to it as well. It focuses a lot on Harry and Ginny's relationship.

Also, I really enjoy the Prince of Slytherin one. I don't know how to link using the bot, but here's a link [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]

*** The Darkness Within is reallllllyyyy good! But among it's trilogy, my favorite one is the second.

Linkffn(The Darkness Within by Kurinoone) is the first one.

Linkffn(A Part of Me by Kurinoone) is the second, which I have said is my favorite among the three.

Linkffn(Deepest Reflections by Kurinoone) is the third. For me, the third was a bit... Off for me since I was too irritated with certain someone's actions, but... Oh well. I liked it though.

The first one is being rewritten, but it still isn't finished yet. Just check the author's profile.

I don't know why but I feel irritated with the Harry without the brother. He's being stupid, although I can't blame him. Of course, he wants to meet his parents, but do you really need to be selfish and stupid?

And that part made me like it too, although not quite as much as I've liked the first two.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** For the Harry/Daphne, I've got...

Linkffn(Honour Thy Blood by TheBlack'sResurgence) Haven't finished this one yet, but what I can remember is... Harry's powerful. Yes. I can remember a scene but it was a battle one and maybe too much of a spoiler.

** Linkffn(The Prisoners Of Azkaban by The Unusual Suspect) Harry in Azkaban fic. Ultra Powerful Main Characters.
