I recently got into reading fanfics where Harry manages to travel back in time to change something that had happened (or change nothing at all). So, i was wondering if anyone had any recommendations? I dont care if there's slash in it or something triggering. I'm fine with crack fics too! Thank you!

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

It's a MoD, time travel/redo fic that's still in the early days but has had recent updates, and so far I feel it has great pace and characterisation.

There is also a companion piece that has other characters POV called Harry Potter & the Peanut Gallery linkao3(21291353)

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Ticket Backwards)

17yo Harry travels back in time into the body of his 10yo self.

Pro: Harry actually feels like a 17yo surrounded by 11 year olds. He's responsible and doesn't let kids like Draco and Pansy get the rise out of him. No bashing and he isnt grooming the kids. He interact with people like Arthur and Percy which is fun.

Cons: Harry doesn't want to change the timeline too much. He has done nothing about Peter. Author seems to underestimate Harry, has Harry perform well at practical aspect of magic but has Harry score lower on test than Hermione and the Ravenclaws.

#+begin_quote
  When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.

The Boy Who Died A Lot by StarCrossedGirl : cracky to begin with but very clever premise and writing

Escape the Paradox by Meri - Harry goes back to Maruders era

Rapture by Mia_Ugly: Adult Harry goes back in time and meets adult Snape. Beautiful and raw.

HP and the Philosopher's Stone: Time Jump Chronicles By Transgressions: Auror Harry goes back in time: I enjoyed this, book 1 is finished but it's still wip.
