Recently got into fics where the author almost writes a whole new Harry Potter world. It can include Harry going to different school. Looking for long fics where they are preferably complete.


** Uh, not Harry/OC but for totally different world, linkffn(Reign of the Serpent; Prince of the Dark Kingdom)

Both darker worlds, both abandoned but with hints that any pairing you want could happen soon in the first one, and hints at HHr and Harry/Luna in the second. It's been a while, he might briefly date an OC in Dark Kingdom.
