:END:
I'm looking for a fanfiction or one on AO3, not sure which, where it starts before 5th year. Harry is living at Grimmauld Place with Sirius and the rest of the characters, but is slowly becoming disenchanted. He has his trial for underage magic, but greets Lord Malfoy, Lestrange and Evan Rosier? afterwards with the proper greetings. Lord Voldemort grants him immunity and there is another female death eater named Valerie?. Therefore Harry is allowed out and about from Grimmauld Place. He meets up with various death eaters when he is shopping and talks with them. A bit later on Molly Weasley tries to perform an exorcism on him, but it doesn't work and then she crucio's him. Harry escapes from her and runs and runs from the house and eventually found by Lord Malfoy and others. Lupin finds him and offers the anti-cruciatus potion and Malfoy asks who tried to crucio Harry to be told it was Molly.

I can't remember if it was complete, but I don't think it was. Please help folks!
