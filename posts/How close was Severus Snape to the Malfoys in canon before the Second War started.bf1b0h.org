Snape was clearly a trusted “friend” of the Malfoys, seeing as how they worked together within the inner circle of the Death Eaters. He obviously became a closer supervisor to Draco much later in the books because of the Unbreakable Curse.

My question is, how close was he to them back when they thought the war was over? Did they keep in touch?

I saw his likeness towards Draco as more of a House favouritism and a nod to his previous alliance with Lucius, but beyond that, I don't see any other proof of their close relationship. I've read a lot of fics having Snape as Draco's uncle, but I'm not sure how probable that is canonically.

Any thoughts?


** It's fanon that he's Draco's godfather, not canon but largely accepted

** I don't think they were any closer than any other Death Eaters who knew each others' identities. I think the only reason Narcissa asked Snape to watch over Draco is because, as far as she knew, he was the only person at Hogwarts who could.

** The one piece of canon from back then was during Snape's sorting. Snape is deeply disappointed that he and Lily won't be in the same house, but Lucius, as a prefect, warmly welcomes him to the Slytherin table.

My personal headcanon? As a prefect and quite possibly Head Boy, Lucius kept James and Sirius from bullying Snape. But after Lucius graduated, Snape no longer had a protector.

*** Lucius is not really the altruistic type, i doubt he'd publicly defend the poor, friendless Half-Blood against the rich, popular Pure-Bloods. Since Snape is talented, he may privately show him some nasty spells to retaliate, to secure him as a future ally.

** Lucius was more decent than Snape, i don't think he would have genuine affection for a monster like him and Narcissa well... she was desperate for saving her child and asked him to protect Draco only because she supposed that Snape had a soft spot for him.
