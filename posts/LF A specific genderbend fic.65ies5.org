Long time lurker here. I came across a specific fic that was about Harry getting turned into a girl by his sister. From what I can remember, he was friends with Neville. And James & Lily weren't terrible parents. Any other details are really vague. Can anyone else remember what fic this was?

  A response to Final Master X2's Harry Potter Challenge. Harry and his bestie Neville are not having a great time at school, but at least it can't get any worse. Well not until his little sister, Rose decides to get involved with her slightly wonky but awesomely powerful spellcasting anyway. FemHarry, FemNeville, and Femslash. This one is all about the girls. HP/HG.
