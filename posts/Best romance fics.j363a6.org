I loved [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=240987&showRestricted][Delicate by Padfoot4ever]] and [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=38070][Living Life by Singing]], and have been trying to find fics that are just as well-written ever since. Anyone has any recommendations for the best romance hp fan fics?

â€‹

(No particular ship, any ship is fine - though I do especially like Dramione.)


** For Dramione I've enjoyed some of Colubrina's fics like linkffn(A Constellation Name) and linkffn(The Muddy Princess). I never finished linkffn(The Wrong Strain) but I liked what I read. And she has a lot more Dramione.

  It had been one night and Draco Malfoy had gone out of his way to make sure she didn't expect it to be any more than that. Still, she probably should have told him about their daughter. DRAMIONE. (Plus drabbles of their child.)

  Just another Pureblood!Hermione story. A hidden adoption revealed, a brother found, a new world to figure out: "What are you hoping for?" he asked as they stood ready to do the spell. "I don't know," Hermione admitted. "You?" His knuckles were white on his wand. "A sister," he said, his voice very low, "I'm hoping for a sister." Winner 2015 Energize WIP Awards. COMPLETE.

  Everyone knew what veela were. Veela were magical creatures, breathtakingly beautiful, who captivated men with a single look. It would have been nice to have been that strain. Instead, Hermione Granger was infected by another. Instead of captivating all men, she was captivated by one. She'd die without him. She was already in almost constant pain. DRAMIONE. COMPLETE.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.
