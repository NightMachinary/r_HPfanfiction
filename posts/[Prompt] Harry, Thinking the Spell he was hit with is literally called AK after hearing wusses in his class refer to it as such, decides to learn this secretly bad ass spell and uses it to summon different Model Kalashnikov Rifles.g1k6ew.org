as the title says. Sick of not knowing what people are referring to when they say "He hit you with an AK when you were a whee baby". Harry decides to try and recreate the spell using the only things he knows about it. The fact that it's green and it's called an AK.

Thus he creates a spell that lets him summon floating AK Variant rifles behind him all of them different variants of green that auto lock and fire on the nearest targets in his line of site.


** H: "AK-47!"\\
V: "Ay Kay what?\\
*TA!*\\
V: "OW!"\\
*TATATATATATATATA!*\\
V: "OWOWOWOWOWOW Okay... Not bad... But still nothing compared to me! Now witness the power of an immortal god!"\\
H: "AK-101"\\
V: "101?!"\\
*DU!*\\
V: "ACK! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! That's it! Everyone dies! Say goodbye to your school Potter!"\\
H: "Well that's not very nice!"\\
V: "Of course not! I'm fucking evil! "

I'm too lazy to type out the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b5Jji8uaFk][rest of the joke]].

There's still the AK-203 and the AK308 (battle rifle) to do.

What, the progressing numbers are perfect for this skit.

** What's really disturbing is that from the magic I've seen in that universe this would be entirely possible. You'd probably need to manually do a quick reloading spell when they ran dry, but the weapons would still be doing their thing so you can pretty lay down continual fire. We're basically talking about non-intelligent constructs that can follow basic commands..well within the Potterverse's range IMO.
