:END:
I imagine this'll be found within a few hours at the most considering the clue I'm giving.

All I want is a title.

Half-Oni Girl named Kotone.

I may have gotten the name wrong, but I'm pretty sure I haven't.

Either way, there's the clue, and as I said, I imagine this'll be really easy.

#+begin_quote
  Post HBP. HHr. Harry and Hermione's odd behavior during their 6th year explodes into a maelstrom of chaotic, bitter emotions, caused by a strange 'illness.' Help comes from a young, orphaned girl who is much more than she appears.
