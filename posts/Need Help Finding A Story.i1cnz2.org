I don't remember the name of the story or the author. All I remember is Hermione gets pulled out of Hogwarts after second year. She leaves a box with letters for Harry telling him to follow them and they'll help him survive. I know its not much to go on, but if anyone can help me find the story I would greatly appreciate it.


** This is the only one I know

  Hermione is pulled from the magical world after fourth year, but leaves Harry a box before she goes. Manipulative Dumbledore, OBHWF plotting, misguided Order, HHr.
