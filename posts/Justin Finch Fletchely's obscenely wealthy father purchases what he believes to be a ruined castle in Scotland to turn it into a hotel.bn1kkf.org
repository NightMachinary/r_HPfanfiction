*** Literally, "No one gives what they don't have." (I wasn't familiar with that one.)

But that raises the question, who owns a generic abandoned castle in England? I can think of three possibilities: the peerage that originally owned the castle, if it still exists, a muggle landowner who owns a large tract of land that the castle happens to be on, or the Crown.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Holch_Povlsen][Anders Povlsen]] owns 345 square miles of land in Scotland, including isolated tracts large enough to accidentally include Hogwarts (and Hogsmeade). Legally, the magical title to Hogwarts probably doesn't exist in the muggle world, so the random muggle landowner route could work. The problem would be transportation, since I suspect Hogwarts is miles from any muggle roads.

**** A ruined castle will actually attract hordes of curious Muggles.

If they really want to keep Muggles off, they should put up signs like:

“Danger! Radioactivity!”

Or

“Military installation. All trespassers will be shot!”

I bet far far fewer Muggles would dare to explore.

**** I think it likely that there is no Muggle title over the land constituting Hogwarts, due to the date the school was founded. Essentially, the school is old enough that it pre-dates the English and Scottish legal systems.

In the Muggle world, when you go to buy a property and you check the seller has title to the land they are purporting to sell, they can prove their title in one of two ways.

Firstly, they can show you the title deeds.

Secondly, you can look at the central register operated by the government which lists the owner of the land.

The first system is the older one and is increasingly defunct as registration is now compulsory on all land transfers. So you will only look at the title deeds rather than the register in respect of land which has not changed hands since the system of registration was introduced.

So you ask yourself: firstly, is there a title deed to Hogwarts' land in the Muggle world? No, there can't be, because the school far predates the oldest title deeds in existence. We also know the school is unplottable, so at the time it was founded it would have been taken "off the map" such that it wouldn't fall accidentally into any generic grant of land made by Muggles by reference to landmarks.

And then secondly, is Hogwarts registered in the land registry? Highly unlikely, since no Muggle would be able to register it and no wizard would be inclined to.

Edit: on the other hand, the title to the Malfoy lands definitely exists in the Muggle world too, as it was created by William the Conqueror. So that could lead to amusing outcomes XD

Edit 2: though presumably the Muggles have either been obliviated or believe the title to be defunct, as otherwise it would be the oldest extant title in the UK.

***** In the muggle world, the Malfoy lands are probably a little-remarked-upon entry in the Domesday Book.

Scotland was not covered by the Domesday Book, but the first land registry in Scotland [[https://www.ros.gov.uk/about/what-we-do/our-history][appears to have been created in 1286]], long before the Statute of Secrecy.

Thus, Hogwarts Castle may be in the registry. However, when tracing the ownership, muggle historians would (probably) discover that the family lines went extinct centuries ago (around the time of the Statute of Secrecy at the latest) with no identifiable heirs. Under the intestacy laws of the UK, the land would then pass directly to the Crown. And it is common for the Crown to [[https://www.gov.uk/guidance/refer-bona-vacantia-land-or-buildings-bvc2][resell this land]].

There are points where the process may stop, of course. The Crown may disclaim and hold the land. Or the Ministry of Magic might notice and step in. But there is definitely a process for Hogwarts to pass into muggle hands.

***** The concept of the trust (originally a "use") traces back to the crusades, when crusaders would leave legal title to their lands with a "trustee" who, despite having legal title, would be restrained from dealing with the property as they wished because they were holding the property on trust for the crusader.

So Hogwarts predates the concept of a trust.

Edit: replied to the wrong comment, but anyways, Hogwarts does have a trust so it must have been set up at some point, so maybe they got the land titles then too?

*** Hmmm. Lawyers trace the claims back to a dead guy and fining no record of the man dating past the early 1900s, move their inquiry to Scotland. Scotland isn't privy to wizards because the UK's single contact is an occasional meeting between the PM and the MoM with a warning to the former not to tell anyone, so they agree that in the apparent absence of any next-of-kin that the castle should logically pass back to the Kingdom of Scotland. The Queen becomes the legal owner of Hogwarts.

It would be really trippy if there were construction workers coming to work on the hotel *while school is in session*, and the students can see them, but they can't see the students. And somehow the workers think they are making progress and it appears to them to be a normal job, but it doesn't negatively affect the students or teachers in any way, they just find it amusing.

Now why would this happen?

** Uhm, about the umplottability.

Clearly, being umplottable means that the actual Hogwarts grounds don't show up on a map. But what about the surroundings?

Someone must own the surrounding area, and that has to show up somewhere. So technically, without any record of the actual Hogwarts grounds, someone owning all the surrounding land could legally own Hogwarts and its grounds.

[[https://i.imgur.com/qzWs2jn.png]]

Like this, suppose someone buys up all the surrounding lands, which would show up on the muggle records without the Hogwarts hole in it. From a muggle perspective they could in theory be considered to hold all the lands in that rectangle
