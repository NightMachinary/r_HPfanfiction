The good, the bad and the ones that make you scrub you hard drive for fear that someone else might stumble upon them.

Personally I've really liked the goblins in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][For the Love of Magic]] since they treat Harry as terribly as their other clients.


** My preferred Goblins is this:

- They're not true bankers. That's not canon. They're fancy mini-storage operators. We have no indication that they offer loans or investment management. We see that they're a company that offers long-term rental of secure storage. We don't even have any indications that they pay interest. They're not a true bank.
- They're money-exchangers (Pounds > Galleons).
- They appraise precious gems (though this may be sent back from their expeditions in other countries).
- They don't have time-dilated healing chambers.
- They aren't your go-to for home warding.
- They aren't the be-all, end-all for curse-breaking.
- There are no "Goblin Friends".
- They care about their customers only as far as ensuring their agreements to keep their storage secure.
- Other than above, they don't care about humans and have no qualms with betraying them (see: Griphook).

They loaned money to Bagman, though it's not indicated that those were Gringotts goblins.

**** Did they make him a loan or did they act as bookies for the World Cup & Tri-Wizard Tournament and then get angry when he skipped out on his bet? Or both?

***** Both:

  "Lee Jordan's dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off Bagman as well. Turns out he's in big trouble with the goblins. Borrowed loads of gold off them. A gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the gold he had, and it still wasn't enough to cover all his debts. They followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. He's lost everything gambling. Hasn't got two Galleons to rub together. And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back?"

  "How?" said Harry.

  "He put a bet on you, mate," said Fred. "Put a big bet on you to win the tournament. Bet against the goblins."

We know they hire curse breakers. And as you say, they are in the business of secure storage. It's not a big step to having some sort of warding department.

*** I disagree to some degree with some of the information here.

They are bankers, maybe not in the muggle sense, but they definitely are bankers. They store money and valuables, offer exchanges, provide loans, and more.

Also, they do offer curse breaking, which involves wards, so as someone else said, its not all that far to jump from that to warding services of some sort.

And Goblin friends? Even in Cannon Harry is to some degree on friendly terms with Griphook and while he does betray them, you can be friends with someone and choose family or kin over them. And Flitwick is half goblin half human meaning there had to have been a human goblin relationship.

**** Not "friendly with Goblins", "Goblin Friend", a commonly-used designation in fanfiction that denotes that a human (or, I guess, some other non-human sentient) is so highly regarded by the "Goblin Nation" that they are placed on a pedestal wherein an attack on the Goblin Friend by another person would see Gringotts retaliating against the attacker, be it with arms or financial sanctions. A Goblin Friend has preferential treatment in the form of greater access to services, lower fees, etc.

** They run the magical equivalent of those storage units you see everywhere. Any financial services, legal services, etc should be provided by other humans, however, this takes a lot of work to worldbuild, so it's understandable why everyone simply makes it all goblin run.

** There's one fic I read where the author had the goblin guards armed with MP5s. They were positioned to be this interesting group that are preparing for a new war against magicals, this time armed with superior weaponry against people that think firearms take minutes to load. Sadly, I don't remember the name.
