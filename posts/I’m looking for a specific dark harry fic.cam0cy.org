It starts with Harry entering school in like 5th or 6th year for the first time and the beginning of the story is mostly about other people's reaction to him, once it's in his perspective it's mostly a horcrux hunt and trying to get rid of the horcrux in himself. Once he does get rid of the horcrux there's an alternate persona he takes on occasional called Tom. He's gets sorted into Slytherin, there's some smut. I remember this fic for having really good fight scenes, especially one between Dumbledore and Voldemort. The fic heavily focuses on how strong Voldemort is through the story. Can anyone help me?

#+begin_quote
  In a world where twisting the very fabric of space and time is commonplace, Harry Potter is considered something extraordinary. Yet when he finally arrives at Hogwarts after being missing for seven years, no one can quite figure out what kind of person he is. Himself included. Darkish themes, no slash, no pairings, some lemons mixed in.
