- Remus Lupin sentenced to Dementor's Kiss

*** I don't think that would happen

Because Dumbledore would intervene to lessen the punishment they would receive, remember at this time he has even more influence than he did in Harry's time

Remus would end up expelled at most maybe they break his wand like with Hagrid, I can see Sirius expelled too, and if it was known why Snape was snooping in the shrieking shack there would be no reason for Lily to hate James

I don't remember did this happen before or after Snape called Lily a mudblood?

**** I disagree that Dumbledore would intervene. It's a fanon trope that he gives /everyone/ a second chance. The only glaring examples in canon I can see of this, which is where fanon pulls from, are Snape and Malfoy. But they're two entirely different situations:

Draco hasn't killed anyone, yet, and Dumbledore is attempting to preserve the relative purity of his soul.

Snape, while whether or not he could be considered "redeemed" by the end of the series is up for debate, his remorse and turning against Voldemort was /genuine/. Perhaps he deserved to be punished, but Dumbledore, because of Snape's genuine remorse, could at least count on him to be an unfailingly loyal spy - if not for himself, at least to spite Voldemort. Morality aside, that's just a smart move strategically, to keep him out of trouble.

To my point, though, Dumbledore has otherwise never shown any kind of mercy for people who're already responsible for someone's death. In the same vein that Draco almost killed someone and Dumbledore intervened to keep him out of trouble, he did the same for Sirius Black when /he/ had almost killed Snape. But had Draco /actually/ killed Katie Bell or Ronald Weasley? I think Dumbledore would have come down on him hard, and similarly against Sirius.

***** while I see your point I still stand by what I said

to be honest, I wasn't even thinking about the whole Dumbledore gives everyone second chances, it's more like he would realize that Sirius and Lupin (especially Lupin) didn't really want to kill Snape, it wouldn't have been actual murder but an accident, I think Dumbledore would have seen the event as the mistake of a stupid impulsive teenager.

I mean you could make an argument that he would let Sirius end in Azkaban (which I personally doubt) but he would never let the ministry punish Lupin for something that was completely out of his control

****** I completely forgot to address Lupin's role in events - I didn't mention him at all. My mistake. I had thoughts on it, but they slipped my mind, sorry!

I'm not entirely certain how Dumbledore would handle Remus. On one hand, he's a child who found companionship with a group of people. Of that group, one of them /essentially/ betrayed him by revealing his secret to someone who obviously despises them while, at the same time, endangering both of their lives (Lupin indirectly, Snape directly). But, at the same time, Remus is fully aware of how dangerous his transformation is and how under control the entire situation needs to be kept. /No one/ ever informed Dumbledore that James and Sirius and Peter were aware of Remus' condition - we know this because Dumbledore had no idea about the only thing that keeps them safe during the full moon; The animagus transformation.

Remus and his friends, not just Sirius, were extremely irresponsible with such a serious illness and you could, in that vein, hold Remus accountable for everything that happens because of the knowledge that other people have of his lycanthropy.

Would Dumbledore view the situation that way? I'm... not sure. I'd like to think /not/. However, at the same time, it /is/ fairly difficult to punish Sirius without somehow implicating Remus' condition to the entire world. I'm fairly certain had Snape fucking /died/, however, that Dumbledore would /not/ have just allowed Sirius off with a warning.

So I suppose it depends on how guilty Dumbledore would have considered Remus, in his role. If he feels that Remus should also be held accountable, both of them are going to Azkaban, no questions asked. If he doesn't? At the very least I expect Sirius would have been expelled and some fake reason would have been given. Sirius, despite his fault in the situation, would likely agree to lie about his reason for being expelled to spare Remus.

He didn't know they stayed with him, didn't know the whole Animagus scheme, but I think he may have at least suspected, seeing how close the four were, that Remus had /told/ them his secret, and (what with his "love is the greatest thing" philosophy) been okay with it.

I think if Dumbledore did know that James, Sirius and Peter were aware of Remus' condition that he would have shown mercy on Remus if Severus had died. After all, if that were the case, then Dumbledore shares exactly the same, if not more, responsibility for the situation as Remus does.

Hell, even if Dumbledore /didn't/ know, he's the one who knowingly allowed a werewolf to be a student. Even if that student had broken his trust, it would still be something for which Dumbledore was directly responsible.

Do you seriously blame Dumbledore for that? I mean, sure, he /definitely/ blames himself, but that's just /dumb/. He had a friend who attempted to torture his brother. And then he intervened.

********** I find it hard to accept that logic.

Namely, we have no canonical evidence that Dumbledore actually neglected his sister. He was, perhaps, not on hand to cater to her 24/7, but his /brother/ was. You can argue on the morality of shoving that responsibility off to his younger brother, sure, but there's never anything that would imply that the sister was ever not taken care of.

Secondly, even if he had, you're right - her worsening condition had nothing to do with her death. She did spend her last moments in fear, frightened of the fighting around her - and that's horrible - but her reaction is exactly what we'd come to expect as typical for Ariana. And the resulting fighting was, in the end, what was the cause of her death - not her condition.

No blame can be placed on Albus Dumbledore other than, perhaps, making the wrong friend. Something of which I find hard to blame a man searching for an equal for. Hell, Aberforth is more at fault for that particular altercation than Albus, considering he goaded Grindelwald. Albus' only reason for inclusion in the fight was to stop Grindelwald from torturing his brother.

#+end_quote

Shortly before. During one of their arguments before the major falling out, Snape tried to compare his Death Eater friends to James Potter and the others. Lily retorted that while arrogant bullies, Potter and his friends didn't use Dark Magic. Snape tried to argue that they did--and used their monthly romps as evidence (I imagine James and Sirius and Peter were all exhausted during class during the full moon). Lily snapped back that she knew his theory (whether she was aware of the truth of Remus's lycanthropy is subject to debate) but that she also knew that James saved Snape's neck from whatever lived in the tunnel under the Whompng Willow.

*** Why?

The one most like to be punished would be Remus, because he is a halfbreed, like they easily did with Hagrid and he was framed for a murder and only got expelled as well.

Sirius got away with people knowing what he did, in that case maybe nobody even knew how Snape found out, but everybody knew that Snape was sneaking after them and tried to get dirt on them. Everybody would just assume Snape found out like that. And even if not, he didn't force Snape in there. Snape went there on his own, even suspecting what he would find.

Why would Lily hate James forever? He had nothing to do with anything. Because he didn't manage to save someone from a werewolf?

There is a real chance that the only once that actual did something illegal there are Snape and ironical maybe James when he went after Snape to save him. Because there must be a law that forbids actual opening the secluded cage of a werewolf. That is reckless behavior and could endanger others. But just telling or talking about it is probably not illegal. I mean people there called openly for the murder of halfbreeds and muggleborns and while it was rude and had social consequences in some circles, it was most definitely not illegal. So Sirius would have probably be saved from punishment because of laws his own ancestors established to be free to insult and threaten muggleborns and muggles.

*** I disagree with your third bullet point. I think your first two points are spot on but I think because of those things, James Potter grows up and matures way faster than in cannon. Afterwarda Peter and James probably don't have it in them to continue pranking and just kind of coast along in school. Now a writer could easy make a case for Lily trying to strike up a friendship or help them with school work out of pity, or whatever, and then a relationship grows out of that.

*** I think that's overstating it. In a /fair/ legal system:

- Remus gets off scot-free because he wasn't in on it, and he was (in this instance, at least) following the rules. Except he might be expelled because werewolves aren't "supposed" to be at Hogwarts.
- Sirius...I want to say goes to Azkaban for a short-ish sentence for reckless endangerment, but Snape was an idiot for going into a situation where he had good reason to believe there was a transformed werewolf, and it's plausible that Sirius didn't do anything legally wrong. He would still very likely be expelled, though. Just look what happened to Newt Scamander.
- Dumbledore faces an inquiry for enrolling a werewolf in the school and is fired.
- James is carefully investigated, but is let off because he wasn't in on the "prank."
- Lily understands that James wasn't in on the prank and remains on tolerable terms with him, but she still never lets him close enough to fall in love with him.

Of course, we know that magical Britain /isn't/ a fair legal system. Even though Fudge isn't in power yet, there's still a war on, and people are scared. A realistic guess is that Sirius would go to Azkaban for a long time, possibly life; Dumbledore loses all of his positions, but stays on as a consultant for the war effort; and Remus winds up either in Azkaban, with Greyback's pack, or committing suicide.

I'm really not so sure about that.

Reckless endangerment:

#+begin_quote
  Reckless endangerment is a crime consisting of *acts* that create a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person.
#+end_quote

[emphasis mine]

I'm not so sure about the correct interpretation of "acting" here, but even if it can also refer to speech, the constitutional right of free speech has pretty high value in comparison. Telling a fully cognizant person how to enter a lion's cage doesn't sound like "reckless endangerment" to me. Sirius isn't forcing Snape's hand in any way and he's not deceiving him either. Snape is suspecting that Lupin is a werewolf and wants to check it out... he's being an idiot. Sirius is just saying: "Sure, go ahead you moron, here's the key".

There's the idea of "shouting fire in a crowded theater", but even that seems a lot worse than what Sirius did.

And then I doubt that Lily and James would be impacted too much.

Fanon may have muddled you up, but in canon, Dementor's Kiss only exists as a sentence for a Dark Wizard who has /escaped Azkaban/ (presumably because they have thus proven that no peaceful solution could possibly hold them in this world or the next). Even the worst criminal wouldn't be sentenced to it upon their original arrest. Not saying the consequences for Lupin would be pretty, but they woudln't be quite as dire as a Kiss.
