So I watched the movie last night and wanted to discuss it with you people, because the community here seems to be more savvy in terms of HP lore.

I personally loved it. As always with Rowling's writing you can see glimpses of a bigger world behind, and this is no exception, like the differences between the english Ministry and MACUSA.

The build up for Grindelwald's and Dumbledore's story is definitely there, especially with the deathly hallows reference and obviously Grindelwald's appearance at the end.

I find myself more interested in the possibilities for the expansion of the Wizarding World than for Newt's story, but that's just me. Hopefully we'll get that with four more movies to go.


** First of all, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/5cq70f/spoilerpiecing_together_information_from_reviews/][I nailed]] my prediction.

Unfortunately I don't take too much satisfaction in my prediction because that was the one part of the movie I disliked. I admit there was a certain visceral joy is seeing Grindelwald advancing on 20-30 adult wizards and witches and laughing off their spells. However, there are two things I really dislike about it:

1. Graves was an interesting character and it would have been great seeing him working alongside Grindelwald as his lieutenant. The decision to make Graves = Grindelwald just shrinks the cast of interesting characters.

2. Even though we only saw him briefly, all my fears about Depp playing Grindelwald are feeling rather immediate. Firstly I really don't like the look of the character. Secondly it seems clear to me that Depp is going to play him as Jack "Grindelwald" Sparrow with his trademark craziness. That's a real disappointment given that Grindelwald had always seemed to be the thinking man's villain to Voldemort's crazy. He had an ideology that was coherent and arguable, he wasn't obsessed with immortality, and he was able to convince Dumbledore that he was right (for a time). Making him nuts just destroys all that and gives us another shallow villain.

However, other than that (which is more of a worry for the future of the franchise as it was only a small part of this movie) I loved it. I felt like all the characters were reasonably fleshed out and distinct, and none of my fears about magic were realised. I was mainly concerned that magic would be nerfed against Muggles but this did not occur, and indeed all the depictions of magic were more or less in line with my headcanon. Wonderful.

I particularly loved the way the movie expanded on magic as being much more than just spells, which the fandom is generally too focused on. Magic is a much more varied thing than the neat, ordered idea many have. The Obscurus is an example of this, as is Queenie's legilimency. Her being hyper-specialised in legilimency is exactly the kind of thing that I talk about in my headcanon document, where a person's "magicalness" doesn't just vary in power but also in specialisation.

The worldbuilding was great in general. I particularly loved the look we got at a meeting of the International Confederation of Wizards (though I thought for a moment we might get a Dumbledore cameo there, but I guess he isn't on it yet). The speakeasy was also cool, as was the US magical death penalty.

I didn't even mind the hints towards a Tina/Newt romance, which lots of people complained about as coming out of nowhere. I don't think it came out of nowhere at all.

TL;DR enjoyed it a lot, liked the additions to canon, only disliked one element. 9/10

*** Oddly enough when I left the theater I had a few thoughts but the first one was "I bet Taure hated the magical combat." What with it just being them shooting waves of magic at each other. I probably thought that because I often find myself agreeing with almost everything you say about magic in Harry Potter.

Besides combat though, the magic was stunning. I really got the sense that wizards are tiny super humans among us, bending reality to their will. It just felt very.... magical.

***** The speed was actually very refreshing to see, and as you mention above watching one person tank all of that magic was great. But, the lightning whip scene made me cringe. I feel like that character in general wouldn't just be playing around like that.

** I loved it! I am SUPER interested in Leda Lestrange and if it's another Andromeda Tonks situation or another Bellatrix situation. I was so excited to see some PoC! This movie was way darker than like any of the HP movies. There was some horrible child abuse in there. And some really heavy political tones. Loved it. The CGI was a bit much but you know, minor complaint.

Leda Lestranger, - the taker - 'You need a giver, not a taker', said Queenie. After that, I already made stories on my mind where Leda is engaged to someone else who she doesn't love, but will never give up while carry on a secretive love affair with Newt; she uses him when she needs, gives him hope, but at the last minute shuts down and tell him that they can't be together... ooooh, I need a fanfic like this NOW!

** Honestly, I loved it. I might get a lot of flack for this, but as someone who grew up with Harry Potter and is now an adult, I found that I enjoyed having adult protagonists more than our favourite trio... I found Newt to be more endearing than Harry, and it seemed more relatable to me.

I was surprised with how dark it was, but it definitely was a plus in my books. New York felt dark and gritty, which is totally different from when we are first introduced to Harry Potter. Honestly, when I got out of the movie last night, I could not stop raving about it.

My only complaint is that I loved Colin Farrell and the character of Percival Graves, and I would have loved to have seen more of him as a separate unit from Grindelwald. As someone mentioned previously, it would have been nice to see him in a role as lieutenant.

That being said, I didn't really disagree with what he (Grindelwald/Graves) was saying when he was arrested. I can see how and why he would be angry after the aurors blatantly went against his orders and killed Credence.

So yeah. Overall fantastic cast in all spectrums, the music was lovely, and the costumes were stunning!! I think it was a solid introduction to this new arc of films, and I am thoroughly excited for more. :)

I doubt that's a controversial opinion, especially looking at the recent demographics survey. I totally agree with you. I've had a hard time caring about yet another Harry-Hits-The-Stations-of-Canon fic for quite some time now, so I'm really excited about what a fresh breath of canon opens up in terms of fanfic.

RIP Farrell. I am NOT excited about Depp, but maybe I'll be surprised.

**** Phew! Glad to hear it. When I first watched the film and read the reviews, I felt like a lot of viewers wanted a new Harry. I was so relieved it wasn't the case!

I will agree with you on the sentiment of Depp, I LOVED Farrell. (Maybe it was the robes? Or the hair? But DAMN.) Here's hoping it works out well...

** I enjoyed it but I was disappointed with the writing. Plot, pacing, and character development were let downs for me.

The creatures were creative, it was nice seeing magic be so prominent in the magical society, almost the entire cast was good, effects were pretty neat.

But the film felt like it was conflicted about what tone to go for. The two storylines didn't really connect in a meaningful way, and because of the misbalance of stakes in the storylines Newt's felt like a bunch of side missions.

The film had a whole lot of setup for future films and it distracted from what they were dealing with in the moment.

I suppose ultimately it's Rowling first screenplay so she deserves some leeway. I just hope she improves for the next one, or gets some help from someone more experienced.

I would have rather had a film centered around Newts stuff than the constant cuts to the other storyline which was never fully fledged in the end.

** I loved the Political tones in the film. The workings of MACUSA, the harsher muggle interaction laws, the brutally dark death penalty they have over there, I think I'd prefer being tossed into the veil honestly. The meeting of the ICW was great, it was nice to see ambassadors from asia and the Ottomans there (the dude with the fez) though I'm a bit bias as i love the ICW and Grindelwald. I've had ideas bouncing around ever since Newt mentioned working with Ukrainian IronBellys on the Eastern Front in WW1, that's mental i mean on what side was he on, what was to doing with Dragons, i can imagine they could be one hell of a Trench buster. Is it because of what he saw there that he became so protective of Animals? He mentions that Humans are the worse and most deadly animals of all so it stands that he saw some fucked up shit during the war.

The fact Newt has a Brother, Theseus, who's some hot-shot Auror for the MoM, and is important enough that ICW members get excited to see him, and he keeps in contact with Graves who himself is the HEAD of magical law in America.\\
On top of all that he's a war hero in WW1, which is interesting due the British Ministry not officially getting involved, was he on the Eastern Front too? or on the Western? Is he ashamed of Newt for being expelled?

But yeah sorry, I'm hyped for the increase of size of the WW and for all the new History and World Building brought by the Film.

On a more serious note, we got a very different perspective on beasts, especially regarding their intelligence, so expect a lot of animal companion fics where they interact in more complex ways.

** Theory List:

1) We already know that Grindelwald is going to escape from prison somehow; could his arrest be somehow part of his own plot? (in a Trojan horse concept, sort of thing...)

2) Newt has been to Africa... Grindelwald does wandless magic which is also common in Africa... coincidence?

3) Who were Credence original family? I'm sooo thinking that somehow he will come back!

4) I still believe that we will see some Isolt's Gaunt's decendent from her squib daughter Martha making an appearance later on

I feel like I need to watch it a few hundred more times to pick up on everything that I missed.

It was so detailed and I loved all the characters. Also excited to learn more about Leta (sp) Lestrange and the American wizarding community. Well, actually anything about it. I love the added layers of depth that this film added as well. The New Salem Philanthropic Society creeped me out hardcore.

Also wanting to learn more about the American wizarding currency and hoping we see more of Jacob! ♥

Anyway, just loved it.
