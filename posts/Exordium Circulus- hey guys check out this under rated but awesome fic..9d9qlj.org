*** Read the first chapter, looks neat. Is it going to turn into RoyEd? I've had some fics that started well before veering into bad slash territory, and I've learned to recognize warning signs (like Winry and Riza not even getting a mention).

  They're still not sure exactly how they ended up on the magic side of a place called London, but Edward and Roy are not new to dealing with the unexpected. Needing to get home, they figure out how magic energy works and they make a mutual decision to go to Hogwarts. Neither of them are prepared for what they find at Hogwarts, or for what happens when Ed starts lying to Roy...
