So, this prompt requires some explaination.

I have long wanted to write a fic where the DEs and the Order must fight together against a common threat. I think I may have just found that common threat.

The Seven are powerful, yes, but they are not all-powerful like most threats would need to be.

Essentially, this fic would involve the Order, Death Eaters, and the Boys teaming up to take on the Supes of the world. Don't ask why, that's for you all to figure out. Why team up with the Boys? Well, they're the only people in the world with experience fighitng supes.

What do you all think?


** "Imperio!"

Game over.

*** First of all, in such a story, Compound V would probably have magical qualities. Second of all, a person of sufficient will can resist Imperio. I think supes/The Boys are quite stubborn.

** I feel as if Voldemort alone could deal with all seven of them. Killing curse works conceptually so none of the seven can defend against it. Voldemort can go undetectable, untraceable, and teleport so access to the seven shouldn't be too hard especially given their public presence. A protego deals with mundane physical forces so there shouldn't any issues defending against them. The only is issue is with A-Train and Homelander who are fast enough to make killing them difficult, though they still don't pose a threat to Voldemort. But Voldemort can teleport or employ methods to slow them down. All Voldemort needs is some basic intelligence on where the seven are and the motivation to go after them.

*** 1. Apparation doesn't work cross-continents. Also, its kind of tricky to use in-combat, as you could splinch/kill yourself. Most people forget that. I also believe the more you use it, the greater the risk of splinching.
2. Invisibility cloaks other than Harry's work more like Fallout's Stealth Boys. They only allow partial invisibility.
3. Just from a storytelling perspective, it's a better story if the Seven are an actual threat.
4. Magical shields don't block light, so Homelander could kill every wizard in the room easily.
5. It would make sense that in this world, Compound V is at least partially magical.

PS: I have an idea for a plot-twist I'd like to throw at you. Hermione in this story is in fact secretly a Supe, having been given Compound V when she was a baby. Her powers are 10 times as strong as Homelanders. She was intended to be Vought's fail-safe if Homelander ever went rogue, hiding in the last place anyone would think to look. She plays a similar role to Black Noir in the original comics, taking polyjuice to look like Homelander and committing horrible atrocities. At the climax, everyone finds out about her secret, and she tries to kill Butcher and Homelander, along with her former friends. In the end, she is defeated by Ron aparating her into the sun, along with himself. Not sure about it being her though, but it would be the last thing any reader would suspect.

**** 1. I listed Voldemort specifically because he and Dumbledore are capable of apparition in combat without splinching. I do not believe that either Homelander or A-train are fast enough to cross an entire continent with a speed that would beat instantaneous transportation. If one needs to transport themselves to the same continent as their target, they can employ other means of magical transportation. I checked against the books for everything I have provided about HP canon.
2. I refer not to an invisibility cloak but to a disillusionment charm performed by a wizard at Dumbledore's level which can grant invisibility.
3. Fair enough, but the default assumption I always operate with is to assume the canon unless specified otherwise.
4. They block the conceptual threat of harm which includes light. There is no arbitrary rule in canon, as it would contradict the clear themes seen throughout the novel, that the shield charm can defend against magic, falls, physical forces, and suddenly be unable to defend against light which is known to be overriden by magic (like all other mundane forces). See, for example, the disillusionment charm which can be used to hide a campsite.
5. See 3.
6. It would certainly be a surprise twist and an interesting ending. It seems as if it would fit into the story you're seeking to write.

***** Well Voldemort is below Dumbledore, so disillusionment might not work.

Anyway, how can I make the Seven an actual threat so that Voldemort and what remains of the Death Eaters actually /want/ to work with The Boys?

I am thinking having Compound V be partially of magical origin. Like, it allows the Supe to endure magical attacks and even in the case of Homelander, see through invisibility spells/cloaks. Homelander and A-train, or even Maeve, could speed-blitz Voldemort and kill him instantly.

Homelander kills most of the Death Eaters and Order, and much of Wizarding Britian, prompting them both to join forces with the Boys, to kill Homelander and the Seven. Why did Homelander do this? Well, based on the plot-twist, I think you know the answer.

This requires the Boys(I call them that, since what reamins of the Order/Death Eaters are declared members of the Boys during the story),to use ingenuity and creativity to tackle the Seven, and the worlds population of supes. They succeed, for the most part, but after Hermione's betrayal, and Vought's attempted takeover of the world, most of the characters either end up dead or worse. At the end, only Starlight, Maeve, Hughie, Harry, and Ginny are left alive. Yes, it is THAT dark.

****** Note how in their duel Voldemort almost wins against Dumbledore who employs both the elder wand and Fawkes who saved Dumbledore's life. Voldemort was certainly Dumbledore's peer in canon when it came to magic, though he was most certainly not when it came to matters of being a good person.

#+begin_quote
  â€œI knew that Voldemort's knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power.

  Dumbledore on Voldemort in OotP.
#+end_quote

Changing compound V to be of magic origin would work to ensure that the seven pose a threat to wizards. Magic is the threat to magic in HP. The rest would follow from there. For a large organization of people cooperating to remain named "the Boys" seems unrealistic, however.

******* Ok, understood, Voldemort is quite powerful. But at the same time, he could still be pulped by Homelander. Homelander flies faster than an F-16, meaning that Voldemort's head would likely end up in Edinburgh if he were in England. As for the name.... First of all, regardless of who is in it, the team is still Butchers. He decides the name. Secondly, it actually provides a lot of cover for them. The Boys is a CIA black ops team. Their existance and scale is not known to anyone besides the CIA and the team itself. Calling it 'the boys' means no one has any idea that there are women in the group, or how many members it has. All in all, though, I think adding both sides to the mix shakes things up alot, both for the HP Characters and for the Boys characters. The Death Eaters have to work with muggles, their hated enemy. The Order have to work with their hated enemy. The Boys have to deal with two sides who hate each other, and one who hates them. But, eventually, the members of the team do gain some amount of respect for each other. Not friendship, just begrudging respect. Its over two years of working to kill Supes that it happens. Not overnight.

******** I mean, it's your prerogative to decide whether or not Homelander can beat HP magic in your fic, but in canon a shield charm is capable of protecting against Homelander. A fast collision is still a physical force which falls under the concept of harm. Voldemort can use a shield charm against a stunner, a shield charm against a fall, and he can use a shield charm against a flying person.

As to the name, that falls under your prerogative as the author of your story. I hold to my previous opinion about it.
