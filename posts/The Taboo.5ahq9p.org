The taboo is rarely mentioned in fics. Even in stories that are mostly canon compliant it doesn't seem to come up much. Are there any stories that use it in interesting ways? It seems like it would be tactically very useful for the good guys. They could set ambushes or apparate around the country pissing off snatchers and death eaters.

It also seems like it would make a useful 911 like system. Say a code phrase and the aurors show up. Another for if a kid does accidental magic in front of muggles and the obliviators show up. Maybe another for the accidental magic reversal squad.


** I used it as a code words for Aurors to ask for back up in the later stages of my fic, but it's not on all the time - you have to go and ask for it to be placed on you in preparation for a big job, so it doesn't end up getting accidentally triggered. linkffn(The Aurors by Floreatcastellum)

As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

** I'd say it functions similar to the Trace. The accidental magic squad probably relies on that more than taboo on a word, they would have to have a lot of Taboo words for that to be effective. It is rarely used, and honestly I thought it was Darker magic, but I would attribute that more to how it was used in canon.

** To me in would seem more useful for a thief or infultrator if they needed to make a quick escape. Use the taboo to bring down the wards then portkey away
