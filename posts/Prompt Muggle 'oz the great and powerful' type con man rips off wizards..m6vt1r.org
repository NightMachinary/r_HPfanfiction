The setting:

Modern day, The price of gold has been on the rise, and with it come the opportunists. Conmen, dirty bastards from all walks of life, out to make a dishonest buck.

The premise:

Muggle reatives of magicals and disowned squibs band together to stick it to uptight magicals in the con of the centry. They will seperate thouse elitist wizards from their valuable gold. Using advanced modern stage lighting and pyrotechnics, cosmetics and a wand shaped flashlight, our heroes fake magical vows and impersonate goblin debt collectors, all for a quick buck.


** linkffn(Dangerous and Deadly Lord Voldemort by Kevin3) doesn't really fit your prompt, but it has a similar concept, so you might enjoy it.

  A tale of illusion and deception - what better bedtime story could a magician tell his son than when he managed to pull one over on the entire wizarding world?
