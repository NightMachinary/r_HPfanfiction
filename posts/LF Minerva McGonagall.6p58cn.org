#+begin_quote
  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

  Back in 1942, the trio of McGonagall, Pomfrey and Hooch first walked the corridors together, forging friendships that would last for all their lives. Faced with misfired curses, dragon pox, Quidditch-related mayhem and Slytherin's monster, they'll need all of Minerva's quick intelligence, Poppy's incredible knowledge, and Rolanda's reckless daring to get them through in one piece.

** YAS McGonagall is my fav. Check out linkffn(a call to arms by mydearprofessormcgonagall). It's a Hogwarts Year 7 fic which features the story from Ginny's POV in the first 3rd, then POV switches to McG for the second third. Then it hops around to all different characters in the end. Or if you're solely looking for McG, the story linkffn(the sleepwalkers by mydearprofessormcgonagall) is an excerpt chapter that's mostly standalone and features her badassery. Really anything by the author mydearprofessormcgonagall on ffn.net is really good. Her story linkffn(great deeds by mydearprofessormcgonagall) is 100 snippets from McG's life from birth onward and is amazing. There is also a sequel! linkffn(the house cup by mydearprofessormcgonagall) is also some short McG fun.
