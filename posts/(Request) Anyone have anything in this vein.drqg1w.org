  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

*** The concept of this story makes no sense. Why does getting venom and blood in his eyes harm Harry when there's a literal Phoenix right there that was capable of healing a LARGE amount of the most lethal venom in existence from his blood AND a large gaping wound left by a fang the size of his fist? There's no chance the Phoenix couldn't heal that shit right up. If not, then Harry wouldn't be blind. He'd be dead. There is no reason for a middle-ground between those two options when "most deadly venom" is involved. Might be an okay story, but the premise makes me have to give it a hard pass as nonsense.

****** I love that you're discussing my story... and DeDe_at_it_again, thank you so much for the lovely, long and detailed review. I'm working on a response. I'll definitely go back to this part of the story (about how Harry was blinded) and make sure that I explain it better when I edit it.

So, before Fawkes' tears were applied to the wound in his arm, Harry's vision was fading in canon while he was dying. In my story, not only is he pierced by the fang in his arm, he also gets blood and venom directly in his eyes. Fawkes cries on the arm wound right away and that goes into his blood and saves his life, but damage occurs directly in his eyes as well and that damages his optic nerve. The damage is done by the time Harry asks Fawkes to cry into his eyes.

  Severus lives in a constant state of exasperation, and this state is heightened by the shenanigans of his best friend Lily and his tiny, evil shadow, Regulus. Werewolves find love, Slytherins stay sneaky, and nobody will listen to Sirius! What's a man got to do to be heard!?Don't ask Severus, he's just along for the ride.

Also, I definitely stay away from anything to do with harems.
