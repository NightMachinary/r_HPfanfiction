*** Cytomegalovirus according to Google.

Somehow I don't think this is what OP is going for.

***** Probably because the OP didn't give any reason as to why Harry/Hermione and Harry/Daphne are boring ships. If the OP did, then this thread most likely wouldn't be that silly and we could have a clear discussion of boring ships vs. non-boring ships (all based on opinion, of course).

***** Because I'm not here to try and 'change anyone's view' on fics. People like what they like. I don't care what they read, and no one should care what I read.
