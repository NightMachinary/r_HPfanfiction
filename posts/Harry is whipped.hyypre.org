** Define whipped in this scenario because it usally has to do with ones significant other and if you are suggesting a harry/umbridge I would kindly ask you to go and never come back

*** "Once more, please, Professor," Harry asked.

Umbridge raised an eyebrow, "Are you asking for another strike from my whip Mr. Potter? Do you enjoy punishment?"

"Only when it comes from your smooth hands, Professor,"

"Are you being truthful now? I don't allow for naughty liars in this office,"

"Of course I am! You see, Dolores, I must not tell lies. So I have to say, yours are the most tender lips I have ever felt. I would take a dozen whips for one kiss."

"So be it then," Umbridge said, pursing her lips upwards.

***** "Why do you even do this to you?" asked Ron.

As Harry bit his lips, he used his two hands to make as if carrying two heavy air melons.

"Really? Because it doesn't seem like--"

"It's the layers of clothing, Ron. I swear to you, I could use each cup of that pink lace bra as a hat. I had, sometime." he smirked.

"You sicken me."

******* Hermione comes in, "What are you two talking about. One of those long Quidditch conversations?"

"Well, it was more big than long," Ron said.

"And perky, very perky conversation. Rosy pink conversation," Harry added daydreaming.

"Whatever... As long is it is not Umbridge, It's alright," Hermione said, "Merlin, I can't stand that woman!"

"She is very..." Harry started.

"Hellish?"

"Insufferable?"

"Congruent," Harry said.

"Congruent? How so?" Hermione asked.

"Well, she has this... how do I say it. All around pinkness to her. And is not only on the outfit you see of her..."

"I reckon she does like pink," Hermione replied thoughtfully, as Ron looked greenish at her side. "But... congruent is hardly just clothing---"

"Her personality is congruent as well. In a way, you can say the carpet matches the drapes," Harry ventured with a mischievous smile.

Hermione looked puzzled, as Ron excused himself, for he had had enough of that conversation.

*********** "I'm telling you, Ron, the cats on the walls were too distracting. I almost lost the mood," Harry said as they made their way to Potions class.

"I told you I didn't want details."

Harry seemed not to hear him, "It was intense though. Sweaty. Moist and squishy too, like a toad actually."

"Quidditch practice again?" Hermione asked.

"Sort of. It was definitely exhausting. Had to keep a good grip of the broom..."

Hermione raised an eyebrow as she went on to her desk.

"You prick," Ron said. "She doesn't get what you're talking about."

"And what are you talking about in my class. If you please be so kind to share, Mr. Potter." said Snape.

"Oh nothing, professor. I was just telling Ron about my detention with Professor Umbridge last night."

"I imagine you earned that one," sneered Snape.

"Oh, yes. But she did punish me, Professor. It's all good now. She got me scrubbing an old pink cauldron all night,"

Ron almost hit his head when he realized no one understood what his friend was on about.

************* "I asked you not to bring her here," Ron said to his best man.

"She's my girlfriend, and this is a wedding. Who was I supposed to bring? Rit Skeeter?" Harry complained.

"You know what mate? You might think that sounds like way more awful than this, but it doesn't really."

"Oh, come on, Ron."

"It's Dolores fucking Umbridge, Harry!" Ron shouted, "You brought Dolores Umbridge to my wedding!"

"You said I could bring a date,"

"Not her! It's Hermione's wedding too! And people are telling me Umbridge kept mumbling '/Here comes the Mudblood, here comes to Mudblood/' through the entire bridal march!"

"Well, it sounds bad if you say it like that!"

"And how did it sound to you?"

"Oh forget it. She's happy because I announced that she's officially my girlfriend, and that's all that matters," Harry said, "Besides, I'm so getting it tonight!" he said giddily.

"IT. IS. MY. WEDDING!"

"And what? It's not like you and Hermione have the monopoly on sex or whatever. Besides, we already had a head start, earlier, on the banquet table!"

Ron was dumbfounded, "YOU WHAT?! I ate from there already!"

*************** "Severus Doloroso Potter, you were named after two heads of Hogwarts. One was your mother, and the kinkiest woman in the sack one could find." Harry said, to his toad-like son.

On the other side of the station, Ron was talking to his daughter, "Whatever you do Rosie, don't get involved with Potter. I would rather you to get with Scorpius Malfoy!"

"But dad, Doloroso is just the hottest boy around!"
