I also remember (but might be mixing it up with a different fix) that Harry can pop to different places like elves can but he can stay in the "void". He's not able to hear anything but sets up a dictaquill to write down what people are saying.


** I can't remember if he used the elf version of apparition in this story but he did use house elf magic to fix his firebolt in chapter six... White Knight, Grey Queen by Jeconais.

*** I just skimmed the rest of the chapter and he does use elf apparition in this story. Hope it's the one you were looking for!
