now exactly what i mean here is that it would be your typical indie Harry story, only that it's from the point of view of his love interest, and they aren't happy about it.

they can be an OC or an SI, potentially even a reincarnate from our lovely little world, or even someone like Hermione or who ever you want it to be.
