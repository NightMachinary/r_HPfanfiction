  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** As far as I know there is only 1 blind Harry story that is remotely good and recommended consistently and thats Blindness which someone recommended already.

This is a list I stumbled across a while back that has "Handicapped Harry" stories on FF.net

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Handicapped-Harry/32134/]]

Its got a few blind ones but no idea how good they are.
