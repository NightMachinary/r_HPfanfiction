:END:
more specifically a harry potter fic where harry as a Metamorphmagus has been changing his/her shape, look and sex since he/she was born, as such harry as he/she grows up doesn't see him/herself as male or female and because of this change back and forth between genders and his various looks as he/she changes his moods and his feelings.

- as far as his attractions go don't really mind what it is, he could be straight, gay or bisexual


** This rather long one shot from a collection somewhat fits your request. It's titled "The Chameleon." Harry uses his metamorphic powers and a time turner to almost give himself MPD.

**** You used the wrong flair then. "What's that fic" is used to identify fics you've forgotten the name of. You're looking for "requests" or "prompts".

  Al doesn't suit her at all. She wants a name like Lily's so everyone will know exactly who she is, what she is, see that she belongs too.

#+begin_quote
  Teddy Lupin---orphan, metamorphmagus, former Head Boy, grocery-store clerk---has no idea what he wants to do with his life. He's not sure who he is, or even what he'll see when he looks in the mirror. The people around him are growing up, but he's stuck and confused---for one, why is he suddenly attracted to James? When Teddy finds out he has a half sister sixteen years his senior, he and James set out to find out the details of Teddy's father's past, uncovering an intense relationship between Remus and Sirius. As Teddy's assumptions about family disintegrate and re-form around him, Teddy must learn that growing up is as much about accepting the present as it is accepting the past.
