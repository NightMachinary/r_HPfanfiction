Do you think Lily was spelled or given some potion so that she couldn't forgive Severus? Was she compelled to end her friendship with him?


** Snape “simply” calling her a Mudblood o_O

Snape, by that point, had all but joined a hate group dedicated to the eradication of her very existence. Even if he didn't call her a racist hate slur she is perfectly within her rights to stop being friends with him based on that.

** I honestly can't believe this is a serious question. No, I don't think Lily was spelled or given a potion.

I think she cut ties with Snape when she had no other choice. Hewas aligning himself with a group who advocated for her murder. Seems like a fairly simple choice to make

** In real world equivalent, Snape turned his back on his best Jewish friend and joined the Nazi SS instead.

It goes way beyond simple HS drama.

Besides, James Potter had significantly changed in his later Hogwarts years.

*** But if I'm not mistaken, Snape wasn't actually a Death Eater at the time. If you think about it, he ended up in the Dark Side because he had no other option. He was raised in an abusive household, treated like trash by the so called Light side and rejected by his former best friend... I mean, I wouldn't want to fight along people that have bullied me my whole life. If someone from the other side offers me power, knowledge and some form of alliance, I would gladly accept the offer

You would sign up to kill innocent people in exchange for knowledge? Literally wtf is wrong with you. Not to mention that it wasn't the Muggleborns that bullied Snape, it was the 4 Marauders, two of which were purebloods. Great logic there.

***** Of course I wouldn't kill innocent people. You know? I didn't think of it at the moment I wrote that. I just try to put myself in his shoes. He would be happy to kill any of the Marauders if he could or simply those from the Light side that made his life miserable. Would you like to fight along people that almost killed you? Depending on how much he wanted it, he could have simply join the other side for revenge. It's just my theory.

Just to clarify this, I'm not saying any of the sides are good. They both have some level of evilness. Personally, I think that the best thing Snape could have done was becoming Neutral in the war and/or leaving the country to focus on his career as a Potion Master.

Or, get this, he could choose not to join either side.

  treated like trash by the so called Light side

He was treated like trash by his peers. It wasn't Albus Dumbledore, Alastor Moody, Caradoc Dearborn, or anyone else in the Order bullying Snape, it was other teenagers.

  rejected by his former best friend
#+end_quote

After he called her a slur and associated himself with soon to be Death Eaters that wanted to exterminate people like her. Hmm, I wonder why she would reject him.

So you would become a blood supremacist and join a violent hate group just because a couple of Gryffindors bullied you?

** I mean, from an actual reading of the text it's damn clear that it was the straw which broke the camel's back. Especially when you consider that the list of names that Lily mentioned were Snape's friends basically is a list of Voldemort Youths.

James matured out of being a dick, while Snape was unpleasant and just got worse over time.

** There is so much wrong with this.

- James didn't treat Lily like property. I've seen classmates who are more possessive of people they're trying to go out with. In fact, Snape is probably more possessive of Lily.
- Mudblood is the magical equivalent of the n-word. there is a difference between persistently asking someone out and calling your best friend a racial slur
- the Mudblood event was the last straw. Canonically, Lily just gets tired of defending Snape when he doesn't care too much for her
- your description reads like a bad marauder bashing fic

** I love Snape, but it was more than that. Snape was going down a wrong path. I understand why he was going down it...why would one join their bullies?? but still, she was a Gryffindor who only saw black and white. It wasn't him calling her a mudblood, it was the other things, though she could have been more understanding.

** It was already frayed when the courtyard conversation happened. Swm was the last breaths really. She's already attracted to James even in swm, and her only hang-up was James' bullying. Once he seemingly stopped, she accepted

It's easier to forgive something that was not directed towards you. James never bullied Lily, so it was just a character flaw that could be changed. Snape had wronged her personally, so it was more difficult to forgive.
