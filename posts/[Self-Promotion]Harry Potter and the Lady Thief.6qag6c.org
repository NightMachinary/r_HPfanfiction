With [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined]["Divided and Entwined"]] now complete (after 67 chapters and over 600K words), I started a new story, inspired by [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-ideas-discussion-and-recs-thread-ninth-times-the-charm.305865/page-865#post-22088113][a prompt]] from CG99:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]]

It is set in an alternate Universe. A number of canon events didn't happen or happened differently. The society of Wizarding Britain is a bit different and a number of characters will act differently as well.

** I'm not sure if you want constructive critism as you didn't ask for it. If you don't, then disregard my post.

I haven't read anything by you yet so this chapter is my introduction to your writing. After reading the above comments I expected the writing to have a bunch of issues but it is competant and enjoyable. The arguments laid out in the above criticisms seem as if pulled out of thin air. The plot is strong as this is how a corrupt society with extreme prejudices towards an underclass functions. The Grangers can and would be sued in a civil court for the actions of their minor daughter in our own world, so it's not out of bounds to happen in HPs world.

This chapter as a set up to the story is dynamic and most importantly, has me INTERESTED in what comes Next which is the entire goal of a first chapter.

I have some feedback on the opening scene with Mundagus Fletcher. This scene is the intro and sets the tone for the believability of the rest of the characterizations. I feel that the switch was flipped too fast on MFs loyalties. Losing your family is traumatic but this is war and MF knew what he was signing up for, after all he is a sneaky cynical basted who can read situations well enough to get in and out of trouble easily. As such, he would have known the possible outcomes of being aligned with Dumbledore, one of which was losing his family. In order to make me believe that this was the last straw for MF I need some indication that there were cracks in his loyalty before the evening of the murders like broken promises or notes of dissension about DDs inability to keep members safe. There are notes of dissatisfaction from MF for being Dumbledores personal thief but someone of MFs occupation would be accustomed to scorn so that isn't really the prior indication that would trigger my belief that Mundagus has reached his final straw. There are many other facets to a thiefs character that makes the scene a little thin but the above may be enough to highlight what I am experiencing as a reader.

The other thing I noticed, and I conceded it may be a personal preference, is the pacing between Hermione's arrest and MFs appearance. I wanted it to move faster. AS I stated I haven't read any of your work before so there may be purpose to this in the tone and function of your stories so my opinion my not hold water. There was duplication of information given and I also felt that the Harry and Ron scenes seem superfluous since this is a story about HG.

Overall, excellent chapter and I look forward to more.

*** Thanks! With regards to Fletcher's defection, as I see it, the loss of his family was the one and only reason - this Fletcher, as the next chapters should show, was not a cynical bastard, but was a "gentleman thief" working for Dumbledore because he opposed the Death Eaters. It wasn't a final straw, but a sudden massive blow - similar to Sirius's reaction to the Potters' demise - and he lashed out at Dumbledore because Albus was there, and he wanted to blame someone. I don't think such a breakdown is implausible, even without prior build-up (other than the stress of being in a war), since losing your family - finding your wife and daughter brutally murdered - can and does break people. (Like the scene in Gladiator, as far as I remember the main character has a similar breakdown.) With regards to the pacing, the story is planned to focus on Harry and Hermione, with each chapter starting with the POV of a different third character, so showing Harry's reaction was important.

** No offence to you or your stories, For some reasons, I never get into your stories. Probably because for a long time, more than two-three years, I have stopped reading Hermione centric or Hermione as a main character stories. If it was another character, say it was Penelope Clearwater or Lavender Brown, I would have more chances to read Divided and Entwined.

Just bored of all the OCs (I don't consider characters like Greengrass, or Clearwater as anything but OCs - they lack any characterisation in canon, and Lavender hasn't much more in that area) or the Harry-centric stories where he gets the author's dream girl of choice.

***** SF5 likes to throw his chacaters in tough situations that require smart and decisive action - and Hermione thrives in those.

It's wonderfully easy to use her to give exposition (Rowling and SF5 both so this) and you can develop her easily as a character in different directions as she is very flexible.

See: Year one "killed, or worse expelled" vs. year two "let's steal from Snape because the teacher don't know shit".

You can use her in different ways, and that makes her very easy to write, even with her personality intact. I once heard someone describing her as "walking plot device" - and to an extent that's true.

And she doesn't have any traits that make most readers hate her: Laziness, Stupidity, she isn't overly emotionaly - but she still has flaws. She is easy to relate to.

So in a way she's easy-ish to write well (contrast: Dumbledore or even Ron) and quite versatile while being a likeable character.

  walking plot device
#+end_quote

I believe I said that a couple times, and it's not in the good way. Being a walking plot device means you have no real qualities other than exposition, which can easily be done with the main character. Having someone like Hermione to me, just means the author is too lazy to have Harry do research and go down a slope of learning and understanding.

#+begin_quote
  she isn't overly emotionaly
#+end_quote

Definitely not, it's not like she sends Magical Birds to attack someone because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, or using emotional black mail against her contemporaries when she doesn't get her way, or what about the time she started SPEW which was based on emotion moreso than actual facts?

I don't think this applies to Hermione. I agree it applies to Snape, but she tries to do the right thing throughout the series. (DA, House-Elves, Supporting Harry in the Triwiz, Helping saving the PS, Helping with the Horcruxes, ...)

So that is definitely unfair to say about her.

I think you need a serious fucking re-read of canon if that's what you think.

#+begin_quote
  “Our short-term aims,” said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than Ron, and acting as though she hadn't heard a word, “are to secure house-elves fair wages and working conditions. Our long-term aims include changing the law about non-wand use, and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, because they're shockingly underrepresented.”
#+end_quote

She *never* talks about freeing them, but giving them rights. And Ron's fucking argument is:

#+begin_quote
  “Hermione --- open your ears,” said Ron loudly. “They. Like. It. They like being enslaved!”
#+end_quote

Yeah, that was the argument that was made before even with humans. And you know what? We see three house-elves outside of Hogwarts.

- One wants to be free (Dobby)
- One is mistreated (Winky) and punished cruelly.
- One disobeys his master every single chance he gets, and even gets him killed. (Kreacher)

That isn't a good record. If you saw Dobby and Winky - wouldn't you think it's right to fight to give elves like Dobby the *choice* to go free? Shouldn't Winky have the right to refuse to follow an order that makes her scared for he life? Should she, after years of long service simply be forced on the street?

Even if you disagree with me here, try to see Hermione's perspective and you'll notice that she isn't a crazy bitch. Maybe not perfect in the way she approached it, but who is? She's fourteen / fifteen.

****** Does she? I always thought that Hermione was the long term planing and research arm of the team, while Ron was kind of for entertainment and Harry was the good samaritan who is also great at thinking on his feet in tought situations (I kind of picture Hermione as freezing when fighting (at least at first!) because she can't decide which of her many spells to use (for the best outcome), while Harry with his smaller selection just uses what works!)

ps: Does she really have flaws? Except for social ineptness (being a bossy know-it-all who thinks most people are stupid (at least that's probably how many others would describe her canon behaviour - and I am not talking about us, but her fellow students!)), a vindictive streak (the cursed parchment) and some insecurities...I am talking about real flaws like Harry's rushing blindly into things or Ron's general laziness...I'd say her flaws are MINOR (and she'll outgrow them in time...sadly Rowling didn't give her much character development)

******** One very great sum-up of Hermione that displays both her best quality and her worst quality: "She's great at giving advice, but not so good at taking advice."

That I think is Hermione's biggest flaw: She wants people to listen to her, but isn't very good at listening to them in return. If they say something she doesn't like or disagrees with, she ignores them and just carries on. She's narrow-minded, she has problems accepting that other people's viewpoints can be valid, and she's really bad at thinking outside the box.

In short, Hermione's so used to being the smartest person around, the one who knows the most and who has the answers, that she just assumes that anyone who tells her differently is wrong.

** I have to say I saw this, read the first chapter, and put it on my 'don't need to track list'.

Your entry into your world is very rough. I recall this being the case in Patron as well, but you ended up going back and flushing out a lot of the details.

In particular, the setup of things going bad early seems off without explanation. You basically needed Hermione impoverished and forced into a situation for her to become a thief, but to do so you had to turn down so many seeming... more in character options.

I mean, I would think Hermione and her parents would react to this like "You did what? Well we're just gonna take off for Austrialia/The America's. Screw wizarding Britain"

You scrapped with the interesting notion of familial debt, but don't really explain it. I could possibly see familial debt in a more primitive wizarding society that hasn't had some of the modern worlds legal reforms, but that would have to be explained.

Honestly (and I hate to say this), i feel like this might have been better as a WW!Hermione fic. That would explain her being thrown out of Hogwarts, the refusal to let her go back to the Muggle world, her parents inability to support her, and put her in a place you could see her working within the wizarding world's unofficial doors when the official doors close. And it would have avoided the whole 'conspiracy of everyone at Hogwarts', which is both a massive unexplained plot point and massive divergence.

Cause honestly the setup you have now feels more like "I'm gonna go back muggle and study and become the prime minister and get the nukes and nuke you all too hell' rather than what you are going for.

*** You can't easily outrun the wizards and Gringotts by moving to Australia or the Americas. Especially not when you're already in finanical trouble, and people are moving to collect.

The parents were held liable for Hermione's actions. That wouldn't hold up in a muggle court, but since in Wizarding Britain, the Wizengamot is the supreme court, no one really cared about what the muggles thought. Or what the law said when it came to dealing with an uppity mudblood.

I have no idea what a "WW!Hermione" is.

Basically, the chapter shows that in this AU, bigots are in charge, and that there is no justice to be had for a mudblood if the rich old families take offence at her being better at magic than their own kids.

But to be honest, I don't exactly understand why anyone would expect the Wizarding Judicial system to work as a muggle court would - the examples in canon we have show a corrupt travesty of justice where rules and laws are easily bent and broken, and the Minister can order a prisoner executed without trial. How that translates into "they wouldn't do that to Hermione!" I can't fathom.

**** As Lam said, Werewolf Hermione. It is an overused trope usually used to ship Hermione!Lupin, I was just saying having something that would stop her from returning to the Muggle world, like a magical ailment. Actually, I think any explanation would do, even if its just the court ordered it to be spiteful. It feels like you want to put her into a catch 22 (A situation where she has no good way out), and I hadn't felt like that situation was explained.

Or rather, It felt like what was being gone for is "Hermione is trapped in bad situation with no way out", but simple "Expelled from Hogwarts and losing all her family money" was not enough to feel like she was in such a situation.

Maybe if it was "With a huge goblin-enforced debt she has to pay back, which requires her to work instead of going to school, condemning her to a life of drudgery", then it would have worked. Because then she would be in a 'no win' situation where taking the third option is in character, which kinda felt like what you were going for. Or perhaps something where every 'legal' source of income she procures will be seized, even those in the muggle world. But just from what was said, I didn't see it.

(The wizaridng court taking everything from her wasn't the part that bothered me, although I did feel it was under developed. It was more the last section that felt like they needed more fleshing out)

I honestly wouldn't have blinked an eye at "Hermione accused of a crime and racked with debt, taken by Goblins to the salt mine to work off her debt". But I balked at the setup here. It felt like it was missing something.

I'd note that it'd work with Harry without much additional setup: Say he is removed from the Wizarding world and forced to live with the Durdsleys for the rest of his existence, you can easily imagine him jumping on anything offered. But with the other characters, it needs more explanation. /shrug/

The family situation was a single line, and I easily saw "Stripped of everything by the wizarding world' part fitting, but not the ongoing impact of that. It wasn't clear how just stripping them of everything they owned removed them from being their for Hermione. Perhaps an ongoing responsibility forced on them because of this would, but...

I guess I just felt something was skipped over :). Not exactly sure what.

And on that note the following was just because it was fun to type out, not that it relates to your story:

At first I thought you were going for the notion of more familia/clan shared responsibility (something they do have in some areas of the world), which would have been interesting It doesn't really fit with how the wizarding world had been portrayed so far, which depicts wide families with weird (and often disgraced) offshoots. Parental shared responsibility is a bit narrower, but honestly, doesn't really fit with the feudal character of the wizarding world. It would kind of break the system of structured feudal inheritance if the spurred offspring could hang his actions on that of his inheriting sibling.

Edit: But don't take it too hard, I saw your story before work and didn't give it too deep of a read It was a light read and the hook just didn't grab it that is all. I'm sure i'll give it another try once there is more uploaded :).

***** I think there is a misunderstanding here, maybe based on other stories where people are banished from the Magical World: Hermione isn't banished from the Wizarding World. Her wand was snapped, yes - but she can get another one. She isn't banned from going to another school (but that costs money she currently doesn't have). She can visit Diagon Alley whenever she wants. She might be ostracised, but that's a social repercussion, not a legal consequence.

The main thing is that she was framed, hurt, her reputation and finances ruined, and she wants revenge for that.

Her parents are a trickier subject. Since Hermione is the cause for their ruin, so to speak, they are not too happy with her (if Hermione hadn't embarrassed Draco and co, this wouldn't have happened), and Hermione does feel guilty about that, and probably exagerrates the issues in her view. But they can't do that much for her anyway - she's a witch, and she's not about to give up magic for anyone. I might stress that more in a future chapter. But ultimately, both from a Watsonian and a Doylist perspective, the Grangers are not going to be very important. Hermione won't listen to them if they try to make her abandon the Wizarding World, and they can't force her.

I also didn't think I need to point out that every legal source of income will be seized - that's how debts are collected, after all, in my work experience in that area: The debtor keeps enough to live, and the rest goes to the creditors.

****** Ahh, well maybe that is what I am rubbing up against:

It feels pretty contrary to Hermione's character to bulk authority like that, particularly young Hermione. She is generally portrayed as being particularly authority deferential. It plays into her bookworm status. She certainly doesn't start out as a 'rebel'. It feels like a more natural reaction for her would be to retreat to the muggle world / other wizarding world and go study there, and then come back to give her comeuppance to Wizarding Britain.

I would liken it to: "A character decides to run off and join the circus". This is something you can see a character like Harry do without too much issue, but someone like Ron (Lazy, Tight family) or Hermione (Bookworm, not particularly rabble-rousing), you are gonna need a story for how they got in the situation, because it doesn't feel natural :P.

Her take such a rash and independent stand doesn't float well with her character, so in order to do it you have to either A) Redefine her character differently from Canon or B) Get her in a situation where she this is the only viable choice.

At least how you presented things I was getting the vibe more from B than from A (its presented as after-the-fact, every indication these are canon-personality characters and just 'different things happened to them' rather than 'what if character X had a different personality trait').

But, I felt that you hadn't really eliminated other 'more likely' paths she would take. I mean, if Hermione had the option to go study magic in France, she would take it long before deciding to study Thievery.

Edit: Story details I thought were interesting that I should expand on:

i1. Debt and its consequences: I had assumed from reading it that the debt was going to be part of an on-going burden for Hermione. Obviously you can imagine the Wizarding world seizing everything they own, but that just doesn't seem dire enough to cause the reaction you are going for. A good portion of the value in being something like a Dentist is what is in your head. While that background seems to support something like 'Hermione can't go to school because of tuition expenses', it doesn't really feel like it would support the breakup of her family or a sudden personality change on her part.

Now an ongoing burden would do that, but that is what I felt had to be explained. The stress of something like "Got to get together a payment or the goblins will come and enslave her and her family as repayment" is a great way to put characters in a tough position. Since the wizarding world tends to be explained as being out of date, they wouldn't have something like wage garnishment and bankruptcy, relatively recent legal concepts. Plus, it would have to be something that fits in their system of 'noble families' and such (I've seen this one done a few times)

i2. Family: It feels a bit out that after losing everything her family wouldn't come together over it. Drama and resentment? Sure, but Hermione is portrayed as having a loving family, so its hard to imagine them not coming together. And its hard to imagine them blaming their 11 year old daughter over 'the crazy wizarding world' for that. I mean, they let their daughter go to a boarding school, and suddenly she is put upon by the system and they get dragged through the mud too, all in a way that would be completely unacceptable in the muggle system? It feels like it should be a lot more 'how dare those bastards do that to our Hermione" than "Hermione, how could you do this?".

Now, there are ways to make this interesting: Having them struggle with being powerless and impotent to stop it, particularly a system that would seem patently unfair to muggle eyes, could easily be used as drama to damage a relationship. Having something held over them 'if Hermione doesn't do this then you will be taken and sold to pay off the debt' is also a great way to cause it, as the situation of 'our 11 year old daughter has our life in her hands' would be enough to cause many a parent distress.

So yea, I guess 'your daughter messed up at magic academy now we are going to destroy you' feels like it should produce a much more protective parental reaction than resentment to Hermione.

Or another interesting way around it would be to have them not involved because the wizarding world forced a choice on Hermione. Something like 'if they stand by you, they lose everything, but if they disown you and keep contact with you to a minimum (you are only allowed one letter a year or something), then they will be immune' That sets up a situation where Hermione would force them down that path because of how she cares for them. Even if her parents wouldn't blame her for them taking everything they owned, Hermione would still want to do what is best for her family. And then resentment would make perfect sense: They could resent her because she forced them to not share her burden with her and lose their daughter, even if the crappy situation was being forced on her from without.

******* I really don't know why there is this clichee that Hermione worships authority. In her first years she lied to teachers after the troll incident, set a teacher on fire, and paralysed a student so she could break curfew to stop a teacher from stealing - after the deputy headmaster had told her all was well. In her second year, her plan to solve a problem involved brewing a potion with ingredients stolen from a teacher to impersonate students who would be drugged. She went against every single authority in the Wizarding World to fight for house-elves. She founded an illegal study group to fight a Ministry-backed teacher. If Hermione meets a rule she doesn't like, she breaks it. That is her constient mode of operation. She gives lip service to authorities - and that's all. Calling Snape "Professor Snape" means nothing when she will set him on fire whenever she thinks it's needed.

I also disagree about her not being rabble-rosuing - of all the students, she is the most likely to rose rabble, if maybe not too successfull at it. Although she was the backbone of the DA, and started it using Harry, so she got better at that as well.

With regards to Beauxbatons, she lacks the money to pay for tuition there.

Edit: With regards to Hermione's parents, they are not really explored in canon at all - we don't even know their first names. And as muggles, they can't really do much in the magical world, which means they'll not play much of a role. The debt is ongoing in the sense that it's not going away until paid. That's generally how debts are handled, after all.That^{ll} be shown a bit more in chapter 3.

******* Hermione was never truly rule-abiding or authority-worshipping. Instead, she used rules and authorities to push her own agenda and cause (from forcing her friends to study to keep other students in line). But if those things stood in her way, she wouldn't hesitate for a moment to break them.

This combination of bravery, drive, intelligence, and ruthlessness made her a very dangerous person.

** I like your writing style and the premise of your works are generally interesting, but I would have to agree with the points that a lot of other people have made - piggyback off of their examples as it where; you set up circumstances that don't make a lot of sense. Rather, situations that require a suspension of disbelief surpassing the made-up magical and sometimes conflicting nature of the HP cannon.

At the same time, I think you write to play around with what may happen if a set of specific situations occur - giving the characters a reason to hate the world they live in. A justification, as it where, for their actions later on. While not optimal, the design choice is one that creates a real - though flawed - plot line which is enjoyable to follow and, while somewhat predictable, interesting enough to keep me and tens of thousands of other people coming back for more.

I look forward to seeing how your vision plays out.

*** I don't think "2" is a lot of people. I still don't see how anyone can expect a non-biased, well-working judicial system from the examples we see in canon. If your Minister can order an execution without trial, then that's pretty much a clear sign that there is no justice to be had.

I base a lot of my take on pureblood society on the Deep South ca. 1850 to 1940, with the Muggleborns in place of the African-Americans. Many hate that - they prefer to read about a nice society with just a few bad bigoted apples, not a deeply flawed, racist society. That's their preference. But I'll not turn my AU into a world where the judicial system works as it works in the modern western world. Hermione is not planning to prove her innocence and bring those who frame her to justice, as she would in such a world. She is planning to become a thief to get revenge because her trial has shown her that she cannot expect any justice.

**** Fair enough. My broad generalization of your following based on the opinions of a very small portion of a small portion of the people that read your works was out of place. Sorry.

I wasn't trying to fault you for looking at the world a different way, I'm not reading FanFiction to watch a victorious rehashing of cannon. I enjoy the setup of the original series; I've fallen in love with the characters and love experiencing the different perspective of those who choose to share. I may not agree with all of them, but that doesn't mean they are wrong... as hard as that is to say.

While your writing style may be a bit choppy and repetitive, I likely see it that way because I'm used to reading stories told from a first person point of view of a character that isn't really conflicted - or that has to develop as a person. As I said earlier, your characters change - your plot is mostly actual well flowing plot and not a series of thinly veiled plot devices.

Your a good writer and I'm bad at complimenting people without being cynical and pointing out what I think their flaws are. Err, /ShrugsAndLooksAwayAwkwardly/.

While I haven't done much research on history, it's not my favorite subject, the relationship between the slaves and the enslavers who once openly populated the US and a vast majority of the world is what I mentally mirrored the 'pureblood society' with. Though it is somewhat exaggerated at points, I'm fairly certain that is what JKR based the dynamic on. The fact that you are doing the same makes sense to me, as it's both relatable to the real world and something already in the cannon universe that can be expanded on.

I'm having trouble putting my interpretation of the society into words. I think that when you have a lot of people who think one way that is morally wrong, on a base level, it's either due to them being sheltered from the rest of the world or an entirely corrupt society. In the case of Magical Britain, I think it's both. With the Stature of Secrecy and the demeaning term of 'muggle' as well as the physical divide between the island and the rest of the world in the form of an - albeit easily crossed - ocean the Wizards have isolated themselves. I mean, you have families like the blacks who are inbred to the point where their tree is described as something akin to grotesque. It's hard to change habits when you don't know any better.

I guess I'm trying to say that I understand the point, you can expect something from a place that can't even begin to understand what you want from it.

** I'm sorry, but while the writing is good, I can't get over how badly thought out the plot was.

Lucius involved way too many people, several of them being pre-teen girls. That's just asking for it to blow up in his face. All it would take to expose it would be for his enemies to repeat the exact same maneuver he's retaliating over in the first place, or simply for one of those young girls to grow a guilty conscience and admit to being coerced into it. And then he goes and discredits her skills in the media via Skeeter which hurts his own case that she was indeed skilled enough to pull off the theft. Also the dorms are rather easy to sneak into or otherwise get an inside agent to plant the 'evidence,' and in such an obvious place it just beggars belief. And what are a bunch of underage witches doing at Hogwarts with all these expensive heirlooms anyway? Why do they all have one? They can't all be filthy rich. And if she was accused of selling them where is all the money from that?

Not to mention how Dumbledore failed to make any sort of push-back against what looked an awful lot like a mistrial what with not being informed of the charges. Also, could he not have procured some actual legal representation for her? If I can come up with so many holes in the prosecution's case in less than an hour certainly an actual lawyer would have the case in the bag.

As far as the expulsion goes, when Dumbledore says he would have to fight the Board on that it implies that theft is an expulsion-worthy act and with would only be his belief that she was framed going against it. That doesn't really make any sense in terms of appropriate levels of discipline. All examples of expulsion in canon (and most real life scenarios for that matter) either involve breaking the Statute of Secrecy or directly attacking students. Suspension should have been the appropriate punishment here. Board or not, he should have been able to argue for at least that much.

And shouldn't the fact that Lucius' previous plot had been revealed have had some sort of repercussions against him? Ones that would discredit this sort of follow up plot?

And then there's how everyone in the dorm jumps to the immediate conclusion that she's guilty despite her reputation. I get that this reflects the Heir of Slytherin thing but there's no parseltongue superstition muddling things up here.

And what about Harry? I know he agreed not to do anything rash that would get him in more trouble, but wouldn't he at least immediately offer to provide some monetary aid for his friend in need? And why would the Grangers sell their practice to pay the fines? Wouldn't it make more sense for them to take out a loan to pay the fines and then pay it back over time using their cushy dentist salary? For that matter how are dentists having a hard time paying off a fine for theft anyway?

And how the heck does Mundungus know where she lives?

*** To repeat Lucius's plot means you have to deal with the fact that the accused are family to influential Wizengamot members. It's easy to get a mudblood convicted, not so easy when it's the daughter of a good family. And a filthy rich family to boot - yes, the Old Families are that rich; it's the point of later robbing them. Where is the money? Her problem.

Dumbledore did make a pushback, but with the evidence as it was, he couldn't do that much. I don't know what kind of legal experience you have, but in my experience at a criminal court, "someone planted this in my trunk/jacket/flat" generally doesn't work without aditional evidence. Are you really trying to tell me that an African-American arrested with Crack in his jacket will get off when a rich white guy testifies against him? I don't think so. With regards to expulsion, a student who steals on that level as she was charged at would have to go in this story. YMMV, but here, it's certainly an expulsion level offence. And with Lucius on the board, Dumbledore can't do much. As I have said before - if stolen loot is found in your trunk, things are not looking good for you. Now add that she's a mudblood showing up everyone else, and you have a lot of purebloods supporting the assumption that she is guilty.

Harry isn't rich enough to pay her fines, and any money he'd pay would simply go towards paying the fine, and therefore be wasted.

Of course it would be smarter to let them keep the practice, but that's not the point - Lucius wants the mudblood's family ruined. Can't take a loan when you're already bankrupt, either - banks don't tend to do that. Mundungus was, as next chapter will show, informed by Dumbledore.

His arguments against harsh legal punishment ought to hold the same weight with regards to school punishments.

The prompt of Hermione getting shat on by the wizarding legal system and taking her revenge is not a bad one and you have the writing skill to pull it off. However, I think your story as it is ought to be thought out a bit more and revised. If anything, surely you could at least have Lucius be more competent and manufacture some more convincing evidence against her than testimony from children and a pawn broker and a planted necklace. How about some forged receipts? Knock her out in the halls and 'catch her in the act' with the evidence actually on her person. Fake a duel while you're at it so she actually hurt someone if you really want to justify expulsion. Maybe steal and plant Harry's cloak on her or something. Imperius her parents into blowing all their money on gambling so she has actual motive and they're unable to get a loan. Memory charm the students into actually believing the fabricated story so they can't fuck it up. The means are there and Lucius is a smart cold bastard. There's no reason for him to hold the idiot ball here and half-ass it after his last plot got exposed by school children.

She is not banished from society - she is expelled from the school. In theory, she can go to another school, or get private tutors.

Draco's plot got exposed by kids, not Lucius's plot. Lucius is a more competent plotter - but why would he need more convincing evidence, if what he has is more than enough? Part of the point of the chapter was to show that, yes, really, it doesn't take much to get Hermione framed. She is in a position similar to a black girl in the Deep South in the early 1900s accused by white rich girls. An open and shut case, no matter what really happened.

And I still don't get why you asusme that the judicial system would be better - from what we have seen in canon - and this is an AU - the judicial system in Wizarding Britain is corrupt, to the point that the Minister can order a man executed without trial.

Damn near anyone can come and go as they please without repercussion and any former Hogwarts student would know that. And Like I said before, Lucius could just as easily arrange for the evidence to be found on her person and it would be much more convincing, so I find it hard to believe he would choose the less effective option of the two given our assumptions of his competency.

#+begin_quote
  Banruptcy happens when you cannot pay what you owe. You don't have to actually have spent all your money already - it suffices if the debts due are above your available money. And the magicals don't give a shit about muggle laws and procedures, as shown in canon by how easily they obliviate people.
#+end_quote

I'm not contesting how little they care about muggles. I'm contesting their ability to actually go to the correct bank and extract their money. I never mentioned bankruptcy. Do wizards even have bankruptcy or do they still have debtor's prison? I wrote about how fines are paid and how they have means and opportunity to get the money before paying them.

#+begin_quote
  Uh, no - I don't have to explain that. I simply have to say that he is not rich enough to pay the fines. Either he has less money than in canon, or the fines and damages are too high.
#+end_quote

If I'm even asking this question then you kinda do. It's your job as the writer to communicate these things clearly in text.

#+begin_quote
  Draco's plot got exposed by kids, not Lucius's plot. Lucius is a more competent plotter - but why would he need more convincing evidence, if what he has is more than enough?
#+end_quote

Draco's plot? While you weren't very clear on which Malfoy organized that plot, just that Draco give up the info, the context implied that it was Lucius' AU substitute for the Chamber plot. If Lucius is a more competent plotter then /show/ that in the text. You shouldn't have to tell me that after the fact. If he's as competent as we both seem to think he is he would not have settled for 'just enough,' especially when he's up against Dumbledore. He would have covered every angle and we should /see/ that, not be informed of it later. Plot holes shouldn't have to wait to be filled in later. They just shouldn't exist in the first place, especially in the first chapter.

#+begin_quote
  Part of the point of the chapter was to show that, yes, really, it doesn't take much to get Hermione framed. She is in a position similar to a black girl in the Deep South in the early 1900s accused by white rich girls. An open and shut case, no matter what really happened.
#+end_quote

And my point is you can still do that without a bunch of glaring plot holes muddling things up. And if that black girl in your comparison had the president speaking in her defense like Hermione has Dumbledore it wouldn't be nearly so open and shut even if she does still end up convicted.

#+begin_quote
  And I still don't get why you asusme that the judicial system would be better - from what we have seen in canon - and this is an AU - the judicial system in Wizarding Britain is corrupt, to the point that the Minister can order a man executed without trial.
#+end_quote

I'm not questioning the corruption. I'm questioning your depiction of it. Lucius and Umbridge, unlike Fudge are clever about their corruption, they follow the letter of the law while spitting on the intent, and that's what makes them so dangerous. Fudge only gets away with being so obvious because he is such a useful puppet to the ones who are really in charge using him as as scapegoat for their corruption. Lucius would never do something so ham-fisted even if he could get away with it, it's just too risky and not his style.

And as far as the Sirius thing goes firstly, no one but out heroes knew he hadn't had a trial. Secondly, he was thrown in Azkaban without trial, execution only came years later when he escaped. Thirdly, Sirius is an exceptional circumstance what with the chaos surrounding Voldemort's downfall and his supposedly admitting his guilt at the scene of the crime so it's not a fair comparison.

EDIT: Missed a point.

#+begin_quote
  She is not banished from society - she is expelled from the school. In theory, she can go to another school, or get private tutors.
#+end_quote

That's not the effect of expulsion we see in canon. Everything in canon suggests that expulsion and wand snapping is a final act. If Hagrid could just get a new wand and go to another school then why didn't he? If Hermione has that option why does she think expulsion is a fate worse than death if it doesn't mean giving up magic forever? Why would they even bother with wand snapping if you are not somehow barred from just getting a new one?

  Uh, no, did you not read my first post? As it is now you can expose it the exact same way the previous plot was exposed. All you need to do is get one of the involved parties to talk by sneakily spiking their drink with veratasrum or guilt tripping them and the whole thing unravels. There are ways Lucius could prevent that, but there is nothing so far to show that he has. And that's not an opinion, its a logical conclusion based on available textual evidence. If you want it to be clear that that plot is not easy to expose then you as the writer need to make it so and "likely will explain it later" is not good enough. This is the first chapter, just about the worst place to leave a plot hole.
#+end_quote

Yeah, using Veritaserum, after that caused the whole mess - a really good idea. That's about as smart as Dumbledore openly using Legilimency on the girls. Who do you sacrifice to actually question the girl then? Because they will be sent to Azkaban for certain, for using Veritaserum.

  That's not how it appeared from what you wrote and that's what actually matters. If you want to convey that idea you need to do a better job of it. Even if a lawyer is unable to win her case, the mere absence of one makes it seem like Dumbledore didn't even try to help. If you really don't want her to have a lawyer you could at least give us a reason in text why that's the case rather than leave it a s a plot hole.
#+end_quote

In canon, Dumbledore was the one to defend Harry. We never saw any lawyers in canon at any trial. So... I don't think I actually need to point out why there are no lawyers if there were none in canon either. Please don't claim the absence of your fanon as a plot hole.

You think it is hamfisted - I think it was a decent plot that had, as Lucius's interlude will show in a later chapter, a few angles not apparent to you. You don't need to cover angles that are not present in the story, but only exist in some reader's fanon. Lucius organised witnesses, knew that they wouldn't be questioned too hard, arranged for the necklace to be placed, and that was it. The he timed the additional charges so that Dumbledore wouldn't hear of them in time, and done. Really, overengineering a plot when it's not needed is not smart.

Wand snapping is a symbolic punishment, as snapping an Officer's sabre was. And I don't know why Hagrid didn't go to another school. I also don't know why Dumbledore didn't reverse that decision, once he was Headmaster. I'd call that a plot hole - canon is full of them.

But in my story, expulsion doesn't mean - unenforcable - banishment from the magical world. Which pretty much is made clear in the story, so it's not a plot hole at all.

#+end_quote

And canon Dumbledore actually did a decent job defending Harry despite Fudge's interference. Why doesn't he manage that here?

Lawyers aren't fanon. As long as there's a government there's going to be lawyers. We should expect them to exist in magical Britain just as surely as any other profession until we are explicitly told otherwise by canon or word of JKR. Fanon would be arbitrarily deciding that there's no such thing as lawyers in magical Britain in order to explain away not explicitly seeing them in canon.

As far as why we don't see them in canon there are more plausible explanations than 'there are no lawyers.' The trial you depict is ostensibly normal, kangaroo court aside, while the few trials we see in canon are definitely not normal. With regards to Harry's trial, Fudge went out of his way to hamstring the defense (Dumbledore only just barely made it in time to get a few words in), beyond just disregarding the opposing arguments one might expect from a biased judiciary. As for the death eater trials it was pretty clear that was a time of exceptional chaos and I doubt many lawyers would be interested in defending death eaters (even less so than a muggleborn) and the ones that were may very well have been death eaters themselves.

I totally get that you want to give Hermione the short end of the stick here and that's A-OK, but I'm just trying to say you could have done it better. Having a biased judiciary convict her in spite of a well reasoned defense would be more compelling and indicative of the problems with the system than Dumbledore doing jack all to support her. In fact there's a wonderful best-selling novel about just such a scenario you may have heard of called /To Kill a Mockingbird./ Why can't Hermione get her own Atticus Finch?

A locked locker is only private because it's locked. The situation would only be the same if Hermione went through trouble of securing her trunk in a way that one could reasonably expect it to remain secure against the average magic user like a lock would do against muggles. As far as the dorms being secure, that's completely laughable. It's security theater at best. If a couple of plucky second years can get in anyone can.

#+end_quote

Sounds like /fanon/ (you seem to love that term) to me. Everything in canon indicates that it's a means of preventing an expelled student from further practicing magic. If Hagrid could get a new wand and study on his own he wouldn't need to sneak around with his wand shards concealed in his umbrella. He even says back when he gives Dudley a pig tail that he's not supposed to be casting magic because he was expelled, and it's only by Dumbledore's grace that he got to stick around as gamekeeper.

#+begin_quote
  "Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts," he said. "I'm --- er --- not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff --- one o' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job ---" "Why aren't you supposed to do magic?" asked Harry. "Oh, well --- I was at Hogwarts meself but I --- er --- got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an' everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore."
#+end_quote

There it is, straight from the source.

#+begin_quote
  I also don't know why Dumbledore didn't reverse that decision, once he was Headmaster.

Probably because the expulsion was legitimate enough without Riddle framing him for the Chamber fiasco, what with keeping a deadly giant spider in the school.

You really don't seem to get it: The incident cannot be repeated unless you pick someone to sacrifice as the interrogator. Veritaserum is not some magical "drink it and you start talking" potion - you need someone to ask the questions. And that someone will be sent to Azkaban for using Veritaserum. Otherwise yomone drugs the girls, or one of them, they stare blankly into the hall, people notice they have been drugged, and a Silencing Charm later they are carried to the Infirmary to be treated. Because no one wants to go to Azkaban. And even if a girl talked - so what? Most Slytherins suspect something is up. And most don't care. And the Wizengamot would easily decide that someone confunded or pressured the poor girl. I might add a line about that in the next chapter, but I don't really think it's necessary since it's just you you have that issue with it.

A handful of proper pureblood girls giving testimony, to the same Wizengamot their parents are part of, have more credibility than Dumbledore saying "this muggleborn girl didn't do it". Not the least because Dumbledore is no witness, and can just say "I do think she is innocent".

Right, direct testimony was probably poor word choice on my part. I was think more along the lines of him being a sort of well-regarded character reference.

So basically we've been playing by different rules this entire time. If you had said earlier that "X is part of my AU" this discussion, which you don't seem to be enjoying at all, would have been much shorter. Once more, you need to communicate better. You can't assume the reader knows what you're thinking. All they have to go on is what's written. Until they are explicitly shown what exactly is AU in your story they are going to assume canon.
