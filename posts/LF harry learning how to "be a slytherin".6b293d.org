pretty much gryffindor harry learning "slytherin-esque" skills like manipulation, deceit, etc.


** About a third of the stories with Daphne Greengrass listed as a main character have this. For example linkffn(7888771) The snake within.

linkffn(12446118) The realities one has a Slytherin Harry from another reality coach another on lying.

No promises on quality though.

  Voldemort is back, he can be stopped but all things come at a price. Someone called for a hero but he said no, ripped from his own reality he jumps again. Will he be more helpful this time? AU femHarry.
