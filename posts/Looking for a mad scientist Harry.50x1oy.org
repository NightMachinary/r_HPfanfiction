  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on! Intelligent!Super!Harry Later Mad Scientist!Harry Rated M for Language, Nudity, and Gore Stein-ish Harry Genres: Humor/Romance/slight Horror

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

**** In Blindness Harry is smarter than everybody else, plays god by creating life, and when he gets his hands on a Horcrux spends hours in his lab experimenting on it before destroying it completely. Seems pretty mad sciencey to me.

  Pumpkins killing each other, extravagant masquerades in the honor of a merciless queen, abominations towards creation, and Dr Harry Potter. There's a lot of screaming coming from the Island of Azkaban tonight. WARNING! Crack, Horror, and gory imagery

  It's the year 2185CE. Commander Jane Shepard is recruiting members to bring with her on a mission against the Collectors and the Reapers. Among the candidates is Dr. Harry Potter, the reclusive mad scientist who has been missing for twenty years. Who knows what he was doing during that time? Rated M to be sure.

**** The lack of magic was nothing, it was the fact that Harry was the man behind everything and could solve any problem by utilizing the latest version of whatever the humans stole form him gave the story no urgency or conflict to make it readable.
