If you guys have any fanfics where Harry can remove the Dark Mark (for whatever reason) I would like to read some of your suggestions.

I would prefer if it didn't stray into Dark!Harry territory, but if it isn't Voldemort-level and more like Moral-Compass-less Harry, that would be fine.

Ships of any kind are welcome (except for Tom/Harry or variations thereof.)


** Off the top of my head I remember that "This means war" by jeconais and "A black comedy" by nonjon features this a little.

**** I've seen this, but I hadn't the interest because from the summary [and the title], it doesn't seem very serious (no, not you Sirius). I have a hard time with mainly comedy/crack fics. Is this one of those?

*** In the end, does the mark become nullified? Like, for example, Voldemort can't use it to summon/punish/kill anyone via the mark anymore? Or is it banished from the skin to leave behind no trace of the mark? There is one where Harry just switches essentially the 'master' of the mark. Changing it from the skull&snake combo to a barely visible golden kiss mark.

***** It's link ffn(a black comedy)

It's a smallish part. He speaks to the snake part of it and kind of convinces it hrs Voldemort for a while. It does go away but only because he duels voldy in a Lord's duel and wins. It's a parody story but extremely well written and rated r. I would def recommend

****** It doesn't actually go away it changes to the black family mark cause Harry is Lord black in this one. So it changes to his mark. But it isn't actually a death mark anymore

** Harry Potter removes Snape's Dark Mark in the very last chapter of *Harry Potter and the Chained Souls.* You'll need to read *Harry Potter and the Enemy Within* first. Basically, this is what should have happened in Book 6 and Book 7 haha. Both fanfics were written before those books were released.

I know there's been other Harry and Snape (no slash) fanfics I've read where Harry removing Snape's Dark Mark is a sign of redemption or to protect him from Voldemort and always occurs at the most climatic moments.

** Late in /The Art of Self-Fashioning/ by Lomonaaeren, Harry does indeed manage to remove the Dark Mark. Harry's mindset isn't always the healthiest, but he isn't evil, nor Dark per se.

I quite enjoyed the work.

** It happens /very/ late into the series but in linkffn(Harry Crow), Snape is able to get rid of his dark mark by pledging his allegiance to Gringotts, therefore making his Dark Mark the Gringotts dragon instead.
