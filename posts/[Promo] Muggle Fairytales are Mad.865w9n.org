This is a cute fic set during the never ending camping trip, and the interaction of Hermione, Ron, and Harry makes me smile. The fic is still in progress but it's pretty fun, you get the feeling that everything is a bit dreary and they're trying their hardest to ignore the gloom. linkffn(5646950)

*** I liked it, but I'm also a big fan of fairy tales.

** I've started to read it and it's very nice. I've always been fond of fairytales and some of the stranger ones are certainly more readable with Ron attempting to deconstruct them. It'd be cool if the overall narrative seemed to be going somewhere, but generally a very pleasant read!
