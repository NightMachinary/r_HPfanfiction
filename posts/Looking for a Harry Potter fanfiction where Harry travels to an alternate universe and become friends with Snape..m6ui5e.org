:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a Harry Potter fanfic that I once read on Potions and Snitches, I think it was also posted on FanFiction but I am not sure about that.

It was a oneshot if am not wrong and in it Harry had been transported to an alternate universe. He wasn't able to get used that universe and was mostly cold and silent. Snape was still his usual self and it was because of his familiar hateful attitude that hadn't changed that Harry end up starting talking to him and getting along with him.

I think it was in third Pov from Snape's (or Harry's) side.

I can't really remember much of it but I think they talked about Harry's old world and how his parents were dead there and I think that at some point James Potter had learned those two were getting along and was jealous.

: Harry's parents were alive and I think the Harry of the alternate universe was alive. If so he was very different from Canon/Og-Harry.

Harry was still in school though I am not sure which year.

I am sorry for the lack of details, but I can't remember much of it.

It isn't much but I hope someone can help me find it, thank you.


** I think you're talking about World in Pieces by Lomonaaeren, although it is decidedly NOT a one-shot and even has a few sequels. linkffn(6730432) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/761514][Also on AO3]]

  AU after the last chapter of DH. Harry gets pulled into another universe to deal with the problem of Voldemort there. But that is not the worst thing that could happen. Mostly gen, with Snape mentoring Harry. COMPLETE.

**** I have actually read this one but no it is not the fic I am looking for. Draco was not a major character if mentioned at all and from what I remember the fic starts directly in the other universe with someone (most likely snape but possibly harry) mentioning how Harry quite was and how he didn't seem to adjust to that new world.

Thanks a lot anyway.
