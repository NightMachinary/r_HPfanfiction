Is there a reason Sirius didn't return to Grimmauld Place after the events of PoA? The Wiki says he gave it over to Dumbledore for Order of the Phoenix's use in 1993 (PoA era), which would mean Dumbledore became Secret Keeper to the Fidelius Charm--but in Goblet of Fire, Sirius is still on the run, and only "returns to England" to hide out in a cave near Hogsmeade because he's worried about Harry.

Is there an explicit canon reason he doesn't just go back to 12 Grimmauld Place, or are we just left to assume he hated the place /that/ much?


** Out of universe- JKR probably didn't think about Number 12 until she needed a place for the Order to stay

In universe- There's a few reasons we could guess, but nothing confirmed as far as I know. Sirius might have not known that he inherited his home since he was cast out of the family, if his parents and brother died. It's possible Dumbledore or Remus looked into it for him when they needed him to be in Britain. Or maybe Sirius knew, but worried about getting caught. It's possible he needed Dumbledore to perform the Fidelius, either because you need someone to cast it and someone to accept the Secret, or because he didn't know the charm himself (we only know that James and Lily knew it, not any of the others). It's all speculation but there's reasons out there other than just "he hated the place so he stayed away from it as long as possible." I'm sure even Sirius would agree that it's better than living off scraps in a cave.

Er, not necessarily. A nice plain cave wouldn't have Doxies, cursed music boxes, strangling drapes, an indestructible portrait that screams obscenities at you, a hostile house elf who actively resists efforts to clean the place up, and let's not forget the fragment of Voldemort's soul.

And Sirius had just spent over a decade being tormented with his worst memories, many of which would have taken place in that house.

The only reason I can think of that he might /want/ to immediately return would involve Fiendfyre.

This can be easily remedied with a silencing charm. It's just plain stupid that none of the characters ever bother doing this in OoTP. Besdies, it's just obscenities - that's hardly anything to be scared of.

There's the Imperius curse. No one would give a damn if a house elf was placed under the imperius to make himself more obedient.

Failing that because of nonsensical moral reasons, Kreacher's memory could be modified into thinking that Sirius is a great and glorious master. After that he could have helped with the cleaning of the house.

Having a roof over your head, a comfortable bed, warm meals, *bathing* - all these seemingly simple things would be priceless to a man who's not had them for a decade.

I am pretty sure we're meant to assume that Mrs Black's portrait spelled to be resistant to Silencing Charms just like it's resistant to attempt to unstick it from the wall.

The point isn't that it's /dangerous/ or /scary/, it's that it's /obnoxious/.

Er, changing someone's memories in that way carries the exact same ethical issues as Imperiusing them. You may think that the issues in question are minor; that's your opinion; but someone who rejected the one would most probably also reject the other.

All these things can be obtained in a cave. To begin with, the whole point of hiding in a cave is that it's a roof. But moreover, if one is a competent enough wizard with a working wand, all the others are easy also. Transfigure a rock into a bed. Use cooking spells on whatever you can scavenge to make it tastier, or simply duplicate a few crumbs of food nipped off a Muggle /ad infinitum/. You want a bath? Transfigure a bathtub and some soap, /Aguamenti/, Bob's your uncle.

In that case, just do what a lot of fanfics say and brick up the portrait, or put up a partition and charm that partition to block out all sound. The bricking is somewhat hard if you were to conjure that, but the partition and enchantment ought to be easy as hell, especially for someone who enchanted a motorcycle to fly at age 18.

Yes, they can all be obtained in a cave, but the cave that we see is decidedly more like an uninhabited cave than one with any amenities. Sirius said he was living off rats, for goodness sake. Harry also thinks he looked half-starved.

Rejection of useful solutions because of flimsy moral reasons is a great way to make things harder than they ought to be.

But the real reason for Sirius not going to 12 Grimmauld Place is probably because Rowling didn't think of it yet.

******* It's a complicated knot of issues that you can stand on either side on, but I think hundreds of years of philosophy would disagree with calling concerns about the ethics of free will "flimsy".

Sirius (whom you yourself recall is a gifted sorcerer in his own right) /not/ improving the cave and choosing to live off rats instead, for very obvious psychological reasons, strikes me as evidence of the simple reason he may not have wanted to go to Grimmauld Place either upon escaping: he was still too crazed to even think of his own comfort. It took a full year of Remus nursing him to even get him to still extremely unstable state he is in at the Shrieking Shack confrontation.

Indeed, a psychological interpretation also further explains why he might avoid Grimmauld Place; regardless of what he could do to improve it with some elbow grease, just walking back in there might be more of a shock than his very, very volatile mind could have taken upon getting out of Azkaban, and perhaps he knew that.

IIRC, he wasn't in contact with Remus until the shack. It was only that night that Remus saw Peter Pettigrew on the Marauders' Map, put two and two together, and rushed to the shack. That's why he forgot to take his wolfsbane.

** That sentence in the wiki is a little wonky, and as a result I think you're reading it incorrectly.

The wiki says "After his escape in 1993, Sirius gave the home over to the Order of the Phoenix...." But I don't think the wiki means he gave it to the order in 1993, /immediately/ after his escape. The wiki just says that he escaped in 1993, and at some point after that he gave Grimmauld Place to the Order.

I don't think the Order was reinstated (if that's the right word to use) until after Voldemort's return in 1994. Therefore, my guess is that the home wasn't under the Fidelius Charm until after Voldemort's return. And I don't think it would've been an ideal hiding place for Sirius until it was under the Fidelius Charm.

Of course, this begs the question of exactly how the Blacks kept hidden from the Muggles all this time.

** I thought it was obvious that Sirius really hated that place. Aside from that, without the fidelius charm, his family home would be one of the first places people would be looking for him after he escaped from Azkaban, so it's neither nice nor safe for him to go there. Why should he return then?
