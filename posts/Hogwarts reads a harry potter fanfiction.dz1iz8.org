An y harry potter fanfictions where the caracters react to another fanfiction?


** Hermione: Scribere Fabulam... Scribere Fabulam... Scribere Fabulam...

Ron: Hermione, what are you doing?

Hermione: Trying a spell. What does it look like? Scribere Fabulam...

Harry: What spell is it?

Hermione: Well, it's for Arithmancy. We have to figure out the incantation and wand movement from a Charm that Professor Septima described. Scribere Fabulam...

Ron: I thought Arithmancy was just all maths and stuff. You actually cast spells in that class?

Hermione: You would have known that if you had tried it out. Scribere Fabulam... Ugh! The spell is supposed to conjure a book with a fictional story, but I just can't get it to work.

Harry: Are you sure you have the right incantation? Because it sounds like you're trying to conjure some fabulous scribbles.

Ron: So... Hermione writing normally?

Harry: I was more thinking Malfoy, you couldn't take anything he scribbles seriously.

/The trio giggles and sniggers./

Hermione: Maybe?... It's a Latin translation of Write a Story, maybe I got the translation wrong?

Ron: Write a story? Wouldn't it be create it conjure a story?

Hermione: Normally, yes. But spells aren't always that literal, and what I found could fit the equations if I found the right wand movement... Scribere Fabulam... UGH!

Harry: What about a translation from... the Latin word for author or something.

Hermione: ... That might actually work.

/Hermione makes a bunch of notes for a couple minutes than readies her wand again./

Hermione: Auctor Artis

/Suddenly, a scroll of parchment appears, displaying an essay of words in messy handwriting./

Hermione: YES!!!

Ron: What is it... Oh did it work?

Hermione: Yes, and it's all thanks to Harry's idea!

Harry: Well... I didn't do much...

Hermione: Oh, nonsense, I'd have been stuck on this for the rest of the day if you hadn't helped. Turns out the incantation translates roughly to Author's Craft.

Ron: Nice going, Harry. What's the story?

/Hermione picks up the parchment./

Hermione: There's no title... It doesn't look very good... In fact it looks awful.

Ron: Even better, let's hear it!

Hermione: If you say so... Ehem... “Hi my name is Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way...”

*** "Damn, that was... No. Just no. I think we'd better be safe and burn this scroll before anyone else sees it," said Harry, as Hermione put the scroll down.

"Indeed," replied Ron, drawing his wand, "Incen..."

"Expelliarmus! Burning a book? How dare you!" Shouted Hermione.

"But, what can we do then?"

"Well, we can always place it in the Room of Requirement," suggested Harry. "Let's ask for a place to hide something, and see what it offers."

"Harry! That's genius! Let's go!"

A few hours later it was time for dinner. All was normal, until a professor wearing long black robe with small white skeletons, black pants with a skull buckler, and a skin tight black shirt with a red 666 over the heart. It was not Snape, it was... DUMBLYDOOR.

"I went soul searching on the seventh floor this afternoon, and as I was thinking about where my soul could be hidden, I found this strange room that used to be a toiler once upon a time. Inside was this ancient prophetic scroll, that somehow has managed to predict the events of today... to an extent. And as the scroll of prophesy demands, as of now..."

"I'm a satanist! And gofik!"

** I saw one a long time ago where Hogwarts read /My Immortal/. I looked for it again recently, but I couldn't find it - I think it may have been deleted, but I really hope not.

What I remember: there were two (I think) OCs (possibly reader-submitted), one of whom was named Marty. The last chapter was a stinger set years later where the Marty OC got an iPod (?) for Christmas and freaked out because /My Immortal/ had had iPods in it.

If anyone remembers and/or has a backup of this fic saved, I would really appreciate it! :)

  We've all seen Harry Potter, friends and enemies read his past, but what happens when he gains the opportunity to read the adventures of entirely different Harry Potters. Completely original stories that can range from harem tales to X-overs to pairings that don't make sense. Reading stars including students, staff, death eaters and the Dursleys. Read, Review and prosper!

  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.
