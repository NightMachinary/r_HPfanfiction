I used to be very into reading HPFF several years ago, but gradually drifted away when I stopped finding anything new to spark my interest.

Recently however I've missed it, so decided to come back. I was wondering if I could get some recommendations of fics written in the last few years.

For context the following were some of my favourites back when I used to read (these are the ones I can remember, obviously so many that I cannot)

1. *The Lie I've Lived* by jbern (Favourite fic probably)
2. *Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time* by joe6991
3. *The Denarian Renegade* by Shezza
4. *Awaken Sleeper* by Water Mage
5. *A Black Comedy* by nonjon

Any suggestions would be welcome, but more recent fics would be preferred.


** You are coming back at the right time. IMO, last two years were the best time to read HP fanfictions. A disproportionate number of my favorites were completed during that time. Using 1/1/2015 as the cut off date, here are some really good ones that are complete:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), is by far the most popular fic on this sub. I won't spoil too much, just read it and enjoy!

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is an excellent rewrite of the canon story in a very different AU. I like it so much that I wrote a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5bf1gs/lf_complete_stories_where_hermione_isnt_a/d9oc0z1/][quite long description]] of it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is a superb dark!Harry story. It depicted a dystopian post Voldemort magical Britain in which the old regime betrayed Harry and his friends, so that they decided to fight back, with any means.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] and its expansion [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076644/1/The-World-of-The-Accidental-Animagus][The World of The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(12076644;9863146), are great in world building. Readers actually got to see what happened outside Britain, and Year 3 plot was brilliant and very original. Both good and bad guys have been beefed up significantly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542), also does a great job in world building. In this AU, Dumbledore was cool, Dursleys were trying hard, Fudge was reasonable, Hermione was effective, Lockhart wasn't a fraud, Umbridge wasn't nearly that bad, but Voldemort was utterly terrifying.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is written by the same author as "Patron". It's another extreme AU where a very cunning Lucius Malfoy outmaneuvered Dumbledore in 1981 and had ruled magical Britain for the next 20 years. But Dumbledore would strike back with a vengeance after the next generation graduated from Beauxbaton. One of his agents sent to Britain, Ron Weasley, met a loyal Malfoy enforcer, Wand Leader Hermione. This fic is my favorite Ron/Hermione romance.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467), has Dumbledore taking the aftermath of CoS a little more seriously. What followed is a delight to read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795), is a great Hermione time travel fic. She sent her memories and powers back to her 2 years old self, or 42 days before Halloween 1981. Hilarity ensued, but also heart-breaking moments.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]], linkffn(11419408), is IMO the best canon-compliant, Year 7 Hogwarts story. Snape is especially well done in that he is portrayed neither too good as to blow his cover or too evil as to make the name 'Albus Severus' all impossible.

--------------

Several very interesting fics were first published during past two years and are still in progress:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], linkffn(12088294), is the sequel to "The Accidental Animagus". That story is getting better and better, combined with humor and suspense. Draco's character development is one of the best I've seen among HP fanfics. The bad guys are scary and yet their interactions are hilarious.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12324284/1/A-Dramatic-Reading][A Dramatic Reading]], linkffn(12324284), is a super hilarious variation of the 'Read the Books' trope, and has its own plot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), has the Ministry selling out Muggleborns to appease Voldemort after Year 4. One Year later, Hermione formed a Muggleborn guerrilla group and dished out massive losses to Death Eaters and their sympathizers. But Voldemort also had some terrible tricks up his sleave. This fic is already 426k words long, and has still a long way to go, [[/spoiler][despite Voldemort being already defeated]]. Combat scenes and political intrigues are very well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight][The Red Knight]], linkffn(12141684), has canon Ron reborn in a different universe. He faced great challenges because almost all key female characters were taking on very different, if not inverted, roles.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), is the sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], a Star Wars crossover. This story is a SG1 crossover and features heavily on the theme of civilization/empire building. Seeing Hermione and Luna wielding light-sabers and throwing Sith-lightening is quite fun.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of the Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136), is a pretty good 'Ginny in the world of Fire and Ice' fic. Generally speaking, HP magic was overpowered for that world, but it's fun to read curb-stomps from time to time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-With-Me][Grow Young With Me]], linkffn(11111990), is IMO the best romance I've read in this fandom.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** This is what I posted a few days ago when somebody asked:

Do you like crossovers? *Of course you like crossovers.* Even if you don't...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8897431/1/Child-of-the-Storm][*Child of the Storm*]] linkffn(8897431), a crossover with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, asks the question of "what if James Potter was just Thor in a human's body?" and then constructs a world with so many layers and moving parts it's extraordinary. Even better: it's complete it currently has a WIP sequel. Do be warned though, it takes a few chapters for the story to fully find its legs.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince][*The Black Prince*]] linkffn(11098283), a crossover with Game of Thrones, has Harry 'reborn' as sorts (it hasn't quite explained what's going on yet) as the second son of Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister. While this is definitely Harry, he's also molded by his life in Westeros - and the world adapts to his presence. Currently ongoing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10199392/1/Early-Retirement][*Early Retirement*]] linkffn(10199392) and it's sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11510638/1/What-Happened-Between][*What Happened Between*]] linkffn(11510638), crossovers with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, are a play on BOTH a female!Harry, and Master-of-Death!Harry and how that fits into the Marvel universe. Oh, and this Harry has issues resulting from the fact she can't die. Don't read the third story in the trilogy, pretend it ends with 'What Happened Between.'

Now, this one isn't TECHNICALLY a crossover...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][*A Long Journey Home*]] linkffn(9860311) might as well be a crossover with /The Once and Future King/ and a few other stories. It's simply a beautiful read, and is really an exercise by the author in exploring different cultures and having the female Harry interact with them. Still a WIP but very easy to walk away from and not be totally devastated there isn't more.

These aren't crossovers, but please don't hold that against me:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10728064/1/Days-to-Come][*Days to Come*]] linkffn(10728064) deals with the post-Deathly Hallows world under the assumption that Harry (along with everyone else) developed some massive issues along the way that didn't get addressed. From Harry's point of view it's pretty black and white, but it's obvious the world is operating under shades of grey. Nobody was innocent, some just reacted worse than others. It sort of peters out at the end, but still comes to a heavily satisfying conclusion.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9444529/1/Vitam-Paramus][*Vitam Paramus*]] linkffn(9444529) is a MASSIVE slow burn romance between a very realistically portrayed Quidditch star Harry, and Gabrielle Delacour. Seriously, Harry might as well be Cristiano Ronaldo with magic in this. Until it's epilogue was posted I wouldn't have recommended it as it was left with one of the more unsatisfying conclusions. The epilogue gave the fic, and its readers, the release needed.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.
