Earlier this week I lost my cat it in a tragic accident, so I'm looking for a good length fic to get completely lost in, preferably focusing on the First War. Canon-ish pairings. Not a huge fan of Wolfstar, but I'll look past it if it isn't the main focus. Looking for something that really focuses on the Order of the Phoenix.

Thanks in advance! ⚡️⚡️

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

** the only bad thing of TLAT is that the author never completed it... The last chapter posted does give you some closure and you can live with it never being completed, but it'a such a good fic I just wish we had more
