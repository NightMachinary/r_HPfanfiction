#+TITLE: Harry's hair is untamable, it it a simple fact. Gel was like water, and hair spray a light breeze to the gravity defying hair. How could growing it long stop it's power? It can't.

Oh Harry had tried, he had tried very hard to make his hair lay down. But even Sleekeazy's did nothing, his hair had grown immune due to the Potter family's excessive use.

So, he tried growing it out.

"Harry..." Hermione looked like she was struggling not to smile, and Ron looked like he was choking himself by holding in his laughter. The reason?

Harry had decided to see if a hair growth charm would let it lay flat, but...

"Yeah, yeah. I know." Harry brushed some of the bush on his head away from his face. Apparently when you grow out Potter hair, it grows /out/. The certifiable lion's mane was testament.

"Can you at least help me cut it?"

(My HC for why Harry won't let his hair get long lol)


** He's the Boy Who Lived. Now everyone, at least all the Gryffindors, wants a Potter-style lion's mane.

** After a few miscast spells during the DA meetings, Hermione has determined that somehow Harry actually has magic resistant hair.

Harry grows out his untamable hair and drapes it around himself like a messy cloak of protection. He ends up using it much like the Sanin Jiraiya to tank virtually any damage quite easily.

Death Eater: Crucio!

Harry just turns his back on the attack and walks away as the spell splashes harmlessly against his unruly black curls.

Like my beard over the last year. It's been a year since I last saw a barber, but it hasn't got any longer for the last six months, it's just gone out sideways.

Am I secretly a wizard?

*** Since magic is involved, you could easily have all the hair-centered magic you want. Being able to lengthen, block spells, and restrain or impale things would be very useful.
