As much HP trivia as anything else. Funny how the minutia I glossed over as an avid reader requires research when writing FF. As best I can tell:

Expulso = causes an object to explode. [DH, possible targeted at Harry?] Bombarda / Bombarda Maxima = causes an explosion itself. [Umbridge blows open ta wall] Reducto = explosion, but more like a disintegration. Only on inanimate objects [used in Tri-Wizard; taught to DA] Confingo = a more accurate exploding spell, ray-like [not used until Battle of Seven Potters; DH]

Even writing that I am still not sure which is which. What is your head canon?


** Bombardo is a rather loud spell of destruction, which can be inferred from the name (as well as it's mentioning during /Cursed Child/). Unclear whether charm, hex, jinx or curse.

The Reductor Curse blasts solid objects out of the caster's way. So, by nature, not necessarily destructive though could probably be used that way. And is a curse, which sets it apart from charms, transfigurations, hexes, jinxes, etc. Also seems to have the ability to /reduce/ something to it's end state (as in that table during a D.A. meeting during /OotP/).

Expulso: Blows shit up. Unclear whether charm or hex/jinx/curse.

The Blasting Curse (Confringo): Blows shit up. This leads me to believe that Expulso is not a curse.

This is all the information that I could sift out of the hp-lexicon. And now you asked for headcanons on this.

Let's start off with something in canon that isn't obvious: There are multiple magical ways to achieve a specific effect. For instance, you learn in Charms how to make objects dance and move (ie, become animate). Animation is a topic that also falls under Transfiguration. Another example is the Severing Charm (Diffindo) and the Sectumsempra Curse. Both can cut people (no idea if Sectumsempra can cut objects or not). So does the fact that they produce the same effect mean they are the same piece of magic? *No*. The subjects are differentiated not by effect (Transfiguration as an umbrella course and not separated into Form-Changing, animation, conjuration, vanishing, etc) but by the means through which the effect is brought into being. This is all clear from canon.

So my headcanon? Who cares which one you use as long as you are internally consistent. You can have them all have the same effect with all being curses, you can have them all have the same effect with them being different types of magic or you can have them all have different effects. Doesn't matter which route you go with /as long as you are consistent in doing so./

Internal consistency is king.

I would think in those cases, the charms are making the thing bob around, like someone picked it up and bounced it around. Transfiguration would make it truly animated, with its parts actually bending and flexing, even those parts that are otherwise stiff and inflexible like a table leg.

** As dumb as it may sound, but I treat the array of explosion curses a lot like different rounds for a tank. You have sabot AT rounds, HE rounds, AP rounds,... Depending on what you choose you will do different amount of damage to different targets.

Reducto and Bombarda are a bit similar in what they do, in that they both destroy solid objects. Reducto blasts an object into pulver. Bombarda makes a big fat hole in it, or rips it apart. Use Reducto against a wall and you won't have a good outcome - thats what Bombarda is for. Use Bombarda against a single objects and you may be hit by the ensuring shrapnel.

Expulso and Confringo are the two types of "AP" rounds in the magical arsenal. I treat Expulso as the HEAP round. It strikes, explodes, and depending on how close you are to the effect, you may end up being hurt. Confringo however, does nothing if it doesn't hit a human, but if it does the effect is much, much worse.

** As I understand, 'expulso' is the banishing curse used to propel things/people away from you with a bludger-like force that looks blue in appearance. Bombarda/Maxima causes an explosion like a mine, Reducto is used to turn your target into ashes and is more precise. I assume from the movies that Confringo is a more explosive and fireball-y.

** Very helpful!

I knew that the "piercing curse" is fannon, but is the bone breaking curse as well?

** /Bombarda/, by my understanding, is like a cannon or mortar, and designed for use against stone structures.

/Reducto/ brings down objects, mainly by turning them to dust.

/Expulso/ unleashes a pressure wave at the target.

/Confrigo/ is a fireball or flamethrower spell.
