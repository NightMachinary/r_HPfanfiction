I recently read

'Love and love again'

'Light up the sky'

'The darkness within'

â€‹

And I really liked it, do you have any fanfics similar to these?


** I haven't read any of those. The only story I know that has them alive and neither knowing about the other is linkffn(Blank Slate by tresmaraudeur).

#+begin_quote
  Fourteen years ago, their slate had been wiped clean. With no memory of their pasts, they built a new life, but after an owl delivers a strange letter to their daughter, the life they built is beginning to crumble around them. With help from old friends, Lily and James Potter remember their pasts and return to the Wizarding World while Harry faces his fifth year at Hogwarts.
