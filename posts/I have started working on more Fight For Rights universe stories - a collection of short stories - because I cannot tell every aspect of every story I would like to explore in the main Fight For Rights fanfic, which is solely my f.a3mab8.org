Yes please see the title! If I did try to write all my ideas into the story and explore them all it would make the story have like a million SUBPLOTS and tangent scenes and it would be super long and off track! :) So I have come up with this idea instead so Fight For Rights can keep its focus.

They will be short stories in the future of the world, and they will be from all different nonhuman perspectives and even some humans who interact with nonhumans! They are about adapting and communicating and accepting and compromising and embracing differences instead of seeing them as negatives or obstacles. In general and in the personal.

I have entitled this short story collection "Monster Tales", which is supposed to be yes ironic because that is the main insult most nonhumans get from humans, but these short stories will see many humans learning that they are more than just that - that they are anything BUT that. :)

For example, one idea I have is about a family lost in the woods during a thunderstorm and they get helped by a loner magi-aracnhid who invites them into her dry and nice den for the night.

Another is going to be about a gorgon (Medusa's species - human upper body with snakes for hair, and lower body of a serpent) and her boyfriend going to a social outing in a human city for the first time, and how they deal with that.

And I have another one that's going to be about a mermaid who keeps meeting a lonely and depressed older woman at the docks and it's the only company she ever has anymore and it cheers her up, and eventually the mermaid will get her to join her in the ocean and have fun and stuff, and then convince her to get help getting better by seeing a therapist and stuff. :)

Anyway no I will not put them onto my fanfic.net until Fight For Rights main story is done because it would spoil how the future of the world and some characters turns out.

But I will say that I did research history and it has been like 50 years since the civil rights act, and looking at where we are now compared with then I thought it would help me to write my story's lessons and issues, so I decided to set it 60 years into the future of the world where nonhumans have been open and gained rights to parallel it. :)

And I will not put more Fight For Rights chapters until I'm all done because I do not want to have super long gaps and struggles with writer's block all the time. I will wait until I finish the story and then post chapters on a SCHEDULE so it will be no problem for anyone. Yes thank you friends like Florea and Starfox and Achille and LineofField and also MandyBumblebee.
