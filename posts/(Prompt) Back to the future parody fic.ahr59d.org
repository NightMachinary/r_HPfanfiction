Harry and Hermione travel back in time to the marauder era and Harry begins to fade out of reality like Marty Mcfly after Lily or James become infatuated with Hermione and are set on taking her to the big end of year dance instead of each other? haha (can be H/Hr ship fic or they are just friends)


** I heard linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4986849/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Balm-of-Time]]) Is kinda like this but I haven't read it yet to confirm.

  Dumbledore concocts a cunning plan to travel back in time and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. His untimely death prevents him from going so Harry must go in his place, and take the one person whose help he really needs with him.
