[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12058516/16/The-Reclamation-of-Black-Magic][Or, how The Reclamation of Black Magic just became that much less accessible to FFN readers.]]

Is there a curse on good fics, or something? I mean, yes, the author isn't stopping, but I don't follow Ao3 stories like I do ffn stories. So this kind of pisses me off.


** Everyone keeps commenting that the authors should just grow a thicker skin. Authors are providing content that we read for free. If they don't like getting harassed, which yes, this author has been, for quite a while now (read the reviews), then why shouldn't they find a platform that doesn't seem to breed the kind of maliciousness that FF.net does? I wouldn't want to hang around someone where people consistently send me vile comments or threaten to report my story.

Yeah, it's the internet and there are always trolls but why should anyone want to stay in the place where the trolls are the worst? Also, FF.net's ludicrous application of the no smut policy means that authors have good reason to go somewhere else if that's something they write.

** I don't understand why people complained. I mean, when I come across something I don't want to read, I just... stop reading it. It might be a little disappointing, but it's not like I paid anything for it. It even says in the summary and before the first chapter "Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes." What were they expecting?

*** I'm not sure why I'm still angry about this-I never even read the fic. But I guess it just seems so stupid to me. It probably didn't go from the characters eating breakfast in the hall to hardcore fucking instantly. There was probably some kissing or something that would have been warning of what's to follow for uninterested readers. There were probably even clues leading up to that chapter. Do we need to do an announcement?

PSA: duck out at the foreplay if you don't want to read about the sex

It must suck to have a bunch of people angry about what you've written, but I think the author needs to get a bit hardier. Don't quit, just spite write through it

**** I mean, was it really by surprise? There wasn't any flirting or clues leading up to it? There was no kissing or undressing, just straight from eating or whatever to full-blown sex? Unless it was rape, I don't think it can be a surprise for the readers. They also could have ducked out at any point-no one is forcing them to consume it. There were even several warnings.

******* The AO3 was basically founded (and conceptually framed) by LJ writers of all shades. Slash (and kink of all sorts) was always more represented on LJ than on the Pit. And as LJ was repatriated to Russia and attacked by various evangelical kooks, the need for a truly inclusive, non-commercial archive for /all/ fandoms gave birth to the AO3.

Might have to do with the fact that you have (or at least had to, once) to jump through some hoops to register on AO3 and some 15-year-olds do not have patience for that.

Of course, that's not to say there aren't any such people there, but yeah, that, plus what seems to be a lack of guest reviews, and it at least /seems/ a bit cleaner in that regard.

***** Didn't mean to imply anything else with my comment. It was /clearly/ harassment, but such things are sadly part of fandom. "Getting used to it" is pretty much the only option, other than reporting it.

(But reporting trolling on the internet is often like fighting a forest fire with a cupful of water.)

** I haven't read this fic but I'm worried about what this will mean for her other WIPs like Misplaced Moony.

OP, I get that it's annoying to keep track of everything on both Ao3 and ffn, but Ao3 is a great platform! I use that and ffn in combination and it's easy to get email updates on Ao3 when something updates that you're subscribed to even if ffn is still your main site.

Also, why is she so worried about someone downloading her work without permission on Ao3 when it's easy to do on ffn with one of those plugins (I don't have one but other people use them all the time)?

*** She gave several warnings earlier in the story to say that it would contain such scenes. Several chapters had them. They are on her author page. She has written many fics and faced this same thing. It's her work, she can post it where she feels most comfortable.

FFN is becoming a toxic environment for authors. Getting mad at her for not wanting to put up with harassment is akin to victim blaming someone who is bullied in-person. It's not even that she's going to stop writing entirely, she is just switching to a different (still publicly accessible) site.

Also, the lack of formatting settings on Ao3 is off-putting for me who's visually impaired and suffer from albinism, but nobody ever consider that, do they? At least it's not Portkey or any other relic with fixed width that doesn't work with browser zoom.

You can set whatever custom skin you want, use browser zoom or font settings, use browser reading plugins (like high contrast, chromevox, readability, etc), access the site with screen reading and screen magnifying software, and you can download the files in several formats that makes them easy to port to accessible ebook readers. There's logical heading level navigation both throughout the browsing and search pages and on each fic.

On the other hand, FFN tries to block downloading fics, which some users (like me) want for accessibility reasons, has some elements that are inaccessible to me with NVDA (like the "mobile edition," "fontastic panel," and "language," buttons), has no apparent useful heading navigation, and the filter function has issues on the non-mobile site.

I do not think that it is a fair criticism of ao3's accessibility that they do not offer something like the fontastic panel (but instead enable users to fully customize the experience to their actual needs and offer a pretty accessible base site.) If you give the site a try you will find that it can be used by anyone ranging from low vision to completely blind.
