Are there Any good fics that feature a Harry and Hela pairing? Doesn't have to be MCU/thor fandoms Hela.


** Late, but seeing as there are no replies, I'll at least drop this one here:

Sorry that it isn't really Harry/Hela, it is Harry/multi, but imo really well done. The plot and worldbuilding is always the main focus, smut takes a very balanced backseat. I just reread the now 1.8m words for the third time and really enjoyed it again. But Hela comes into the story late, and joins the relationship even later. As I said, maybe not what you want (Harry/Hela) but definitely one of the best MCU crossovers I have ever read.

**** It is not finished. I am not even sure it will be finished ever lol. Not because the author doesn't update, but because there is such an incredible amount of stuff going on and so much else in the marvel universe that he can still bring in over time. But maybe its not your style if you already dropped it once. On the other hand, giving it another chance can't hurt.

****** Ah yes, thats exactly the reason why I myself just had my 3rd re-read of it :D It had been like a year since I read it and there have been like 600k words added in the time. So for that author, around 8 chapters... Just to mention it, if you also like other crossovers, his "Magic Of The Force" and "FILFY Teacher" are great too. Despite the name of the second one...
