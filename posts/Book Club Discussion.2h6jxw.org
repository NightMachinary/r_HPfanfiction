A clear majority favors a new fic every two weeks while a smaller majority favors continuing the current recommendation threads.

Every two weeks I'll make a thread in which I'll announce the next fic and we can discuss the previous one.

It was also suggested that we have some standard discussion points and more of a guided discussion. I'm open to suggestions for the former and volunteers for the latter. I don't know if I'll have the time to do it myself.

There's also a link in the sidebar to submit recommendations at any time, not just in recommendation threads.


** So no more Book Club recommendation threads then?

*** I'll continue to post them a week ahead. I probably won't sticky them anymore so the main book club threads can stay at the top for the full two weeks.
