Hey guys!

Y'all are always so good at helping out so I have a little request. Does anybody know of some good fics where Harry isn't the Boy Who Lived but James and Lily are still dead? Maybe Neville is the savior maybe there is no savior etc. it doesn't really matter to me. I'd prefer if he still lived with the Dursley's but if you know some good alternative ones feel free to recommend them as well!

Thanks guys :D


** Having his parents dead in this scenario is easy, the real problem would be to still have him live with the Dursleys. At least canon Dursleys

*** If we have the same background, we still have Peter framing Sirius. And Petunia is still Harry's closest relative.

**** Well yes, but Petunia doesn't want him, and without the blood protection, Dumbledore isn't eager to make it happen

  Instead of becoming Voldemort, Tom Riddle established a school of “secondary importance” for Muggleborns, half-bloods, and Squibs. Since the school frees Hogwarts to continue drifting more towards the purebloods' whims and wishes, they haven't raised any large fuss. Besides, everyone knows that half-bloods and Muggleborns don't have any real power. Just look at Riddle, who had ambitions that outpaced his magical strength. They don't see the revolution coalescing under the surface.

** I'm a big fan of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1140833][Ut Malis Melior]], where Harry's parents are at St. Mungo's and Neville is the BWL. He starts off living at the Dursleys'. There are a lot of politics in the series but I think it's done well and age appropriate (adults at the Wizengamot and children learning from them). I also like that Harry and Neville become friends, there's a lot interhouse friendships here. The author is currently writing book 4. The series gets really tense as it goes on!

  Harry Potter grew up at Number Four Privet Drive. Harry Potter has never known his parents. Harry Potter is a wizard.Harry Potter is not the Boy Who Lived.--The Thrown Pebble is Book One of a whole-canon reimagining wherein Neville Longbottom, not Harry Potter, was the one targeted by Voldemort. This changes many things, and other things not at all.(TTP is complete; the series is a WIP. Tags will be updated as chapters are posted. See series notes for more details.)
