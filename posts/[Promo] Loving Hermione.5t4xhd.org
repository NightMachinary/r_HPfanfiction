The first chapter of the newest story to come out of GryffindorTom Towers, Loving Hermione, has now been uploaded to fanfiction.net.

Following on from the events of Taking Hermione, a fic which has within a month gained over 25k hits, follows Harry and Hermione during the summer before Fifth Year and their encounters with the Order of the Phoenix, the Goblins of Gringotts and Harry's Pureblood Supremacist great uncle, Charlus Potter.

In the first chapter we find out something that embarrasses both Harry and Hermione, and also the Granger family heritage that Hermione knew nothing about.

** There's promotion, and then there's flat-out hyperbole. A 'hit story' that was started a month ago, just completed, and has 85 follows and 49 faves?

Don't sell so hard. It makes you look desperate.

** Well, that's fun and all, but it'd be nice if you could be bothered to use consistent punctuation and spell names correctly. I'm sure Delores is a lovely girl, really.
