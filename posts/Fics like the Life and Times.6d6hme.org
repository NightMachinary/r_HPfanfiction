Are there any Fics on par with the Life and Times? I not, I'll take any Mauarder Era Hogwarts Fic.


** I have never personally read it, but there is a Jily fic called Commentarius that I hear people talk about often and say it's in the same league as TLAT. Bot doesn't seem to be working, so I'll just link it.

** Nothing comes close to TLaT unfortunately. I'm writing a fic that I hope will be received well, otherwise 'Teardrops on the Balcony' by ByeByeBirdie is considered next best.

** The Life and Times is really the epitome, been reading pretty much only Marauder Era fics for the past month or two and still haven't found anything I liked as much as it - mainly because of how James and Lily were written. anyway here's a few recs, I generally prefer longer fics so most of these are pretty lengthy.

First off if you haven't read the TLaT [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6957058/1/Snaps][one shot]] linkffn(6957058) its worth a quick read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2429621/1/I-ll-Take-it-Shaken-Not-Stirred][I'll Take it Shaken, Not Stirred]] linkffn(2429621) - This is written by the same author but it has nothing to do with TLAT, its a seventh year fic and it has that TLAT feeling to an extent, worth trying out at least, its the closest you can get to more of the Life and Times writing style.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10939132/1/An-Unexpected-Attraction][An Unexpected Attraction]] linkffn(10939132) - This is very similar to TLAT, mature in that the characters have sex and drink etc, Seventh year, really long, I cant say much more for it other than that i'm only on chapter 28 but its enjoyable so far, it deals with similar plot lines as Tlat, its also WiP so bear that in mind.

The following are ones I haven't read, but in my search were recommended over and over again and are on my read list

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6019444/1/Before-The-Fawn][Before the Fawn]] - linkffn(6019444) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]] - linkffn(7305052) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1461086/1/Forever-Alive][Forever Alive]] - linkffn(1461086) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3503913/1/You-Want-To-Make-A-Memory][You Want to Make a Memory]] - linkffn(3503913)

And, don't really know i'm recommending it since I didn't really enjoy it myself, but the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2717445/1/Tears-on-the-Balcony]["On the Balcony"]] trilogy is an option as well, I don't really like to criticize FF authors to harshly (they do this for free after all) - but i felt it kind of went around in circles a bit - well a lot.....but someone might like it - linkffn(2717445)
