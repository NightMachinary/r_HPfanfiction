So I've recently started it and I've pushed through fifteen chapters but the writing is good although I have my issues with it. Do any of these tone down?

-As much as I hate using this term, Lily is really nothing more than a Mary Sue. Every scene she's in she shows us how utterly brilliant she is. She's nearly mastered wandless magic within the first ten chapters and it's supposed to be ridiculously difficult. Every single character we've stumbled upon tells us how much of a magical genius she is. She is inventing her own spells in only thirty minutes and has defeated her Defense Professor three times in duels despite him being an auror and having 5 years more experience than her. Everyone, and I mean everyone, tells us how amazing, kind, clever, brilliant and creative she is. And a lot of people are feeling bad for her despite a lot of people going through what she has. She's also an Animagus. She's made the centaurs on their side by only saying a few simple lines and has a pet unicorn. I love canon Lily but she's quite irritating here. Does this tone down?

-The characterisations are off. Everyone is talking and thinking about Lily and how amazing she is. You'd think James, one of the main characters would have other problems, but no, he doesn't. His only thoughts are revolving around how impressed and in awe he is of Lily. He doesn't have his personal problems. Dumbledore recruits a 17 year old student despite it being OOC for him to do so. She didn't even approach him or know anything about it before. Hagrid only talks about how kind and clever she is, constantly sobbing about her dead parents and how lonely she is despite a pot of people having similar situations. Her problems are treated as something unique when they're frankly aren't at a time of war. It seems like everyone is just there to tell us how much of a magic genius she is. Does this tone down?

-Sirius. You know how Sirius is a womaniser in fanfiction? Yeah, take that and triple it a thousand times. His thoughts only revolve around Lily despite never having met her before. He's just too perverted as well, only talking about either Lily or making something perverted out of perfectly innocent things. As he's one of my favorite characters and a quite complex one, it's quite frustrating to see him fawning over someone he's never met and being a womaniser with no other character traits. James only talks to him about how brilliant Lily is. Does this tone down? Or not? Does it increase?

-Lastly, the plot and I assume the mystery that's supposed to be coming seems interesting but I don't know when it approaches and if it's worth sticking around. Is the ensuing mystery interesting or just puts another downer on the fanfiction? If so, is it unique? Does it make up for everything else?

Lastly, the reason I've stuck around is because the worldbuilding is interesting and the banter is quite funny. The author is also a good writer. So, does anything of what I've listed tone down? I guess my issue is mainly with Lily, the author seems to worship here. Should I stick to it or not? Is it worth pushing through? Or do my issues with it only increase? Is the later plot good and makes up for it?

Thanks for your help!

*** I was very happy when I saw your comment, I truly was.

Nope, sadly. It was a bit sickening to be honest. I felt that it had potential, it really did but Lily being more powerful than most Order members when she's only 18 and still at school? Everyone is raving about how amazing, talented, unparalleled, kind, good and intelligent Lily is and /she's not even dead/. I don't think Rowling would even agree with how overpowered she is in this fic. And she based Lily on her own mother. No one can master wandless, non verbal magic in two days time. Not even Dumbledore and yet who does? Lily Evans. She also beat her auror Professor three times in a duel without effort at all. I mean...? She could also apparate without training at only 14...on her very first attempt. Oh, she also has a pet unicorn from like, chapter one. And it's worth noting she invented a spell in less than thirty minutes, and as we're constantly told, a very brilliant one. Did I mention it's very brilliant? But it's brilliant, it truly is.

It was nauseating because everytime (between maaaaaany different characters) the POV is switched, it is to tell us how amazing she is...moving on? Hagrid only talks about her. /Albus freaking Dumbledore/ only ever speaks of her. Slughorn says that she's practically more talented than Riddle. The plot never started and what made me ultimately drop it is Sirius not even /meeting/ Lily and all he ever talks about is how absurdly talented she is. I mean, are you for real? His only other trait was being unusually and worryingly perverted, more so that even most fanfiction makes him out to be and that's saying something. *He's never even met her*.

I felt it had vastly wasted potential, which is sad. I might give it another go, though. There was a mystery and I never got to see it and it seemed terribly interesting. Lily was also horribly clich√©d and undeniably a Mary Sue with no flaws at all. She, I think at one point while I was skimming the thing, was said to have a condition that leaves her very weak. I was curious what it is but it was mentally exhausting to skim through all that praise and never getting to the real plot. She's got a great singing voice. Her peers are afraid of her abilities and yet she's unusually kind. She is popular with no close friends at all. She has a heavenly singing voice. Animals just /lurv/ her. People only talk about her. She's got more info on Death Eaters than Moody on her first Order meeting because she worked at the Leaky Cauldron. If that's the case, then most aurors should just work at the Leaky Cauldron. Case closed. She knows more about the dark arts than her DADA Professor too.

Again, I might give it another shot in the future after I'm finished reading my current fic. Have you ever gotten around to reading it? If you have, what are your thoughts on it? Any opinion would be appreciated. /Please/. *Please*.
