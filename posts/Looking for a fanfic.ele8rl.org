:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In one of the opening chapters, Harry is about to be sorted by instead stands on one of the tables in the Great Hall and screams out the pain and suffering he suffered at the Dursleys - taking off his shirt to show scars and other damage. This causes a feedback that seems to release the Horcrux. Susan Bones calls in her aunt who comes to investigate (while Dumbledore tries to sweep it under the mat)

It then moves into a "what happened before" section that shows how Harry no longer lives at the Dursleys and was raised in the Wizarding world (I think the Greengrass family?) and knows more than Dumbledore would like.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
