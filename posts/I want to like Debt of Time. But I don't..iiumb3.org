I joined a fanfic reading club in discord recently (I found it here a few weeks ago) and we read a bunch of fics at once but everyone seemed to be on the Debt of Time train, so I hopped on.

They love it. I don't.

I've seen threads upon threads about the masterpiece that is Debt of Time over and over again, but I never read it. Honestly, fanfic is sort of one of those, no offense, embarrassing things I do but don't tell anyone I do. Heck, I created a throwaway just to post this in case one of my friends stumbled across it. Committing to something so long felt like a real nosedive into the deep end, and I've never been sure this was the type of hobby I wanted to do that with. (Fanfiction is still pretty taboo guys, sue me)

But I've been bored in quarantine, so I have been reading with the group. The group is raving about Debt of Time, so after finishing a Snarry I really liked (Breathe One Two by SolitaryEngel - go read it), I thought, okay fine, I cave. I'll read it.

I don't get it.

The plot is clean. I don't mean smut-free, because there is plenty of smut, especially in places that don't make sense, but otherwise I don't really like the characters that much, I hate the whole "Hermione is Mia!" angle, and while I can agree there are some really cool parts, it's just too long to enjoy at its pace. I think I would've liked it if it were 400,000 words. Maybe even 500,000 words would have been okay but 750,000 words???? It feels like too much.

Do you guys like Debt of Time? Am I crazy for just...not?


** Yes I agree. It's really just JARRING how much obviously bad fanfics I come across - with like two dimensional, over the top caricatures for characters, extreme illogical bashing, and fucking unnecessary SMUT (I only think a sex scene is necessary in any book or movie or TV show when it advances the characters or the plot in some way, otherwise leave it out; I'm not there to rub my fucking bean) - with like hundreds of reviews saying it's "OMG THE BEST THING EVER IT HAS SO MUCH DEPTH AND CHARACTER." Are they all seeing a different fanfic than the one I do? Most of these super popular high reviewed ones are just outright awful. I tend to read ones with a lot less reviews, after some searching around the fanfic sites.

*** I don't think it's necessarily BAD but I wouldn't say it's amazing either. I think it's a big accomplishment cos of the size of it, but I just don't care about Hermione or the Marauders in this fic and there is nothing that makes me want to care about them either. I can't connect to the character moods.

This group usually picks really good stuff so I'm going to keep reading with them but I will sit out the debt of time discussion i think

**** just wanted to add that harry crow is this example for me. everyone raves about it but i think it's really terrible. at least Debt of Time is somewhat well-written and just struggles with emotional connection and pacing. Harry Crow is BAD

** That story is a Rube Goldberg machine for getting Hermione laid. I admire the skill required to construct this machine, but the goal seems pointless.

** I've read Debt of Time twice. I do like it, but my views on it have changed as I've distanced myself from it. On a second reading, I tend to skim parts... and honestly, I wish Mia had ended up with Remus over her final partner. That relationship dynamic was much more healthy.

To me, Hermione comes across as a Mary Sue and has plot armor for a lot of her "bad" decisions. While the physical aspects of writing (grammar, spelling, mechanics, etc.) are well done, there is definitely plot and character work to be done. That said, Shaya Lonnie is excellent at what she does (writing beyond-novel length stories /for free/) and I did enjoy my read of it.

** Yeah, that's normal. Fanfic readers have different tastes --- and I don't mean "good" and "bad." I mean that, depending on who you ask, you'll pretty much get 1,000 different reasons that people read fanfic. Different readers look for a pretty broad variety of tropes and writing styles in their fiction.

And there's such a huge variety of different kinds of HP fanfiction that it's normal to click with people over certain fics and then meanwhile totally disagree about others.

I'm sure the book club will get around to reading something that you like again.
