If what i'm looking for doesn't exist then I would appreciate any decent Harry/Ginny fics that are not complete fluffs and have a more serious/well written plot, the longer the better.


** Hail Odysseus, linkffn(10645463), comes the closest to your requirement. But I'm not sure she was any 'lighter' than him.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

** Ah, the only one I can think of at the moment is a fluffy one shot. Not what you're asking for, so I'm sorry, but if anyone else in this thread wants to read it:

** Well, linkffn(5957714) has dark-ish Harry who turns away from Voldemort eventually, AND it's Harry/Ginny.

**** I read this fic before the rewrite was started, and, though it was an interesting and compelling story, it really was in need of some proofreading.

I'd say, don't wait, read the rewrite first and then continue with the original.

  A rewrite of the first part in my Dark Prince Trilogy. What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? Book One of the Dark Prince Trilogy.
