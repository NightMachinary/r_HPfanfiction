It doesn't have to be Harry as the protagonist. I'm just looking for some well written over-powered fun.


** I had high hopes for this thread and now I'm just disappointed :( since I've already read everything that was recommended.

Does anybody know any fics that would fit in this thread but are less known or were started less than a year ago?

I never see this recommended and it's one of my favs. It's very AU but has some excellent world building and great OCs. It starts off a bit cliche as some older fics tend to do but quickly gets more original. I will say that, although Ron isn't really central to the story, they do bash him pretty hard. It has a sequel that is unfortunately abandoned.

**** Sadly already read when I was on vampires in hp binge ;). I loved Miranda's work and was so disappointed when sequel got abandoned. It was quite a while since I've read it (and by a while I mean years) so it might be a good reread for me. Thanks for the rec, I think it will be great to go back :)
