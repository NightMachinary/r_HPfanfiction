So I've been reading this Fem!Harry/George fic, it's well written, has a nice chapter-to-word ratio, well paced (a real rarity), and over 700,000 words. Typically these all go into the win column for me to be occupied for at least a couple of weeks. Today I decided to drop it and here is why. Nothing is different. Everything is the same. Fem!Harry is spunky, acerbic, and a delight to read. What changes would this new protagonist bring to the table. Let me save you the time, no changes. There is nothing different from canon. Oh look, here's Remus in the Shrinking Shack. Did he forget to take the potion, turning into a werewolf, and allowing Pettigrew to escape? Absolutely. Did Fem!Harry leave Crouch Sr. alone with Krum, so Krum can be stunned and so Crouch Sr. could disappear? You Betcha. Fem!Harry and Ron have a dramatically different relationship, will Ron still throw a hissy fit when Fem! Harry's name comes out of the cup? Yup. The most egregious example is Fem!Harry and Ron went to Hogwarts in a different way in second year, therefore Ron's wand never broke. Oh, that means they'll have to find a different way to get rid of Lockhart! How do you think they did it? If your answer was Ron breaking his wand later in the year anyway for no apparent reason then you win the special prize! Therefore nothing changes, Lockhart still obliviates himself in the same way, and nothing changes.

Why write hundreds of thousand words of a fic if you just parrot canon? What is the point of you writing anything at all if it's just the same? There is no reason for me to want to read your fic if you don't actually /do/ anything. If I wanted to read the Harry Potter plot I would just read the books! I don't even care if the plot is stupid because a stupid plot is better than a plageristic (is that a word?) boring one. Just be original, or even be cliched, just don't be exactly the same.

I'm the opposite. Long fics (500k+) almost never entertain me throughout the fic, so I avoid anything more than 400k words unless there are stunning reviews. The problem is that rarely does the author ever actually plan out 500k+ worth of content from the beginning (or near the beginning). Often, they get to the end of the original content they had planned and have to try and find a way to hobble together the next story arcs in a story that has already met its resolution.

As far as sticking close to canon, this is a common occurrence in fanfiction and just simply comes down to bad writing. Coming up with something new an original is tough, and some people aren't willing to put in the time to change canon appreciatively. Just close the story and begin a new one.

Pureblood Pretense in particular is amazing at dropping hints or events that seem insignificant or irrelevant, but then resurface a year or two in the future in ways which make you wonder how it was possibly all planned out.

At the very least, most fics longer than about 300k words will slowly start losing my interest unless it's vastly different from canon.

** I agree with you completely. But here's the thing, let's say you're writing a 5th-year divergence, but the earlier years also have to be written to explain some differences, special abilities, and so on. The outcomes of the years 1-4 have to be roughly the same for certain important events to happen (Voldemort's ressurection, etc.) It's a problem I ran into when writing my own story, unfortunately I don't have a good solution.

**** Somewhat related:

Several fics start off with a couple of chapters telling the readers who this never-before-heard-of "Harry Potter" character is. You know, in case someone's been living in a cave for a very long period of time and just got out.

Then they continue with a description of the normality-obsessed Dursleys, and their appearances in long-necked, horse-faced and obese details. Then they usually describe Harry in stereotypically fanfic fashion, and finally surprising the readers with the fact that he's /not/ completely Dursley-approved normal, no, he's a /wizard!/ Bet you didn't see that coming!

It's also usually mentioned where his room is, depending on where the fic (hopefully!) deviates from and branches off of the canon story line. There are a total of 2 - two possibilities here. It's very important to inform the readers properly in case they were forbidden to read Harry Potter by their witchcraft-fearing parents.

Honestly, /nobody/ stumbles across a HP fanfic without any clues about the canon story. There's /so much/ that could, and should, be left out.

And don't get me started on the impossible-to-avoid Hedwig. She's all over Harry like stink on a troll. He /always/ ends up with Hedwig, even if bloody Voldemort himself has to buy her and give her as a gift to Harry. It's the one canon rail station that it's near-impossible to avoid. Not to mention her obsession with ear-nipping and cuffing various characters over the head while flying.

Canon rails. Canon rails everywhere.

I'm starting to appreciate the modus operandi of the Joker. I wish I could blow fanfics up and laugh maniacally at the destruction.

/Boom!/ Recover from /that/, Hedwig! ... aaand she's a bloody Phoenix...

**** Also also, if the writer adds events that were not present in the original series or that were but are significantly enough changed from the original version, then it's possible to save the pacing that you'd think would get skewed by rushing through events not to repeat them.

And also times three, switching the perspective to that of another character is also a thing that allows you to write about events that are not changed much without writing about the exact same thing; for example, writing about the troll debacle from the perspective of Hermione or, I don't know, Snape, could make things more interesting because it is not going to play out exactly the same as the narration will be coloured by the character's personality and thoughts.

You have at least three ways out that let you avoid parroting the same stuff:

- Just don't write it. You can have information about things that happened characters earlier without describing them directly. The character can talk about them, think about them, write and read about them. I remember having few fics like that in my PtR, but I haven't read any yet and don't remember names now.
- Just compress and skip things that stay the same. For example On the Way to Greatness linkffn(4745329) does that. Though it really should be even more compressed.
- Show only differing moments. For example On the Wings of a Phoenix linkffn(3000137) does that.

No. This is not true. If the plot isn't different, then all of this can be explained and integrated into the story. If things are different enough that you have to write the earlier years, then the plot would be different enough that it would be worthwhile to write those years.

*** To be fair, the only really big point of divergence I can see is the fall of Boromir, since I doubt Obi Wan can challenge Balrog without preparation and studying the enemy. But Kenobi could stop Boromir from going for the Ring, and thus Brotherhood would continue to Mordor unbroken. Olorin goes to Rohan alone, and while he can deal with this situation alone, the Pellennor Fields battle is catastrophic without the Army of Dead. Gondor falls and Orcs continue to the West.

At the same time, Frodo's mission is much easier and he completes it a little bit faster. Yay... I guess...

What would work much, much better, is if Kenobi came to Middle-Earth a couple of years earlier and... I'd say, joined Balin's Moria expedition. Now THAT would majorly affect the plot of LOTR and still lead to a better outcome.

They would tell people that she went to a boarding school for troubled young women. Dudley still offered to stick her head in toilets, and she still learned to snap back, "Really, Duds? The poor toilet's never had anything as nasty as your head down it, it might hurt it," and run. Harry was the kind of girl who came home with scabby knees, who snuck the kitchen shears in the dead of night to snip her dark messy hair short.

*** So far the only Fem Harry I have read and liked (that i can remember), was Effects and Side Effects (sadly abandoned at just under 500k). Its a multi (F/F+) so not everyone's cup of tea, but I think it was the "style" of Fem harry that made it so intriguing and interesting, since hes not exactly "Fem" from the get go, but rather via side effects.

I do feel like there was another but for the life of me I am drawing a blank now.

I have also found it hard to find any good fem Harry fics, and I think a lot of the time its because either the author does not stray far enough away from male Harry, or forces a Fem Harry for pairing reasons leading to mediocre background and writing.

** I completely agree with your rant. I find this an awful lot in Slytherin!Harry AUs. So for the Philosopher's Stone, the group doing the canon thing is Harry and Draco with either Pansy or Hermione, and they do the EXACT same things in the exact same ways the original trio did in the book. The absolute worst thing though is when authors lift chunks of text directly from the books and put them in the same scene in their fic. If I wanted to read the books, I would do so!

And often in stories like the above mentioned PoS AU, usually Harry and Draco are best friends or will have a romantic relationship later on so the author has the Malfoys friendly to Harry, which causes problems when the author gets to the equivalent of book 6. The author is not willing or able to come up with an original plot to go with year 6 so the series is abandoned after the 5th story. I see this all the time.

Now that said, I like reading Hogwarts Era fics so obviously I don't mind some canon in my plot. But instead of a word-for-word rundown, I much prefer to see canon as the frame for the picture that is the fic but the picture itself is unique. For example, I read a story that was original but included several canon scenes such as the Battle of the Seven Potters, but the scene was was written in the perspective of Hermione on her flight with Kingsley. Changing the point of view character in a standard canon scene is a good way to get some original story telling into a canon-inspired scene.

I have also seen a story follow canon in the background but the story itself is original. For example, there was a story where Draco still has to repair the vanishing cabinet and kill Dumbledore as in canon but Draco confided in Dumbledore and joined his side as a spy, with Hermione, initiated early in the Order, as his handler. So while yes, Draco did do his HBP book thing eventually, the journey along the way was different. Another example would be writing about the experiences of a student/staff member of Hogwarts within the time frame of the 7th book and show how the events of canon are affecting them.

So there are ways to tell a story and use canon as a guide without resorting to a straight copy with new names, but unfortunately, not all authors do this.

** I hate this stuff, especially all the mental gymnastics that goes into ensuring that events stay the same.

For example there is Innocent series linkffn(9469064; 10093402; 10858061; 11732213).

The first pre-Hogwarts part had quite a few problems, but at it also have some interesting ideas and set-up quite a few changes which should heavily influence plot of the following years. Harry knows of the magic earlier, Sirius is free, they know about horcruxes, Harry befriends youngest Weasleys earlier, and certain character is set-up to end up in the different house.

But in the end there are barely any consequences, things get forcibly put into the story rails set up by original books. Complete waste of time.

Other example - The Serpent's Gaze: Hatching Snakes linkao3(3764659). Author of this "work" even asked for opinions on this reddit and I my feedback sums well what I think of those rehashes - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4f6eyf/promotion_a_more_ambitious_boy_slytherinharry_au/d27yo0j]]

Why would anyone write stuff like that is beyond me, I much prefer super Harry soul bond manipulative Dumbledore wish fulfilment fics (at least until they don't go into muggles being danger for wizards, which triggers me). At least they try something new even with repeating all those generic clishes.

  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.
