Hello, myself and a few chums from The Teacher's Lounge forum on Fanfiction.net have a cabin at Camp NaNo and we have a few empty spaces in our "Cabin" still available. If any one is interested please PM your Camp NaNo user name and I will add you on a first come first served basis. Lots of fun and support. Cheers.


** I just wanted to say thanks for the reminder :) I keep forgetting that's a thing. Hopefully I'll actually be able to finish 50k this time because November and April are both horrible months for me.

*** No problem - we have 2 spaces left in our "cabin" if you would like in.

***** Basically its your peer support group/writers circle, in this case based upon interest or genre. You can choose to be randomly allocated a cabin though if you fancy.

You get a dedicated real time chat to brainstorm or have virtual write ins or just decompress if your brain overloads. The cabins also have word goals extrapolated from the goals set by individual "campers" so the whole cabin "Wins" or "Loses" together - motivating everyone to pull together and support one another.

****** Sure, sounds fun! Do you still have that spot? Might help keep me motivated!

******* Yup, you just need to go to campnanowrimo.org and register an account and project and I'll add you to the cabin.

** Is there a community page where I can find all the stories participating in the NaNoWriMo?

*** The camp forums are hosted on the main NaNoWriMo site. Because hosting the projects online is not part of NaNo there is no central point to see all of the stories - however there is a thread for synopses and excerpts.
