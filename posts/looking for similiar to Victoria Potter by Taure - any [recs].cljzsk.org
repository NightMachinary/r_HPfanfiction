Hi all,

anyone got any similiar stories to Victoria Potter by Taure? im enjoying the friendship theme that definitely picks it up well from the first books. This might be the first fem!Harry i've read and its enjoyable. " with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life " who has anything similiar?


** I'm still waiting to find out if standing naked during a storm was worth it.

Where you at, Taure?!?

** It's been a while since I've read it, but I think PseudoLeigha's [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/340966][Mary Potter series]] had similar themes. Unfortunately the latest one hasn't been updated in over a year, but they're still still worth a read. First one is linkao3(5044273)

  After 5th year, Harry takes charge of his own life. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war, and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Long, slower-paced fic. Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, NOT Evil!Harry, No Romance. -ABANDONED-
