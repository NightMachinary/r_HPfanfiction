#+TITLE: Due to the lack of green-eyed people in the series, other than Lily and Harry, my headcanon is that every single person with an unspecified eye colour has green eyes.

** After some quick research, I found out that in 2014 almost half of the UK has blue eyes (30% green). I was honestly expecting something like 20 black/50 brown/15 blue/15 green in all of Europe outside of Scandinavia.

*** In my country of origin, green eyes are far more common than blue, so this is really weird. Out of my friend group, three have green eyes and I'm the only one with brown ones. You can imagine my surprise when I googled how common they are, and green eyes only clocked in at 2% of the population.

**** It's because, to the best of my knowledge, Green Eyes only appeared in the populations of Western/Northern Europe. They may be pretty common there, but where you add countries like China or India with billions of dark eyed people, they worldwide population is really small.

** This reminds me of editing my first-ever Nanowrimo draft, and realizing that every.single.character had "inky black hair." I face-palmed hard and then went through randomly assigning blond and brown and red hair to people.

Just like JKR clearly loves redheads, maybe SHE doesn't know lots of green eyed people? So she wanted her special snowflake boy and his magical mama to have the special pretty eyes?

** I always thought that Harry had special emerald eyes. Like a color that people don't normally, if ever, has. I always picture that some people in the universe has green eyes, obviously, but not like Harry's. They're greenish-blue, greenish-hazel, forest green, sea foam green. And you get the point. Harry Potter is the main character so he's special. That's just how it worked for me when I was eleven, twelve, thirteen, etc reading the books. And since Harry is special with emerald eyes ‚Äújust like his mother‚Äù so she had these really special eyes too. Read a great fan fiction where the emerald eyes they had were directly linked to the killing curse giving them an edge for necromancy. It was amazing! (And for added reference Lily was the child of a great-squib who was kicked from their family for not having magic. After a generation the Magic came back inside of Lily. She never knew.)

** I practically never come across people with green eyes.

Tbh I don't think there's a single time in my entire life where I've seen someone and noticed how green their eyes were without for some reason or another taking a close look. I've seen vibrant blue eyes, but not green.
