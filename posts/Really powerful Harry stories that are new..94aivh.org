Does anyone know of any recently completed, or published stories that have Harry as a relatively powerful wizard. By powerful I mean he can at least contend with the likes of Voldemort, and Dumbledore by fourth year. The more powerful he is, the funner. Let's say the story had to have been either published, or completed in 2018, and if it's published, at least have finished second year.

I'm not looking for arguments about wanting a powerful Harry story, trust me I know, and usually dislike indy!Harry stories, and stories on a similar vein, but sometimes you just want to read a story for fun without the drama, or angst that comes about in such stories. Having the character being powerful is one of those ways

Points for originality, and internet cookies for good recent crack fics(guilty pleasure). Also this is for anyone else as well, so don't stick too close to the requirements, imagine i'm 50 people wanting slightly different things.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

*** What reddit rule would posting a link violate? I mean posting links is kind of Reddit's whole schtick.

*** This is a pretty good story if you don't mind OP stories and Harry with lots of girls. I don't so I thought it was good, but I can see why it isn't for everyone. The sex is way underage though.

** Rebirth of the Founders is great and was just updated again. Basically Harry is reborn as Salazar Slytherin. Totally badass. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12026413/1/Rebirth-of-the-Founders]]
