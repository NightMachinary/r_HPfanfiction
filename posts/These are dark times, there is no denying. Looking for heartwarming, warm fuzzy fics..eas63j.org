  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. ‚ÄúA what?‚Äù Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.‚ÄúA Chizpurfle,‚Äù Hermione hissed back. ‚ÄúNewt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy mam told me about them,‚Äù Seamus Finnigan said darkly. ‚ÄúShe said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.‚Äù‚ÄúThey eat wands?‚Äù Harry asked, horrified.‚ÄúYeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‚Äòem all out.‚Äù

** I was out of the fanfic game for a long while, so I'm still exploring and building up my recommendations, but here are a couple I've read recently that I loved.

So this one is Fred in the afterlife, which sounds sad, but it's funny and upbeat Fred Weasley tomfoolery (this author also has a related fic called Passports Required): linkao3(6521176)

Hermione/Fred: linkao3(6470221)
