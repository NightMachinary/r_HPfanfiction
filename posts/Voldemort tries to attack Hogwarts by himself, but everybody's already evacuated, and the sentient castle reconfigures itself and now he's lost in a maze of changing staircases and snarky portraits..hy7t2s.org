Optional: And Hogwarts has the personality of GlaDos.


** A common misconception was that Hogwarts had a Room of Requirement, in actuality, Hogwarts WAS a Room a Requirement. As Voldemort stepped into the castle the walls began realigning and voice began echoing through the halls, "Oh, it's you. You monster. Welcome to the Hogwarts Enrichment Center. Lets begin testing."

*** "The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start."-the voice said.

** So many lines work from the game.

“Because despite your violent behavior, the only thing you've managed to break so far is my heart.

“I'd just like to point out that you were given every opportunity to succeed.”

“Unlikable. Liked by no one. A bitter, unlikable loner whose passing shall not be mourned.”

“The part of you that could have survived indefinitely is gone. I just struck you from the permanent record.”

That's just the first game.

**** I wonder if I could make a 'Still Alive' parody.

Edit: I worked on it a bit! Sample:

#+begin_quote
  But there's no sense crying over every Dark Lord.

  You just keep on fighting with your Griffindor Sword.

***** Can I add to it? I'm not sure about the You's, the He's, and the I's. But I'm taking a break.

This is the triumph

He's making the walk there

It's his last

It's hard to undertake

you're final action

Avada Kedavra

You have to die

Before it ends

Have you ever left a man

Without a piece of his soul

“But there's no sense crying over every Dark Lord.

You just keep on fighting with your Gryffindor Sword.”

** This is /perfect/

1. The Diadem Horcrux is still in Hogwarts.
2. Hogwarts can use it to trap his shade and shove it into an endless series of homunculi for 'testing'.

** "Well hello there, Tom" came a voice from above. Seething with anger from being referred to as his dirty muggle name, Lord Voldemort spun around, wand out at the ready. In his final years, Tom Riddle was slowly becoming more and more delusional, his mind slipping further by the day. Prone to hallucinations, and fits of anger that followed in the deaths of his servants, Lord Voldemort had slowly killed off almost every Death Eater in his service. The smart ones, the few of which existed, had fled months prior, leaving only the most loyal, and subsequently craziest, followers behind. Maybe this could explain why the formidable mass murderer known as Voldemort had chosen to come to Hogwarts by himself, filled by his own illusions of grandeur, and an iron belief that he was destined to rule not only the Wizarding world, but the Muggle world as well.

** How about a Hogwarts with the personality of HAL from Space Odyssey? Better plot twist..the reason it's abandoned is because everyone finds Hogwarts becoming more and more sentient but in a bad way.
