By still active, I don't mean if they're still up, I mean if there is still frequent activity on them. For example, FictionAlley. That site is still up but it hardly ever gets a new post anymore, apart from the odd person looking for a fic and a couple of dumb Harmony shippers.

And most of the fan sites seem to have died out over the past few years. Heck, I'd still love to know if Restrictedsection.org is ever coming back. So yeah, any HP fansites that still have somewhat active communities? The only one I know of is DLP.


** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/][Sink Into Your Eyes]] is definitely going strong. I see another 7 stories updated since yesterday, including ones from our fellow redditors [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] and [[/u/BigFatNo]]

** [[http://pottermoreforum.net/]] is pretty active. [[https://www.potterforums.com/]] is also active, though not as much as the former.

** Potions and Snitches? Though, it's a niche site for gen Harry and Snape fics, but stories are still being uploaded/updated fairly regularly there.

** It isn't a HP fansite at all, but spacebattles still has a lot of fanfic on it, almost all genfic, I've never seen a shipping focused fic there.

Fics Like 'Seventh Horcrux' and 'Applied Cultural Anthropology or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus' were posted there first. Decent standards for writing as well.
