As much as I don't care about the original twilight stories, I do enjoy crossovers in that universe when romance isn't the focus. As you can guess the problem is that almost all twilight fanfiction writers focus on the romance rather than the world.

Please give some recommendations.


** A few that I enjoyed: linkffn(The Girl Who imprinted; Follow you; Chrysoclorous; You with the lion's roar; Twilight Night; Forever Harry)

The first is hilarious, in my opinion. The second is really sweet, but unfortunately in a massive hiatus or abandoned. The third is my favourite twilight fanfic, even source fanfic. The last 3 are cute complete ones.

EDIT: I only now noticed that you said you didn't want romance, of those that I suggested, the ones with the least romance are TGWI and Follow You, though they have romance.

  The Volturi ran off with their tails between their legs, but a gathering that large of supernatural creatures attracted attention from the magical world. The magical world is still rebuilding from Voldemort so Harry gets sent. He finds trouble quickly with vampires - and an infatuated shape shifter.

** I've had this idea for ages for a story where Harry shows up as the head/negotiator for a squad from the ICW to investigate/mediate the gathering of all the vampires during breaking dawn. Similar to The Girl Who Imprinted but actually showing up during the confrontation.

They're known to the Volturi, but a complete surprise to many of the other vampires.

Could make for an interesting starting point.

** What should be the focus? It's like asking for something like Romeo and Juliet, but with the focus on the world, not the romance.

The only story I know is linkffn(4037128), and yes, it has romantic aspects but to a certain extent, it also describes the Vampire community.

btw., the story is complete even if the completed sign is missing.

*** The world. Politics. Death. Destruction. Rebuilding. Twilight or The Vampire Diaries world has much more potential than Romeo and Juliet. There are many(few compared to the total) Twilight fanfiction that shift their focus away from the romance. It's just hard to find a crossover with that.
