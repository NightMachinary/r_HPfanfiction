:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The HP fanfiction has Harry living in Grimmauld place and turns the place into an apartment of sorts where werewolves and vampires can rent/stay. Also eventually Harry ends up in the ministry and was questioned on the treatment of the creatures living with him, and the ministry was trying to take them away from him. But Harry pleads to the ministry not to take his family away from him.


** It doesn't quite fit, and it's not the main premise of the fic, but there's a scene in Stand Against the Moon that is similar to that. Linkao3(2378855)

#+begin_quote
  Cursed against his will, Harry made the best of his life until he found himself, again, wandering in Death's realm. When Death offers him a second chance, a chance to right the wrongs he'd been blind to for too long, he can't possibly refuse.
