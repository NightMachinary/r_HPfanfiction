I'm already questioning why I'm doing this, and I haven't even started. I'll just do an introduction for now. I'm writing this part before reading anything.

So, Partially Kissed Hero. We all know it, the fic is just about a step below My Immortal as far as infamy goes. It was written by Perfect Lionhart, who you may also know from such stunning works as Chunin Exam Day or Stepping on Worm, and who also goes by Skysaber sometimes. Do I even need to introduce the guy? His fics have been shat on (probably rightly so) for the last decade, anyone who is slightly familiar with either Harry Potter or Naruto fanfiction has heard of him. So I decided PKH was the perfect fic to review. Will it be as bad as people say? Probably, yeah. I've read Chunin Exam Day, once in my misspent youth and then again last year to refresh my memory, and I tried reading PKH at least twice before, though I've never gone farther than the first few chapters.

As for how I'm doing this, I decided to go more in-depth than either my review of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ebv6rt/a_subjective_review_of_core_threads/][Core Threads]] or of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fa4r2f/a_subjective_review_of_the_archeologist/][The Archeologist]] - I'll try to do 5 chapters every day, so allowing for a few missed days I should be finished in less than a month.

Once again, this is a subjective review. This is my opinion. I am not qualified to give any kind of literary analysis, so don't expect anything approaching insight. I ramble and digress with the best of them.

Now, let's read this thing and see what the fuss is all about.

Spoilers for the fic, though if you were interested I would tell you go read something else. Like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12132374/1/Six-Pomegranate-Seeds][Six Pomegranade Seeds]], I'll never stop recommending that fic - never found one quite like it, if you know any do tell.

*starts reading the thing*

Yeah, I can't deal with more than a chapter today. Screw reading 5 per day, I'll see on a day to day basis how much I'm willing to subject myself to this.

*Chapter 1 - The Diagon Alley shopping trip that never ends, except that it ends at the end of the chapter. Still long though.*

Starting off, I'm beginning to think that I had this fic confused with another one - I vaguely remembered the dementor attack that dislodges the horcrux being at the start of fifth year, but this fic takes place during Prisoner of Azkaban. We'll see.

Also I'm a fucking idiot, because I was expecting PL to make up an incident involving a dementor, and it didn't occur to me that it would be on the train. I'm probably already losing brain cells.

The central premise of the fic is not /too/ bad - PL wanted Harry to not be in the same compartment with Lupin so that the dementor can affect him more, so he made up an excuse (Harry and Hermione go in the train earlier to read) and extrapolated a reason at the start of the summer that made events line up. So after Fudge leaves him in Diagon Alley, Harry decides to look up books about Sirius Black and finds an entire section of books dedicated to both himself and his parents. Reading about them transforms him into Ravenclaw!Harry and he "starts using his mind" as PL puts it. He buys books, reads ahead, gets in contact with Hermione and asks her for her notes, stuff like that. Just very trite Smart!Harry tropes.

This chapter is dominated by Harry buying stuff. It's THE shopping trip chapter to end all shopping trip chapters. I'm guessing a lot of people copied stuff from this one, because it has everything and the literal kitchen sink in it. I'm not kidding, he actually buys a kitchen. Probably the only thing it's missing is the walk-in trunk with a mansion inside.

He buys, and I'm pulling this from memory so I'm probably missing a few things, four bookcase trunks, a portable 'master-level' potions kit with self-stirring rods that can brew something like 6 potions at once, a kitchen, a desk with two chairs (for him and Hermione, but explicitly not Ron because he's a lazy fuck) and a load of drawers, a wardrobe with clothes, a book that all Slytherins buy that teaches them potion theory, a load of other miscellaneous books, some magical stationery and a kneazle. Because fuck Hedwig, that's why.

He also gets taken advantage of by a shady salesman who pushes shit on him, but it's fine because he still benefits from it. From him he gets an enormous wizarding tent, a full set of 'British explorer' clothes, a belt with auto-sorting pouches that he basically throws everything I've mentioned into, and a full trunk of language lozenges, which are basically candies that teach you languages.

The part about him going around the Alley and asking people to teach him tricks straight up gave me flashbacks to CED. Had to take a pause after that.\\
Now, a (not so) quick aside on language lozenges, because it kind of exemplifies everything wrong with this shopping trip in a convenient nutshell. By PL himself, each lozenge costs "only a handful of galleons (no more than seven apiece)". Harry gets pushed into buying a complete set by the shady salesman, without even knowing what they were or what all he was buying from him - and this is already kind of shit writing, but not the point. The real question here is, how much fucking money did Harry spend this summer? PL doesn't say, he literally only mentions the word 'galleon' once and it's in that part I quoted. How many languages is a 'complete' set, which apparently has all the world's languages? I know I'm nitpicking and it's a minor thing in the scope of the whole fic, but it grinds my teeth something fierce. By [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers][Wikipedia]] there are 91 languages over the world that have over ten million active speakers - and definitely hundreds more beside. But the set doesn't cover just those, it explicitly contains dead languages like Latin, Ancient Greek, Celtic (not actually a language btw), and even deader languages like Egyptian, Sumer and Babylonian. This one thing alone must have cost him hundreds of galleons, and it just makes me want to scream.

Ah, since I mentioned the shady salesman*, I wonder what the hell is the deal with PL and colonialism, because there are some really weird vibes there. Like, read this part

#+begin_quote
  [...] where they sold Safari garb, and the owner there ignored all of the child's requests and outfitted Harry with everything [...] and everything the old gentry might need out in the wild - down to and including beads charmed to be attractive to natives in case you'd like to trade for their services as guides or bearers or whatever.
#+end_quote

Yes, I'm sure Harry Potter, 13 years old British kid in the 90's, will definitely need your safari kit and mindfucking beads to deal with 'natives'. Fucking hell, I have no idea what to even say.

*I call him shady because that's my impression of him, but PL doesn't really address anything of the sort, like we're supposed to think this guy is normal. The guy who makes unaccompanied 13 years olds buy mountains of shit they definitely don't need.

Let's see, what else do I have to talk about... Harry switches his electives to Aritmancy and Runes, since those were the ones Lily took. No, James is not mentioned here, probably because the Lily thing is just a thinly veiled excuse by PL. There is probably going to be some drama against him switching with Dumbledore, but I'm leaving it for when I get there.

Ah, the Ron (and by extension Weasley) bashing is still mild, but definitely there. I'm expecting it to ramp up over time to Sasuke levels, but for now it's just a few lines of him being called lazy and stupid. Harry still thinks of him as a friend, but it probably won't last - he and Ginny have already been excluded from the train compartment in favor of Neville and Luna (Colin and Dennis were also there, but more as an excuse for Ron and Ginny to have to get another compartment).

There was also a passage about him not being eager to get mothered by Molly since he 'reconnected' with his parents, so I'm expecting some fairly heavy bashing down the line, of the "she stole my money and tried to set me up with Ginny with love potions" variety.\\
I'm expecting a break from the Weasley family fairly soon, except the twins since they were receptive to Harry's gift to Ron when he wasn't (the aforementioned Slytherin-only potions book).

The chapter ends as the dementor nears and Harry passes out, described in two sentences.

So, I'm done. This was the first chapter of Partially Kissed Hero, and I still feel like I'm making a mistake. Like most of PL's works, the insidious nature of it is not yet manifest - only the barest hints of corruption are apparent, the better to lure unsuspecting victims. Like the Rings of Sauron.

See you tomorrow if I can muster the will to continue this self-flagellation.

*** Over the top, cartoonish, moustache twirlingly evil Dumbledore is what I remember.

I think I stopped in mid 50s too, and the only reason I read that far was pure morbid curiosity on just how evil Dumbledore was gonna end up.

I mean, he had actually forced Fawkes to do whatever he said with a binding ritual, he and Snape both had horcruxes that they repeatedly used to resurrect themselves. Because Dumbledore just loves horcruxes so much.

I did find it kind of funny that Dumbledore thought the Colonel, as in KFC, was a legit dark lord though.

Someone already attempted a fic chain about that a while back. The general consensus at the time ended up being that making dump-threads for every single chapter got repetitive and unfunny, and also stirred up too much pointless drama. The maker of the threads was persuaded to stop after two chapters.

Spot on review though, if I recall correctly the Weasley/Dumbledore bashing gets worse real quick. Also, it annoys the hell out of me when fanfic writers just hand wave in shit to make Harry's life more convenient without explaining why /everyone on the planet/ isn't also doing that thing.

** I read about 50 chapters of the story years ago, back when I had never heard of PL.

My initial response was to like the concept of "Harry with a backbone", as I was just getting into that phase of fanfiction in general terms. Some of the humour was well-done too. I also despise Dumbledore and the Weasleys as characters even today, so the bashing of them appealed to me as well. The reason I stopped at around the 50 mark was that the story just bored the shit out of me. PL even said that he enjoys raw data dumps and that he would delay any "action" because reviewers kept pestering him to liven up the story. That type of pettiness was an alarm bell.

Things got worse, as many of us know. I initially put the likes of the shady salesman talking about "natives" down to PL wanting to explore the deeply-ingrained racism of Wizarding society that exists even in canon, but then realised that it could very well be self-insertion, as his later comments on Islam indicate. Furthermore, his treatment of women makes me deeply uncomfortable. I have absolutely no problem with despicable characters in fiction; racism, sexism and other forms of bigotry in characters are interesting topics to explore... until I have the feeling that these are the author's real views, at which point I "nope" straight out of there.

Some of George R.R. Martin's characters are the biggest assholes that I've ever heard tell of, but Martin himself is a lovely man and his writing is impeccable. The distinction has to be made that these scumbags are his characters, not him. In comparison, Perfect Lionheart is no George R.R. Martin.

Oh, and he literally starts World War III in this story.

That was until I started seeing some racist undertones but it coukd also just be ignorant shit writing... nope definitely fing racist defending himself saying all Muslims are Nazis.
