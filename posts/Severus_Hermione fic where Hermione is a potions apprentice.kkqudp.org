:END:
I vaguely remember a fic that started out with Hermione taking some sort of test to brew a healing potion to see if she could be an apprentice. Mid-potion she thought it would be best to add MORE Phoenix tears for a stronger base or something. The cauldron blew up and she failed, but Severus took her on anyway because he saw she was experimenting. But she needed to add something to counterbalance it.

That's pretty much all I remember? I think there's something about them going to a beach coast or something but I could be mixing up fics. Last I read it was in early high school so over 8/9 years ago?
