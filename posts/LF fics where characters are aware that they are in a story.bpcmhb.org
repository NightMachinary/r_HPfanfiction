Deadpool-style 4th wall breaks, "wait, the Herbology Professor is called Sprout and the Arithmancy Professor is called Vector? Who came up with that?", plot armor being used consciously, "this is right where a Deus Ex Machina should appear... oh, hi Fawkes!", etc

#+begin_quote
  Part 1 of The Computational Error Series. George Weasley may be 40 years old now, but he still misses his twin dearly. And when he has the chance to go back to 1989 and see Fred alive again and stop everything from happening, he can't resist. George's relationship with everyone he loves, however, will change in the process. Time Travel. NoSlash. COMPLETE
