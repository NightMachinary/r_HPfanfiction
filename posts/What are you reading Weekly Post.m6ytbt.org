** Title:Clementine Author: shy_one. Rating: General Audiences

This is a brilliant new fic. Dudley has an explosively magical toddler and the Dursleys need Harry's help. It is very well written, with characters that are believable extensions of their canon counterparts. The chapter titles are great (“The Phonebook. Obviously” and “I thought the Chicken was Excellent”). Chapter 10 is particular treat, with a brilliant mic drop ending. I also like the side plot around Harry's Auror career, especially the way it ties in with the Dursleys reinserting themselves into his life. Although updates are a little slow, they are well worth the wait!

** I'm almost done with this amazing fanfic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23296162/chapters/55794568][The Disappearances of Draco Malfoy]]

I'm not good at summarizing so here's the author's summary: "The night that Harry and Dumbledore return from the cave, the Death Eaters are delayed from reaching the top of the Astronomy Tower for one more minute. Draco Malfoy lowers his wand.

A Deathly Hallows rewrite in which Draco accepts Dumbledore's offer to fake his death and go into hiding with the Order of the Phoenix."

It's got redemption, character development, and sloooow burn Dramione. 10/10 recommend.

** Stepping back : Harry go back in time and interact with marauders. Harry/Bellatrix story.\\
I like this kind of time travel stories and I really enjoyed the beginning. But at some point around the middle it goes to deep into a kind of endless loop of power-wankiness/super-emotional which kind of spoiled the fun. Still a nice read but it could have been much better without that.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** I'm rereading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11745900?view_adult=true&view_full_work=true][*Rose Petal Red*]] by /NonchalantxFish/ (Rating: Mature) for the third time because I felt like it.

I don't usually enjoy Slytherin politics but this fic takes away my voice of reason because it's so nicely done and it even keeps me invested the majority of the time. Also, it helps that the main character is basically a grown woman stuck in a child's body. Though what makes me mostly come back to it is world building, how AU it gets and the relationships between the characters. I love the Weasleys in this and all OCs. I genuinely care about them :)

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?

I loved this fic. Really different. It's Remus/Tonks but it's nothing like canon. It's an AU where Remus and other werewolves were trained to be Voldemort's assassins/bodyguards as young children. It's a totally different take on Remus, werewolves, and the HP universe overall. Almost 190k words, complete.

Only downside is that she's ruined me for most long fiction, most just don't compare to her work (though it isn't a downside for me, her fics are very wordy, and heavy on introspection, which might not be to some people's tastes).

*** She has a talent for depicting protagonists with unusual mental states. Sociopaths (The Good War, The Long Game, The Plan Series) , Magical Creatures (Her Mother's Love) and abuse/trauma survivors (To Reach Without). Their thought processes and motivations feel realistic and come through clearly. If you like reading mental therapy sessions in fiction (Jessica Yamada from Parahumans anyone?) you are likely to love it. And that's not even getting into the amazing worldbuilding shared common to her fics!

Cons: Her plots tend to get lost within the characters and worldbuilding leaving most of the works incomplete or untenably large (1M words of The Plan Series). Don't mind much though, this is one of the situations in which the journey is a lot more beautiful than the end.

** I'm almost done with The Merging, and it'd say it's 3.5/5.

It starts well, but later the story's spread too thin when the author keeps introducing new characters for Harry to interact with. That in itself is not that bad, but most of those characters star in one chapter, and then they are forgotten for the next few.

It's even worse considering the story is tagged as a Romance, and all those characters are supposed to be potential love interests, but when you finally get to know one of them the story moves on to the next one.

** I somehow stumbled onto an unusual fic that I just finished. I swear I don't only read Draco-centric fics! This one is pretty dark, but not in the evil wizard sort of way but rather on the topic of mental illness. It's ultimately a Drarry, but the focus of the story really isn't the romance part of it.

It was quite good, but also depressing to read so make sure you've got the constitution for it. There's also a morbid sense of humor throughout the fic, so if you can't do gallows humor you might not like the way some of the people joke. It's all a part of the greater scheme though, and the fic wouldn't have been the same without it popping up here and there.

The author has quite a few misspellings and misused words, so I get the sense that they either lacked a beta or might not be a native English speaker.

TW/CW: Talk of mental illness, eating disorders, addiction, and suicide.

As to why it sticks out for me, it fixes an issue with Canon that bothered me since the very beginning. Harry should not have been in that house after Riddle regained a body the way he did.

** Title: Bibliomancy

My thoughts: This was a reread. An older fic Irma Pince centric about libraries and existentialism. Definitely recommend if you haven't read it before! I think the author initially intended it to be a AU with more fics. But I liked this one.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13331355]])

I am mostly following along with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28860678][Pandemic]]. There is one chapter left so I decided to catch up on the shorter stories in the AU.

Title: Ballad of the Sugar Plum Fairy My thoughts: This is about Albus Dumbledore's story in Pandemic. I liked how he is written in the AU. So it was good to have a standalone one shot focusing on him. Definitely going on the reread list.

My thoughts: Bellatrix centric one shot in Pandemic. I really liked how this fic has a realistic take on Delphi's origins. Without spoiling too much, Narcissa is the one who ends the second war. She gets Voldemort to retire by giving him a kid to worry about. The whole AU is just wonderful what-if world building with beautiful writing. I loved how the female characters are written.

Title: The keepers of the flame of the ecumenical good

My thoughts: Draco centric one shot in Pandemic. Draco isn't my favorite in canon. The author does a good job of making him likable in this AU. I don't think this will be on my reread list because Draco.

Title: Eternal Sunshine of the Scourgified Mind

My thoughts: Not sure. Finding it hard to get into this fic. Maybe next week I can give more impressions.

** Currently rereading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7657235/][Path of the King]] by Neoalfa (M rated). It is a Fate/Stay Night fanfiction with some Tsukihime characters (some Tsukihime spoilers). It is basically a Caster route in fanfiction format, and it is really good. It hasn't been updated in a while, but I have hopes Neoalfa will return, he has had a year-long hiatus before, so there is still hope for more. Seriously it is great.

Speaking of Fate, there is a crossover with RWBY called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980608/][Small Mercies]] by Special FX (T rated) that explores a young Kotomine Kirei finding himself on Remnant. I have always found Kirei's character to be fascinating.

Edit: Didn't realise I was on [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]], I thought I was writing this on [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]]. My apologies for the irrelevant comment.

** I'm reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2802482/13/Can-I-call-you-Dad][Can I call you Dad?]] by Asher Elric

There are going to be a lot of spoilers so sorry. It's basically a sequel to the Cold Room. Harry, Remus, and Sirius become a family in the Cold Room but Sirius is still on the run. In this one, Harry got kidnapped by Narcissa (witch is his aunt) Remus is trying to get Harry back when Sirius is looking for Peter. Harry is at Malfoy Manor and he has a very nice room a =nd Narcissa is try to get Harry settled in but Harry keeps asking to go home. Harry meets a snake named Gervais and they become friends. Gervais helps Harry escape from Malfoy Manor. Harry finds himself in a village and goes into a wizarding restaraunt. The manager asks for his name and freaks out when Harry tells him. He says that everyone is looking for him. The manager gets in contact with the french ministry and says that he found Harry. Remus and Sirius hears the news and when Harry gets in there they tackle him in a group hug. Harry tells them about his new friend and they find out that Gervais thinks that Remus is Harry's mother. They laugh about that for a while and then they go home. That was the fanfiction and I loved it so much so I would recommed it. You might need to read the origanal first.
