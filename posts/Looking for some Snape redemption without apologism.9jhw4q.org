(is apologism a real word? As in, apologizing for someone's actions?)

Hey~

I've read enough fics with a good Snape who was good all along (or, oh no, just misunderstood), as well as an irredeemable Snape who is bad, was bad, and would always be bad. So does anyone know any stories where Snape goes "aw shucks, I'm a crappy person, lemme try and be a better human being" or something like that?

I think it would be really great to see Snape honestly regretting his bad choices, at literally any moment in his life (whether it's after joining the Death Eaters, after telling the prophecy to Voldemort, after 1981, after meeting Harry, after killing Dumbledore, or, hell, even after dying - it's magic, y'all), as long as it's /genuine/, not just "oh no my bad decisions affected me directly so I should stop", because that's not really being a better person, it's selfish and egocentric.

Anyway.

No restrictions~! Any lenght, AUs are fine, and I'm 100% ok with slash, but only maybe 50% ok with Snarry, so just let me know if it is?

Thanks in advance :)


** Panda this is such a good story request, yes I would love to read one like this too! :) How do I please write a "remind me" thing?

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11457669]]) should fit. In this one, he tries to do better after calling Lily a mudblood. It's a good story though it unnecessarily retreads canon and Snape feels kind of OOC.

  Albus Dumbledore rose to his feet, smiling at them in that way of his, like he knew something you didn't and he was proud of you for it. "Friends," he began.The door thudded open and the Marauders burst in, late and pink-cheeked with cold. The headmaster smiled at them, too, and Sirius gave a cheery little salute back.Severus sunk lower in his chair, staring witheringly over his butterbeer. "You told Potter about it, too?""He might as well put all that energy to good use," said Lily. "And, to be accurate, I told Remus.""But Potter, really?" said Severus."He and Black cooked up a jinx that gives you a boil every time you say a slur to a Muggleborn," said Lily. "It was either invite them to Alice's war club or bake them cookies, and I know where my skills lie."Severus sniffed. "Don't come crying to me if he tugs your pigtails.""Come crying to me if he pulls yours, and I'll deck him," said Lily.(Slight AU in which Severus apologizes, tries harder, and stays friends with Lily)

  The entire Wizarding world believes Lily Potter was murdered by Voldemort on that fateful night in 1981, including the man who would've given his immortal soul to save her. But there's another side to Lily's sacrifice, ancient charms and hidden truths that may have the power to change everything.

**** I think it would be fairly in character for him to figure out how to make his peace with it quickly. He grew up basically worshiping his parents, and once he got to Hogwarts everyone who talked about them just went on about how wonderful and perfect they were. If his mother returned from the dead and asked him to start being civil to Snape (especially with Snape also clearly making an effort), I think he'd fall over himself trying to do that for her.

** The moment of impact series.

Harry meets with an accident, is sent to recuperate with Snape, and they end up being father and son.

In the series there's a lot of times where Snape apologises, helps Harry, and generally does things that would make even the anti-Snape become pro-Snape there.
