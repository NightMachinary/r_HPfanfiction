Looks for fics where Hermione ends up with one or both Prewett twins. Thanks in advance!


** I haven't read it but this one is recommended by a fanfic author I really enjoy reading (ShayaLonnie)

** SciFiChick has one, her spin on the classic 'harem' with Hermione at lead. All her fanfics are on her LJ though, and she hasn't updated for the past two years.

It's Hermione/Gideon (plus more): [[http://kris-fic.livejournal.com/54428.html#cutid1][Harem]]
