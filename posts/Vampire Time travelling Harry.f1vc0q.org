I cant remember if harry is a vampire before or after he goes back in time. But when he does he realises there is no way to travel back to the future. So he lives out the 1000 ish years it takes to get back to the present courtesy of vampiric immortality. He had an older vampire with him the whole time, bit I cant remember his name. Any help greatly appreciated :)


** Do you remember if it was slash? If so, it might be [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1085261/1/Blood][Blood]].
