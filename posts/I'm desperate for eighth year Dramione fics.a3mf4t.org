I specifically remember one that I can't find now! Draco and Hermione were head boy/girl and they shared a dorm. They start a secret ish relationship and Harry and Ron are in auror training instead of Hogwarts. They eventually walk in on Hermione and Draco having sex. It's also possible that they break up at the end of the year but she eventually finds him and they get back together, but that might be a different fic. If it is this one, he also throws the ring in the bottom of the lake? I've searched all of ao3's eighth year Dramione tag and haven't found it. I'm moving to ffnet (Lord help me it's so hard to search) and I'm desperate. Ive also searched Tumblr but that's not very helpful.


** Do you remember any other details?

90% of Dramione eighth year fics have this exact same premise

You could also try the Dramioneasks tumblr

  In the aftermath of the War, two people slowly come to realise that they might be more alike than they ever thought. A second chance, the benefit of the doubt and a push in the right direction; sometimes that's really all it takes for a person to exceed your expectations. But we all know Hermione Granger's perfectionism: will an 'Exceeds Expectations' be good enough just this once?

  "Can you make a patronus?" He shook his head. "They say Death Eaters can't do it," he told her, sadly. "Well, it's a good thing you're not a Death Eater, then, isn't it?" she responded with a smile. "I've got the mark, Granger. Personal feelings aside, I'll always carry his brand." "I don't care what's on your arm, Draco... I know what's in your heart. I think you can do it."

  The spring term at Hogwarts starts with a bang with the return of Draco Malfoy, back for his eighth year after a stint in Azkaban. But all is not right with Draco and Head Girl Hermione Granger can't help but get involved. EWE

** I'm a massive shipper of Dramione

Cause.....Tom Felton

Is it Rebuilding by Colubrina?

There's a few that aren't bad

The Eagles Nest - they're resorted in 8th year and Draco/Hermione end up in Ravenclaw

*** You are new here, right? Dramione is pretty much one of the most normal pairings people are looking for. While a lot uf us think this pairing is ... well lets say unrealistic, try not to judge people.
