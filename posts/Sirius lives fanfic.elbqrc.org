Very specifically ones that are more butterfly effect than fix it. So Sirius living alters the story in a way thats significant and wouldnt have happened had he died. Or effects the characterization of other important relevant character(s) significantly which has a impact on the story over all that wouldn't have happened had he died. The alterations to the story has to be something beyond making other characters feel better because he lived or being able to have a happy life. I love fix its and Sirius living. And this can be a fix it too but the emphasis is what changes as a result of Sirius not dying.

Sirius doesn't have to be the MC but he does need to be important. No Sirius/OC, No Sirius/self insert, No Sirius/any minor chatacter who was only ever name dropped briefly and not expanded on at all and same applies to others. Replace Sirius's name with those of other major Canon characters too same restrictions .

No Sirius or anyone from his generation or older / Anyone from Harrys gen even with time travel

No genderbending. There can be trans characters but i dont consider that the same thing.

Apart from that any ship is fine slash femslash het it all good. No ships are also fine though I prefer plot based to ship based for story.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), fits well:

- Sirius lives
- Sirius is plot critical, and the story becomes very different after the point of divergence
- Sirius is paired with an OC, who also has meaningful contributions to his cause

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
