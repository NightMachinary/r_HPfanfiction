Instead of the focus being on how Molly is absurdly protective, overbearing, etc., it focuses on Arthur, having a nice father/son relationship with Harry.

Forget fighting trolls, dealing with basalisks, trying not to get killed. What this kid needs is a nice game of catch and a chance to get some stuff of his chest.

Picturing it as a slice of life/fluff fic.


** (Sorry for any errors, Harry would be like 12 in this)

"Harry lad, pass me that wrench will you"? Mr. Weasley's muffled voice came out from underneath the car, which was currently levitating a few inches off the ground.

Harry dutifully passed the wrench to his adoptive father before sitting down to continue watching him work. He twiddled his thumbs a little unsure of what to do before Mr. Weasly slid from underneath the car and looked up at him.

"Would you like to come take a look?" he smiled his eyes twinkling, Non of his other sons liked tinkering with muggle contraptions and toys and the fact that Harry was interested tickled Arthur's heart.

"But won't Mrs. Weasley get upset that I'm even in here?" Harry whispered looking over his shoulder afraid that the very act of speaking her name within such close proximity of Arthur's car would summon her.

Arthur chuckled "Let me worry about your mum lad," he said before using his wand to levitate another roller next to him. He put his wand back in his pocket before patting the roller inviting Harry to join him.

With one more nervous look back at the house Harry shuffled next to his father and rolled under the car wit him.

"Now this is the fuel line..." Arthur began, talking animatedly about his prized possession with his only black haired child, they were both so engrossed in what they were doing they didn't notice Molly place a plate of corned beef sandwiches and two glasses of pumpkin juice on a small transfigured table next to the tool box.

Nodding, her job done and two of her boys fed, she walked back towards her home to check on the rest of her children, a small smile tugging at the corner of her lips.

--------------

So for some context around my idea, Molly doesn't have an issue with her kids being in Arthur's shed and helping him with his muggle stuff, she has an issue with them going in there without permission and everyone of her kids have helped Arthur blow something up at some point in their lives, Harry has never done that and will never do that.

This is set early on in their adoption of Harry (they adopt him at the end of first year) so he isn't calling them mum or dad yet.

*** I would not mind a longfic starting from this, tbh. Wholesome father-and-son bonding is wholesome.

I'd imagine this would lead to the following changes eventually:

- Ginny is bound to be less shy around Harry. It wouldn't exactly be a romance at 12, and might never be, but they'd probably be on decent terms by the time Ginny gets the diary.\\
  That, in turn, might change the whole setup of Chamber of Secrets - Ginny acting all secretive at that point would be odd. Heck, she might even show the Diary to someone before it ever gets written in.
- I'd imagine Sirius would be even more worried when he sees that picture in the Prophet that causes him to break out of Azkaban. After all, both Harry and Pettigrew would be in it.
- Year 4 would be a little easier on Harry because it'd be easier for Harry to convince Ron that he didn't put his name in the Goblet.
- No Dementors in the summer before Year 5. It's hard enough getting away with that in a mostly-Muggle neighborhood, it'd be impossible if Harry was around the numerous Weasleys 24/7 (and the Lovegoods living nearby).

#+end_quote

Or would it be harder? Ron has always felt overshadowed by his brothers, and now Harry /is/ his brother -- overshadowing him yet again.

Plus, could there be some growing resentment in the background? With Harry so happy to have a family he wouldn't mind the reasonable amount of chores at all, and it could lead to some issues with the others. Molly/Arthur giving Harry extra focus because he needs it to build the relationship could also be a sore point, him "stealing" their parents.

Anyway, I could see the Ron thing going either direction here. Perhaps the biggest issue yet as the fledgling new family, due to unsaid stressors building up over a few years.

Especially if it means enchanted muggle stuff is going to be used more. If you can have a flying invisible car, why not a flying invisible tank?

#+end_quote

Getting a tank won't be easy. In 91 or 92, the Warsaw pact surpluses were just starting to be sold. It would require a hefty sum and despite my misgivings about Arthur, I don't see him counterfeiting money with magic or condunding Muggles for his pleasure. And the Soviet equipment was made with small (1.65m) tankers in mind, so it might not be the best choice for the Weasleys.

Operating a tank is also rather difficult work. Unless it is an Strv-103, you'd need a few people to operate it. You can automate loading and forgo the radio operator, but if you want efficiency, you need separate drivers, commanders and gunners and other than the S tank, you cannot unify that into one position. And I don't think that Sweden was selling its stock of those. Driving it is also more difficult than a car due to the size and limited visibility. Trying to steer a flying object through a few vision ports is suicide.

And frankly, a flying tank is kinda pointless since only the front is properly armoured. The bottom is barely able to resist mines if you are lucky. Certainly not what you want to expose by flying. You'd be better off shrinking an artillery piece or an anti tank gun and flying that around in your pocket on a broom.

***** He is quite ignorant of all things Muggle, yet that alone could be explained by his upbringing in a magical family. But despite his interest, he refuses to simply buy an encyclopedia or something like "technology for dummies". Deliberate ignorance is not a good trait.

His attitude towards all things muggle reminds me of imperialist attitudes towards the natives of whatever they happened to colonise, especially his wonderment at any and all advances. He is genuinely surprised by even simple concepts, making it clear that his expectations were insultingly low, especially given that he regularly makes trips into central London. He would see so many marvels of technology each time, is interested, but a 4 year old would have a better understanding from the picture books in Kindergarten. His plug connection is just one example.

Also, he did nothing to reign in his family's treatment of Fleur. But that one is as much on him as on Bill.

**** You see you're forgetting something with your logic here though, the most important thing, and the only rule that matters.

The Rule of Cool.

Wear some flight goggles, ride with the hatch opened, and you can drive/fly a tank just as efficiently as a car.

Even the bottom of a tank is bulletproof, and going by the feats of canon, the blasring charms we see are about as strong as hand grenades, if that.

A T-55 is basically an "I win" button for the story.

Pettigrew blew up an entire street with one spell. And even if he hit the gas main, if a spell can go through 6 feet of street and earth, it will have no trouble with 20mm armour (that's how much a T-55 has at its bottom).

#+end_quote

Maybe the commander's hatch, but you cannot steer from there (it has neither the controls nor is a rotating driver's position a good idea). If you ride/fly with the driver's hatch open, you will still see way less than out of a car's window because that big turret is behind you and to your right. It will probably be a bit more than what you would see from a commercial airplane, but those have a whole array of instruments and it moves according to the laws of physics (you are always looking where you are going).

Fiendfyre would cook you in one. Apparation allows people to simply leave. And you can always do the Finnish thing and lob a Molotov at the engine deck, which is a lot easier with invisibility spells, teleportation and levitation charms.
