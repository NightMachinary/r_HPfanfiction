That moment when you have been writing your 100,000+ word HP fanfic for 10 years and still don't have a final draft and you make G.R.R. Martin look like the worlds fastest writer

That moment when you have written 3000 words in the last two years because you spend all your time editing and rewriting pointless scenes because of writers block

That moment when you decide not to kill off a character because of a dream but instead have them injured and damaged

That moment when it fills your plot with new possibilities and angst and amazing scene ideas

That moment when you sit down and write 6000 words in one night

That moment when you realise you are going to have to rewrite a third of your plot

Tl;dr made one minor plot change and the old writing block has disappeared after 2 years - SUCCESS

The struggle is real. My fic just passed 143K, but my file with discarded bits is 32,000 words long.

*** I haven't even dared to check how much will have to go. Luckily i don't write in order I write scenes (or chapter 34 then chapter 2) so there are parts where I can just go back and add some dialogue etc

****** I don't write in order so I have never actually posted it. There's still a few scenes left from the beginning I need to write before I could post the first third

******** It sounds interesting, although if I may ask what is the function of the OC? Not meant in a bad way, just curious.

** I haven't written more than 10k this month on two existing stories... but yesterday I sat here and wrote 4,500+ on a new idea.

Congrats on getting past the writer's block!

** I understand being a slow writer, but for me the main reason why I hate it is because it will make impatient followers of the story stop caring about it. I myself like writing so if it will take 10 years I don't care I was always quality over quantity but since a lot of people don't share that sentiment I now try to write with the idea of quantity over quality. And I don't hate it as much as I thought, because I still edit but I don't get into the100 edits trap, though I still edit existing chapters. edit: I do hate it after all, because I am just not one of the lucky few who can sprout some brilliant chapter in a week, and if I wrote my story in entirety before I posted it (as I should) I'd be finally posting one story when I am 80. It's an ongoing process. I am glad that you finally got over your writer's block, congratulations. I don't wish a writing block upon anyone.
