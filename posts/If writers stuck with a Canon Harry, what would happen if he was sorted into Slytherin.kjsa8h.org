** Honestly, I never understood how Harry fit Sytherin at all. If anything he's a Hufflepuff.

What's the defining morally neutral trait of Slytherin? Ambition. Harry has a /distinct/ lack of ambition, always trying for a "normal life" or often nothing at all.

I think he'd be miserable there, and probably find friends in other houses if at all.
