  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

_______________________________________________________[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621][The Man Who Lived]]okay, personal review for me, I'm not much of a fan of the writing style, although it's a really interesting way of doing it, very deep pov I think, but it's so legendary in the fandom that I would be an idiot to not rec it. This is actually the first one that popped into my head, everything else be damned, when I read the first two words of your title. _________________________________________________ [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12006417/chapters/27167826][survival is a talent]] I hesitate to rec this, but arc or no arc, it's a fucking brilliant fic. It really, truly is. They're just /so fucking adorable./ Personal complaint: they keep calling Draco's eyes blue, they aren't. They're grey. Or silver.

______________________________________________________

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4373594/chapters/9926705][Temptation On The Warfront]]and I would be amiss to not have suggested this one. Even if it doesn't fit the arc you're looking for---honestly, The Man Who Lived might be the only one that'd be able to do that ever---it's a really great fic.

** Away Childish Things by lettered is a good one. It starts showing Draco Malfoy how he is now, a more redeemed and mature man, years after being a spoiled child and bully. About two-thirds of the way through, you learn how he got there, what his life was like after the war, and how hard he had to work (no magic, working in the Muggle world since no one would hire him).

**** I find the concept creepy as well, since it's usually a ploy to have someone "fall in love" with a child. This one is amazing though! It is getting to the heart of Harry's neglectful and abusive childhood, and how Draco has changed, coming to terms with what he did and why it was wrong. And that the de-aging is here is related to criminals Harry is investigating as an Auror, not a trick from Dumbledore to give Harry a better childhood.

Another with minor Draco redemption is linkao3(7331278), where Draco is still growing and changing, still agonizing over how he really believed all the blood supremacy and he's not sure he belongs with the "good" side. I think that's one of the most important aspects of character growth for redemption fics.

**** She's also got an excellent track record for finishing fics. When I found SIAT, I honestly assumed it was abandoned, and was stunned to realize it's just a slow update. Even if she never added another word, it's 360k of goodness that I really enjoy (speaking as someone who some of my all-time favorite fics are incomplete and abandoned. I still say they have value and I still love them for what they are).

I understand people who don't want to read WIPs and get upset when things get abandoned (which SIAT has not been), but I really, strongly disagree with this sense that authors in general, but fan authors specifically, owing their readers anything. I have seen too many really good authors chased out of fandom because for some reason they couldn't write fast enough or because, god forbid, a new property started drawing their interest or a new fic, and their output either slowed down or it was abandoned due to readers being jerks. It's a hobby, and for most authors, if people start getting pushy, the last thing they want to do is work on it.

To put it in perspective, a traditionally published author may publish one ~70-100k book every 2 years. That's a /normal pace/ for a lot of authors. A book a year is considered consistent output. SIAT has been going for 3 years, and has 360k, /and/ the author has started and completed multiple 100+k works (one of which was HP) in that same time frame. That is an /insane/ amount of writing. Of course we'd rather not wait, but at least she's an author who is super open about where she is, what she's working on, and that she got hung up in the outline for the current book.

Sorry if I'm coming across as a jerk, this just hit a nerve for me. There are few things more demotivating for fan authors than to be asked "when are you updating?" (and judging by GRRM and Pat Rothfuss, that's not a phenomenon related to just fan authors). Particularly for fan authors who get nothing but reader response in payment and have other jobs and RL interferes. And if she ever does abandon it, she will tell us. So until she does (which hopefully she never does), can we please cut her (and other authors who might not be updating our favorite stories as quickly as we wish), a little slack? I update my most popular fic weekly and just got a comment that I'm writing too slow. It's really down to reader perception isn't it?

****** I will agree with this, but I understand why a most authors don't. One--I *guarantee* that conceding that you have abandoned it will get backlash, and I totally understand authors not wanting to deal with it. I recently saw an author who completely walked away from the fandom where pushy, demanding, entitled readers had been hounding them incessantly. The review responses to being told the author was walking away were about a 50/50 split between "wow, really sorry to see you go, but understand you need to do what's best for your mental health" and outright personal attacks (granted, this was on FFN, but... *wow*, small wonder they were walking away). If you leave it open-ended there's always that sliver of hope.

Two--I think there's good contingent of authors who truly mean to return to it and just never get back around to it. Admitting you're giving up on something, even a fic, is hard, even if it's just for a hobby, even if the author has no obligation to continue if they're no longer interested. Something about that fic we once loved, once inspired us, and I think most of us find it hard to admit we just can't get to the end we envisioned, or don't have a plan, or have simply fallen out of love with it.

In the case of the author in question--she's only abandoned one story (out of nearly 60) that I see, and she did indeed, say she abandoned it and posted the outline. That is a completion record I aspire to.

******* If the author has plans to come back to it, yet feels the need to walk away from it for a while, at least have the courtesy to leave a note saying the story is on hiatus for the time being. This accomplishes two things; 1 - It let's the readers know not to expect an update anytime soon. and 2 - The author doesn't get pestered as much with reviews and PM's asking for a new update, especially if it's been a while since the story was last updated.

******** I disagree. For one, I think the people who /intentionally/ step away from works will usually tell us so by putting a fic on hiatus. I don't think most authors usually intend to walk away, or know that it's going to happen. I have seen a few authors who are like "I update when I update, leave me alone," but they're pretty few and far between. I am subbed to fics that maybe update twice a year. That's just the pace the author writes at. There's no good way of knowing that, and too many fic authors don't know when they'll get to something. Heck, few /professional/ authors are good judges of when they will be done.

Would it be courteous? Yeah, but this is a hobby, not a job, and we are not owed an author's work or their time--and this goes for pros too. We should also show the authors courtesy by not nagging for updates, no matter how well-intentioned. As for "telling your fans" if it's been awhile--your options are 1) updating the author notes 2) putting up a chapter to tell your readers or 3) communicate delays on other social media. People don't get notified when you update comments--you have to rely on them rereading. Most readers hate the false hope it gives them to see the update and see it's just an authors note, so that's as likely to get backlash as not, and following someone's social media requires a little time and energy on the reader's part. Not everyone reads author's notes anyway--I've had people ask for updates on a fic I explicitly marked as complete, but also posted an AN saying it really is complete (/at the time I originally posted it/). Without a little status indicator on the site that's easy to update, there's really no good way to notify your readers unless you know you're taking a hiatus at the time of posting. There are also the authors who are just unapologetic, chronic abandoners, who never bother to tell their readers when they abandon things, because they often simply don't know if it's abandoned.

It's easy to say "the author should tell their readers," but it's just not usually that straightforward. Acting entitled to an author's work is often a very good way to ensure you never get it.

********* As I stated at the beginning of my comment, I was only talking about authors that were intentionally stepping away from a story for a while. I have been subbed to stories that only updated once or twice a year, but the author had already stated that updates would be few and far between, which I have no issue with. There could be many reasons that an author does not update a story, but if an author wants to have readers to be invested in their work, they should do their best to be courteous to their readers. As a reader invested in a story, I would rather get a false chapter with a note from the author saying the story is going to be on hiatus for a while, rather than be waiting indefinitely for a chapter that may never come. This is one of the reasons why I tend to only read complete stories. Yes, it is a hobby, but that is no reason to be rude to your readers. - On the flip side to that, if a story has a note saying it is on hiatus, the reader should not be pestering the author for an update. Then again, readers shouldn't be pestering the author for an update anyway. I have also seen stories marked as complete, where readers are leaving reviews asking for an update. I just can't help but shake my head at those and wonder if they even actually read the final chapter. Then again, there is a one shot collection I have been reading on FFN, where the author has intentionally marked the story as complete, but still occasionally adds new chapters to it. I am not sure why they have marked it complete, when it is obvious that it is not, but is it is their collection, so they can mark it complete if they want.

Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

  He glances at the boxy too-uniform numbers flashing on the face of Richard's radio. It's nearly noon, and he should be getting ready to leave; but there is still a harsh tension in his shoulders and neck that he wants to work out before Hermione finds him. It is, after all, Tuesday; and while his Tuesdays were designated ‘tea with Helen' days previously, they are now ‘lunch with Granger' days, ever since the chance meet-up with the Weasel's wife and the insufferable swot herself.

** - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21256991/chapters/50612300]["Dad Says"]] is an EWE. Eleven-year-old Scorpius starts writing to Harry. Harry starts to fall in love with Draco through his portrayal in his son's letters. Featuring an extremely remorseful Draco living with muggles and working at a second-hand book shop, an isolated Harry, and a Scorpius who's dreading going to Hogwarts because he knows he'll be bullied there. I thought the writing could tend a bit towards the melodramatic, but I also stayed up until 1:45 a.m. reading it all in one go, so I kinda have to recommend it :-P It is complete.
- I also recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816/chapters/37478033][Away Childish Things]]. There is a potions accident that causes Harry to be deaged to the age of ten. Draco has to take care of him. This teaches Draco quite a lot about Harry's childhood that he wouldn't have otherwise known. I'm not super familiar with the de-aging trope, but I have heard that some fics use the concept to inappropriately pair characters of vastly different ages. That is NOT the case in this one.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/640449][Here's The Pencil, Make It Work]] is a lovely little fluffy piece by an author who excels at writing lovely little fluffy pieces. In this one, Harry meets Malfoy working at a coffee shop in muggle London.
- I didn't realize that Draco working through his trauma while living with Muggles was a subgenre, but I am 100% here for it. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20946260][Faint Indirections]], Harry and Draco unexpectedly meet in Boston. Harry is working in a University Library where Draco is studying.
- If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, this is the fourth result. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]], Harry never received his letter. Voldemort has a controlling interest in the magical world. Hermione and a pack of classmates find Harry, partially to protect him and partially to train him. Draco leaves everything he knows because he can't stomach it anymore. He has to come to terms with the fact that his parents, his friends, and the whole world he knows is populated with war criminals. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]] is a little similar in that Draco leaves and has to come to terms with his upbringing. In this, Harry runs away before he gets his Hogwarts letter. He excels at instinctive magic and manages to block tracking magic. I love the feeling I have when I read this. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of an aching nostalgia. It is complete.

** I'm really into [[http://Story:%20Awake%0Ahttps://www.fanfiction.net/s/13592225][Awake]]. It isn't quite what you're looking for, but I think it's close. Harry and Draco become friends and Dracos redemption arc happens off screen... Sort of, but not really. It's pretty much impossible to describe well without spoilers. Highly recommend, though.
