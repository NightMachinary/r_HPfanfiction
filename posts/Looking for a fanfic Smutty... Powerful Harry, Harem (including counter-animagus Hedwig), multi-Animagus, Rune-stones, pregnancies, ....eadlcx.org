:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for fanfic - it's pretty long and quite smutty. It's probably close to 10 years since I read it, possibly at FicWad (I think it was removed though). I believe the author had a YahooGroup for his fics (yeah, tough luck...).

Harry is very powerfull, and quickly gets a harem - Hermione, Ginny, Luna... possibly Cho, the Patils, Daphne, Fleur and maybe Gabrielle. It includes Hedwig, who is able to "animagus" into a human. I think Harry got multiple animagus forms, including an owl-form - in which he impregnates Hedwig. I think they get black(?) owlets with green eyes, who are gifted to the other girls. I believe several (all?) of the other girls also become pregnant. There is lots of sex going on, but not too descriptive. (Including how Harry's for "covers" Hedwig.)

I think Hedwig is seriously injured - maybe killed - at one point, but Harry saves her life/brings her back from the dead. I think Harry buys/builds a large house. A mosaic of rune-stones is placed into the floor at the entry. After Harry for some reason bleeds lots of magic, the rune-stones floats in the air and seems to attack/fight each other and combining into new rune-clusters. This makes a very powerful ward.

I don't remember the title or the author, nor where I read it (makes it difficult to search). If anyone knows - not to mention know where I can find it, or have downloaded a copy - that would be of great help. So does this ring a bell?


** ''Roger23'' plagiarized that fic. The original one is this: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14188524/chapters/32705163]]

IIrc, the author posted on ffn too.

** Hedwig turning human is definitely Lord of Darkness, but the rest sounds like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12575091/1/Witches-Secret]]
