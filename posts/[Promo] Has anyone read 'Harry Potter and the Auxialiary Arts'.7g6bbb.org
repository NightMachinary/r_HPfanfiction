It's being written by Moxibustion and is currently on [[http://www.roughtrade.org/][Rough Trade]]. You have to sign up, but it's quick. I think it's one of the most interesting and well written stories I've seen for quite a while. Has anyone else read it? What did you think?


** Here's the summary:

/The Boy Who Lived is a...Squib./

/He's invited to Fawley House in London (Resurgam Experior Resurgam), school for the Squib who shows just enough magic to be, well, magical. He has no powers, a dire need of therapy and no wand./

/He does have his friends Hermione (long story), Ron (even longer story) and Neville (just sign the book deal now) coming along for the ride./

/He's not in the magical world./

/He's not in the Muggle one./

/He's in with the misfits and the oddballs, the cursed and the scarred, the lost and the dying./

/People just like him./

The author seems to warn quite a bit about child abuse, let's hope it's not the usually shitty angst fare.

*** First one or two chapters are a bit tbh, but nothing too heavy nor for too long

I am amused by that clever pun.

** Can you tell us why it's so interesting and maybe a quick summary? I clicked the link you provided but it's asking me to sign up before I view any part of the story.

*** Considering "rough trade" is slang for gay male prostitutes (apparently, according to google) and the link goes straight to the front page rather than to a subpage (i.e. a story), I'm guessing that it's a hijacked account or something posting spam?

Either way, I'm not clicking that link.

**** Is it really? Huh, learn something new everyday it seems. Always figured it was called rough trade as it's where writers work on their trade and post rough drafts? I messed up the link it seems, sorry about that. The summary is;

The Boy Who Lived is a...Squib. He's invited to Fawley House in London (Resurgam Experior Resurgam), school for the Squib who shows just enough magic to be, well, magical. He has no powers, a dire need of therapy and no wand. He does have his friends Hermione (long story), Ron (even longer story) and Neville (just sign the book deal now) coming along for the ride. He's not in the magical world. He's not in the Muggle one. He's in with the misfits and the oddballs, the cursed and the scarred, the lost and the dying. People just like him.

***** upon further googling, it also happens to be the name of a british record store (I guess that does trade-ins?). First result for me was for male gay prostitution, though. Even when googling the URL.

**** Nah there's an actual story there, with 12 chapters. Rough trade is an actual writing website.

** Spam? Your link goes to the main page. The website isn't secure. There's no summary.
