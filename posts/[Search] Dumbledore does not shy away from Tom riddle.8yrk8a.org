He I think tries to adopt him and keep him from the dark along with Slughorn and also he and his brother are trying to defeat grindelwald

Is this the same Fic as the one where Tom riddle grew up adopted by dumbledore and become a professor and went to another dimension?


** The one where Riddle crosses dimensions is Rectifier linkffn(2595818).

I don't know if there are other stories like this. Good!Riddle fics yes but specifically adopted by Dumbledore I don't know.
