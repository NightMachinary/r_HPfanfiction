Looking for a fic where Luna actually has some substance to the character and isn't just... I'm not sure how to describe how she's usually portrayed.

Looking for stories like Antithesis, Protection from Nargles, Easier than Falling Asleep.

Basically anywhere where you can find good quality romance and an interesting Luna, who you'd like to read about rather than closing the tab.


** What, you don't want perfect!seer!ultra-intelligent!soulbounded!Luna? Surelly you jest, for it is but the pinacle of fanfiction- nay, the most developed from of writing- Surely, I egg, for it is but the penultimate form of art itself!

*** Don't forget kinky AF, willing to satisfy all the author's and Reader's fantasies...

In a serious note, penultimate means â€˜second to last', not definitive, which I believe was what you wanted. In that case, ultimate would be the appropriate word.

EDIT: Oh, I focused too much on you wanting an interesting and well written Luna, and forgot you said Harry/Luna. This one is Hermione/Luna. I'll leave it up in case you are still interested.

*** Not exactly a Hermione fan, but thank you. I might just go through it. Well written Luna's are hard to find.

*** I've read this. It's a good story but not for my taste in afraid. Not the Quidditch bit, love that part. Rather the way Luna is treated amongst others is slightly off putting
