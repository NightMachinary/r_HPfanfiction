I remember reading a fic that had:

- Harry time travels to the past, potentially even to an alternate universe. Possibly just arriving by taking a train from the train station when he dies.
- Harry is raising Tom Riddle as a baby. Given that this is set in the late 1970s/early 1980s, I'm pretty sure the baby!Tom is just the horcrux that was in his head.
- He buys a house, potentially in Ottery St Catchpole, that is being haunted by the ghost of the boy who used to live there. The ghost is friendly.
- He purchases a single house elf to help out around the house and with Tom.
- He potentially builds a secret basement room for his research / to protect his valuables.
- There is a scene where he goes to the Weasley's house to celebrate a birthday (one of their kids, or maybe even one of the Potter's).
- He strikes up a friendship with Luna's mom, who is potentially a researcher of some sort.
- He meets Lily and/or Dumbledore in Diagon Alley, potentially at Florian Fortescue's.
- During his meeting with Dumbledore, Dumbledore notices that he is wearing the Resurrection Stone as a ring.

.... a reaaallly long time ago, but I can't remember what it was called at all. Here's hoping someone on here does.
