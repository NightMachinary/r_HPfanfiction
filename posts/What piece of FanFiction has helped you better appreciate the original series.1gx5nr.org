Some pieces we read for enjoyment, because we love the world and the characters. But sometimes you'll come across something that helps you understand a character or part of that world better. What added this extra dimension for you?

*** I love reading about Snape, especially his formative years. To see why he turned out the way he did is very interesting. I'm very glad that JKR gave such a clear-cut outline of his young life, to be fleshed out.

*** This is possibly my favorite fic of all time. The prose is solid, the story rich, the fleshing out of Snape's childhood and time with Voldemort plausible and well done.

My one complaint (and I feel bad making any, but I just felt like saying this) is I felt the scenes we're familiar with from canon were not as powerful as they could have been. In some cases they felt rushed or somewhat blah, as opposed to a stunningly different view of the scene we're so used to seeing from Harry's eyes.

Still, I agree, beautifully done. I love it.

** Ouroboros, by Lettered, rated K. It's very well written and the author uses second person very well. It didn't necessarily help me understand the characters better, but it definitely got me to look at the series in a new light. It's... haunting. Warning: what's been read cannot be unread.

**** It ends the exact same way as the canon epilogue... It's more the conclusions it draws.

** I enjoyed [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]]. It's not canon but is still a beautiful piece nonetheless and always gives me a case of the feels. Sort of helps to put the effects of the war into perspective.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6026214/1/9-Years-with-the-Marauders][9 Years With the Marauders.]] Great back story for James' and Lily's generation and the original order of the phoenix.

*** I love the reading about the Marauders. I'm currently rereading [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/category/shoebox-pdf-chapters/page/4/][The Shoebox Project]] which has them dealing with their last couple of years at school.

James and Lily is a relationship I always wanted to read more about.

** The First reading the books FanFic that I read. Lily, Sirius, James, and Remus were at James' house and read the first book, it got taken off the FF.net cite, but It really made me understand the books better.
