Linkffn(7512124) Harry learns powerful Occulemcy from Hagrid. Favorite moment is then Hagrid lets slip a reference to a secret giant-oriented martial arts and tries to play it off. Its just a paragraph in the story, but I laughed so hard at it, i don't think I'll forget.

Linkffn(2337373) Harry takes advantage of fate and his prophecy. Favorite moment is the ending where Voldy turns himself in to the Aurors.
