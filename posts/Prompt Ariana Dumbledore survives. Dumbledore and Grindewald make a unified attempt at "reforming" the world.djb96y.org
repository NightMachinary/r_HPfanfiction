And hopefully well written?

â€‹

Let's assume there is no falling out and no duel as well.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/619228][Living On]] linkao3(619228) has this premise. It's unfinished, but worth a read anyway.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17077076][The First Time]] linkao3(17077076) also features a Dumbledore and Grindelwald who stayed together, though they're more focused on looking for the Hallows than reforming the world in it. Oneshot.

  The first time Albus kills a man. (AU where Albus and Gellert never go their separate ways; this takes place a couple of years into them leaving home to find the Deathly Hallows and take over the world.) Grindeldore Holiday Exchange gift for Roflskate/Baratheon!

The premise here is that Ariana didn't die, so Albus and Gellert's fallout didn't happen, but other stuff happened that you learn about as the story progresses. It starts when Harry begins Hogwarts in 1991 and lots of things are different due to Ariana not dying way back when. Hasn't updated in quite a while -- it stopped at the end of fifth year but I don't think it's abandoned.

  A chance meeting and Albus and Gellert would become inseparable friends, until the death of Albus' sister. But what if Ariana had survived? Almost a century later, a boy named Harry Potter would survive the Killing Curse, finally bringing an end to Grindelwald's war. Now, as he finds a place for himself at Hogwarts, there are signs that suggest that the war might not truly be over.
