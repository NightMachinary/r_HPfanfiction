I distinctly remember reading a fanfic where Harry had to face a pillar like construct with lots of runes on it during one of the tasks of the Triwizard. I believe it created your worst nightmare? Or maybe a shadow of who you truly are? And then harry had to fight that nightmare/clone/shadow to win. And I believe this setup for task was Dumbledores idea.

Any help?? Please?

*** Yeah, pretty sure that's it. I really liked that idea... Fred's shadow version was a boring accountant who hated jokes or something like that? And I believe Fleur had some harpy Veela version that wanted to subjugate everyone with her alure and sexuality.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

  What if the founders built in a safe guard to protect incoming students from abuse at home, in the form of the hat? How would the hat react to Harry's so called childhood? Rated for language and expected violence. As complete as it is ever going to get. Revised as another story.
