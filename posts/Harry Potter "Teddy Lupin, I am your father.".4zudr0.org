I am looking for stories where Harry Potter is the father of Teddy Lupin.

I have always felt disgusted by the idea of Teddy being the son of both a Metamorphmagus and Werewolf, it's like the prologue to a 14 year old girls creature fic.

Maybe you'd be more interested in reading one of those fics where it turns out the pureblood supremacists are right about everything?

** ....it's not uncommon for outsiders/minorities to bond with each other & (shockingly!) fall in love and reproduce. Harry is literally a Chosen One archetype, and you're complaining about Teddy having unusual parents? Seriously? He's not even a werewolf, despite Lupin's fears. It's not like avoiding cliches automatically makes a story good anyway, quit being so fucking contemptuous.

*** That just makes Teddy more of sue than anything else.

Surprise, your father is a freak but don't worry! You only got the super metamorphmagus genes. Not a single drop of Werewolf in you.

**** Being a metamorphmagus is genetic, while lycanthropy is transmitted via infected saliva entering the bloodstream. That's why Teddy isn't a werewolf.

Lycanthropy is like a viral infection (similar to HIV), not a genetic disease.

*** Coming Back Late might have been one of those stories. I remember there being some innuendo concerning Teddy's parentage. However, the story is sadly unfinished.

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?
