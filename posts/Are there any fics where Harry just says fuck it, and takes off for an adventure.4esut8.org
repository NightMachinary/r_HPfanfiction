I'm looking for something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9885609/1/Finding-a-Place-to-Call-Home][this]], but without the bashing, emo Harry, and stupid cliches.

I've also read and enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2095661/1/Behind-Blue-Eyes][Behind Blue Eyes]], which I enjoyed, but isn't really what I'm looking for.

So anyone have a good adventure story?

Yes. Linkffn(8197451) - This is probably not exactly what you're looking for (based on the fics you mentioned), but at early age Harry here decides to just roll with it and go on his own adventure.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
