So lets say the devil or a female Demon take the appearance of a hot, sexy Lady and might be summoned by someone or appears randomly in the World. She and her "Master" might perform a contract. I imagine lots of teasing scenes, like the Being teases her Master but it never gets into action, because it would violate the Contract or something.

The idea for this came, when i saw Pictures of the Bowsette Character. So a Hot, Demon-like female figure bonds with a Character and serves as support or whatever. I guess the Story of such a Fic would lead into total chaos and OoC-ness, but im fine with it, as long as it involves funny and teasing moments. Im not rejected to sex scenes either.

But if you know Such fics with a Serious story, im open for it too.
