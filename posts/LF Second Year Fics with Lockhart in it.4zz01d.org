I'm looking for some second year fics from Harry's point of view. They may be AU, or time travel, or pretty much anything, so long as they have Lockhart in them.


** So pretty much any and all generic HP fics that cover 2nd year.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/145/Odd-Ideas][A Memorable Year]] Lockhart's point of view. Badass Lockhart.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] It will take a while to get to year to but this fic has hands down the best Lockhart I've ever seen.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate!]] Lockhart raises Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3595986/1/Fugitives-of-Azkaban][Fugitives of Azkaban]] Not quite as much Lockhart as you would probably like, but he's very important in this fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3312486/1/Battles-with-Basilisks][Battles with Baselisks]] has a Lockhart who's just as scummy as canon but actually competent.

It's been a while since I've read them but I think that [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/][Applied Cultural Antropology]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9486886/1/][Moratorium]] both had good Lockharts.
