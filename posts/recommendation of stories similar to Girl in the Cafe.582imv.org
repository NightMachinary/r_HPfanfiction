Hi,

I usually come to this subreddit every couple of months as a passive participant to catch up on the latest recommended fics.

I've read a story called Girl in the Cafe linkffn(3020368) and haven't seen it recommended here, nor have I come across anything similar so far. If you guys have read it, and know of anything like it let me know.

It's romance, cheesy, but well written specially the characters. No drama, angst, just a fluffy, feel good story about wizard and the muggle he falls for. The muggle happens to be Hermione.

Thanks

*** The metaphor used in the summary is horrid, so I'm not going to read the entire story to give you recs- can you state what you like about the story in the OP? Are you looking for muggle romance, OC romance, or other things?

  It was her smile that caught his eye. Her smile had drawn him in, pulled him closer and held him in its pearly grip. So naturally he found himself incapable of approaching her.
