Remember the first episode of JLU? Where all of Earth's superheroes get teleported to the Watchtower and join the league? Suppose that happened to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Doesn't matter when: During the war or after, whatever.(If it happens during the war, Voldemort's getting stomped).


** Considering most of the DCAU occurs in the sort-of future, id say post war.

Also I would probably love this.

*** JLU takes place in 2002. So even if the theory that the films take place in the 2000s, not the 1990s is true, the League would never recruit 12 year-olds. Although, it would make sense for them to recruit them at 12, then call them to action when they become adults(Around DH).

Of course, I'm going more off Young Justice than JLU.

******* I'd like to point out that the League tends to react... [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZO5qgs4Px0][poorly]], to the revelation. Even in the comics Superman went and shouted at the Wizard Shazam about the situation.

** Okay, I wrote the first half of this /before/ properly reading your prompt, my bad.

Um... might want to change that entry point. From memory the Watchtower was first under Thanagarian control, and then Batman crashed it into the big generator thingy.

I've read one or two fics with similar premises, not for Harry Potter though, and the usual go-to location for entry is Metropolis while the League is captured aboard the ship above the city. The crossover character(s) then goes up to the ship for whatever reason, saves the League, kicks ass, sticks around until the Thanagarian Invasion is dealt with...

...And then goes off to be emo about how all their friends and loved ones are dead and they're stranded in another world. Although that last one doesn't seem to be a problem if the DCAU takes place in the Potterverse.

Going totally off the rails of this prompt, hope you don't mind, I'd do something different. Harry Potter, age... let's say age nine, accidentally magics his way from Little Winging to a nearby hero. Maybe Superman's flying overhead, maybe Bruce Wayne's in the area, etc.

Point is Harry teleports his way to a hero, they go "hey, this kid's a meta and from an abusive home" and decide to watch after him.

And thus you have: Raised-By-The-Justice-League!Harry. Who promptly calls in his "family" when he needs backup. Say... when several students keep getting paralysed by some monster stalking his school.
