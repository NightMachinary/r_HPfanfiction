** I'd like to see a fic in which Lily successfully stole Scorpius from Rose, and Rose swearing terrible revenge on her cousin. Al, Draco, Ginny, Harry, Hermione, and Ron were all caught in this awkward situation. That would make a brilliant family drama.

*** That would be so good! I love any good Scorpius/ Lily fic! The only thing is that I like the "adults" ships to be canon, so if everyone is married to who they are canon married to I'll read it! The only next generation fics I read are S/L! :)

*** Yes I have, but maybe I have overlooked some on there and on ff.net! Maybe someone has read a fic that I have passed by. I just made this request to see if there were any fic I may have missed or have never come across that people think are good reads! :)

**** Fair enough! Sorry for the false hope! Sometimes it's good to go back again and just start clicking at random and see what comes up...

From there it usually leads to full-out author binges. ;)

***** No worries! I might just do that, there is just not that many Scorpius/ Lily stories to begin with anyways. Most people tend to ship him with Rose or Albus.

Is there another hp fanfic website? I think the only one I know of is [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/index.php]]

****** Aside from AO3 and FF.net, I tend to gravitate towards pairing-specific hubs. There was a thread about a site called portkey? being down, and I think some alternatives were mentioned...

Good luck!

** If I remember correctly, I think that maybe Questions and Answers by littl0bird could be heading in that direction...but it's not there yet and has a million other storylines, and the story has only updated a couple of times in the past year.

*** Yes, that story is really dark.

I disagree with sentencing the bad guys to dementor's kiss though. They should be stripped of their magic and locked in an US maximum security prison as child rapists. They would get their well-deserved punishments from fellow Muggle inmates, and when their teeth went bad from lack of magic, they would experience the nice hospitality of Muggle prison dentists (the Grangers could volunteer in this case).

**** That's the same thing I thought. If I were an Auror, I would totally turn a blind eye to anyone who wanted to have their fun with the bad guys for what they did.

Hell, I'd flat out cover for them if they needed it!

** I think this one's pretty popular, but just in case you missed it: linkao3(1432438)

There's also this one: linkffn(4048337)

Edit: Apparently I did the AO3 link wrong? If anybody knows how to do it, I'd like to know. Here's the link I meant to give you: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/764747/chapters/1432438][High]]: Scorpius Malfoy is the Seeker for Slytherin. Not only that, he's the best Seeker at Hogwarts, and it's his catches that win matches. But this year things are different; Albus Potter has switched to Chaser and the new Gryffindor Seeker is his annoying little sister. This is the story of how one match and one missed catch can change your life.
