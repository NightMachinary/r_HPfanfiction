You know the sort, with Harry travelling back in time or into an alternate dimension, etc.

Please no Harry/Tom slash, it always makes me think of Voldemort/Harry and that's just plain weird :c

Thanks!


** Both of the following stories feature Harry as Tom's father figure:

** Personal favourite (because of both Harry's and Tom's characterisation): [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2550563/1/Welcome-to-Hogwarts-1949][Welcome to Hogwarts 1949]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2227840/The-Fictionist][The Fictionist]] has written a few fics where Harry meets Tom.

Do you have any recommendations? I'd be interested in reading a good Harry meets Tom fic too.

*** A lot of slash is alright, but can you really imagine Voldemort in a romantic relationship? Like, really? Reaaaaaally? :D

Just read it, it's good!

*** You can recommend to me =D a lot of Tom/Harry I've found has been incredibly depressing because of Tom being emotionally stunted/dead in those fics. I'm hopeful to find some happier ones

** How about one where Diary!Tom gets loose before Harry gets his letter and 'rescues' him from the Dursleys, raising him as a younger brother.
