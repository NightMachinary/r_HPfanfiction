We had a similar thread for Animagus forms, well, let's talk about Patronuses now. What's your favorite or the most unique you've seen in fanfiction, whether it's shape, ability, or the way it's used?

Mine is, without a doubt, Harry's [[/spoiler][human]] Patronus in HPMOR. The way it ties in with the whole Dementors = death thing and [[/spoiler][animals not being aware of their mortality, and thus providing a measure of defense]] is just amazing.


** A fucking penguin.

When I read it, I couldn't help but laugh imagining a penguin waddling around dementors.

** Huh, the patronus in HPMOR was actually the last straw that made me drop that fic. Generally though I don't care about what animal a patronus is so long as it's in character.

** Luna's patronus is a platypus in "Nightmares of Future Past," which is actually pretty funny.

** Another HPMOR Patronus fan checking in.

It goes to show how variably people respond to fanfic. It all depends on how they approach it and what they're looking for.

For me, that particular scene was /the/ crowning moment of awesome; for someone else in this thread, it was the give-up point.

** Lockhart's patronus, Daisy, in Prince of Slytherin.

Actually what I like most is how the author expanded on Harry's "Prongs" line in canon by turning it into a widespread tradition. Every patronus is given a name that relates to the memory used to cast it.

It makes Daisy, Ironside and Elbby (some of the patronuses in the story) mean so much more because you can guess what memories the characters are using.

** I really liked the "Human" patronus in HPMOR, but in general I don't enjoy stories that are trying to be too clever about Patronuses (for example by giving Harry a magical creature as a Patronus). It's a bit tiring. In particular because I feel like the whole Patronus thing is one aspect that canon handled particularly well... it's hard to convince me that an author is actually adding anything worthwhile to the conversation.

** Agree 100% with OP. Reading the reveal chapter still fills me with feels to the point of tears.

I would not be averse to any Pokemon Patronus, of course! :)

Although I suppose a Xerneas Patronus would neatly fuse the HPMOR and the canon Patroni.

Although the Porygon line is life that we created and they are presumably immortal. At the very least, install Python and have it run "import immortality".

** I know a Sirius time-travel where he spends 6 years beyond the Veil with Death. And is then sent back. And his patronus is Death (who is personified as an ice-queen type woman in this fic). The gawking the first time he called it was awesome.

I can't link because it was a challenge fic that hasn't been reposted.

**** It was Slytherin Black by Jilly James, but I can guarantee that you won't find it anywhere. It was on the Rough Trade challenge site only, and if Jilly posted it, it would be on her own Wordpress site and not one of the big archives. Or /maybe/ the wildhareproject site.
