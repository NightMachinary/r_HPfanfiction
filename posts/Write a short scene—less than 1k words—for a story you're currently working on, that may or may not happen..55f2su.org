--------------

Harry thought he heard a storm of protests erupt all around him, but it may have been merely whispers. Everything seemed to fall away as his eyes lingered on Malfoy, who vacated the stage in graceful strides.

A door off to the side of the podium opened and out walked Voldemort.

He didn't know when he reached for his wand, but he noticed when he clasped his fingers around it. A hand reached over from behind, latching onto his shoulder.

"We can't, Harry," Dumbledore urged. "Voldemort came to an agreement with the Supreme Mugwump. He's come to deliver a speech, but he will retaliate if attacked first."

For a moment, Harry was torn between action and inaction. Then Voldemort stepped up onto the stage, about to address the Confederation and looked straight at him and smiled. The red eyes gleamed with their usual malice, the cold smile triumphant.

Harry wanted to bolt from his seat, do something, /anything,/ but an arm sneaked across his chest.

"Don't you dare," Sturgis muttered. "You would invite catastrophe."

"And /letting him speak/ isn't one?"

Sturgis leaned in. "How many would die? We have no choice. He won this battle."

Voldemort rested his hands on the lectern and the protests were cut short as if by a curse. The Dark Lord cast a look over the gathering, unhurriedly letting his audience settle into a grave-like silence. Harry found himself frozen in his seat, one hand clutching his wand, the other gripping the armrest, knuckles on both gone white.

And then Voldemort spoke.

“Witches and wizards of the Confederation. Many of you must suspect I've come before you to deliver a declaration of war, proof of my alleged tyrannical ambitions. It would be words foolishly spent. War has already been declared - civil war, which is currently in effect in Britain. Those who oppose me, my supporters and our cause, have cried out against me, labeling me a terrorist and fear-mongerer. For a second time in as many decades, I'm fighting to restore Britain to what it once was - a true home for all who hold magic dear, a beacon of wizarding civilisation and once again, I am decried a monster for standing up for what is /right.”/

Harry didn't know what made a great orator, but Voldemort didn't need to be one to hold the attention of the wizarding world. His reputation ensured that each word was readily captured, hammered into the Confederation's collective consciousness like it was being carved into stone. The Dark Lord held himself perfectly straight and with his immaculate robes, handsome face and commanding tone, his words echoed in the Hall with the weight of absolute authority. To disagree with him seemed incredulous - /of course/ that the Confederation shouldn't involve itself with an internal conflict. They could rest assured the civil war would be brought to a swift resolution and Voldemort would install a government both mindful of tradition and forward-thinking - the best of the past and future, to craft a society where all those with the gift of magic would thrive, free from the ruinous influences of the corrupt and the wicked. Soaring words to soothe the soul that yearned for something /better./

Voldemort spoke and the leaders of the wizarding world listened and it terrified Harry.

Finally, the speech ended and Voldemort exited through the same door, Malfoy having left already, and for what seemed like a very long time, the Assembly Hall remained still, yet under Voldemort's spell. A rare kind of magic.

The Supreme Mugwump stood and took to the podium again. As if an enchantment had been broken, the Hall exploded into chaos. Delegates shouted over each other, fights broke out, Aurors swept in to reign in the crowd that seemed one ill-tempered spell away from a riot. The Supreme Mugwump spelled his voice to carry over the commotion and out-shouted everyone else, wrangling the Confederation into a fragile peace.

“Please! This is beneath us all!” he urged. “Exhaustive negotiations took place between myself and Lord Voldemort's representatives to allow his appearance before us to be peaceful and it was. I would be remiss in my duties had I ignored a side in this dispute. Wizarding Britain has a recent history of conflict, a conflict they should be allowed to resolve on their own. The Confederation was never granted a mandate to intimately interfere with any member nation.”

“Are you /mad?”/ one of the delegates shouted. “Don't you know this man's crimes? He calls himself a Lord, but he's no more than a murderer!”

“Mad, am I?” the Supreme Mugwump said, with an expression of disdain. “You're quick to judge others, Master Stavrnik, and quicker yet to use your position to your own benefit, mindless of those you trample upon. I have done my duty as the Supreme Mugwump. Now's the time for the Confederation to decide. Shall we spit on our charter and the principles that have guided the Confederation for centuries? Or shall we let things in Britain take what course they may, as we rightfully should?”

** [ It's a rough, rough draft. Might not even make the cut when it's finished. ]

The small party stood in front of the enormous golden doors leading into Gringotts, flanked by a dozen hooded dementors. All of them watched the clock hanging from a nearby shop, waiting for the signal, or rather the lack thereof.

As the hour turned to four in the evening, the man in the lead turned to an underling, who quickly raised his wand and sent three bludgeoning curses straight into the heavy doors of the bank. The resounding chorus of bangs quickly travelled down the Alley, sending shivers down the people watching the affair, their faces pressed against the storefront windows.

After a moment of tense silence, the doors of the bank began to groan open, revealing an empty antechamber, and a very annoyed voice rang out over the din. "What is your business here, wizards? Are you ready to meet our demands?"

Without pausing to let the words finish reaching the back of the alley, the lead wizard stepped forward and cast a Sonorous. "You will open your bank to the public and return to your duties, or you will be ejected from Gringotts and banished from the United Kingdom. This will be your final warning."

There was no reply. The great doors remained open, and the secondary doors closed. Every hair in the Alley stood raised, nervousness pervading every body in the region. After a few more minutes, or possibly only seconds, the goblins made their reply.

The outer doors of Gringotts slammed shut, and shimmering blue wards flared into effect in front of them, forming crisscrossing bars of energy that spoke of great power.In reply, the leading wizard in the party and several cloaked figures behind him raised their wands. As one, they sent out a burst of vivid orange energy that rattled shop windows and shook the ground as it passed. Very quickly, it hit the front doors of the bank and exploded in a resounding blast that blinded onlookers momentarily.

The wards lasted only a moment more, futilely attempting to dissipate the energy, before they shattered in a remarkable approximation of broken glass, the doors behind them blowing apart with incredible force. Without a word, the dementors accompanying the wizards charged forth, and descended on the bank with all the eagerness of rabid dogs promised food.

Seconds after the dementors entered the bank, shouts of surprise and alarm escaped the ruined front doors, followed shortly after by screams of fear as the dementors feasted on the goblins within.

** Part of a scene coming up in linkao3(Holly Polter), but reading it may spoil some of the surprise for veteran readers of the story.

#+begin_quote
  [A moment later, Harry was hurtling straight upward. He was able to reorient himself to see downward right when gravity had finally stopped his upward motion. He looked down at the island of Azkaban from at least a thousand feet in the air.

  No broom, no winged animagus form.

  With only notes describing the process to guide him, he Disapparated.

  Pain erupted in both his left arm and left knee. He opened his eyes to find himself facing a stone wall, into which parts of him were now stuck. While it hurt, it didn't hurt as much as he would have expected. It felt mostly like those sections of his body were being squeezed under a steel press, but not hard enough that they would burst. Nonetheless, he was stuck in a wall and in a lot of pain. Still at Azkaban. It occurred to him that a destination more specific than 'down' might have served him better.

  There was a 'poof', then a cloudy black darkness surrounded him. His enchanted lenses compensated, but he could barely twist his neck far enough to see two figures slowly approaching.

  He heard one say, "Well, that's done it, Fred. I can't see anything either. How are we going to get him out?"

  The other replied, "Dunno, but we have a few minutes to think on it."

  "Fair point, fair point."

  Harry said, "T-take... take my glasses. Hermione charmed them. They see through this."

  One twin fumbled forward until finding Harry's shoulder, then trailed around by touch to lift the glasses from his face and put them on.

  "Oh, brilliant," the twin exclaimed. "Y'know, we should sit that girl down and bring her into the business."

  "Plans for later, George, cut him out."

  "I'm cutting, I'm cutting."](/spoiler)

** From a quidditch fic I'm writing, The Ballad of Arlfield:

#+begin_quote
  After every fixture Chudley played, win or lose, Harry Potter always sat at that clean table facing an army of reporters, with their ink-and-feather swords and parchment shields, and fixed them a weary, soulsick look.

  Naturally, this was a cataclysmic event that could not pass by unremarked upon. The British press, as the British press were wont to do, would speculate on his every move with frenzied abandon. Every sentence, every glare, every sigh: all could be interpreted in the hands of the clairvoyant Prophet. It had been this way for a very long time, and a smart galleon would wager it to go on like that for some time longer.

  It was for this very reason that, despite the typical sullen, tired expression, Harry Potter was quite glad to be away from England, if only for a few hours longer. It also helped that French journalists happened to be a fair bit more pleasing on the eye than their English counterparts.

  So, he looked out upon a sea of elegant Gauls, and waited for the first question.

  It came exactly five seconds later, when the secretary overseeing the presser, in his crisp, starched robes, picked out a blonde woman in the third row. He nodded pompously to Harry, and then to the woman, and then beckoned her to speak, with the same grandiose pomposity as Napoleon strutting into Austerlitz.

  The witch then began speaking, letting loose a stream of lovely syllables that may as well have been gibberish. Harry did his part and remained smiling and seemingly attentive. When she finished speaking, a mousy-haired woman nearby the Quidditch generalissimo, translated:

  "'You and your side have developed something of a reputation as giant-killers,'" the little brunette started, English by accent, "'having now defeated El Catalan and Torino in the run-up to Chudley's first European Cup Final in over two centuries. How do you do this? What do you tell your players before they go out?'"

  It took all his willpower not sigh. The questions were always the same, and the answers were no better:

  "It's the supporters," Harry replied, the picture of professionalism, exchanging platitude for platitude. "The supports who have stuck by us through all the hard years do deserve something to reward their faith. I tell them that, and then they go out and play. Hasn't failed me yet."

  A light chuckle went through the room as the mousy-haired woman finished translating. The generalissimo then pointed to another face in the crowd, a man near the back who spoke also spoke French and let loose at rapid fire.

  The translator stumbled a bit, and then said: "He's asking about Teddy Lupin. This was his 100th start for your side."

  "And he caught the snitch off a Wronski Feint, nearly into the stands, to win it," said Harry with a smile, "I'd wager that's as good a century start as a lad could hope for. But we shouldn't ignore the rest of our players, Hawthorne kept us defensively solid when Torino came with counterattack after counterattack, and we shouldn't dismiss Weasley's role in all this. Seventeen saves on 22 shots. That's the 583rd start, if you lot are counting, by the way."

  More light chuckling. Another was chosen, and another question was asked.

  "'This is the first all-English final in three decades, the last one being with your former club Montrose, and Falmouth Falcons. Do you believe that English Quidditch is once again on the rise, considering that three of the four sides in the semifinals this year were English?'"

  "I'm not entirely sure English Quidditch ever went away. There have always been clubs knocking on the doors over the past decade or so. I think-"

  The journalist then asked a follow-up question: "But none have won it since 2005," he asked through the translator.

  "As I'm well aware," said Harry dryly.

  And yet another wave of timid laughter swept through the small room.

  It really was murder.
#+end_quote

And, a now, a little snippet from linkffn(Midnight Blues by Zeitgeist84) that I've been wanting to put into the fic for years, but never found the place for it.

#+begin_quote
  "I don't quite rightly know," Narcissa says, tossing her long, blonde hair over her shoulder with a smile, "if I'm to guess, he's entertaining guests upstairs."

  So, I go up the stairs and down many corridors because this house is too fucking big for it's own good, until I finally reach Draco's cavernous office, and oddly enough I hear voices behind the door. It sure sounds like entertainment, but not the kind I'd think of immediately. A particularly loud feminine moan escapes through the cracks of the door. Jesus, can't they at least use a silencing charm?

  So, here I am, sat with a decision to make: Do I go downstairs and make small talk with Narcissa for a while longer, or do I just barge in and interrupt Draco's half minute of fun?

  Well, imaginary audience I narrate my life to, you probably know what a cunt I am by now, so you know I decide to go with the latter. The door opens with an easy Alohamora, and I stalk in grinning.

  I immediately regret my decision.

  "Hel-lo, Draco, dearest of all my fr--oh my God, Hermione!"

  Hermione stares back at me, nude as the day she was born, on all fours atop Draco's desk. Behind her, and presumably in her, is Draco, looking as though he's gone particularly pale. I open my mouth to utter out something, anything, but I may as well have gone mute.

  Oddly enough, Hermione, instead of covering herself up in shock or apologising, or even chiding me for walking in unannounced like she would normally, turns over and eyes Draco irritably, which also happens to give me a good view of herself. "Hey, you didn't tell me there'd be another!"

  "There's not!" Draco whispers, flustered. "Now shut up!"

  Hermione gasps. "You can't talk to me like that!"

  "I can talk to you any which way I want!"

  What. The. Fuck.

  "If someone doesn't explain to me in less than ten words what's going on, so help me I'll burn your goddamn house to the ground!"

  "Ooh, you're a feisty one," Hermione says. "Me-ow."

  Malfoy runs to me, trousers down to his ankles.

  "Merlin, Malfoy, I don't need to see your bits, put your shorts back on."

  Draco stops to do exactly that and then finishes his run. "Potter, mate, pal, you have to understand."

  I respond by keeping a steady ball of flame in a hand. The pale man loses what little colour he has and gulps:

  "It's not Granger!"

  "What the fuck do you mean it's not Hermione!?" I point at Hermione, who sits on the desk in a perfect and totally un-Hermione pin-up pose, pushes out her chest, and waves with wriggly little fingers.

  "It's Polyjuice! She's a hooker!"

  "Hey!" Hermione moans. "We're called /escorts/, you boor!"

He bought the oversized sword above his head and swung it down onto the mountain troll. Hagrid forcefully pulled the claymore out of it's shoulder sending a geyser of blood spraying over him and the surrounding area as the troll crashed to the earth with a thud. It was his first kill in 15 years.

It had taken a long time to put the brutality of his past behind him, it had been Dumbledore who had shown him he could live a peaceful existence and for a long time he believed it himself. However it was also Dumbledore that had requested for him to undertake his current mission for him as well. In his years as a groundkeeper following the conclusion of the war he'd enjoyed his time caring for the kingdoms animals, he felt that he'd been nurturing life instead of taking it away, it bought a serenity to him that he'd always longed for. Yet as he stood there staring at the fell troll, he felt the familiar rumble in his stomach, his heart beat fast sending blood rushing throughout his body. The blood lust had returned.

He swung the sword again bringing it down on top of the trolls head shattering the skull revealing its insides. Dumbledore had always told him that violence had been forced upon him, that it didn't come naturally to him. At that moment though Hagrid knew that he had been lying. Giants were foul violent creatures and that same blood coursed through his veins. The rage he felt was genetic and violence was his birthright.

In my story Hagrid was a warrior of the Gryffindor knights (basically the kings army) however after the death of Lily and James and the end of the first war his heart wasn't in it anymore. Dumbledore convinced the king to let him become a groundskeeper and sometimes teacher for the new generation of knights. It's massive AU but with some canon elements written in but changed to fit the alt universe. This would be Hagrid going to parlay with the giants, in this AU magical creatures roam the land so it'd be a dangerous journey.

** I'm just gonna leave this here... feel kind bad about not updating in six months, etc.

*a deeper skin*

"This disguise... Does Pettigrew know him or something? I don't see the thread."

"I suppose that's the point, isn't it? You don't see the bigger picture until it's, well, /history/."

The study of history, being an often uncomfortable yet deceptively practical pursuit, was habitually overlooked by the average wizard. But the Order of the Phoenix did not invest in average wizards, despite their charitable appearances.

She was raised an Order fanatic; the seed was planted early and watered often. Her parents would speak flippantly of the smoke-filled chambers of intrigue over Sunday roast. A host of faceless wizards peddled specious confessions on late-night Wireless programmes. Even Stan Shunpike (or especially, rather) maintained to this day that high-level agents hatched the plot to poison the Kneazle farm down the road.

Not a moment after she could spell "phoenix", she considered herself a connoisseur on all things unexplained, and on the eve of her eleventh birthday, she resolved to dive into the Niffler's den for herself. Hogwarts housed the tunnel: a plain and noisy corridor, a gentle tap on the shoulder. The plunge was steep.

But flounders flourished in the deep end, and Nymphadora Tonks became just that.

As she flexed her presently stubby, calloused fingers, a small, circular mirror came to rest in the crook of Tonks' palm. She felt her heart wither at the sight of her reflection: an egg-shaped mound of sallow folds and liver spots, encrusted with a pair of beady, pea-green eyes to match.

"Ravishing."

Gesturing one of the flaky stubs at a sniggering Remus Lupin beside her, Tonks wriggled her nose and eyebrows in an attempt to flatten out the excess flesh drooping from her face.

Remus sniffed through his last laugh. "Everything hunky-dory, Nymphadory?"

"No," she growled, tilting the mirror to appraise her corrective Sorcery. "I've never really done old people. McGonagall isn't wrinkly at all, hate to admit... she's the oldest I've ever tried before now."

"So I'm /not/ that sleazy... thank Tiw."

Reassuming her regular, youthful countenance (sans hair), Tonks looked at Remus askance. He grimaced, raising a balled fist to his mouth.

"Good idea," she said with a wink. "I like you better when you're silent."

Remus' eyes glazed over. "Is that a insu- "

"Remus?" she said, levelling a warm yet pointed stare at him.

"Sorry."

Tonks grinned back, driving an elbow into his side for good measure before collapsing onto the worn chintz settee nearby.

"You're unusually chipper tonight," she said through a gaping yawn, stretching her legs over the settee's arm. "How long we here for, anyway?"

"Couple nights," mumbled Remus, clearing his throat as he strode towards the veiled window. "Just a couple of nights. Peter's not trying to hide - I'm sure we'll catch him up before the end of the week."

Tonks hummed, her eyes roving over the fading floral patterns dancing across the ceiling.

"So what's his game, then? If he's not hiding..."

"I've got my suspicions," said Remus, gently parting the veil with a finger. He seemed to recoil at the silver column of light that breached the gap, bur his feet stayed put. "It's sort of personal, I guess."

"Oh." Tonks swallowed, drawing in her knees. "Never mi-"

Remus grunted a laugh. "No, you're all right. I meant Peter, actually. See, he disappeared shortly after being assigned to monitor the Beauxbatons Routes. Ministry intel, not ours."

He sighed, and Tonks nodded to herself. The Order exercised liberal poetic license where Ministry disclosure was concerned.

"Sir Albus won't tell you? Even now?"

"Nope. Not as Sir Albus, not as Bishop," said Remus, inhaling deeply, "not as Professor Dumbledore. I can't fault him - we all knew what we were getting into when we joined. But I've got my suspicions... well, more than that. A Seer couldn't be more certain..."

Tonks squinted at him, intrigued enough to ignore the sudden chill that carried his claim.

"But /you're/ an Unspeakable."

Hands in pockets, Remus cocked his head. He didn't turn around.

"I owed them," he said, quite thickly. "Peter, James, Sirius. They took me as I was... knowing what I am..."

"You mean /who-/ "

"I know what I said." Remus sucked his teeth, scuffing his shoes over the carpet as he turned to face her. "Sorry. You were being nice."

"Don't you forget it," said Tonks, feigning a scowl. "I've Hexed first-years for less."

She found herself bristling at her own words immediately after.

/Grow up, Tonks. This isn't Hogwarts./

Thankfully, Remus chuckled. "I'll keep that in mind. Anyway - I felt like I'd failed them, the day we left. I made a promise that I'd at least keep an eye- "

"Like a stalker?" Tonks snorted at Remus' fishlike expression. "Oh, come on - you were wide open!"

Remus grumbled something as he plodded over to the settee, parking himself on the other arm.

"You'd do the same," he said, wringing his hands. "Between the Department and the Order, I had no other way of checking in on them. So yes, I - ahem - misused the resources I'd been entrusted with to stay abreast. Sirius was the first to go off the grid... James followed a few months later."

Remus bowed his head. "Not three days after Peter's flame blew out, James and Lily turned up dead."

Tonks hitched a breath. "You don't think- "

"He didn't do it." Remus' hands were tightly laced together now. "He wasn't like that. But he was... fragile. And he struggled with it. Always wanted to be a hero, always fell short... that's why he's back.

"I just want to find out who made him leave."

Just as Tonks swung around to lay a land on Remus' shoulder, a sudden whirring sound jolted them both upright.

Remus held up his ring finger; the ruby threatened to light the room aflame.

"Moony hears the song," he rasped, wand to ring.

/"Castle to all feathers,"/ hissed the ring. /"Breach at Falconry House. York on Chimera-alert until further notice."/

EDIT: Just a change in the dialogue of the top line. Makes a little more sense.

** /I'm curious what ya'll think! I've been tweaking this story for a while/

--------------

I support America's right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment! It's a constitutional right! It's /your/ constitutional right! Unless, of course, you're aiming at me. And, of course, they aimed at me. They were jealous. Everybody wants to be me. I'm rich. I'm handsome. I'm Donald Trump.

Some know me as Ginny Weasley.

If I were given the choice between becoming a little girl and dying, I wouldn't be here right now about to board the Hog Warts Express after a summer of trying to figure out why I'm suddenly ginger and poor. The worst combination if you ask me. I would have suspected the Clinton woman of this plot, if she were smart enough. This is like a feminist's wet dream. Now that lesbian can finally admit she loves me.

So yes, somebody shot me. I would recount the story; I would love to talk about how it all went down but, it's long. I get it. Losers don't want to read about the real stories. They just want the bullet points. Informative handouts, really. But, let me tell you, it's a great story. I was super heroic. Then I died.

I remember there being a lot of light while I was dead. Not that peaceful, white light propaganda the media wants you to believe. It's just not true. Trust me, I've been there. Would I go back and see it again? No. In fact, I repeatedly attempted to roll over and shut a curtain against the brightness. It was futile and hopeless and painful, but I'm a hardworker. I kept trying and trying until I woke up in a creaky house full of screaming. It was mostly my own, understandably. I was just murdered in cold blood, after all, and hearing high-pitched squeaks instead my usual smooth baritone was deeply unsettling.

“Alright there, luv?”, was the first sentence I heard in what felt like a long while. I pried my eyes open to see an ugly, old man was peering down at me. At this point, I was convinced that dying was just a nightmare and that somehow I was still dreaming. Or maybe I was in hell. Waking up in the same room as a retirement home escapee certainly isn't what I would call a fun morning. Or a fun night, if that's what happened.

I groaned. Melania warned me about drinking too much Glenfiddich but, well, I'm not going to start listening to her now. Easy enough to just pay the man off. Judging by his room, he's clearly homeless.

“Look,” I started, a bit confused why my voice hadn't returned to normal yet. “I get it. I do. I'm handsome; it's hard not to want me. But, how about we forget about what happened, hm?” The hobo's mouth dropped open in horror. The poor thing. Already in love with me and here I am, breaking his heart. “This was just never meant to be. I'm rich and you're... You're about to be richer, how about that? When I get back to my office I'll write you a /niiiice/ big check. Think big! Then, we'll go our separate ways. Done.”

He stood there with his face nearly the same red color as his hair until he started to sputter horribly. Great, ugly and stupid. I let my guard down for one night- one night!- and look what it got me. A bad dream, a headache, and this guy. A guy who can only wave his arms around and look frantically between me and the door. If this were a job interview, I would fire him.

“MOLLY!” He finally managed to yell. “Molly! Ginny, she- uh! HELP! There's, um, puberty?”

“Is it time?”, I hear a woman shout back as she, from what it sounded like, stampeded towards us. The whale burst through the door holding a book and a stick. She looked at the man first, then me. I've never been afraid of a woman before. I've also never met a woman with a smile quite like hers. Worry. That's what I'm feeling. I'm worried about what horrible things she has planned for me.

My scorned, alcoholic mistake blubbered out more nonsensical words in her general direction and luckily the woman didn't seem to understand him either. “Arthur?” She asked with a raised eyebrow. He shook his head in response and gave her shoulder a helpless pat before shutting the bedroom door behind him as he left.

She turned to me after a stunted moment, smile back in place. “Never mind your father, dear. How are you feeling?"

** From my parents to my Godfather to Harry Goddamn Potter, I have heard every variation of “shut up” under Merlin's own sun. This is primarily because I was never at a loss for words.

Correction: I had never been at a loss of words before right then.

“...”

“Well, Mister ..., do you, perchance, go by some form of nickname?”

“Drac---” I choked, seeing a cheerful-looking puppy-themed calendar on Dumbledore's desk, proclaiming this to be July 31, 1992.

Time seemed to freeze.

In truth, time was moving forward, incredibly slowly, as my Occlumency kicked in and my brain processed this new information very, very quickly.

Fact one: Albus Dumbledore was alive.

Fact two: It appeared to be 1992.

Fact three: Draco Malfoy was an 12-year-old in Wiltshire, not a Healer pushing thirty standing in front of a desk in Scotland.

Fact four: Shit.

Time sped back up.

“Drake,” I covered. /I need a first name that isn't Francis./ “Horatio Drake.” I paused, trying to come up with a reason to be in Albus Dumbledore's office over the summer in interview robes.

And there it was.

“I'm here to interview for the Defense Against the Dark Arts position.”

“Ah. Is it that time of year again already? I must say I had not expected any additional applicants. I hope you are qualified.” Dumbledore steepled his fingers, and though the twinkle had not left his blue eyes, he seemed to be waiting for something. The silence stretched just long enough to be awkward before he sat up, smiling broadly. “Sit down! Tea? Lemon drop?”

“Gladly, please, and no thank you, respectively.” His smile grew.

“Excellent. It's so refreshing to find someone who can keep up with the conversation, Mr. Drake.” He poured boiling water into a mug, pulling a diffuser out several seconds later. “I'm afraid I rather lost the charm of tea leaves after I hired Professor Trelawney. Sugar?” As I shook my head, he splashed cream in both cups and a half-spoon of sugar in his own, before pushing my saucer over to me.

The tea was, surprisingly, perfect. Apparently there were benefits to being an adult in Dumbledore's presence; he'd never offered me tea as a student. We both spent a few moments savoring the hot drink.

“Now, Mr. Drake, let us begin. Are you qualified to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts?” I almost snorted --- I had thought that, by my second year, Dumbledore had dispensed with asking this question.

“I am.” I was almost surprised I could say this honestly. “I am familiar with spell defense and dark creatures up to the N.E.W.T. Level, as well as small unit tactics, curse theory, and a wide array of medical charms.” More than I'd wanted to say, but once I started talking, the words just flowed out.

“Are you, Mr. Drake, a sexual predator or otherwise inclined to abuse children?”

“No!” The question surprised me. As if such a person would answer honestly, unless...

A creeping suspicions began to gather in my mind, and I spared a quick glance toward my half-drunk tea.

Slughorn gestured to the cauldron nearest us, where a potion that looked like plain water boiled away. Granger's hand shot up, because of course it did.

“Veritaserum in the tea, Headmaster?” I frowned.

“Ah, yes. You are as vigilant as a Defense professor should be.”

That was all the warning I got before his mind slashed into mine. I through up shields as quickly as I could, but his probe was nothing like when I'd learned from Bellatrix. Aunt Bella stabbed straight in and kept pushing as strongly as she could, thinking to overwhelm the mind's defenses -- and given Bellatrix's formidable mind, she often succeeded.

Dumbledore struck multiple places at once, pulling out quickly and striking again elsewhere, and as fast as my mind could conjure Occlumency shields, his Legilimency found new areas to strike. It was like fighting six battles at once in my head, and I did so as best I could, devoting a fifth of my mind to locking down memories in hardened Occlumency bunkers, where a sustained assault would be needed to find them, and using the remainder of my mind to conjure weaker shields to ward off each assault.

As soon as I realized that he was only staying long enough in each mental location to distract me, I weakened those shields -- and as soon as the Headmaster noticed that, he suddenly struck faster and more. Eight battles became sixteen, which became thirty-two before my shields began to collapse and I felt him pricking at my hardened barriers. With one final push, I concentrated all of my reserves save the one area at which he was currently pushing, and pushed back into his mind. Suddenly, all pressure was gone.

“Well done.” Dumbledore was quiet, thoughtful. “I'd like to intrude on your privacy once more, by asking three more questions of you while you remain under the veritaserum's effects. I shall understand if you decline to answer, of course.”

I nodded, not trusting myself to speak. I was not okay with it, but I could always decline to answer.

“Excellent. First, I must know, if Voldemort were to return tomorrow, would you oppose him?”

An easy question. “Yes.” Somewhere in the distance, I heard the sound of high-pitched laughter, and I shuddered.

“Good. Would you be amenable to a multi-year contract?”

Another easy question. “No. The position is obviously cursed, probably by the Dark Lord. One year only.”

“Why do you call him ‘The Dark Lord,' as many former Death Eaters do?”

/Do not say ‘because I'm a former Death Eater./ “Because I'm a former Death Eater, recruited as a child, who betrayed the Dark Lord and have good reason to fear his name.” /Damn veritaserum./ “And because calling him ‘You Know Who' is childish.”

Dumbledore's eyebrows raised at the admission.

“Did you commit any heinous crimes under the Dark Lord, such as murder, use of the Unforgivable Curses, or other?”

“No. I have never killed anyone, I am absolutely incompetent at the Cruciatus curse, and I was never given the opportunity or order to use the Imperius.” /DAMN VERITASERUM./

“Interesting. Could you kill Voldemort if given the chance?”

A pause. “No. If it were so easy, you'd have done it long ago.”

“Let me rephrase: Would you kill Voldemort if you had the chance?”

I thought about it. I had never been able to cast the Killing Curse, but that just meant I didn't want anyone dead that much. My oath as a healer said ‘first, do no harm,' but not killing the Dark Lord would be doing significant harm, wouldn't it? And it was not as if he were under my care.

“Yes, if I had the chance.” Dumbledore's smile returned, and the damned twinkling intensified.

“So, why did you decide to apply for this job?”

“As far as I knew, it was the job available.”

“Are you qualified to teach anything else?” I thought for a minute. I had N.E.W.T.s in Defense, Potions, Charms and Ancient Runes, and had essentially qualified for a Mastery in Potions during my time as a healer.

“Potions, Healing, Flying, and possibly Charms or Ancient Runes,” I said. “And probably Occlumency, as you noticed earlier.”

Dumbledore paused for a moment, considering. Then he stood and offered me his hand.

“Thank Merlin,” he said. “For a moment, I feared I would have to give the job to Gilderoy Lockhart. When can you start, Professor Drake?”

** Mine first since it was my idea

Setting the scene: Sirius sat at the head of the table, Harry(14 nearing 15) at his left so his heir ring was closest to Sirius as was custom, his fiancee Sarah Michelle at his right so her wedding and/or engagement band was closest to Sirius, as was custom also. Remus, as the Regent of Potter and Black houses sat at Harry's left while Tonks was directly across from him since Remus's wife is away with the rest of the Tonkses sat by blood then marriage beside her. On Remus's left were two empty seats for the missing Potters then the last four seats of the table taken up with solicitors from the Encyclopedia.

"Well, i think that ends our work for the day," sirius said happily. "The only thing left to do is have a spot of tea."

There were raised eyebrows, this was a new addition to the weekly summer meetings but all felt peckish and nodded at Harry's summation of "good, i'm starving."

When the tea arrived, Sorius said, "Oh, and Sarah Michelle and I discussed this already. Even should she and I be able to spawn, Harry will remain my primary heir. He's adopted and it's only fair."

"But shouldn't someone carry on the Black name?" Andromeda asked, shocked a bit at how she wanted it to continue on.

"Try the tea," Sirius commanded, ignoring the question.

He timed it just right as everyone had a mouthful of tea, he added "And the Black name will continue since I expect Harry to get a whelp or two on Dora before he marries someone. Preferably soon, kids."

Tea went flying.

** /I'm on the phone, so I have no idea how long this one is. This is the prologue to "Colin Creevey and the Rat King" - a sequel to the fic I'm currently writing./

'You have reached your destination. Deployment in 3...'

He allowed himself a smile as the safety belts retracted.

'2...'

He pulled his cowl on - no tricky visors this time, not even a voice modifier. They would be useless down there anyway. All, except for a high-altitude rebreather - Lucius finally managed to procure one that did not require electricity.

'1...'

And the floor under him disappeared, and he fell down, opening his own wings, descending on the unsuspecting castle as a giant bird of prey.

Above him, an equally black, slick jet continued its journey north.

--------------

Auror Simmons liked the night. Ever since she was a student, she loved the Astronomy lessons, and even if her dream to become an astrologyst never came true, she still enjoyed walking under the moon. Especially if the night was starry. And now that she was back at Hogwarts - an incredibly quiet, summer Hogwarts, Hogwarts familiar yet never seen before - how could she refuse?

She was looking through her pocket telescope at the Ursa Major, when she saw a dark shadow cross in front of her target. Frowning, Elsa Simmons zoomed out a little and tried to find the strange object she assumed to be a bird.

--------------

With target easily distracted by the jet - something unplanned, yet more than welcome - it was easy to land on the far side of the tower, slip behind the guard and slightly strike her neck with a rib of his hand. As the guard fell on the roof, he removed the rebreather and looked over the castle from his new vantage point. He wasn't going to enjoy this originally... but this just might have been fun.

And then a fan of red sparks flew from the courtyard in the direction of the tower and he dove into the night, not waiting until he was discovered.

--------------

Aurors Dawlish and Banks were patrolling the seventh floor and, to be completely frank, were getting rather sick of it. Both had been way out of the age when coming back to the alma mater sounded exciting, especially if said alma mater keeps you awake all night. Seriously, who were they guarding it from? Basilisk had been killed already, courtesy of that Weasely kid.

The answer came in form of a shattering glass, as a window at the far end of the corridor exploded and a dark figure in a massive black cloak flew in. Banks quickly sent a stunner at it, but the man dodged it and threw some projectiles at them. Dawlish, quite familiar with Muggle tactics from the last war, quickly cast /Protego/, stopping the weirdly shaped knives in a couple of feet in front of them. He was going to join Banks's assault, when the figure clapped its hands and the weird knives exploded in a flash of blinding light, combined with a thunderclap worthy of Thor himself.

Blinded and deafened, Dawlish uselessly tried to run, when suddenly he felt something pierce his leg, and the next moment he was dragged, kicking and screaming, towards the creature of the night.

--------------

His armoured fist landed squarely on the face of the loud guard, sending him into the land of Morpheus for a long time. His companion at least had a courtesy to lose conscience when the bangarangs - note to self, never again let Stephanie name things - exploded.

Another set of red sparks flew from the courtyard, lighting up the window he came through. He smiled, finally understanding the rules for this place and ran once more, this time - inside the darkened castle.

--------------

'Dawlish down!'

Senior Auror Brooks cringed before lifting her ring to her lips and whispering 'Got it.' She quickly turned to Cruise - the best brawler in her five and her second in command.

'They are here. Spread out!'

Cruise nodded and took a couple of steps back, taking a firmer stand on the platform between the seventh and sixth floors, together with Jane and Marcus, who chose this place as the best killzone on the main staircase. From it, they could hit anything that decided to descend to lower level way before it got to them. Brooks herself and Dubrow - their cursebreaker - took the role of support.

But instead of trigger happy wizards they all expected, the first thing to enter the Grand Staircase was a metal projectile shaped like a bat. It flew in a curve, burying itself deep in the wall way above Strike Team Three. Jane and Marcus didn't even flinch, keeping their aim at the entrances, and Brooks thought that their mysterious enemy missed...

And then the thing started wailing. And an unholy wail that was. As she covered her ears in a desperate attempt to escape, Brooks realised that that was how the soul must have cried, before being devoured by a dementor. Marcus was the first one on the ground, grabbing his ears, screaming, begging for it to stop, but soon all of them joined him. As her vision blurred, Brooks saw a dark figure dive into the Grand Staircase, spreading its monstrous wings. They failed.

--------------

Sonics definitely worked, but he had to hurry. If Damian's measures were correct, Hogwarts discharged the batteries at least ten times faster than normal, which meant he had less than a minute. He flew straight pass sixth floor, dodging a moving staircase, and gracefully glided into the corridor one floor below.

And that's where he saw him. The mastermind behind the castle's defences rose his wand like a fencer and the next second Bruce charged at him, throwing everything he had. He couldn't tell in the dark of the night, but he could have sworn the man was smiling as he dodged the first razorang and banished the rest back to the sender.

Falling on his knees and sliding forward, Bruce ripped his grappling gun from his belt and fired low. The wizard sidestepped with a wooden sound, but he was not the target - the hook buried itself into a wall and the next second Bruce was being propelled forward, throwing his last trick at the feet of his enemy. As the white smoke filled their sights, Bruce reached the wizard and went for a takedown... only to be grabbed by his neck and slammed into the wall.

The battery in his suit was long dead, so the shocker was out of question, but the mechanics still worked - he brought his arm in front of him, and a set of spikes immediately flew off his armour into his enemy's torso. Not strong enough to kill, but strong enough to stagger. Bruce used the moment of surprise to bring his legs behind him and push himself off the wall, bringing both of them to the ground. He hit blindly, definitely breaking his opponent's nose, and rose his arm for a knockdown punch...

The smoke dissipated and he realised he was staring at the tip of his enemy's wand. They froze in this pose, each studying the other, and Bruce had a feeling, that the weird, constantly spinning eye of his adversary could easily see through his cowl. Although, judging by a mad grin on his old, scarred and now once again bloodied face, the wizard did not care for it, instead enjoying the fight. Each one was wondering whether he'd be faster than the other, and neither was willing to risk, when...

The gargoyle at the wall moved to the left, revealing an old man in bright pink robes, with a cup of tea in hands.

'Ah!' he said, studying the scene on the floor. 'I see you have received my invitation!'

** It hasn't been edited yet, so it's up for change, but here's the start of part 2 of my fic ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005632/1/The-Opposing-Movement][part 1 can be found here]]). I'm slowly, very slowly starting to write down the story itself after months of planning, but it's still in its early stages. Here's the first few lines.

--------------

She didn't want to be here. She, Ginny Weasley, didn't want to be here.

It had been one of those days where the summer showed itself a month early, and even now, long after the sun had gone down, the air was still sultry, warm, perfect. A mild breeze rolled in from the window and brought with it the scent of flowers and blooming woods, and it reminded her of home.

She was, after nine long months, finally back in her own room, in her own house, with her own family.

But she didn't want to be here.

She got up off her bed, where she had been lying the past few hours, and walked across her room. She leaned over the windowsill and pushed the white curtains aside to look out over their overgrown back yard. The grass was still wavy, long, unkempt and full of gnomes, the overgrown and wasted flowerbeds still needed care, the treeline was still a stone's throw away from the house and it looked enticingly lush, just like it did every year during springtime. Even that old boot was still in exactly the same spot where it had been since she'd last seen it. It was as if nothing had changed at all.

Then why didn't she want to be here?

The Boys Who Lived

Chapter 1

Harry was sitting with Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall for breakfast when Professor Mcgonagall walked up the three of them looking very severe.

#+begin_example
     “Mr. Potter, the Headmaster would like to see you in his office as soon as you have finished your breakfast,”

     Harry’s eyebrows knit together as his face creased into a frown.  The Headmaster had never asked for an appointment before, or called him up to his office barring a major emergency.

     Hermione’s answer was, as always, the fastest.

     “Professor, we have Care of Magical Creatures in fifteen minutes.  Don’t you think it’d be wiser-“

     Professor Mcgonagall gave a smile that was both tight-lipped and tired-looking.  “No, Miss Granger, I don’t think so.  You may give Professor Hagrid Mr. Potter’s excuses.”

     Worry still evident on Hermione’s face as she attempted to raise another objection “Professor—“

     “Actually, Ms. Granger, I highly doubt Mr. Potter will be attending any of today’s lessons, so I would say your goodbyes now.” Her expression was strange, still smiling, still tired, but tender where she was usually brusque and professional. ” Mr. Potter, the Headmaster’s office, as soon as you’re done.  Excuse me, I also need to speak to Mr. Longbottom.”  She swept off further down the table.

     Ron and Hermione turned to Harry and he could see their concern etched into every line of their faces.
#+end_example

“Blimey, Harry,” asked Ron. "what do you reckon that's about?”

#+begin_example
     Harry shrugged, feeling an anxious weight settle into his chest.  “Don’t know.  He’s never summoned me like this before, has he?”

     Hermione huffed.  “Well if you ask me, I think it’s very irresponsible.  Even if he is doing something like . . . I don’t know, teaching you highly advanced defensive spells, maybe, they should still do it around your regular classes.  But what I really didn’t like was the way Professor McGonagall said “say your goodbyes”, did you notice?  It almost sounded like it was . . . permanent.  Do you think . . .?” she trailed off.

     “Make Harry leave Hogwarts?” Ron scoffed.  “Dumbledore’s mental, but he’d never do anything like that.  Everyone knows that Hogwarts is the safest place in the world.  And that goes double now that Moody’s here.  D’you think he’s worried about those nutters at the World Cup, the ones parading around in masks?”

     Hermione hmmed pensively.  “Maybe . . . but I can’t see it.  Imagine Professor Dumbledore at the World Cup.  Or Professor Moody.  Or even Professor McGonagall.  Do you think a bunch of reprobates in masks would make them nervous?”

     Ron chortled gleefully at the thought.  “Yeah, Dumbledore or Moody’d wipe the floor with them.  What could it be, then?”

     Hermione checked her watch.  “I don’t know, but we’re probably not going to figure it out in the next . . . eight minutes.” She turned to Harry “You’ll tell us afterwards, won’t you  Harry?”

     Hermione had a fierce look on her face, and Harry chose the only safe option.  “’Course, Hermione.”  Harry looked between the pair of them.  “If I am . . . going to be gone,” he fumbled for words, trying to force them around the anxious weight in his chest “You’ll take care of each other, right? Won’t get into too much trouble without me?”

     The ghost of a smile flittered across Hermione’s face before she grabbed Harry in a rib cracking hug.

     “Ooh, Harry, you know to look out for yourself, too, don’t you?  Everything happens to you, sometimes.” She continued on in a whisper “And if you do have to . . . go somewhere, don’t forget to tell Snuffles,”  She stepped back, trying not to look embarrassed.

     Ron cleared his throat and held out his hand.  “Good luck mate, whatever it is.  Hopefully we’ll see you tonight, eh?  If we don’t, well,” Ron flashed his teeth, “write when you find work.”

     “Apologize to Hagrid for me.  I’m sorry I couldn’t make it,” 

     “I will,” they responded in unison, then looked at each other.  Neither of them looked like they were going to move, so Harry took it upon himself to turn toward the corridor that lead into the castle and walk away.

     What was Dumbledore playing at, pulling him out of lessons?  Harry wondered as he pushed aside a tapestry of some very violent vampires. Was it about the riot at the World Cup?  But that was months ago and it didn’t even have anything more to do with him than any of the other hundred-thousand people there.  Dumbledore hadn’t pulled him out of classes when a basilisk was roaming the castle, or when everyone thought Sirius Black was wandering around, looking to stick him with a knife.  What was different now . . .?

     He arrived at the gargoyle that guarded the entrance to Dumbledore’s office and stared at it unthinkingly for a moment, before he realized that he didn’t know the password.  He groaned aloud, but hadn’t even finished turning around to go search for Professor McGonagall when Neville emerged from a stair halfway down the corridor. 

     “Hi, Harry,” Neville gave a tiny, almost embarrassed little wave.  “McGonagall told me you’d be here, she forgot to give you the password.  Um. One second.”  Neville began rummaging through his pockets pulling out first a wand, then his rememberall, dried flowers, a small bag of dirt, and finally, a small, crumpled piece of paper.  Clearly McGonagall hadn’t trusted him to memorize the password.  Neville looked the gargoyle in the eye and read “Ice Mice,” before slipping the piece of paper back in his pocket.  The gargoyle leapt aside, revealing the moving spiral staircase that lead to Dumbledore’s office.

     “Thanks Neville, you’re a lifesaver,” Harry smiled at the boy before stepping onto the lowest stair but was surprised when Neville followed him onto the stairs.  Harry was also surprised to notice that even one step above Neville, they were the same height.  Neville had grown quite a lot over the summer and lost some of his round-faced appearance.

     “Were you invited to Dumbledore’s office too?”  Harry asked as they ascended.

     “Yes, but I’ve no idea why.  Have you ever been to his office before?  All those detentions you get . . . have we done anything wrong, do you think?”

     Harry shook his head.  “I’ve been before, but never for anything like that.  If it was something like that, McGonagall would handle it herself, wouldn’t she?  Unless we were going to be expelled, I suppose, but I haven’t done anything like that since the start of term.  You?”

     Neville chuckled nervously.  “Not unless they snap your wand automatically for melting your hundredth cauldron.”

     Neville’s self-deprecating humor caught Harry off guard, and he laughed as well.  “Then you would have been expelled at the end of first year rather than now,” he teased.'
     They had reached the top.  They glanced, nervously at each other one more time before reaching for the door, when Dumbledore’s voice reached their ears.  “Harry, Neville, please come in, time is very short.”

     The boys shared one more glance before entering Dumbledore’s office.

** confrontation between HP and LM. Words were used, insults thrown. LM goes for his wand,, and manages to cast an AK at almost point blank range HP dodges to his right and it misses, barely. HP leans in and punches him in the face, hard. LM staggers back,,losing a grip on his wand, and goes for the sword cane, HP snatches it out of his hand and whips LM across the face with the cane, twice, once each way. he slipped the blade from the sheath

He looked the point of the sword over, turning it from side to side.. LM gets up on his elbows and begins to stand up, but is distracted from that when his gut is impacted by a foot, and his jaw by a knee. He falls, barely conscious back to the floor, half against the stone of the wall. "Would it be a fast acting poison?, or would it be slow, so as to savor the death of your opponent?....hmmm?

LM is leaning to his right, blood and drool pouring from his mouth, his head throbbing from the concussion received by hitting the wall. He could hardly move, but move he did, he toppled to the right, his hand reaching for the dropped wand, but was stopped as his wrist was impaled ,, and the blade of the sword in HP hand was all the way into the flesh.. the burning was just beginning, he could feel it like fire, flowing up his arm, getting closer and closer to his heart...He wanted to turn and curse his assailant, to speak the words of a curse so foul, but was stopped with another kick to the head. His last vision were green burning eyes as he fell into darkness.

** Alt version :"legilimens!" Black eyes glared down at green.

Barriers forced back, blasting the way through his victim's mind, he saw fantasies about attacking , doing violence towards himself.. Snape began to laugh at the pitiful defenses put up by the arrogant Potter whelp.. but instead of laughter coming out of the older man's mouth, instead was blood and bile. His last vision was looking down and seeing both of Potter's hands, each holding a dagger, stabbing him deeply in both sides of his chest, crossing through both lungs and heart.

The blood soaked body of Severus Snape appeared at the foot of the throne that Tom Riddle had made his own. Pinned to the body , a note.

Tom bent and read the note, and anger twisted his face as hew screamed oujt .."POTT..." but that's all he was able to say before the detonation of ten pounds of SEMTEX wrapped around the corpse.

** [A scene from a guardian!Snape fic that I am currently working on. May or may not wind up in the actual fic when it comes time for editing.]

That had been nearly two weeks ago and since then the Dursleys had only been a passing thought in Harry's mind as he took in all the wonder of Hogwarts and the wizarding world in which it existed. He had never thought such a place existed. Sure, he had imagined magical castles in far away lands and sorcerers that protected mystical amulets, and Harry had dreamed of what it would be like if fantastical creatures like unicorns and phoenixes existed, but they had been just that--dreams. Harry had quickly learned not to put much stock into dreams, however, as they never left him with anything but a deep and aching sense of loss in the end when Aunt Petunia would swing her iron pan and shatter any delight he found.

But at Hogwarts there were no flying projectiles aimed at Harry's head and rarely did any adult ever so much as raise their voice to him, let alone a hand, and he had friends for the first time in his life! Oh, he had had a few acquaintances at muggle school but they never lasted very long after Dudley found out. Dudley was large and daunting with his massive size and powerful fists; any peers that were nice to him soon turned away and stopped talking to Harry. It had been a lonely existence for Harry and he longed for the day when he could finally lave his awful relatives and have friends of his own. The day had come far sooner than Harry ever expected.

Trotting down one of the many drafty corridors of Hogwarts, Harry found himself paused at a particularly interesting display case. It was tall and trimmed in what appeared to be gold. The glass of the display shimmered beautifully against the harsh light of the sun which shined through an open window.

The case displayed several moving photographs (an aspect of the wizarding world that Harry was still trying to get used to) and gleaming trophies and medals with names intricately engraved on them. It didn't take long for Harry's eyes to be drawn to a very familiar face in one of the strangely animated pictures. A tall man with glasses and well known, unruly, inky black hair, stood in the middle of a large playing field proudly holding a trophy above his head. The man's, or boy's rather, toothy smile was infectious and Harry giggled as a sudden enthusiastic crowd overwhelmed him. The picture reset and Harry watched, entranced by the boy that Harry knew to be his father. James Potter was younger in those photos in the display case. His face was fuller from childhood chub and his uncontrollable black hair, which Hair recognized on his own head, framed the young James' face. Harry thought it gave his father more of a roguish look.

There were other photographs of James Potter lining the shelves and Harry found that he couldn't drag himself away.

Harry didn't know how long he stood there in that chilly corridor, watching the moving pictures rewind time and time again, but it must have been a significant amount because when his attention was finally drawn away, the torches had been lit and the sun had disappeared in the sky.

“Mr. Potter,” A silky voice full of hidden threat crooned. “Why am I not surprised to find you gazing all starry eyed at this particular display.”

Harry recognized the voice immediately and gulped hard. Glancing over his shoulder, Harry found that, just as he suspected, Professor Snape gliding in his direction. The man scared Harry something awful and Ron had warned him to stay out of the man's way--he was evil!

“I'm sorry, sir.” Harry found himself apologizing, though he didn't truly understand why. He didn't think he'd done anything wrong, but the professor's intense gaze had a way of making him feel like he did.

The professor sneered and Harry flinched, though he tried to stay completely still. Uncle Vernon would sometimes make Harry play a cruel game with him. Harry would be ordered to stand totally still as Uncle Vernon circled him with his hand clutching firmly at the belt around his waist, just waiting for a small twitch so he could rip the weapon off to wield.

“None of that backtalk from you, Mr. Potter, or you'll find yourself scrubbing cauldrons till your hands are raw.”

“I'm sorry, sir.” Harry repeated, this time allowing some of his nervousness to leak through. Sometimes Uncle Vernon just liked to see Harry shake, maybe that was what the professor wanted.

It seemed to satisfy the dark man for he inclined his head sharply and glared severely at Harry, “Curfew is in half an hour. Do you require an escort back to your dormitory, Mr. Potter, or do you think you can manage it on your own?” The question was saturated with sarcasm and even Harry could see that the professor was being purposefully snarky. “I'm sure you don't need to be reminded that any student who believe themselves above the rules at Hogwarts will be subjected to harsher punishment, correct? This is an ideal that your father never seemed to grasp but perhaps you tiny brain can.”

Harry was taken aback by the amount of venom coating that single word but nodded quickly, “Of course, sir. I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was so late.”

“Get going then.”

Harry didn't need to be told twice. He turned and hurried in the opposite direction, clutching his school robes close to his body.

When he finally arrived back at Gryffindor tower, Harry found Hermione and Ron seated comfortably in the common room and arguing heatedly, as they often did. This time it was over the importance of respecting one's teachers.

“Okay, but what about that old git, Snape. He's awful! Fred and George told me he threatens to chop his students up and use them as potion ingredients. He also gives out the most detention of any other professor!”

Hermione frowned, “Language, Ronald. Professor Snape gives a fair amount of detentions considering there are so many students who choose not to give him the proper respect--” The bushy haired witch paused to glare pointedly at Ron, “--not to mention that potions is a very dangerous art. I heard that before Professor Snape took over as potions master there had been several accidents in the lab. One boy even poisoned himself when he accidentally mixed up nightshade with another harmless ingredient. Professor Snape has to be strict.”

Ron huffed, “Okay, he has to be strict. But he doesn't have to be a foul tempered git all the time.”

Hermione appeared as if she were prepared to say more but she noticed Harry standing awkwardly at the door and smiled widely. “Oh, Harry! Where have you been? You disappeared after dinner and we couldn't find you anywhere. We were worried.”

“Hey, mate.” Ron greeted calmly, “Where've you been?”

Harry beamed at his friends, the first two real friends he'd ever had, and described the beautiful display case he'd come across in one of the corridors, how several photos of his dad were in it, how he realized how much he truly resembled the man he'd never met.

“That must have been the Quidditch case. It's where they display all the awards and stuff that students from the past have earned.” Hermione filled in, “Muggle schools have them too, for sports.”

“Blimey, Harry.” Rom breathed, “I didn't know your dad was a celebrity too!”

“I didn't either.” Harry mused thoughtfully, “No one told me.”

“Maybe you inherited some of his skills! Next year, we have to try out for Quidditch!”

Harry nodded, not truly listening to his redheaded friend; he was still thinking about Professor Snape's appearance in the corridor and the subsequent warning which followed.

** Here's a piece I wrote a while ago that's the start of a mini-series I'm planning. I doubt I'll take it out (I like what I wrote, even if it is a bit dated for my tastes) but here it is anyway.

--------------

The crunch of dry leaves beneath her shoes seemed offensive in the absolute silence of the forest. No birds were willing to make a sound, and no cricket would even think of doing so. This made the repetitive crunch of leaves even more unbearable to her ears. She didn't want to make any sound. She didn't want to hear any sound at all, not even her own breathing.

She could hear Death, and so very much wished she couldn't.

People seem to think Death has a specific sound; the rattling of chains, or the moans of the damned riding upon the winds. But Death has no sound. Or rather, Death has every sound, for death comes in a good many forms, far too numerous to name. But she could name them, oh, that she could. The shift of her jeans as the fabric rubbed together. The laughter and shouts from the clearing ahead of her. The light of the bonfire that she could glimpse through the trees. The crunch of the leaves beneath her shoes. The beating of her very heart.

Death has no sound, for death is not "what." Death is "when."

And for Terra Potter, Death is now.

Huddled under her invisibility cloak, Terra stood on the brink. Before her stood certain death. Were she to walk into the clearing that lay not twenty feet away, she would most certainly die. A quick and painless death it might be, for Voldemort would fool around no longer, but death it would be. There would be no wiggle room here, no lucky break for her to take advantage of. She would simply die, and worse, it would be her choice.

Behind, though... Behind lay hope. Hope of victory, hope of being able to watch this nightmare end with her own eyes, hope that she would catch that lucky break and survive once again! Survive, but at the cost of others. A cost that seemed to be scrawled in blood all along the margins of the twisted storybook that was her life. If she turned back, others would pay. If she looked forward, she would, for once in her life, pay the cost herself. A cost she desperately did not want to pay.

It was selfish of her. It was horribly, wretchedly selfish and it made her despise herself to the utmost extreme. Others had paid the piper long before she arrived at this point, and even if she went through with this suicidal insanity, still more would pay to hear that wretched pipe play. Others had sacrificed more than she would ever know. So why was it so difficult to let go? Why could she not make the leap like so many before her? Her life was worth nothing compared to theirs, so why couldn't she do it?

Why was she so /weak/?

"So disappointing."

Her eyes, which had been unfocused while she had ruminated, snapped back into focus as a voice drifted up from the clearing, reaching above all other noise despite how soft it was.

"I thought she would come. I've never known the foolish child to deny herself a chance to save those she cares about. So disappointing," she heard Voldemort say.

She was! She was here, she thought frantically. She wanted to save the school, to save everyone in it. She wanted to sacrifice herself doing what was necessary, no matter the cost.

Didn't she? She didn't know anymore.

So she stood there, paralyzed by indecision while Voldemort and his inner circle prepared to move on Hogwarts for the final push. As she watched, they doused the fire, plunging the clearing into darkness once more. With the moon hidden behind the clouds, and what little light that could find its way through blocked by the tree tops, Terra stood in near total darkness. She was only able to perceive the faint outlines of the trees in front of her, and faint shapes moving behind them. It was then that she felt it.

To say that she felt it was not technically correct, but it was the simplest way to describe it. She couldn't feel it like the wind through her hair or the branches against her skin. It was simply there, crawling on and under her skin yet never touching her at all. Niggling at the back of her mind, yet trying to grasp the feeling in her mind lead to nothing.

Slowly, almost mechanically, she turned her body to face the disturbance. What she saw put everything else out of mind.

It wasn't magical, that much was certain. Magical things have a certain feel to them that Terra never knew existed before, but now that she felt the stark difference, it was clear. It was not magical, nor was it human, or animal, or... anything, really. It was just black. Pulsing, black darkness. Redundant, really, but it was a darkness that seemed deeper than any shadow she had ever seen. No lethifold could simulate it, no dementor could replicate the chill that settled in her gut. She was sure that even in total darkness, she would be able to pinpoint precisely where that /thing/ was.

But worst of all was the way it /called/ to her. It sang a siren's song deep in her soul, and she felt compelled to touch it, if for no other reason than that it was a third option. It expected nothing of her. It would not try to kill her. It simply was.

*As you could be,* it seemed to whisper.

Terra could have whimpered. Might have, even, but she couldn't hear anything but the steady pulse of the shadows. The allure it exuded was tantalizing.

*Come to me.*

She wanted to live.

*You will.*

She didn't want to die.

*Death is not the end for you.*

She wanted a house, a job, a family.

*There are much greater things in store.*

She didn't want greatness.

*Greatness is what you are.*

She wanted to be someone else.

*And so you shall.*

Terra stepped into the shadows, cloak on her shoulders, wand and stone in hand.

And on that night, Death was born again.

** Voldemort sat in his throne, the hall decorated with the blood and bodies of Death Eaters and Order members alike. A thoughtful expression on the face of the Dark Lord as he considered those left standing in his hall. Lucius, Bellatrix, and Dolohov in front of him, wands raised to protect him and their way of life. Potter, Granger and the youngest Weasley male standing facing them, wand drawn and ready to continue the fight.

"You want to be like them, don't you Harry?"

"What are you on about Voldemort?" Confusion evident across Harry's face.

"Normal, you just want to be normal."

Harry paused, understanding in his eyes. He knew this to be true.

"Yeah, so what, all I want is to be normal, live an everyday life, friends and family surrounding me. Is that so wrong?"

Voldemort smiled and shook his head.

"No Harry, of course it's not wrong, what's wrong is that that doesn't apply to you. You aren't normal, you are the Boy Who Lived, the child of prophecy. You aren't normal, and your stubborn determination for normality will lead to your fall. You are unwilling to accept your extraordinary life. You struggle with your singular importance. That is why you will fall."

Harry took a step forward, while Ron and Hermione stayed in their position. Confusion clear across both their expressions.

"Your wrong Voldemort, my normality, my friends, what little family I have is what makes me strong. They ground me, help me realise that life is worth living and that incredible things aren't necessary, not when I have the everyday magic of love and happiness."

Voldemort laughed, long notes of amusement at odds with the bloody surroundings of the hall. Before immediately falling into intimidating seriousness. Even his remaining Death Eaters stiffened at the sudden tension.

"Harry, Harry, Harry, how long did Dumbledore hammer that line of thinking into your brain, love, friends, family, happiness? I have abandoned all these things in the pursuit of my ultimate goal. This has lead to my success, even after my fall at your crib, my ideals remained. Tell me, Granger, how was your acceptance into the Magical World, where all your little hopes and dreams met, did the Magical World greet you with open arms a decade after my fall?"

Hermione startled at being addressed by the Dark Lord.

"No, I was loathed, looked down on as a muggleborn, I was just a stuck up mudblood to them."

"Exactly, my ideals lived past my fall, even now, almost two decades past, your kind are hated, blamed for the worlds ills."

Hermione was determined her voice carrying strong through the hall.

"But that's wrong, the system is broken, your death will fix it."

Voldemort laughed again.

"Right and wrong don't matter, Might is Right. Even should I die, these ideals will live on, it won't be Harry Potter and his mixed bag of friends who beat me, it will be the child of prophecy, ordained by magic. Further proof that only those of exceptional magical potential can be victorious. Any sweeping social changes that occur as a result of your supposed victory would simply be a result of your might, because Might is Right. There would still be followers of my ideology, waiting, biding their time to expend their might and return the world to how it should be, with magicals in power of all others."

The hall stood in silence, a moment of time in which all who heard him considered his words, would his defeat create deep social and ideological changes, or simply surface deep changes to appease those in power?

Harry stepped forward once more, uncaring for the wands of Voldemort's supporters, now aimed squarely in his face.

"This doesn't explain your idea of my normality being my weakness."

"Oh but Harry, by refusing to accept and embrace you status as extraordinary you are confining yourself to their rules, you are taking yourself to a point and saying, here I stop, I will go no further. I am unbound by this idea and so shall continue to progress, leaving your line in the sand far behind."

Voldemort stood, his power gathering around him, Harry took a step back to be closer to his friends.

"But all philosophical discussion aside, you three have come for one reason, to become a footnote in my rise to power, a brief stop in my journey to domination. Let battle commence, and at the end, I will mourn your fall. For all your faults, you where a worthy foe, and without you, the world shall be so much simpler to conquer."

Wands raised the childhood companions stood in solidarity against the tide of darkness, they knew that in this moment they stood between Voldemort and the world he wished to create, and should they falter, all they held dear would fall. They could not make a mistake lest their world end.

Voldemort swept his wand into action.

"Avada Kedavra."

The game was afoot.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

some background and stuff, this whole idea is based on the line, you want to be like them, don't you. Which I heard in the Pusha T song Intro (Darkest Before Dawn), from the album King Push - Darkest Before Dawn: The Prelude. I imagined it as Voldemort mocking Harry for his belief in the everyday heroes, the family and love Harry comes to rely on. The other more political ideas just kinda came about as I wrote it. The final line is just cause I love Sherlock, both the TV Series and the books.

Tell me what you think, all critique is welcome.

** (This is from a fem!Harry fic time-travel fic I've had on the backburner a while. *tl;dr* version: meddling with time isn't as easy as she'd hoped.)

--------------

It was with no surprise that she soon found herself the owner of a holly and phoenix feather wand. Nor did Ollivander's remarks on great and terrible things give her a shock. "But," the wandmaker said, "I doubt that I'm telling you anything that you don't already know."

/Those/ words gave her a nasty jolt. She forced herself to meet his silvery eyes; his gaze was directed at her face yet unfocused. He might have been looking through her. Into her. Only one question managed to escape her throat and with great effort. "How?"

How did he know that? How did he see? How did he understand what she had done?

"Oh, magic is a strange thing, as is time," he said in his faint, careful way. "They're altogether stranger when bound together." His gaze shifted to meet hers. "I suspect that shall be a theme this time 'round, the strangeness of bound things." He moved his attention to her wand. "Twinned objects, twinned people, twinned souls. Yes, quite the theme."

"Are you ..." Her heartbeat seemed to drum inside her skull. "Are you like me?"

The wandmaker shook his head but once and turned away. He shuffled into the rows, visible in the occasional beam of light slanting through the mote-filled air until he altogether disappeared into the tea-brown shadows of his shop. Then, he added in a voice that seemed to be right next to her ear, "Even if I were to tell you what I am, you would spend the rest of your life attempting to comprehend it. I rather imagine that might interfere with your plans, Madam Potter."

/Tell me/, she wanted to say but did not, could not. Her reluctance was instinctual, like that of a person admiring a lively, colorful snake at a distance. Some things were meant to never be touched.

She set seven golden coins on the counter, payment for crossing yet another river, and left.

** /Datura (fem!Harry) has been raised and taught in the great magical nations by Bellatrix and Sirius Black as well as the entire Black Coven. She was apprentices by the Head of this Coven, Rowena Ravenclaw. Before this scene, Datura has gained access to the Timeless Archives of Babylon and found its equivalent of the prophecy sphere in the ministry. It lets her connect the dots and she figures out her past as well as her destiny. This scene is of Datura coming to her mentors rooms to say goodbye./

Ravenclaw was staring out of the large window, down from her Tower onto the streets of the Ziggurat. She seemed calm, but Datura knew, seeing her soften and tighten her grasp on the windowsill, that her Mistress was anything but serene in her mind. "You leave Babylon?"

"Yes, Mistress Ravenclaw. I've heard it. It was a prophecy." Datura answered, her hands damp with sweat, both from the sun over Iraq and the weight Fate bestowed upon her.

"A prophecy you say." Ravenclaw scoffed. "Helena used to believe in them. Helena died because she trusted the bones she threw more than her own mind."

"I cannot ignore this." Datura countered, voice rising. "I can't sit by and /watch/ as people are murdered. I can end this."

"You truly believe that?" Ravenclaw looked away from the streets of her city. Her eyes met her Apprentice, her Coven sister and goddaughter. "Datura. You think you can beat a mage, four times your age and at least with a hundred times your knowledge?"

"You taught me well, I..."

She rushed over to her charge. With both hands she grasped Datura's face and stared into the swollen, green eyes of her. "I taught you nothing - /nothing/ that will help you in war. I made you a scholar, a visionary and you believe yourself a warrior? Listen here, /child/. You are not a warrior. You have never been a warrior and never aspired to be one until you heard that prophecy."

Datura gulped and frowned at the bile in her mouth. "But I must." she answered.

"Why?"

“He killed my fathers and one of my mothers. He killed my family. I know why you all kept this from me, but now that I know I must seek...”

“Vengeance?”

“Justice!”

“And die while doing so, I assure you.” Rowena pressed Datura against her. She hugged her fiercely and kept her head at the side of her face so that her apprentice wouldn't see the tear coming from her face. “Is this your decision?”

“Yes.”

“Then I beg you, wait a few more days.”

“For what?”

“For me.”

Datura gasped and leaned back to see her Mistress' face. They were red from tears and her lip quivered. It was surreal, like a bad story told, to see the mighty Elder Witch with such emotion on her. “You come with me?” Datura asked, only to assure herself of what she saw.

“I have lost one daughter to Slytherin's brood of snakes.” Rowena kissed her on the forehead. “Britain will burn before I lose another.”

** “Does anyone else smell smoke?” Harry asked, looking ‘round.

Ron sniffed the air. “No.”

“That's odd, because your collar's all singed,” Pansy said, pointing to it.

Ron looked at it. “Ah, shit, I forgot.”

“What happened?” Hermione asked, her eyes wide. “We just had Potions before dinner and I don't remember you being on fire.”

Ron's expression told her he had no clue, either, but Harry's pointedly looking away told her otherwise. Hermione zeroed in.

“Harry.”

“Yeah?” he faced her, taking off his glasses to wipe them on his sleeve.

“What happened?”

“We may or may not have mishandled our potion while you were in the store room,” he said, putting his glasses back on. “And somehow it ended up on our clothes.”

Hermione looked closer. There was a sickle-sized burn hole on his chest just below his Gryffindor patch. Ron's sleeve was tattered and singed through to show his the sleeve of his white shirt.

Pansy laughed.

“Bit of a shame,” Ron said, scratching at his nose to hide his smirk. “I think that was our best work together and then we go spill more than half onto ourselves and the floor.”

“Mostly the floor, though,” Harry said quickly to Hermione, whose eyes had widened in alarm.

“You could have been hurt! It could have started an actual fire!”

“Well, it did a fine job,” Harry said, gesturing to himself and Ron. There was a smear of soot along his jaw. They erupted into snickers.

Hermione looked perplexed. “How did I miss all this?”

“You were talking to Neville, weren't you?” Ron asked through gasping breaths. “You had your back to us. You were probably the only one in the room who didn't see us jump onto our table. Slughorn was beside himself thinking Harry'd got hurt.”

“Dean got some in his hair, too,” Harry said. “And when it was over he told us usually it's Seamus who sets his hair on fire.”

Her frown remained, but a reluctant smile formed on Hermione's face as she pictured the scene. Ron began to choke, which spurred on Harry's laughter, who put his head on the table to hide his face though his body still shook with mirth. They could hear him wheezing. Ron had tears streaming down his face.

“My goodness,” Pansy said, an amused smile on her face.

“People are starting to notice,” Hermione looked around uneasily. “Quiet down, for Merlin's sake.”

Ron took a deep breath, wiping at his eyes. “Hermione, there's no one else around.”

“You don't know that!”

“Were you able to turn in your potion?” Pansy asked.

“All that was left was ashes,” Harry said, sitting back up, his face still flushed. Ron clapped him on the back and he hiccuped. “Slughorn gave us extra points for the demonstration.”

Ron started to laugh again, pressing his fist over his mouth to staunch the sound. Pansy had joined in the hysterics. Hermione remained unamused.

“A normal warming potion would have to be really potent to start a fire, however small,” she said. “They used to be mainly used in hospitals before we came up with warmth charms.”

Ron groaned. Hermione pressed on.

“Harry, did you follow the instructions or the notes on your book?”

“The notes.”

“Are we talking about this again?” Pansy twirled her quill in her fingers. “There's nothing wrong with going with something that's been proven to work, Hermione.”

“You're right,” Hermione said, “but if this potion started an actual fire rather than just provide a sense of warmth then you two really could have been hurt. We still don't know who this ‘Prince' is, remember? How can we trust them?”

The mood had shifted at their table quite suddenly.

“Whoever they are, if it weren't for this book I wouldn't have the marks I do now for that class,” Harry said. “It's just notes, Hermione.”

“Don't get upset just because you're not the best at Potions anymore,” Ron said. “Hell, that book has helped me, too.”

“I'm glad that /cheating/ has helped you when studying couldn't,” she said, miffed, “I'm only trying to be cautious.”

“How is it cheating?” Ron asked. “It's just following instructions. We're still making the same potions.”

** /I've been playing around this idea for a while and it's mostly me having fun with tropes. I call it my fem!indy!lord?Harry story. No idea if it'll happen, but the first chapter is sitting mostly written. I tried to name her after a flower, but Emma stuck as a common British sounding name (like a female Harry) and now I can't think of her as anything else./

--------------

“You're a member of the House of Warlocks,” Ernie [Macmillan] said. He had the air of someone explaining something to a small child. “You have a seat and everything. It's always empty, of course, but it's there for when you claim it. Most assume you're waiting to finish your education.”

Emma [Potter] couldn't do anything more than open and close her mouth.

“Oh for Merlin's sakes - you don't - of course you don't! Hang on, I'll show you. I know it's in here somewhere!” Ernie dashed down the aisle, stopping in front of one of the cabinets. Emma tagged along behind him, seeing that he was digging through the cabinet labeled 1982.

“Here it is!” Ernie triumphantly cried. He shoved a piece of parchment under Emma's nose.

/Unanimous agreement. Let the record show that Emma Lily Potter has been awarded Order of Merlin First Class for her defeat of You-Know-Who. She has been awarded all rights and privileges with this honour, including a life-time seat on the House of Warlocks should she choose to accept it./

Emma blinked at the document. It shouldn't have come to a surprise to her, but every year it seemed that she learned a little more about herself.

“I have an Order of Merlin,” she said, feeling stunned. An Order of Merlin First Class were incredibly rare. Most were rewarded one posthumous for acts of incredible bravery. There were very few people alive who had one.

“Of course you do!” Ernie seemed flabbergasted. “Merlin Potter, have you never picked up a history book?”

Emma blustered. She certainly knew more than any book at the Hogwarts library could tell her about herself. And they certainly didn't know what happened between her and Voldemort that night. Hermione had summarized a few of them when they first met and Emma had decided it was all a load of dung. “Those history books have everything wrong. One said I grew up with goblins!”

Ernie blushed and Emma wondered if he had believed the book.

“Really, Macmillan?” She arched an eyebrow. “It's not exactly a secret that I live with my aunt and uncle.”

“I know you live with your muggle relatives now, but before you came back no one knew where you disappeared after that night. There was a lot of speculation and there was a really good theory that the goblins took you. Anyway, that's besides the point. Order of Merlin recipients are given a seat on the House of Warlocks. You could be attending meetings, passing legislator - you'd be the youngest ever! The voice of our generation! It's unprecedented! By the time most heirs take over their seat, they're well into their fifties or older and there's never been an Order of Merlin recipient so young.”

“So I could take the seat and tell them Lord Voldemort's back?”

Ernie yelped and dropped the scrolls of parchment all over the floor. “Sweet Helga, Emma! You can't say things like that!”

“Why not?” Emma challenged. She could feel her temper rising.

“Professor Dumbledore already tried that and, believe me, he's got a lot more political clout than you. They'd turn you into a joke! I can hear it now. You're too young, too inexperienced, you've been raised by muggles - ” Ernie started shaking his head. “No, no. It would be political suicide.”

“I like to live dangerously.”

“Very funny, Potter. This is your reputation, and wizards have awfully long memories. You don't want people getting the wrong opinion of you.”

--------------

At a lost for what to say, Emma scanned the document that declared her a member of the House of Warlocks. She snorted when she saw the elegant signature Abraxas Malfoy among the others. Her heart stopped when she saw the name Charlus Potter.

“Charlus Potter? Who's he?” She asked. As fas as Emma knew, she was the lone Potter in the wizarding world. Her father had been an only child and her grandparents were dead. She wondered if she had any relation to these Potters and why she had never heard of them until now.

“That would be your Great-Uncle,” Ernie said. He looked at her with something that resembled a bit too much like pity for Emma's tastes. “He became Lord Potter after your father died. It only passes on to male heirs, you see.”

--------------

Emma wasn't too keen on telling Ron that she had a date with Michael Corner that weekend. He had been getting increasingly overprotective of her. Apparently he thought she could fight Voldemort just fine, but needed defending from the romantic interest of their male classmates. "We're having a girls' weekend, you and Neville can do your own thing."

“Why can't we come along?” Ron pestered. “What do you need a girls' weekend for anyway? It's just the two of you and you can hang out with us.”

“We're going to do some shopping, talk about girl things. Parvati said there's this nice day spa where we can get our nails done.”

Ron snorted. “The day you and Hermione start acting like Parvati and Lavender is the day I eat my shoes. What are you really doing?”

It seemed that Ron wasn't giving up. A smile slowly spread across Emma's face. “We're going bra shopping, that's what. I've gone through a growing spurt. You probably haven't noticed or anything.”

Ron stopped smiling and suddenly seemed very interested in the embroidered pattern on the couch. The tips of his ears were red. “Neville and I will find something else to do,” he mumbled.

“That's what I thought,” Emma smugly said. Hermione muffled a laugh behind her hands.
