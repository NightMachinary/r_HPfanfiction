:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi guys I read this not long ago but accidentally closed all my tabs and couldn't find it again, spoilers for the story in question, i remember a fair bit of it but when i search i mustn't be looking up the correct words or phrases because ive had no luck.

It was about two twin girls and one has magic and the other is a muggle. They originally thought they were both magical but turns out just one if them is. It's a bit tense btwn the sisters and they're going to text while separated. The magic twin upon going to hogwarts realises thats not possible and first night at hogwarts goes to send a letter, knocks out filch gets in trouble etc. She by default hates the other twins in her year Lysander and Lorcan Scamander... I remember a magic carpet (the owner lends it to them bc he has personal interest in the outcome of their wish/ finding out if the other twin can get magic) and a genie or djinn. She and her sister leave the grangers tent in the desert after that whole mess. Hermione is minister for magic, the magical twin is friends with hugo weasley (but she is isolated in school bc she is looking for a way to make her sister magic). The sisters have a long lost aunt that they find, that leaves them money when she dies which pays for the magic carpet when they later mess up. The sisters have owls which are siblings. Newt scamander is in this fic and has practically no magic bc of some fish. These fish hold big potential for the sisters because of their unique capabilities. Because of the genie mess magical sis is like expelled from hogwarts and will be going to another magical school and the muggle twin wants to be some type of scientist, wanting to study magic.

Thanks for ur help!

  When only one Hogwarts letter arrives for identical twin sisters, Juliet and Jennifer Belstone find themselves separated for the first time in their lives. Desperate to be reunited, they ask...could a Squib ever become a witch? And so their quest begins: a difficult and dangerous search for a source of magical power. Can they ever bridge the divide?
