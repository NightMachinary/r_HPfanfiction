** I have something in regards to this transformation. Harry is leading the order of Phoenix. It's a self plug.

Five years after the battle of Hogwarts the war is still raging. The Order under the leadership of Harry is going toe to toe against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Diversion from Half blood prince onward.

*** If you want constructive criticism about your writing; the first few things that stood out literally in the first chapter alone were run on sentences and punctuation/grammar. Too many sentences went on for far longer than they needed to. you had some parts that looked like part of a sentence got deleted in editing but not all of it. The best example of this I'd say is the like 3 sentences about Licorus Black's painting. You introduce a character trait about it by saying it's a gossip, then try to make an example of that by referring to how it told Hermione about Harry and Ginny. The problem is the wording of that sentence was super confusing. You have a sentence after which talks about gringotts and looks as if the information about other places to store money just got deleted, so the sentence ends abruptly. I'm not trying to flame, just wanted to give a bit of constructive criticism. Will continue reading.

#+begin_quote
  People rally to a just man, as Umbridge finds when the DA follows Harry to arrest her and demand that the Wizengamot try her for torture. When Dumbledore seeks atonement in battle against Voldemort Harry inherits his power and his responsibilities. Harry must learn to wield those powers in a world where law and justice have powerful enemies and many must atone for injustice done.
