I've watched HP movies like 4-5 times thanks to Amazon prime & I felt those movies are very good then I read the books like 2 times. Then I dont know how I came into fanfiction it started with harry/Ginny story where harry wants to protect Ginny where she becomes MOD after acquiring wand from umbridge in a ambush to kill harry. From that day my life started to deteriorate. I didn't sleep those 3 days at all and have taken sick leave and read so many stories. It slowly evolved into all types of stories and I may have read more than 1000 stories. Due to this my sleep time has been drastically reduced and dont have enough time to get ready and I'm not having enough concentration to do the remaining works.

I already stopped reading any good author books or self improvement books because once started the reading of HP fanfiction those fantastic books and famous personalities books or videos are became waste and not able to concentrate more than 10 min on those books and I'm automatically opening fanfiction.

This is affecting me in so many ways. Not able to spend enough time with my family or friends. Stopped socializing with anyone and stopped all fb/WhatsApp etc. I'm still young(21) and not preparing for my finals after this internship.

Does it happened it for anybody? How you coped with this and how you lose this addiction for fanfiction. Please share your valuable comments please


** I had this many years ago and dropped entirely out of the FF scene (in a manner of speaking) for over a decade except for re-reading my favorite FF series every once in a blue moon.\\
I found my way out by starting a website where I reviewed Apocalyptic themed books...forced me to read other things besides HP fanfiction. Plus, gave me a new reading obsession for a few years in there.

I've just recently returned to FF in the past few months and I have found that my tolerance for "bad" fanfiction is ....non-existent now, so I'm not finding as many stories I want to invest my time in.

Try picking a new genre of books that isn't in the FF world.

*** I second this. I will get into FF and it utterly consumes me for a few months, then I find something else to read that I have to binge, but it isn't quite as /voluminous/ as fanfiction, so I can't just commit my whole waking life to it. As you pointed out, reading some higher quality published works really changes your tolerance for poorly written stories.

**** You'd be surprised at some of the bad quality published stories out there. Apocalypse themed authors have some very bad habits..some as bad or worse than ff authors. At least ff doesn't have an obsession with spending ten pages describing their military arsenal.

I also now don't waste my time on the ...not so great fanfics. Used to be that I felt the need to finish them, even if they weren't great.

** I slowed down the past few months but I used to be about the same. Constantly reading new fanfics and didn't really do much else.

Back in highschool I'd check out 2-3 books on Friday and finish reading them all by Monday. Part of that was because I didn't have anything else to do but the other part was because it let me escape the stress of my life for a few hours and get lost in someone else's life.

Fanfiction only adds to this even more. The Harry Potter universe is an almost limitless world of untapped potential. If you can think of it there's probably a Harry Potter fanfic about it out there. We're all basically familiar with the general world of HP so there's less "Wait who is Amelia Bones?" that you might get reading other books because we all have a good idea of who the characters are and what the world is like. We don't have to rebuild a whole new world in our head with new characters each time we start a new story, that makes it easy to read. And it's fun, taking the same familiar world and people we already know and changing it in some way to bring another new story about.

The problem is that this form of escape is addicting, especially when life is stressful. Forget worrying about studying for finals, I want to see what Slytherin Harry does about Ron's blatant house prejudice. I'll go to sleep after 1 more chapter, wait that's a cliffhanger, I'll just read another chapter. It's an easy way to get trapped.

I don't think the problem you have is necessarily with fanfiction itself, but more you need a healthy way to relieve stress. */Reading countless fanfics is a symptom, not the disease./* It's hard being in college or having a job, and sometimes even spending time with friends is emotionally draining and stressful. What you need to either find an alternative way to relieve stress or a way to balance fanfics with your day to day life.

Setting yourself a strict time when you *will* go to sleep will help some. Drawing up a schedule and saying "I'm allowed to read fanfics from X time to Y time each day" will give you something to look forwards to every day without taking up all your free time the way it is now.

** I went through a period in college where (I guess partly because I had to read so much for school) I stopped reading anything but fanfiction, too.

I recommend taking a break from reading entirely for a while, except the studying you have to do for school. Start to think about what you're getting from those stories (for me, I wanted that perfect unattainable romance, so I just kept reading it over and over) and once you identify that, try to find a way for it to fit into your real life. I didn't magically fall in love at that point in my life or anything, but I did learn a lot about how to love myself.

That year, I also listened to Hamilton for the first time, so sometimes a distraction and some distance from your obsession can help you resurface in the real world, too. I also think it would be good for you in more ways than one to try some meditation, either guided meditations online or a meditative yoga class or whatever works for you.

** This was me too. I still go through periods where I put off my studies because I'm reading fanfiction, and honestly I can't remember the last time read an actual book. I find it's best to avoid starting new ones, so I start rereading ones I've read before. That way I can actually break away, because the thrill of needing to know what happens is lessened.

** I wouldn't call what I have an addiction since I do other things and it rarely delays my sleep, but I found that after reading a really good /actual/ book written by a /real/ author that I realized how crappy most fanfiction is. I still read fanfiction, but I rarely read the crappy variety anymore and don't follow as many new fanfiction. I also now do other things more often.

** Okay wowww. Reading the post and all the comments made me realise I have a problem. Now that I think about it fanfiction was and is an escape for me the minute I get anxious, stressed, bored or uncomfortable (pretty much all the time) I would read fanfics even if that means ignoring everyone around me when in a social setting or just to procrastinate.

It's 3:29am here and I have 3 different HP fanfictions that I'm alternating between whenever something I don't like happens in one of the stories I switch to one of the other two.

I always thought it was my phone that was my crutch and that reading fanfictions was just a better way of spending time.

I'm gonna work on this dependency and try reducing the number of fanfics that I read and find another method that's better to deal with my anxiety and need to escape from reality instead of just blocking everything out and becoming dependent on reading, I don't want to call it addiction cause it makes it sound worse.

Also just realised I haven't read an actual legit book like a hard copy for a while now (not counting schoo issued ones used for assignments) I should do that I miss turning the pages and the smell of new books.

Sorry if that didn't make sense im too tired to properly proof check

** Have you thought that maybe you're asking the wrong people? If this is actually an addiction, then you might be better off on a subreddit for people dealing with addictions rather than one of people who indulge in said addiction, regardless of whether or not they're actually addicted to it. Edit: Just to be clear, I don't know how well traditional addiction therapy (or whatever) will help with something like this.

*** This sounds like the real answer, honestly. None of us are experts or know OP personally so we can't say /definitively/, but it does sound like at least one important criterion for addiction is being met (negatively impacting daily functioning). I would second a recommendation for OP to seek out some addiction-related communities and depending on the severity/how much you need to fix this, to seek out professional help.

People can get addicted to anything, depending on the person and circumstances. Substance abuse is what we hear most about just because of how our bodies work, but just because something is not physically ingested doesn't mean your brain can't begin psychologically reinforcing those same reward/pleasure center pathways in a dysfunctional, addictive way.

** I know what you mean. I went through a phase when I was a student where I was just reading and reading late at night until I didn't realize I had fallen asleep. And then when I woke up I would be in a daze the whole day (from not sleeping right). I realized it was getting bad when I couldn't remember the details of the stories I was reading anymore, which was so unlike when you read an actual book and the details just stick to you. FF was a means of escape for me due to the stresses of school.

What I did was everytime I would finish a story, I would stop and write a "review" about it and post it on my then active Tumblr page. This made me realize how much trash I was reading.

It's been years so I guess, having to deal with real life (work) also forced me to take a good look at what the heck I was doing and decide if I wanted to fix my life or not. I have now significantly lessened the amount of time reading fanfics but I admit that there are just some days where I strongly feel the urge to just go back to my old habits. At least now, I'm better at identifying what triggered me to escape once again and address it.

** I took 1 day off FF (which was incredibly hard), then a few days later 2 days (ect.) I also put limits on my phone so it'd tell me to stop after a certain amount of time. I also blocked the ff websites and apps I used for it. Then I disconnected my phone from the internet and downloaded some games like Tetris and solitaire and watched YouTube videos so I had something else to distract myself with. I also found putting on podcasts particularly helpful since I could put a podcast on while I was reading and then I'd start listening to the podcast and stop reading. Good luck!

** To my mind, an addiction is anything impacts your quality of life. Based on your description, for you, fanfiction certainly qualifies. There was a time that I was where you are now.

As for how you fight it; you fight it like any other addiction. First, you stop cold turkey. Cut yourself off, block the sites, find people to keep you accountable. Don't read any fanfiction for at least 30 days. If you find that it's impossible to read other things without reading fanfiction ten minutes later, avoid other reading for that time too. Purge your system.

Then, when you've stopped reaching for your phone or computer every moment, stop and take a look at your life. Decide how much time you reasonably want to spend reading, if any. If the answer is, "This relaxes me; I want to allow up to an hour a day," then good for you. If the answer is, "Never again," then that's okay too. Make the right choice for you, and take your time doing it. Think about other goals in life - are you trying to learn something new or start a new habit that would be more fulfilling? Devote time to that. You can always come back to fanfiction later - it isn't going anywhere.

The real key is to make a resolution and stick to it. Notice the signs if you start to "cheat" on yourself. If you find that you cannot read in moderation, then the only option is total abstinence. Don't mess around with addiction. It's like alcohol - some people can drink socially and be fine. Some can drink but have to watch themselves. And some people simply cannot touch a bottle without ruining their life. Know which kind you are, and do not let yourself cross a line. Don't lie to yourself that you can fix it later - stop early. Do not push your self control.

If you'd like to direct message, I would be happy to help in any way I can.

Good luck.
