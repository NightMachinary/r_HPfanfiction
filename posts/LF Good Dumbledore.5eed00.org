In particular, where Dumbledore only uses stunners. But any other good Dumbledore fic are also welcome. Can be bashing or non. Maybe it is how I'm searching but I find so few of these.


** Hmm...

It's not all holy-and-light Dumbledore, but he's a protagonist in this snippet: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10383313/10/From-the-Mind-of-Dunuelos-Plot-Bunnies][Slytherin Harry: Dumbledore Acts]]

** He's geneally a good character in my AU stories, although he's also generally quite ruthless towards those who threaten or hurt innocents. He'd kill a Death Eater rather than risk a student's life, for example. Definitely not a "stun them, don't kill them" character.

*** I know it is a flawed (OOC) characterization. But that's why I'm looking for it since I'm writing a paper on the different ways Dumbledore is characterized in fanfics. I know it's out there - I've read it before. I just can't find the fic that had it.

**** A Dumbledore that only uses Stunners while his allies get killed by Death Eaters is pretty much a staple of fanfictions where he's a sort of Antagonist for a "grey", "dark" or ruthless Harry.

***** Thanks! I guess it really is how I'm searching. I've been going through a list of past fics I've read, but since most of those are MOB/evil Dumbledore, I probably skipped it.
