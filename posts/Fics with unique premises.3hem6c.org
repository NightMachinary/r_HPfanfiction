** Since I was just writing about it on other threads, [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]] is the only non-crack fic that I know of where Hermione ends up in Triwizard in Harry's place. It could be edited down by about a third, and the ending is kind of weak: too fixficish, but most of it is good.

linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) is not the only fic that gives Hermione a powerup or a special talent, but it's only one I know where the story is actually about her doing stuff with said powerup or special talent (rather than helping Harry, who got an even bigger powerup or special talent, or something like that).

** I would say Hogwarts Battle School linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]]) If you haven't read it yet, it's about Dumbledore dying in the first war, and Snape taking over as headmaster, reforming hogwarts into something in many ways similar to what we see in "Ender's Game". Focus is on dueling and group battles between the various houses.

*** Battle School is pretty good, but is it just me that is bothered by the combat?

It portrays magical combat like some sort of flintlock pistol dueling, with dodging, rolling and magical exhaustion. I just couldn't take it, it seemed so outlandish.

In canon, as far as I can remember, combat is portrayed by the normally skilled fighters shielding or (mostly movies?) batting spells away, with only really unskilled kids dodging, while the truly skilled fighters barely even moving, just flinging death and destruction and using *magic* to defend themselves.

I don't know, I just think for a fic so much about fighting, it handled HP fighting pretty poorly.

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.

*** On the other hand, Harry being absurdly Powerful in some inborn, immutable way is profoundly unoriginal.

However, the worldbuilding --- the purpose of the Ministry and the Goblet, etc. --- are highly so. The only problem is that the author mixed up who the good guys were. (Hint: It's not the handful of wizards who won the birth lottery who have a track record running amok and trying to conquer the world; it's those trying their best to stop them.)

**** I think the ambiguity of the "good guys" is a good thing. Because it's all filtered through the eyes of Harry, one of those few incredibly powerful wizards who would be fettered by the ministry instead of helped by them. So of course he will see the restrictions and control on power as a bad thing, because he can actually use that power.

***** It would be good, if the author didn't go out of his (I think it's a "he".) way to make his sympathies as clear as possible. We are obviously supposed to empathize with Harry and cheer for his actions. If nothing else, I don't recall Dumbledore, in his writing, pointing out that this setup has important functions and neither does Hermione.

The way I see it is as follows (copied from my post on a different forum):

Roll 5d6. If you got all 6s, then congratulations, you won the genetic lottery and get to be one of the Powerful Otherwise, sorry, someone else got the Power, and it's only somewhat correlated with their general intelligence, and is completely orthogonal to empathy and humility; and even then, power corrupts. So, you better hope that nobody who won the die roll takes a disliking to you or yours, and that you and yours manage to avoid becoming cannon fodder or collateral damage when some of those who won the die roll take a disliking to each other and go to war. (History shows that three out of the four Powerful wizards of the 20th century that we know about did exactly that.)

Oh, and that fourth wizard who didn't try to take over the world? He just indiscriminately crippled the closest thing to a police force the wizarding world has, and that force was in charge of punishing common crime, preserving the Statute of Secrecy, and protecting Muggles from abuse and exploitation. Roll 5d6. Unless you got all 6s, you're a Muggle. Have fun.

One doesn't need to sympathize with something in order to understand it and caution others against changing too much too quickly. Dumbledore, of all people, should have understood that.

#+begin_quote
  And Hermione is a book learner and the book was written by Dumbledore, who is one of her heroes.
#+end_quote

This is a separate issue with this fic, which I didn't want to bring up: in a nutshell, Hermione in it is pretty fanonized. In canon, she wanted to be like Dumbledore when she grew up (and, had she been endowed with Power, she probably would have been one of the take-over-the-world types, for the world's own good, of course), but she had no trouble questioning Dumbledore's motives and reasoning on several occasions (PS and DH are two that I remember). And, as for her blindly trusting books, we actually have canon that directly contradicts that: she read what she could find on House-Elves that was written by wizards, and then she explicitly rejected it, instead applying her Muggle-derived ethics. She would know at least some of the long history of Muggles reigning in powerful people. (If she were American, she would know about Checks and Balances; but as a Briton, she would know about the Magna Carta.)

Harry, Hermione and Ron as superspies in training. No magic, but lots of Q-like devices, lots of background, and a Ron who is the son of a Lord, and yet still the Ron we know - but more importantly, is the Ron canon Ron should have grown up into.
