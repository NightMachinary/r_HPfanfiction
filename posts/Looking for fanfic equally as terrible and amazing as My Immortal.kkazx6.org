Hi! I'm looking for “so bad it's good“ fanfics similar to My Immortal. Any suggestions please?

  Do you want your little ones to read books; and they want to read the Harry Potter Books; but you do not want them to turn into witches? Well-this is the story for you! This story has all the adventure of JKR's books; but will not lead your children astray. For concerned mommies everywhere! Blessings! Grace Ann

** Thirty Hs, although the experience is completely different- instead of being written by an overly dramatic teenage girl, it's written by a member of Dethklok.

** Well, linkffn(Harry Crow) leans /really hard/ into the tropes that make it up, eg the most Gary Stu version of Harry that I've ever come across, so if you like it, you'll really like it. Personally, I didn't.

  What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.
