I just read an unfinished fic Long Way Home where Fem!Harry Jasmine is Morgana La Fey by going to the past.\\
One of my favourite parts of that fic was her best friendship with Hermione so I wonder if there are fics that focus on how different the story goes if Harry was a girl who's closer to Hermione than Ron.

PLEASE no Lord/lady stuff, and I'd prefer focus on friendships and stuff rather than the Voldemort plot.


** Yule Ball Panic would be too much relationship oriented? Apart from being fem!slash

*** Already read the entire series. Loved it. I do want a best friend thing this time around though.

** Linkffn(the never-ending Road by laventadorn) Don't let the Snape pairing scare you, both parts of the fic are not about that just yet.\\
But I does have an amazing Harry/Hermione friendship.

*** It's been good so far! But Merlin, it's so painful to read a rehash of cannon even with minor details changed.\\
Just got to the part where she has to leave Hermione to spend the summer at Hogwarts, made me cry and frustrated
