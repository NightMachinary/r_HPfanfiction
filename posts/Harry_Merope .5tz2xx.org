********* So if Harry travels back let's say 15 years when he's 17, is it then alright for him to be romantically interested in a 1 year old Ginny?

You know 'cause if you still consider someone to be the age they were /before/ the time traveling then that has to go both ways.

Jokes aside, how can you love time travel if you have an issue with character age, do you just have a thing for MILFs (who are not really MILFS anymore since they're not moms yet) and anything further back than Marauder era is a no-go or do you only like fics in which both the main character and a love interest travel back?
