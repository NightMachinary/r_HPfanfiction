It's been 12 chapters and 33k words so far. I wrote the first chapters a couple of years ago as mostly porn-without-plot in what I thought was a cool AU setting. Then I decided to expand the universe while keeping the sex stuff the focus, as I have no self-confidence that anyone would want to read what I write without it. Still though, how far can you reasonably take a smut fic?

(I don't expect anyone to read it through, but maybe the first chapter and one more random one?)

** "Because it's nuts" is not a reason to stop a smut fic.

** I've read it and enjoyed the moments, but the original situation hasn't been resolved- Hermione is still a slave in this reality and Pansy getting her a wand puts them in the position of being revolutionaries. The Parkinson family has been inexcusably absent, particularly with house-elves around to spy on their daughter (of age or not).

You've got a set-up for a high-tension, perilous noir romance. If you have the will to take it to a conclusion, I'd recommend pulling back some of the last chapters and reinject the peril. It's the risk, the tension, that made the story particularly titillating at first.

Or, if you're just doing it for the fantasies, do that. I can readily attest that plot can really slow down your output if you let it interfere with smut-writing.

*** Thanks for having read it! I do want to go deeper into the universe, having put a fair amount of thought into it. I just thought this would be a fun interlude before having to go back to Hogwarts and confront their far less pleasant future. Hermione needs to shake off her humble upbringings, after all!

I'll take what you've said under advisement, though, definitely.

  In a world where The Dark Lord was never defeated by Harry as a baby, he ushered in a society where purebloods are on top and mudbloods are at the very bottom. Pansy could have any mudblood servant she wants, but as far as she's concerned, Hermione is just perfect. Smut!

** Here's a alternative suggestion/idea.

Stop writing for a little bit, go back through the story with a finetooth comb and hammer out the direction */you/* want the story to go. If you do want to turn the story back, edit out the parts you decide are superfluous and make a /alternative/ chapters story.

It's not very common, but I have seen it done well by a couple of authors

*** Thank you for the interesting advice! If I decide to push forward on the plot as much as I've thought of, I might edit out the sex and make it a normal fic, while keeping the sex in the alternate chapters. It could be a good idea.
