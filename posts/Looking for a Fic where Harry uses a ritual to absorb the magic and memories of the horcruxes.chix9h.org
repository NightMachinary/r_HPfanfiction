:END:
I read it a long time ago and can't find it. It may or may not be a crossover, and or a sequel that is a crossover. All I can remember about it was that Harry found/ created a ritual to absorb the power and memories of the horcruxes, all of them. I would also be thankful for other story recommendations of similar stories.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/]] He absorbs all the horcruxs here I think, so it's probably the one you wanted.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12246163/1/]] This one should fit your request, but I don't think is the one you wanted.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/]] Probably fits the request? Don't remember much about this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5066535/1/]] This one doesn't really fit because first, he uses technology more than magic to deal with the scar, and he doesn't absorb anything, but the Goauld stuff makes up for it I think. It's a Stargate crossover of course.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11517217/1/]] This one absorbs the horcrux, magic and memories, and doesn't stop there. Naruto crossover.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

  Purebloods have always been obsessed with maintaining their bloodlines. What was this based on? What is the origin of these traditions? Or rather WHO? As always Harry finds himself in the oddest situations. But finding himself face to face with the Progenitor of Magic Itself? That's certainly not what he expected when he got out of bed in the morning.
