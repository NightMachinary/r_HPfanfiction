I just recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2703901/1/Curse-of-Fate][Curse of Fate]] by Mistress Nikitia, and it was very good, although it gets kinda cracky towards the end and is incomplete.

I hope you folks can recommend other stories in which Harry or another character becomes a vampire, or stories which deal extensively with vampires in general.

*** This and it's sequels are fantastic, however the trilogy has been left unfinished which is quite disappointing. No other fics feel the same after reading this series.

** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/5185][Forever Knight]] by DeliverMeFromEve is the best vampire fic there is. It was written before Twilight, so it avoids most of the cliches associated with vampire stories today. It's dark and excellently written. Pre- DH. H/Hr

*** There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3705709/1/Blood-Bound-A-Vampire-Story][Blood Bound]] for H/Hr, but not nearly as good..

EDIT: Oh and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2234227/1/Hermione-s-Change][Hermione's Change]] is a nice little short fic.
