Preferably post-DH, but any well-written story that mainly focuses on teaching pureblood wizards how to live in the muggle world, realistically. This can be them doing it on their own or with the help of someone who knows the muggle world better.

I'd rather no stories that center around a pairing, but I'd be good with anything except pairings with age gaps.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10287864/1/Biting-the-Hand-That-Feeds-You][Biting the Hand that Feeds You]] has Snape and Draco pulling a Breaking Bad but with potato chips as a sideplot. It's also got Bellatrix in a meat Susanoo and the greatest Draco/Ginny ship ever.
