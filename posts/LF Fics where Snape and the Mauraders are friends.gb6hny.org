I haven't read any Mauraders era fics except for timetravel, so if such a fic exists I think it would be interesting

*** This was entertaining. Lots of really good writing. Didn't care for the heavy handed "let's torture this character to make him sympathetic" situation, but it made up for that with an enjoyable premise and conclusion. Also author's notes were a bit heavy handed. For a writer that talented, I didn't expect the notes to sound so ... childish. Glad I read it.

**** It definitely felt a bit contrived when Snape spent about 50% of the fic injured or unconscious, but the rest of it was very enjoyable to me. I agree ---the author's notes felt like they came from an entirely different person, and I did my best to avoid looking at them.

***** Yeah, didn't care for the torture porn. The weird thing is that the writer is genuinely good. But that, and the author notes felt like something else.
