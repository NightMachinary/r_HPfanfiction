  Harry is attacked by dementors in Little Whinging, Surrey. Somehow, this turns out not to be the most traumatic event of the day. In which: Harry wakes up in Voldemort's fifteen year old body, confronts a dangerously charismatic and no longer quite-so-insane Dark Lord impersonating him, joins (inadvertently) the nature vs. nurture debate, and wonders (without success) at the difference between sociopathy and psychopathy.
