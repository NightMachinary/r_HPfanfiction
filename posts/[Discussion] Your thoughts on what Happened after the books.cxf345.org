Hello, lets talk about after the books, your thoughts and theories

one of mine is both harry and Ron where in the running to become The new Head Auror when Ron learnt about Hermione's pregnancy he decided to Retire to work at the Joke Shop so he would have more time free to spend with the kids and so Hermione could focus on her career.

** Ron and Hermione go to marriage counseling after Ron reveals he was so drunk at their wedding he couldn't remember it, and admits he has a problem with alcoholism, which led him to give Albus a love potion as a gift. As a result of her parents' possible divorce, their daughter Rose tries to get their attention by acting up at school and bullying her cousin Albus for being in Slytherin.

And now to blow your mind: /it's based off Cursed Child canon./

  *RON:* I mean, we've been together so long --- and married for so long --- I mean, so long ---

  *HERMIONE:* If this is your way of saying you want a marital break, Ron, then, to be clear, I will skewer you with this quill.

  *RON:* Shut up. Will you shut up for once? I want to do one of those marriage renewal things I've read about. Marriage renewal. What do you think?

  *HERMIONE (melting):* You want to marry me again?

  *RON:* Well, we were only young when we did it the first time and I got very drunk and --- well, to be honest, I can't remember much of it and . . . The truth is --- I bloody love you, Hermione Granger, and whatever time says --- *I'd like the opportunity to say so in front of lots of other people. Again. Sober.*

**** According to [[https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/theatre/a-brutal-dark-time-real-life-heartache-behind-harry-potter-play-20190521-p51pkb.html][this article that I read,]] the playwrights were given advice straight from JKR's mouth on how to write and portray her characters, but ignored it to project their own issues into the character dynamics. So it's not like they didn't /understand/ the characters from the book, they just didn't care.

#+begin_quote
  While writing the script for Cursed Child, Jack Thorne endured a private agony. 'Every aspect of the show,' he says, 'is infected by that.'

  In Cursed Child, the now-adult Harry is bewildered by the prickly defensiveness of his teenage son, Albus. He tries to talk some sense into the boy -- and when that fails, he shouts something that sucks the air out of the room.

  "One of the notes I got given was, 'Make sure Harry is still likeable', so I cut that scene entirely," Thorne says. "Then John goes, 'Where the hell is this scene?' and he put it back in ... I think it's a scene parents really relate to."

That scene that parents relate to is the famous Yelling Harry one.

    *There's a silence. ALBUS nods. Pause. HARRY realizes what he's said.*

Even Rowling herself has later admitted there'd probably be issues that could break marriages due to the fact someone who's a joker but immature and someone who's uptight and career-minded could find it harder when they have to make it all work together.

****** Except Hermione isn't from Wizarding Britain, much of her arc revolves around that entire issue of her having serious issues integrating with Wizarding customs and society (SPEW for example). She's always been of an activist/career-minded disposition while Ron is a bit immature and needy of attention.

Not doing the whole Harmony "she should've married Harry, because he's amazing" rant (until the sudden turn in Book six Hermione always came across as rather asexual to be fair) but to me they worked as friends who at the end of the day, after debating/arguing, had the benefit of separate bedrooms and the ability to go somewhere else if they had enough of sharing a space with that person. Completely different world when you have to see that person every day, share finances, and at the end of it share a bed.

Rowling and Watson have both at times stated any marriage would likely breakdown and require counselling, if not divorce, and from the books it's hard to disagree with that assessment.

In my view there's just too many questions and issues that get in the way of "and then they were happily married with two kids 19 years later" when their issues take up a large page total of seven books.

I don't ignore everything said to me, I tend to reply to most of it and argue my point of view on a book series, you're the one who aggressively goes after people the moment they criticise Ron at all as haters. I've actively said I don't think Ron's that bad a character, I like aspects of his character moments and arcs, I just tend to think that certain arcs/gimmicks were overused to create drama for little reason bar other character's story and he was underutilised as the series went on (which became more focused on Harry and Hermione to the detriment of many a character) and as a result I don't particularly like or dislike him as a result, he just sort of "exists" at times.

Simply because I disagree with your view of his interactions with Hermione or Hermione's characterisation towards them isn't sticking my head in the sand. Yes they have a deep friendship but I don't particularly agree it's really painted as more than that until HBP, which is the book that seemed to be where many of the most remembered romances suddenly took up a lot of the story (Fleur/Bill, Tonks/Remus going from one-sided to relationship, Harry/Ginny with the whole "lion" business, Ron Lavender then Hermione implied at the end of the book, the revelation Voldemort is nasty because of love potions and false love or something) and therefore to my mind comes across as something else tat Rowling didn't plan from the start but as she went along.

And replying to one person only to then go to someone else all to insult the former is the metaphorical going behind someone's back.

********************** You came into a thread, made an insult about me because you thought I was someone else, deleted that when I challenged you about it, and since then you've just been throwing weird shade at me for no reason.

All because I have a different interpretation of a novel than someone else, to whom I didn't insult or argue theirs must be rubbish or lies. Just that I didn't agree with it.

I'm still waiting for an explanation of why you did this and if you don't have one maybe you should stop talking to me and just leave me in peace?

*********************** Nah mate I'm just telling you to move on. You're the one getting really triggered and personal about this. I deleted that comment because you said it upset you and that's polite, even apologised for it. I did explain why I wrote it. Maybe if you want to be left in peace you can just stop replying to me with this nonsense and move on with your life? It's a discussion board and I get notified every time you reply.

Again though there's basically no chance you're really reading any of this because you're still demanding I rewrite something I already wrote.

Let it go and move on with your life. It's a discussion board, nothing important.

************************ You've been nothing but insulting this entire thread:

#+begin_quote
  " No one mentioned Hermione up to now lol."

  "Absolute nonsense. Krum alone disproves that."

  Also Hermione is clearly shown to be interested in Ron but I get the feeling you'll reject that.

  it's you specifically (and two other users) that show up in every thread about him with this mad vendetta

  I'll delete that other comment but it's difficult talking to someone that just replies "actually no it's not like that because I don't like it"
#+end_quote

You claim stuff happened, I refute it, and then you just conjure up something else with no reference to your previous claims. You dismiss anything I'll say before I even say it while accusing me of not listening to anyone. Even the admittance about the previous comment you deleted comes with this hackneyed backhanded justification for it.

And now it's all "triggered". For your comments about me your own conduct is rather petty at this point and, once again, you aren't able to provide anything of substance to justify it other than you don't like my interpretation of what a character would be like /after a series has ended/.

I'd like to be left in peace, that means you stop responding which each time comes with more and more insults.

None of this is true. I'm not insulting you. I don't need to stop responding, I'm not stalking you, and you're free to just not reply. Please refer to my other comments for the rest, I've stated everything already and you've ignored it.

************************** I've quite literally quoted several insults you sent me, which come in different replies, with your very first comment of this thread claiming something that wasn't true...

I shouldn't have to put up with personal insults on a discussion simply because you don't like my interpretation of a fictional character, nor should the onus just be "ignore it". You just shouldn't say it.
