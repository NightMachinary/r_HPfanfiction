Long story short, I want dimension hopping fics. Preferably /Harry centric/ dimension hopping fics. I only know of a few, and they've probably been read by just about everyone at this point.

Please, no Stages Of Hope. I've read it a couple times, never really liked it.

So...Pretty please?

  I am Harry Potter and I've just destroyed everything; space, time, matter and all twenty-six dimensions of our fragile little world in the twinkling of an eye. I am Harry Potter and I have just irreparably violated Global Causality. Take that Hawking.

"A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there."

** Surprised [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]] hasn't been mentioned yet. Along with Stranger in an Unholy land it's the best fic I've read in this genre. Also, there's a Hermione-centric sequel out there somewhere called Shadow Walker iirc.
