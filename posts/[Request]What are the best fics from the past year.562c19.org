** linkffn(11419408) Not From Others - Written by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]], it follows Ginny's POV across the events of Deathly Hallows. It's completely canon compliant, and it feels like a Harry Potter story, rather than just a story with Harry Potter characters (or worse, HP characters in name only). She manages to nail the characterizations. Not once did I find myself thinking "man, that guy'd never do/say that" which is a common problem even in fics I like. Further, she absolutely captures the feel and tone of Deathly Hallows. What I mean by this is, yes, there's clearly a war going on in the background, and it makes things a little bleak, but all in all, most characters are just trying to get by. The war effects the characters greatly, but manages not to dominate every aspect of their lives, which IMO is a very delicate balance that the author has struck with impeccable precision. I'm probably not articulating this very well, but my point is, Not From Others is, to me, the absolute best fanfiction that I've read so far.

  She may not have been able to join Harry, Ron and Hermione, but Ginny refuses to go down without a fight. As war approaches, Ginny returns to Hogwarts to resurrect Dumbledore's Army and face the darkest year the wizarding world has ever seen. DH from Ginny's POV. Canon.

Can't agree more, I'm accidentally (wasn't planning on doing it, I don't even have the time ffs) reading it again and I almost forgot how good it was. [[/u/FloreatCastellum]], I sincerely hope you'll get back to writing soon because you having a hiatus means I'm having one too :(

I deleted ~7000 words of the Muriel vs Marge fic I wrote in a fit of insecurity, so if I do write that again I might just post it here rather than publishing it on ff.net.

***** Ah good on the Lupin part! One of my favourite characters (liked his portrayal in Not From Others as well).

I do hope you've been able to recover the M/M fic though? Never worth it to delete anything like that. Going back to my essays for my first year of uni was embarassing but also quite instructive.

And if you start posting on reddit I must find a way to get notified about that... Don't think reddit has a build-in stalker mode.

** linkffn(11191235) - *Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin* really hit its stride this year. It's been posted a lot in this sub (so I won't beat a dead horse), but it's one of my must-reads. Imagine the stereotypical WBWL story, and watch as this slowly subverts all the common tropes. Just be warned the first half of Year 1 is quite bad (but Year 2 more than makes up for it).

There's also [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire]]. It recently updated, but it's a 4 part series set around the idea of building a civilization. What if a bunch of wizards were shipwrecked in the middle of the ocean and had to build everything from scratch?

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** linkffn(12125300) Black Luminary - really good discovery that I've made two days ago. Non BWL (I think) Harry that was adopted by Arcturus in the world where magical world went through some serious changes after Grindewald's fall. Reversed situation with purebloods opressed, kidd starting Hogwarts at 13 years old and magic that's heavy on theory are amongst interesting points of this fic. On the other hand characters are somewhat too extreme in their behaviour and I feel slightly annoyed how our information about magic is put into small portions, but it's definitely a fic worth reading.

linkffn(12123765) Harry Potter and the Wizarding World: Dark Arts - Decent fic with non BWL Harry (Neville is BWL) who doesn't like muggles very much despite his mother's efforts to teach him to the contrary. Rather disappointing on the magic side so far, with plot that didn't manage to really branch out yet (we are at troll which went in really different way), but the writing is good enough and the author uses non-book stuff well.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4707098][*If the Sun Goes Black*]] and the prequel [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6264406/chapters/14353156][*There Is Always the Moon*]] are really good Drarry mystery-ish fics set a few years after Hogwarts. To say anymore will give a lot away because there are some cool twists and reveals and I don't want to spoil. Read them in the order of If the Sun Goes Black first because otherwise the plot twists are nowhere near as good. linkao3(6264406) and linkao3(4707098). There is Always the Moon is one of the best fics I have read this year - if not the best. It is a creature fic without falling into any of the usual tropes. If you like Drarry, you will love this fic.

Right now lots of people on this sub, myself included, are LOVING [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7737991][*Put Your Guns Away It's Teatime*]] and the sequel that is a WIP [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7882474/chapters/18003613][*Put Your Curse in Reverse*]] by Frombluetored. The are not only canon pairings but CC compliant fics. The twist is that there is an Albus/Scorpius relationship, but even that is CC compliant with how she did it and so well done (even if youre not huge on slash - it isnt graphic at all). These fics are SOOO good - the author writes their family dynamics and banter perfectly - and it's updated every couple days which is amazing. Idk how she does it. I highly recommend them! Linkao3(7882474), linkao3(7737991)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6177703][House Proud]] also came out this year and is really cool. It's super creepy and reads like a cross between Edgar Allan Poe and HP fanfic. linkao3(6177703)

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Well, it's not from this year, but it has been updated this year, if that counts at all. I'm hoping it will be updated soon, again, too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446042/1/Rise-of-a-Light-Lady]]

This is a Fem!Harry fic of a kind I've never read before, and I expect great things to come out of it when it's updated again.

Another one from the same author (who's actually really good in my opinion, and maybe one of the better ones on the site, even) is this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11798446/1/The-Golden-Age]]

It's a time travel do over fic with the twist that the main trio (plus a side character) go back in time together, instead of it being just Harry or just Hermione, etc.

I'd like to say that what I love the most about this author is that her dialogue/characters are her strength, and there seems to be real emotion/passion behind them. It seems as if she draws from some very personal places when writing, and I appreciate it a great deal, especially considering most fanfics I've read the dialogue comes off as robotic, flat, stiff, whatever have you, and the characters themselves seem dull or muted. Not so with this author, and I expect great things from her...if she updates.
