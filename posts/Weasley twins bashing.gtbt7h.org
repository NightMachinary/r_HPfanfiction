** Very few writers are going to bash only the twins. Too many of them find the Twins' antics "funny" and "cool", and besides that, Harry needs to be best friends with the twins so that they can show how much better friends the twins are to Harry (compared to Ron) and leave opportunities for Weasley bashing.

The closest writing I've seen that bashes the twins (more like calling them out on their bs) is chapter 49 of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/49/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]) but it was very short-lived since they make up in Chapter 53 and Ron /apologizes/ to them. /Apologizes/ to the /twins/. Ugh.

I wish there was a fic where someone calls out the twins bs while leaving the rest of the family alone, but I also wish I had a million dollars.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** There was a one-shot I read that I really wish I'd bookmarked because I haven't found it again. It portrays the twins' canon "pranks" against Ron as the malicious actions they are (turning his teddy bear into a teddy-bear-sized spider /while he's holding it/, burning through his tongue with an acid pop they forced him to eat), except that they succeeded in forcing him into the Unbreakable Vow that was stopped in canon. They made him vow never to rat on them for their pranks. Then Ginny gets hurt in one of their pranks and they insist that he go and get their mother. So Ron, who's not even old enough to start Hogwarts, has to decide between his magic and his sister. At the end, squib Ron is sent off with the "squib accountant cousin," who turns out to be James Bond.

  An assortment of Harry Potter one shots. Though listed as "Humor/General," the collection also contains Drama, Horror, Family, and Tragedy, as well as a few experimental fiction stories as I work out my stylist chops. Contain crossovers with several fictional worlds, including the Cthulhu Mythos, Starship Troopers, Star Wars, and James Bond.

*** Because not all of what they are doing is Fun (some of their pranks are not harmless). You don't do that in real life without either be expelled, Hardly punished or someone could be snapping because of the Pranks(bullying) and doing something really wrong in repercussions.

Let's not even talk about the experimentations of unknow magical products on first years (or their own familly). Could kill someone, but they don't even register the risk, thinking that a Magical Healer could fix everything.

My head canon is that The High quality of Magical healing made the Wizardling world kind of retarted in front of the potential danger of magical experimentations.

***** That's because they are on the "Good" Side and one of them died for the Cause, If the Pranksters were Slytherins, not related to any cause to Harry and his companions, and were deliberately focusing The Griffs, they would be a lot of hate.

I don't know why people don't realize but, what the Marauders and The Twins were doing was basically isolating the morally and Ok Slytherins, letting them only having Allies with the others members of their own House: The Future Death Eaters and in so facility The recruitment of those that were isolated.

****** Err... what? Snape is far from 'morally okay'. This whole revisionism over 'Snape was the REAL victim!' because the Marauders bullied him always grosses me out. Imagine if the family of some school shooter made that argument. Nobody wants to hear it when the bullied 'victim' does something way worse than the bullies ever dreamed of.

Just for a reminder, Snape was part of a conspiracy to murder a man and a *one-year-old baby*, for the sole purpose of controlling the baby's mother. That's sick. And before you say he loved Lily, ask yourself if someone who endorsed toddler murder would have a problem with rape and compulsion spells. To me, Snape was as bad a villain as Voldemort.
