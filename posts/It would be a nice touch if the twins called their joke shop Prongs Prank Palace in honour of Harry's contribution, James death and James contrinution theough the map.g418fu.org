** For the twins, Prongs is a co-creator of a fun gadget they used for a while as kids, nothing more. Even if they learned his real identity, they still don't have any personal connection to James Potter. Why would they feel they feel the need to honour his death and contribution over, idk, their uncles whom they might even remember?

At most, I can see them naming some product or a product line after Sirius as a gesture to Harry.

** No, that's horrible. The Weasley's came up with all the products and had the entrepreneurship to establish the business. Naming it after some prat who made a map that they didn't even use after fourth year seems stupid.

Also, from a branding point of view all of the children of Hogwarts know of the Weasley twins and their pranks. A shop named for them will be much more recognisable than one named after "Prongs" that only at most a dozen people know.

*** The 'prat' did more than that. Marauders, that is Prongs, Padfoot, Moony and Wormtail, were what inspired the twins to focus on pranks as something they wanted to do in life. They were their idols, inspiration, and Harry was the one to actually make this possible.

When twins got the, rather substantial, donation at the end of fourth year, they didn't have developed products, just a few tricks. They didn't have money, and even most prototypes were lost in the deal with Bagman. They didn't have a business plan, or anyone high up to sponsor them, or find investors. On top of that, Zonko's had the pranks & magical doodads market cornered if not saturated. customers were happy with that, and didn't truly need anything more.

Harry quite literally pulled their startup from the ground. While I admit they did good work in R&D, and learned some marketing in Book5 through 6, WWW would not exist without Harry. It could have failed even then, but Umbridge provided artificial demand for their products, allowing them to get the word out and start expanding.

That is why I believe that adopting a name that would reflect the contributions of their idols and their partner is not out of character, even if it's not very important either. A potentially fun side-plot, but not a viable foundation to build a proper story on.

**** Marauders being the twins' idols is pure fanon. The only thing twins knew about them is that these were the people who created the Map, an artefact the twins had no problem parting with after a couple of years of using.
