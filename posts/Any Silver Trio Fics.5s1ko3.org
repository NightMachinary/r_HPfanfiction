I don't know why but I just love our second-best trio. Any fics, oneshot or chapters that involve Ginny, Neaville and Luna.


** lol I'm so used to seeing silver Trio refer to a Slytherin group (green and silver are Slytherin colors after all) that this really threw me!

  Ever since she was a little girl, Luna had gone out into the most sincere pumpkin patch she could find to wait for the Great Pumpkin. Even though they were in the middle of a war, there was no reason why this year should be any different.

  An AU spin-off of "Breaking Point." Jack's offer is a chance to get close enough to do some damage, and, in this world, PM decides to take it. Now she faces a series of difficult decisions about how far she is willing to go to bring down the man who destroyed her life and now threatens the existence of most of the universe --- decisions that are complicated by her own traumatic mental illness and by the unwelcome suspicion that his interest in her may not be entirely professional.
