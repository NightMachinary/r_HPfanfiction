Hello!

I read a really good space opera AU fic for a different fandom and I realized that I've never really read any scifi AUs for HP! I was wondering if anyone could rec me some good ones, short or long, complete or WIP.

I prefer stories with a romance subplot but I'm willing to read gen, and I don't like/won't read stories that are Hermione-centric. It's alright if she's in the story as long as it's not her as the main character.

I'd appreciate it if anyone could help me out! Thanks


** Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3412346]]) a muggleborn asks the room of requirement to make a spaceship. Instead, it connects the DA to an abandoned alien spaceship in the asteroid field.

Linkffn(voyage of the starship hedwig) a magical exodus to another planet.

Linkffn(browncoat, green eyes) Harry is hired as the Serenity's new pilot. Crossover with Firefly.

**** Sadly, a lot of the Stargate ones end up making HP so overpowered that he can take out Anubis with a sneeze.

I'll have to dig through my history and see if I can pull out a few decent ones.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
