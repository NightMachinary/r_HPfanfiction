Help! I've been trying to find this for a while now and can't think what it was called. I can't even be certain it was on fanfic.net, but it was incomplete.

Harry is quite independent and explores Hogwarts. He finds a cool room with a tree that only shows up once a year, and let's Hermione carve her name in it.

There was something about the shadows on the room being dangerous after dark.

James was alive, and Harry had a distant relationship with him, but I can't remember if there were any siblings.

At one point Harry leaves Hogwarts and trades at a really interesting multi level marketplace, which may have had a chequered theme?

I really enjoyed the world building, but just can't think of any details that would help me find it.
