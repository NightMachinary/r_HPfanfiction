** Make a Wish has this as a staple of Harry's affairs. He just wants kit to go backpacking through Europe in comfort and anonymity. But thanks to some meddling shopkeepers, he finds himself with omniglot gear, a sword that turns into a scythe and makes nearby plants wither, an invisible dagger, an everfull beer stein, a book of Russian battle magic...

*** Should be said that this is a humor fic. The shopkeepers in the story are cursed seers, unable to effect the future. So they use their ability to sell things.

** Given that every good shopping trip starts with a visit to the friendly Goblins of Gringotts, I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2666565/1/The-shortest-Severitus-story-ever][this story]] by IP82.

** In Let's Do The Time Warp Again, Harry buys a potion for Hedwig that allows her to shoot deadly beams of focused magic. Powerful enough to vaporize adult dragons, lol. "Hoot!"
