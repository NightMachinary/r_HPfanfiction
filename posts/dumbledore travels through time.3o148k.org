we've all seen different time travel fanfictions with different characters but here's one. Ever seen one where dumbledore travels through time? an idea i had for a fanfiction was dumbedore is trapped through time where he is randomly jumping traveling through time to different times both past and future randomly and he can't figure out how to stop it and get back home

any fanfics?

  The future is lost, so to save it, both Harry and Dumbledore go back the moment it all began - that Halloween night. Of course, things do not go exactly as they had expected. Unspeakables, Wild Magic, Time Travel, Vampires, Bonds, Goblins.

  "Knockturn Alley," Hermione breathed, and a rush of relief flooded inside of her. At least she didn't end up amongst cavemen or dinosaurs. Time-turner fic. Sirius Black falls behind the veil, the time-turners are destroyed, and a Gryffindor is going to change history.
