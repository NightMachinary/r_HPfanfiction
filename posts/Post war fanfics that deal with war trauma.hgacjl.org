Really just want a well written fanfic that explores their trauma, especially the golden trio's. They went through a fucking war for goodness sake, their friends died, they killed, they were tortured, they are not unaffected. I hate when post war fanfics don't deal with it, just completely ignore it or make one character over traumatized while the rest of the world moved on.

I prefer trauma within the canon which already was bad enough even if in the books wasn't too explicit, but I am more than okay with things being exaggerated or new events taking place and adding to the trauma, as long as ther is a trauma.

Hurt/comfort fanfics are super welcomed and any ships are great. Ships I super enjoy tho: Harry/Hermione, Draco/Hermione, Draco/Harry, Harry/Ginny, Snape/Hermione, Harry/Any character rly, Hermione/Any Character.

THANKS!

  The war has been won, yet the aftershocks continue. The scattered survivors are left to pick up the pieces and find ways to move on. Join the various members of the extended Weasley family as they struggle to rebuild and cope with the consequences. And of course there are still Death Eaters left to find.

  In which Harry is a tad messed up after the war, but Snape gives him a run for his money. Or: an epic tale of PTSD, recovery and gay porn! (For detailed warnings, please see author's notes.)
