What would happen if Hermione was friends with Parvati and Lavender somehow? Maybe she became friends with Padma Patil and Lisa Turpin? Maybe Ron became friends with Dean and Seamus and Harry became friends with Neville and Justin.

They can be three friends together, Harry, Ron and Hermione, but it'd also be interesting to see if they could make friends with others outside of them.

For instance it was common to have a group of friends but only be close to like two or three of them, while having friends outside of that group as well.

  "While you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts," said McGonagall. Following the 1991-92 school year, the Gryffindors decide to make good on that promise.
