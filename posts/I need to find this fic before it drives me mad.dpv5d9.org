:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Not being able to find this fic is driving me mad.

The only thing I remember in it, is a bit where Harry shows his friends and Snape a memory, it was to make a spell or potion work I think.

In the memory Harry is beaten by his cousin and uncle and contemplates suicide with a gun.

  Dumbledore locks Harry and Snape in the Room of Requirement. Harry's magic works, and Snape's doesn't. Will they kill each other? No slash.
