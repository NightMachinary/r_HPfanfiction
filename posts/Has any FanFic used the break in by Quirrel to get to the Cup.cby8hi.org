I don't remember ever seeing Quirrel's break in in 91 being brought up to *Gringotts* to help to get to Hufflepuff's Cup in the Lestrange vault. Has anyone come across one?

Here's one of my thoughts on how it could go:

"Excuse me Mr. Goblin, did Albus Dumbledore ever inform Gringotts of who broke in to a vault back in 91?"

​

"No Mr. Potter, he did not!"

​

"Oh. Well, it was Quirinus Quirrell who was possessed by Voldermort at the time, at least I think he was possessed already, I don't think he could have done it on his own. He was definetly possessed later in the year, I saw Tom on the back of his head before I . . . uh, killred him. Quirrel I mean."

​

"Tom, Mr. Potter?"

​

"Ya, Tom Riddle, you know him as Voldemort. Its an anagram, 'Tom Marvolo Riddle,' you can rearrange the letters to form 'I am Lord Voldemort.' He made that up when he was a teenager, so I guess that explains it."

​

"Yes, I'm sure it does. Did you have any other information you wished to impart, or were you simply informing Gringotts of the identity of the attempted thief years after we could have done something about it?"

​

"Well, I was eleven years old at the time, the adults should have told you then! But they never do what they're supposed to do, do they? But I do have some new information for you, I mean you being Gringotts, if you wanted to, you know, punish Tom for the break in. One of his followers put one of his belongings in their vault, I thought you could claim it for damages against your reputation?"

​

"What would the item be Mr. Potter?"

​

"Oh you couldn't miss it, its the cup in the Lestrange vault with a piece of Tom Riddle's soul in it. I hope that helps sir."

​

" . . . . . "


** The goblins would look skeptically and say do you have any proof of your claims

and then mention the lestranges are in good standing with the bank and they are not in the habbit of raiding customers vaults on words of other customers

*** They'll probably say that. But it's possible they'll check for themselves anyway. Curiosity killed the cat, or the goblin in this case.

** The goblins would probably ask "whats in it for us?" The cup had been there for years and nothing happened so they would probably have no problem with it.

Horcruxes seem to be inert unless it came in contact or came within the vicinity of a person.
