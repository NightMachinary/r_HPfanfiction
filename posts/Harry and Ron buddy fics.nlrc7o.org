Can someone please recommend fics which focus on Harry and Ron being buddies and Ron having a greater influence on him than Hermione. I am fed up of reading fics where Ron is ostracized and Hermione worshipped. I don't want Herms bashing but a Ron who is truly 'Harry's best mate' is something I wish to see.

When I think of Harry and Ron as adults, I always think of their relationship as something like that of Harry and Sirius' from nonjon's A black comedy. But I haven't seen anything like it.

To be clearer, I don't care if they are in school or adults but their friendship should be awesome. I am NOT asking for Harry/Ron. Also, Not really comfortable with slash but if the story is good and nothing is explicit, please recommend. Thanks.

  Harry accidently gets good at chess after playing Ron for 6 years. Pity he doesn't even notice.All the chess matches are real and linked in the fic for you to follow along for context since, as it turns out, writing chess is bloody difficult!

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)
