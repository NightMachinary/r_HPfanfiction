a story featuring a romance between the two that has enough lemons for you to call smutty, the story doesn't have to be the best but at least decent.

IF you can give me a story(s) that has a great story and contains enough smut for you to call it smutty...well even better


** You want a fantastic story and great sex scenes? Thank me later. Forever Knight on Portkey. [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=5185&chapterid=&agree=1]]

*** I finally finished reading that last week... I wish there was more vampire!hermione stuff. I only found three finished stories so far and this is the only one that isn't completely focused on smut (yet is still MA).

Edit: and I don't mean Twilight vampires.

**** She was absolutely perfect in that. I love the way the story is told and how the characters progress. Plus some of the hottest scenes? You'll be hard pressed to find a more complete story with all of those elements. Most vampire ones aren't done right so I tend to avoid them. Forever Knight is, unfortunately, the exception, not the rule with those

****** Why is it that people always bash Twilight (no: I am not the greatest fan ever, in fact I only read those books because I needed it for a presentation at school (I was talking about Bram Stoker's Dracula and compared it to modern vampire literature and I compared Edward with the Count)), I agree it's not the best book series out there (hell, there are many better vampire books!), but it's not total crap either :(

ps: It's like with Harry Potter: A lot of fanfictions are better than the original series!

******* I wasn't bashing, only indicating I didn't like it.

I grew up watching Buffy and later Angel, Twilight for me destroys the dark allure of vampires as soon as they discuss the sparkling in the sunlight. The sunlight damaging vampires is a defining aspect as it symbolizes the evil their mere existance represents. That which enables life in general is lethal to them. It's also why in a lot of vampire stories/myths they are vulnerable to water, ranging from merely being burned by holy water to all water burning like acid or being unable to cross flowing water.

Removing those things AND then making them feed on animals only (even if it's a personal choice for the vampire) just makes them quirky, not the dark creatures I want to read about.

******** I watched those, too (and while I agree that the "Vampires" in Twilight are far from the real deal, I can push that away and enjoy some senseless fluff with plotholes (as I said, there's loads other, better, vampire books out there) for once, not to mention that a new spin was something the genre needed (that's why I like those daylight-rings in "The Vampire Diaries" - they don't make the story all dark and gloomy (if there's no sun, it's dark an gloomy) and allow them to interact with normal people!)...girls loved to talk about it, that's the other reason I read it...)

Vamps are not evil -.- (as long as they don't kill/kill for pleasure), they just have another diet (are cursed with another diet as some vampires would say who don't like attacking people)

If you want dark vampires who are nothing like the humans they once were (before being turned), then I agree that Twilight isn't your cup of tea (and I can accept that!)

ps: they would be rather smelly, if water killed them :(

*** Forgive the necro, but fuuuuuuuuuuuuck.

I was /not/ prepared for the emotional journey I was taken on by that story. After binge reading through it last week, I've just started a second read. Knowing what happens now, the first few chapters feel like I'm being bludgeoned in the face with an anxiety bat, just waiting for the hammer to fall.

My sincerest thanks for introducing me to this, it is truly delightful.

(most people can't discuss things anymore, they have to be right all the time etc. - it's sad...debates are great IMHO, because arguing makes you refine your own arguments (as well as your speaking...trying to convince somebody is hard, at least if they hold a totally different opinion to start with!))
