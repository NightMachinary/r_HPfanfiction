** Gaps between updates. If new chapters are being released somewhat consistently and then a new chapter takes twice as long or longer to be posted I assume the story's going to be abandoned soon. It's a pretty common pattern, once the author gets out of the rhythm it's tough to keep writing.

** Maybe it's confirmation bias, but I associate an author setting up their own website, a patreon account, or something with impending abandonment. I figure they're unsatisfied in some way with the fanfic writing experience so they try other things to reinvigorate themselves and then that fails so they stop. I see it on youtube channels as well.

**** Sure, but the percentage of those that do that verse the total number of writers in the HPfanfic world is probably sub .005%.

Even among "good" authors that have published long, complete stories, the percentage is probably sub 1%. It's pretty safe to say that updating quickly is a good sign that burnout and abandonment is incoming.

***** Is it really that small? I know it's hard to resist the temptation to start posting and the system does lend itself to posting as you go, but I always finish a story first and I know others who do too. Mind you, I don't write great mammoth epics but I haven't ever not finished posting a story once I started, and I posted chapters at least twice a week. I don't think I'm that unusual.

****** Well, obviously there's no real way to come to an accurate number, but I think it's fair to say that the number of writers that finish a story before posting must be very small. First because the vast majority of fics that aren't 1-5 chapters long aren't finished in the first place. Second, because even those that are finished generally take months to years to actually wrap up.

I know that many authors who /do/ prewrite the entire fic will space out the posting in order to get more views and reviews (look at fics like /The Sum Of Their Parts/, and how it's gotten so few reviews for the quality and length of the fic. That's because of it being posted in a period of like 10 days), but even they wouldn't take 6+ months to post an entire fic.

******* It would be quite interesting to know what the stats really are. I know when I was first thinking about posting a story on ffn, I did my homework and read all sorts of 'How to write a successful fanfiction' type of thing (I was hopelessly naive!) and they all said "finish your story first" etc, which seemed common sense. None of it did me any good. But I have seen equal numbers of people advising on: a) spacing out updates: b) updating regularly once or twice a week: c) updating every day. I've tried all of them and none made any difference so I don't think there is a 'best' way to do it. Some stories just hit the mark and some don't.

******** Well, it seems like common sense that if you post your chapters over a very short period of time (days), that you will get less reviews. Spacing out the posting encourages chapter by chapter reviews, rather than reading them all and then reviewing on the last chapter.

I'd be interested in the statistics too, but considering how FFN admins are a pain in the ass to deal with on the best of days, I don't see them releasing that information.

********* But equally, if you update quickly you spend more time on the front page. As far as I can see, nothing about fanfiction seems to work the way common sense would dictate. After all, if that was the case, the best written stories would get the most attention and I don't think many people believe that is the case. I've given up having theories about any of it. That way lies madness.

***** A major problem with time travel fics is pacing. Because realistically (assuming the time traveler has post-DH knowledge and Dumbledore isn't evil), a time traveler would go straight to Dumbledore, destroy the horcruxes in less than a week, and fix everything else in a month. But that's a boring story if it's not a one-shot, so authors try and stretch it out... and mostly it doesn't work. It would take the addition of obstacles outside of canon to make the story longer and maintain suspension of disbelief - like loss of memory, serious harm to the original timeline, a Voldemort with different strategies, another villain, massive AU, etc. which adds even more work to the creative process.

For example, linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them) was published in under 2 months and is 31k words. It's good, but that's because the time-traveler is effective and intelligent.

A long publish period doesn't mean the story is better.

It frustrates me when an author adds in conflict for the sake of keeping a story going. If there is not a build up for the new conflict to happen such as the comic book idea that a large number of heros are responsible both directly and indirectly for their villains. In this way I could see Harry pushing an agenda while he is back in time and this cause heartache because of an indirect death/loss of money/loss of livelyhood/home/etc. that caused a new villain that wasn't cannon. Again this needs to be built slowly.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I never understood this. If you are going to send them back in time, but wipe their memory once they get there. For me then it just seems like a reason to retell the same old story, but with seemingly 'random' actions that are actually from the future and help to tell a different story. In this case I don't understand why the Author doesn't just say their characters are ooc to some extent and be done with it. It's fanfiction it doesn't always need to make sense.

#+begin_quote
  massive AU, etc. which adds even more work to the creative process.
#+end_quote

I think the AU is a good reason to crossover. Like I said before since Harry went back in time he changed something that caused a character or event from another universe to affect one of the characters from the HPverse that would not have been affected otherwise.

One of my favorite stories has been written over the last 3 years. It has 15-20k chapters that come out about every 3 months or so. I know it won't be finished any time soon, but I can't help but read it.
