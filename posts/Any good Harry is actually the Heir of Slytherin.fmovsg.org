Are there any good fics where harry is the descendant of Salazar Slytherin Please no wrong boy who lived


** Harry is a true heir in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]], which is my favorite Slytherin!Harry fic and one of the only 'wrong boy who lived' fics that I've enjoyed reading. (First book in the series is "Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes".) linkao3(12608820)

Harry is also a descendant of Slytherin in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]], which is a fun read even though it dips into some OP!Harry, indy!Harry and manipulative!Dumbledore tropes. linkffn(6254783)

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

**** July of last year.

The author was reliably updating the fic at a fast pace (at least one chapter per month) until last year when they mentioned that their free time had decreased due to college, family and other life commitments. 649k+ words over the course of three years is amazingly prolific for a fanfic author, so I have high hopes that they will return once life evens out for them.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** I'm reading, and loving, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man)

Technically we don't know, just yet, whether or not it's a WBWL story. There's still a chance Harry is the BWL despite the story description. But he is definitely an heir of Slytherin's.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Fem!Slytherin!Harry (Mary); realistic!Dursleys; consistent!Professors; mature!Snape; follows the books VERY closely, especially the first three chapters or so (but with 50% more snark). See first chapter for preface. Most chapters K-rated, T for language, several sections from Snape's perspective are T. Later books may be M-rated. McG first contact/guardian. PM for pdf.
