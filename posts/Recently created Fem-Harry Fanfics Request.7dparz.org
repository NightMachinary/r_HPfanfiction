I've been looking for recently created fanfictions with regarding fem-Harry, but finding it is quite the challenge. It's not as if there's a tag for this genre, so it's usually the hard way of looking.

If anyone knows of any fanfics that was created this year, or last year, I would appretiate it. I already read most of the older ones, and the most well-known ones as well.


** linkffn(Parselbrat) is recent. I haven't personally read it, but apparently it's good.

  Harry discovers Parseltongue a little earlier. As magic goes, it's not very useful. It's enough to make a few friends though. And isn't that enough? (Fem!Harry)

#+begin_quote
  She's sarcastic, reckless, quick-witted, sassy, and much more, but when faced with future tasks, not just from the Triwizard Tournament, there's one trait Iris Potter is willing to throw out --- laziness. Five mostly unique tasks, Animagi, humor, numerous magical creatures, and the beginning to a morally ambiguous and powerful but not overpowered fem!Harry. No bashing. Fourth year.

  [Au] A different love, means a different life. When James Potter fell in love with Tamara Eilhart, fate was forever changed; and Harriet led a very different life. Growing up an Eilhart is not easy, especially when a deranged Dark Lord is after your head. Strong! Fem!Harry, Femslash Harriet/Katie Bell
