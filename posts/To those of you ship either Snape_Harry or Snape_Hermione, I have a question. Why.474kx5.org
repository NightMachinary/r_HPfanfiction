Now I don't care if you ship something weird, heck I've had so much innocence taken away from me, that I basically find anything to be hot. I was just scrolling through Tumblr as ya do and somehow wound up on a blog dedicated to these two pairings. This resulted in me finding a badly photoshopped picture of Snape smiling at a pregnant Hermione with a 13 year olds face. Thank you Internet, I hate you.

And as I continued to browse through parts of these small fandom, I found myself getting more confused. So feel free to let me know what the appeal of this is and if it's anything more than your average teacher/student fantasy.


** I wish I'd bookmarked all the times I've explained my Snape/Harry predilection in the past, because I've answered this question repeatedly during my years in HP fandom, although usually for a more ... well, sympathetic audience than this sub.

First, I'm here for the shipping. I look to published fiction for complex plotting and worldbuilding. Fanfic is a way to relax and play with erotic energy, which isn't something that gets much page time in original fic, and to explore beloved characters. For Snape/Harry specifically, I was drawn to the transgressiveness, the tension and conflict and tragedy, the tangled history, and to anything that might overcome their resistance to each other. I liked the teacher/student dynamic precisely because it was wrong, fierce, fraught, unequal, but also because I enjoyed the wartime trope that forced the two of them to work together. I arrived just pre-HBP, and that was the heyday of self-sufficient, ambiguous bastard Snape who'd changed sides for his own mysterious reasons and was a dangerous ally, an acerbic critic, and a sexual opportunist.

I apparently have a deep-seated kink for power dynamics, because my other favorite pairing is Snape/Dumbledore, precisely because some of the same issues crop up there as well -- issues of power, trust, betrayal, authority, disparity in age, past mistakes and present-day taboos. Then there's the duality: Snape's bitter outlook on life pitted against Harry's essential goodness, the push-pull of flawed complexity vs. simple decency, Snape's technical brilliance and addiction to the Dark Arts vs. Harry's intuitive gifts and somewhat passive attitude toward magic, Snape's struggle to be worthy if not exactly good, compared to Harry's uneasy status as virtue's representative in the wizarding world, outcast vs. hero, ugly vs. popular, etc. Alongside that are the ways in which they're alike: valor, emotional deprivation and incompleteness (it's constantly pointed out that Snape's emotionally stunted, but there are ways in which both these men are older than their years), obstinacy to the point of stupidity, sarcasm, self-sacrifice, subservience to the schemes of a more powerful wizard, a tolerance for obsession in matters of love.

Also I'm a sucker for the hostility that makes them lean into each other and snarl in each other's faces and wind each other up until finally one of them snaps and someone pushes someone else to the wall and WTF suddenly it's sexual and the power struggle is off the scale. I like to find ways to maintain the scenario of desperate hostility between Snape and Harry that ends with one of them absolutely breaking emotionally. I have a thing for Snape being devastated by his own feelings, in a borderline-psychotic, helpless, out-of-control way. That long lack of affection's got to have left him a bit wiggy.

Alongside that, I'd like to read all the variations on forgiveness and redemption. That doesn't mean it has to end happily. Just that the seething resentments and secrecy and misunderstandings and thwarted love have to burst out into the open. There has to a reckoning, an accounting. In postwar fics, I want Snape to have changed because of what he suffered, but I don't want him to be mellow and romantic and unrecognizable. And I want Harry to have trouble being 'normal,' despite it being his dearest wish. He's not ordinary, as much as he'd like to think he is. I want them both to struggle with the after-effects of the war, the loss and loneliness and the freefall that comes of not having a purpose anymore - the enforced need to defeat Voldemort or die trying.

So yeah, Snape and Harry are my locus in fic for intense emotional reckonings. Don't give me Alan Rickman and Daniel Radcliffe, for God's sake. They have nothing to do with my sense of these characters. Give me relatively young, bitter, self-hating, seethingly angry, skinny, greasy-haired, brilliant, working-class, workaholic, sexually repressed and morally damaged Snape, who has all the empathy and social grace of a guttersnipe. Give me sarcastic, self-reliant, exhausted, grounded but self-deluding Harry, who is still a bit of a loner, who believes he can live a perfectly ordinary life with a loving family but discovers it doesn't always work out that way, doesn't heal all wounds. There's also the sense that Snape has an obsessive need to love something better than he is, and Harry has both his "saving people thing" and his own orphaned need to /be/ loved. It's not necessarily healthy, but it could slake that mutual hunger borne of terrible childhoods. (Complicated by the fact that Snape was partly responsible for Harry's terrible childhood.) For me, finding ways to reconcile them to each other is half the fun of a Snarry fic.

Of course, I also like to see them shag like bunnies, collide in the most dysfunctional relationship flame-outs ever, and sometimes even die. I do have a few romantic fics bookmarked, but my interpretation of this pairing is a bit out of step with fandom these days.

This is just the tip of the iceberg, you realize. My OTP is so messy and intense that I can easily analyze it from twenty different angles. But this is basically where I started out. (Aren't you sorry you asked?)

** It's not so much that I ship Snape/Hermione, it's that every once in a while I'll come across a fic that does it really well, and it's a guilty pleasure. The fics that I found cover it really well go *really* AU, like When a Lioness Fights or Chasing the Sun. I enjoy the overall story, the way the relationship (or lack of) is handled, and even though both characters tend to end up practically OCs that share a name and some personality traits, that's forgivable because it's an AU story anyway and I enjoyed it. It's not trying to be the 8th Harry Potter novel. It's just, I'm so very picky with this ship because a lot of them go into 'let's not' territory.

Plus ships like this tend to have some interesting plot devices to try and make things work. Like in 'Problem with Purity' (which I did find problematic in places, but it was still an interesting read). I enjoy the occasional marriage or breeding law, the bond fics people love to hate, the 'brought together by war and together we can save the world' fics... As long as it's written well!

I'm not for a thirtysomething having sex with a fifteen year old. At least let the younger party be of age, honestly. There are far too many stories that have a third year Harry/Hermione with [insert teacher] that are written by /adults/. If they were written by teens I'd understand a bit. And I'm sooo not for the whole traditional student/teacher. Adult apprenticeship where you understand the potential consequences is one thing, a not-adult student that apparently hasn't figured out their hormones yet is another.

I don't have a problem with age gap at all though, since my two fav ships are the same age gap as this one. It just has to be handled right and not creepy.

*** As for the age gap, I don't remember anyone being too skeeved about Remus and Tonks together in canon even though at the end of the series he was 38 and she was 24 (at most, considering she was 22 in The Order of the Phoenix). She's only seven years older than Harry so once he or whoever gets to their early twenties I'm all game for pairing them with an older fellow.

As for someone who reads Snape/Hermione, I absolutely agree. However in many, if not most (well certainly most of the ones I've come across) SS/HG Hogwarts era fics, Hermione is NOT 15 (which would make her a 4th year), but in her 7th or even 8th year, where she is of age and is 18 or 19 years old.

Many people have the notion that a Student/Teacher relationship means that there is a pedophile-type relationship going on but that is not the case, certainly in the more popular fics.

**** Yes I understand that. But I've opened up completed fics that had an interesting summary only to find out that she's in her 4-5th year and it doesn't wait those 2+ years to develop. Often these are the shorter or older stories (like 10+ years old).

The student/teacher was a separate but related issue I have. It's (generally) not a good idea to be in a romantic or sexual relationship with someone in a position of authority over you. Especially if there's any chance of them using that authority as leverage in the relationship. It's got nothing to do with an attraction to underage people thing, since the student might very well be an adult, it's to do with abuse of authority. Often fics will do something to remove that authority (like having her take her exams early), but sometimes they ignore the issue altogether (like ultra secret student/teacher relationship), which I don't like.

** As a 40 year old female Snanger fan I get asked this one a lot.

Although I must admit the vast majority of stuff I read featuring this pairing is post Hogwarts. However some like "Chasing The Sun" by Loten, skirt the issue while Hermione is under age and at school and only have the relationship bloom once far into AU territory.

I think I just find it a plausible match based upon character traits. Both are clever, driven, loyal and ruthless when required. Hermione can be quite sarcastic (although never quite as biting as Snape). I think Snape had his emotional development arrested pretty early having essentially gone straight back into school after finishing and watching the same petty dramas unfold again and again, whereas Hermione is fairly adept and insightful regarding emotional mechanics so the two are not as unequal as it may seem at first blush.

After having bought into Harry's paranoia about Snape during P.S she is the voice for calm and reason thereafter always telling the others they should be trusting Dumbledore's judgement regarding Snape.

Although veering into head canon I have often wondered if Hermione secretly suspected that Dumbledore's death was a coup d'grace on Severus' part and there was more to it. Given the high emotion surrounding it she wouldn't have wanted to add fuel to the flames by saying so, but think about how much research we know she did about curse scars when trying to help Harry. There weren't any like his - but I bet she read about more than a few like the one killing Dumbledore and we know how quick she is.

On his behalf, Lily Evans was a kind, clever, brave Gryffindor. Ticks on all 3 for Hermione.

From her side of the fence we KNOW she finds his aesthetic appealing - because black haired, hook nosed, and sallow skinned are all applied to Viktor Krum (as well as Severus) and she liked him well enough. So... I guess that's why I find it works.

*** You summed up everything I could have to say on the matter! Thank you!

The only thing I would add with your Viktor Krum and Snape comparison is that both are older than Hermione (so maturity is something she values), both are considered "darker" characters (Durstrang and Slytherin, respectively), and both are very talented, intelligent, brave wizards. While she did not ultimately end up with Krum, I think her relationship with him sets a precedent.

I also don't personally like her with Ron so I much rather ship her with characters similar to her only other main interest in the series, Krum. Thus... Snape.

**** Not OP, but I have a few suggestions. She mentioned linkffn(Chasing the Sun by Loten). It's fantastic, Loten's characterizations are absolutely spot-on. If you like that one, (or if you like the writing but can't deal with school-aged Hermione) read linkffn(Post Tenebras Lux by Loten), which is EWE (canon except for the epilogue) and starts ten years after the war ends. Again, Loten's strength lies in her characters.

Another possibility is linkffn(Phoenix Song or, Hermione Granger and the HB P) which is the first in a trilogy that covers years 6, 7, and the return to Hogwarts to repeat year 7 from Hermione's perspective. It's also EWE.

You can't recommend Hermione/Snape without mentioning linkffn(Pet Project by Caeria), which is by far the most popular Hermione/Snape. It's not my favorite, but it got me into the pairing when I started out the fic thinking I would back out absolutely disgusted.

And, just to cover all the tropes of this particular pairing, linkffn(Thirty-One Days by keelhaulrose) is a time travel fic, where Hermione spends a month at Hogwarts in Snape's sixth year. linkffn(Pride of Time by Anubis Ankh) if you want a time travel story where she can't get back to her own time except the long way.

Let me know if you want more :)

Edit: I forgot linkffn(Sin & Vice)! How could I have forgotten it, it's one of my favorites! A desperate and ruthless Dumbledore uses a time turner that can send a person back five or so years safely to train Hermione into what the Order needs her to be. There's a pretty quick summary of what she did while she was turning through time, and then the story picks up just after the return of Voldemort at the end of Goblet of Fire with at Hermione in her late twenties. Hermione is brittle but not broken and has scars (both physical and mental) to rival Snape's. The author gets her timeline mixed up in some fairly minor ways later in the story and in a few ANs, but that's fairly understandable when the timeline is as incredibly non-linear (except from Hermione's perspective) as it is in this story.

**** Bad with personal hygiene? He is never described as smelling offensive or being grubby. Greasy hair could just as easily be attributed to the same fast metabolism as kept him rail thin as to poor hygiene. There is no textual evidence saying one or the other so either stance can be taken. Sallow skin can be attributed to his living and teaching away from natural light. He has bad teeth I grant you but I don't doubt many people would from the same socio-economic background and period in which he was brought up . IRL Statistics would say given his back ground, age, etc he was likely to have been a smoker, though of course there is nothing in Canon which suggests this is the case.

The older mysterious man thing holds as true for Severus as it does for Krum. Plus Severus was shrewd, intelligent and academically skilled and while Viktor *was* clever enough to claim the role of Durmstrang champion his chief achievement seems to have been Quidditch which I can't imagine would have an enduring appeal. Whereas Severus was already a gifted potioneer and spell crafter prior to 7th year (meaning he was ahead of Krum at the same age).

There is of course no definitive right or wrong to shipping. It is all subjective and comes through the lens of personal interpretation.

***** I do personally enjoy my own little head-canon in which Snape was never going to be a handsome man, but with being bullied and then joining Voldemort and then all the proceeding war stresses for /years/... He simply never had the time or will to bother with his looks, thus going from a potential "he's alright, I guess" to the ugly we see him in the series. That's probably why I enjoy post-war stories with him surviving so much, because they give him a chance to just take a deep breath and figure out who he is outside of "spy" and "traitor".

****** My head-canon around Snape's attractiveness, is that we only ever see him in canon from Harry's perspective, and Harry (being a straight male) isn't likely to notice whether another male is attractive to women unless they're conventionally handsome. I like to think Snape featured strongly in some conversations up in the girls' dormitories after he knocked Lockhart on his ass, for instance.

****** I'm not going to get into the whole debate because I don't have time right now. But, the "Snape is ugly so I can never see him in romances" idea is very sad to me. When you love someone, you love them and they become your "standard of beauty" even if they are nowhere near conventionally attractive. The idea that "ugly" people don't belong in romances and/or are unworthy of love is an idea that should be challenged in our physical beauty-obsessed society.

If this were referencing Snape's inner beauty (or lack thereof), I'd challenge it less. Though I'd say that, while Snape is frequently nasty, at other times (especially if you are consciously aware of the Harry-filter), he is protective, intelligent, and loves deeply. I think what attracts many Snape fans (including me) is the story of redemption.

In the end, it's all about perception of a character. I do sympathize quite a bit with Snape: bitter over unrequited love, greasy hair and bad teeth is just like me a couple of years ago. But I grew out of it, and Snape didn't, and that's why I think him so unattractive. He reminds me of who I really don't want to be, and the memory of the feeling of not having brushed my teeth for far too long is kind of the strongest.

I do agree that the good things of Snape's character, redemption and fierce loyalty, are very admirable, and I can see where Snape shippers in any shape or form come from. But I can't really feel it myself.

**** So I just turned 36, and I just started reading Snape-based fiction in the last few months and really being moved by his story.

When you're 18, or 24, or 27, someone mid-to-late-30s seems to be someone grown up and established. However, when you begin reaching 30, 32, 36, and I imagine 38 and more, you see that age as relatively early in life. My understanding of the supposedly evil King Richard III was very different when I was 16 than when I was 34, and realized that at that point in Richard's life, he was already dead.

My understanding of Snape and his tragedy has changed now that I am almost at the age he was at the end of his life. Imagining a mean old dried up bat of a teacher from the point of view of a 11 year old child is different from imagining that same person as someone who is potentially as young and vital as you yourself are, with as many potential years ahead of you as you yourself have, and whose choices in life were severely reduced at age 19 or 20.

Most people make mistakes in their teenage years, though few make any as big as Snape did. Yet most people in a decade and a half have had the chance to recover and heal. Redemption narratives can become very appealing to people my age, who may also be facing the consequences of bad early choices (for instance, poisonous relationships, ill-thought-out career choices, snowballing issues from unresolved childhood traumas, etc).

** I ship Snarry. I don't typically enjoy chan (Harry being underage) because, well, it's squicky. I do like the Snarry fics that are post-war, Harry is an adult, and they reconnect somehow. It does take a bit of stretching canon to make it work - canon Snape wasn't /anyone's/ idea of an ideal sexual partner... but with a good writer and a liberal use of er, artistic license, yes I enjoy it.

Now, /why/ do I enjoy it... well, I like their dynamic - Harry having someone who pushes him to be better, doesn't let him take the easy way out, challenges him. I'm also a bit of a sucker for the dom/sub dynamic which fits in /perfectly/ with Snarry. Snape lends toward a stereotypical dom and it's very easy for many writers to put Harry in the submissive role.

I find that I enjoy the "fanfiction" version of Snape where he's not /really/ a bastard he just plays one because he's a spy. Fanfiction Snape tends to have a brick wall of defenses and a snarky personality but is really a good man underneath it all and Harry compliments this. Harry is warm when Snape is cold. Snape is intelligent and swotty where Harry is more inclined to physical pursuits and fun. Harry is rash and impulsive and Snape is methodical and calculating. It goes on and on. They just have such a intense relationship and if an author can convincingly spin the animosity they share into a love affair... well. Yes please.

Have you actually sat down and *read* a well-written SSHP or SSHG fic? Personally, I haven't read a SSHP fic, so I have no reason to judge that ship. It may not be my cup of tea, but until I read a SSHP story, I find no reason to "hate" on that particular ship.

*On another note~*

If you would prefer the age gap to be smaller, and would be willing to try SSHG out, I think linkffn(Pride of Time) lays their romance out beautifully. Hermione goes back to when Severus is a student at Hogwarts, with no way to return back to her time, meaning she will have to live out the years and age the same as Severus does.

** Snape and Hermione is the first fandom I discovered. I found it right after half blood prince when I was looking for forums discussing him. I never even heard of fanfiction before. I liked to reading the ones that make him a good guy, and where Hermione is an adult. Although I know he is described as ugly in the books, he is ok in the movies.

** I find it so interesting how everyone has a very strong opinion on this and SS's pairings in particular. I love reading HGSS fic, have never and will never read a HPSS fic, but that's due to personal preference. Bottom line is, it's not black and white for a lot of people. I'm personally an absolute sucker for a damaged lost soul finding love and i think HG is the only figure in canon that could ever compete with him mentally and i also spent a vast amount of my secondary school days fancying a teacher of mine, so you know, we all have differing reasons. Age gap to me means nothing, and i always try and seek out post war fics when i can because i do struggle with any fics with Hermione under the age of 17/18. And like i said, it's not all black and white. Interesting discussion though.

** Snape is a good character but a bad person and that's why I don't see anyone paired up with him. He's rude, socially inept, unattractive and enough of a immature scumbag that he thinks it's totally okay to abuse his position of trust and authority to mistreat 12-year-olds.

Several of whom are not Harry Potter.

So could I see him falling for Hermione? Absolutely. Could I see her falling for him? No way.

For the most part he's used to fit into the teacher archetype and Hermione's the most obvious choice for the student counterpart.

** As far as I can tell, it's mostly a lot of cherrypicking and choosing of traits the author wants to see (or just outright creating their own), twisting canon to form a different mental picture of what these characters actually are, and ignoring all the bad traits that would actually making this pairing impossible, and then trying to justify it.

*** Yes, but that's like the definition of fanfiction. I've read all sorts of pairing fics, and a certain amount of gen, in which Harry, for example, bears very little resemblance to his canon self. Overpowered or bad-ass Harry comes to mind. It's harder than non-writers realize to keep someone in character, especially once you start introducing "what-ifs."

For most popular villainous/anti-heroic characters, there's always a percentage of fans who romanticize them, and god knows this happened to Snape. I think there are degrees of plausibility. There are ways of humanizing Snape - remembering that Harry's POV is limited and exploring Snape's private life from an entirely different perspective, for instance. But fics that forget Snape is an arsehole, that spite and resentment were his self-defense as a child and became his default as an adult, that he didn't learn how to distinguish between good and evil until late in his fairly short life - these leave out much of what makes Snape interesting, IMO.

I don't think any pairing is impossible (unless you flat-out hate it and nothing is going to change your mind), but part of the fascination of Snape/Harry (I can't speak for Snape/Granger) lies in writing/reading a fic that deals with the difficulties between them and with Snape's prior actions. I'm not going to argue with shippers who are tired of that and just want to jump straight to "they're already together, I want to tell a story after they've dealt with the past," because there are a million first-time fics out there and you can't keep re-writing the same thing forever.

Really? In what way? I explicitly said I want fics that keep Snape an arsehole and make them deal with it.

****** Being a Harry/Snape shipper. The only difference is that you say you don't "ignore all the bad traits that would actually making this pairing impossible" (i.e. everything). You take note of all those impossibilities, and then do it anyway. That's probably worse.

******* I thought we were having a good-faith conversation, but apparently not.

And worse than what? Worse as a source of dramatic tension? Worse as a source of fictional motivation? All those things are the basis of conflict, and conflict can make for a good story. Or are you trying to imply something else?

If you don't like it, don't read it. I'm pretty damn sure I don't read your favorite pairing, but I don't begrudge its existence. I'll take note that you feel qualified to opine about Snape/Harry while understanding nothing about its appeal to its fans, but why should that mean anything to me? Or reflect negatively on the years of pleasure Snarry fandom has afforded me? It's simply mean-spirited, and it's the sort of thing anti-shippers do to shame fans of ships they hate.

*** As a Snape fan, I will stop reading if he's described so far off the mark.

But, I also keep in mind how the perspective of each individual character can vary from the narrator's. So while Snape is traditionally ugly, a person could still find him attractive in the right setting, plot, etc.

*** No, if Snape is described too far from what he was described as in canon, it's no longer Snape. I'll keep reading if I'm enjoying the story so far, but unless there's something actually written that changes how he looks to /earn/ a change in appearance/attitude, it's just an OC with the same name and job.

Some of the best that I've read deal with the other character having issues with how he looks/acts/whatever that slowly change. The perception, not the actual image, is what changes. And that's pretty true for reality, so I forgive that.

*** As one of the "they" you're referring to, nope. (Plus we recently had a thread about this pic, where it was pointed out that neither extreme is correct.)

Also, for me, anime style is the unsexiest thing there is. All characters become indistinguishable and de-personalized. I love a lot of fan art, but Snape without his hooked nose and some attempt to make his hair look greasy just isn't Snape to me.

These are all possible physical interpretations that stay within the realm of canon and make Snape less of a cartoon grotesque or a pretty-boy rock star.
