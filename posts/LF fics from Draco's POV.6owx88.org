** [[https://www.buzzfeed.com/ashleyperez/jk-rowlings-version-of-harry-potter-according-to-draco-malfo][J.K. Rowling apparently expressed her opinion on the subject.]]

My alternative:

1. Draco Malfoy's pulls off a "Slytherin" scheme for the first and the last time.^{1}
2. Draco Malfoy gets tricked by Gryffindors into disclosing vital information.
3. Draco Malfoy feuds with a non-sapient animal.
4. Draco Malfoy comes up with highly original^{2} insults.
5. Draco Malfoy finally gets to wield the power he had always felt entitled to.
6. Draco Malfoy learns that serving evil is actually hard, dangerous work.
7. Draco Malfoy wants it all to be over already.

~~~

^{1} --- Credit where's it's due: the "duel" scheme was pretty clever.

^{2} --- "POTTER STINKS" is original, right?
