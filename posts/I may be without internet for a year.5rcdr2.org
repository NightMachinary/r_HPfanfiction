In a few months I will be moving out of state and depending on how things go may not have an internet connection. My hard drive of saved fics burned out awhile ago and I have been lazy about stockpiling. I have saved the frequently recommended ones but would appreciate other recs. I will give pretty much anything a try, but I really enjoy stories that flesh out the universe by answering questions I didn't know I had. Stories about magical paintings like linkffn ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1875189/1/The-Prefect-s-Portrait]]) or something like "The little ones by furiosity" [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=16094]] Stories with alternate sortings are interesting, but only if it isn't a rehash of the books.

*** Thanks for the reply. I haven't read it, but I have already saved it because it's recommended so often. Everytime I think i'll start it I find something else that looks more promising. I'm just really hesitant because of the OCs and it being in America.

** It might be worth it to download entire archives/websites. Thats what I did years ago when I had shitty AOL dialup that charged by the minute.

I can't find them but there a couple of posts on here where people had posted links to archives they had downloaded and zipped. I think someone had a file for entirety of ff.net.

** Ok, seeing as no-one seems to be volunteering anything here goes:

The works of JBern, Shezza, nonjon, James Spookie, & kathryn518.

And linkffn(Whispers in the Night; The Art of Self-Fashioning; Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches; Lesser Evils by Scott Press; Days to Come; Honour Thy Blood; Contractual Invalidation; Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path; Amalgum - Lockhart's Folly; Grow Young With Me; Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin; Muggle-Raised Champion; Seventh Horcrux; Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse; The Reluctant Champion; The Merging; The Pureblood Pretense; The Slytherin Subterfuge; The Ambiguous Artifice; On the Way to Greatness; Forging the Sword)

There are probably more if I could recall. I would seriously recommend getting a kindle though. I was in a similar situation a few years back and I downloaded a program that took website addresses of ffn.net stories and downloaded/converted the entire things to kindle format. Save them all in one folder, plug in kindle and copy/paste across and bam! hundreds of fics on a nice to read device and offline accessible (kindles have tons of storage space for books). Good luck with your move!

All she wants is to get through her studies unimpeded, but with pureblood politics, ancient artifacts, and adolescent hormones getting in the way... well, at least she's up to the challenge.

*** Thanks, the first year or so will be tough, but once we are out from under this house things should be better. I have read "Seventh Horcrux" "Prince of Slytherin" and "On the Way to Greatness" but not the others. My laptop has a kindle app, one of the few things I like about windows 8. I have a bunch of "real book" files too. Even without the prospect of no internet, I feel like I should be saving fics again. It is so depressing to go looking for a favorite and see that the writer is MIA.

*** Oh, there is internet access, i'm just not sure i'll be able to afford it. I'm not sure how long it will take my house to sell, so until it does I will be paying the mortgage here and whatever the new place costs. My husbands cell has unlimited data, I can use it as a hotspot when he is home, but reading is how I spend most of my free time and I'm not sure that we will have the same schedules. It may turn out that we can budget it in, but I want to stockpile in case.

** I would suggest that you buy an Amazon Kindle (one of the models that give you an internet connection, so you can still keep yourself in the loop (unless there are no cell-towers where you are moving to), read fanfiction (if you want to) and also buy and read lots of other works of fiction (as e-books))

ps: May I ask where you are moving to that you will not have an internet connection (I mean even most poor countries have internet by now, even if it might only be hotspots at restaurants etc.)? I mean if I were to move that would be the first thing I'd do: Get an internet connection (that's - at least for me - more important than putting together the furniture (except for the bed maybe!))

*** I should have been more clear. I'm not sure that we will be able to budget it in because we will be paying the mortgage until the house here is sold and for the new place. This house needs some expensive repairs (like the roof) that are going to set us back. I had a kindle, but ended up giving it to my sister. I'm a speed reader, so I felt like I had to keep my hand up to tap the screen all the time. My laptop has a bigger screen, i'm pretty happy with it. My cell phones data plan is terrible, but my husbands is grandfathered into unlimited, I can use it as a hotspot when he is home. I'm just trying to prepare because I know it will be difficult not having internet any time I want it. If I am honest with myself, most of my internet use is reading fics or listening to audio books on youtube.

***** Hopefully there will be one nearby. Someone told me that most of them offer free audio books through the website now. I listen to them at work, and audibles prices are pretty high for only getting one a month. The library here is in need of an upgrade and I haven't been in a few years.
