Hello

I have read my fair share of fanfics. I have read close to canon, alternate universe where one thing change and the result of it (ex Sirius does not die or Harry was adopted): crossover, etc.... but one thing I never understand is the complete alternate universe like Harry Potter but without magic. I don't understand them... and don't like them...

Can someone explain why you like these? I always felt like these where basically original fiction but without creating characters (laziness? or writing challenge?)

There was one that annoyed me lately it was Harry Potter/Twilight crossover but no magic and no Vampire.........

I absolutely do not want this post to be offensive, I genuinely want to understand and even read good one if you have recommendations. If this was offensive, I truly apologize.


** This sub gravitates pretty heavily towards a genre I like to call SFAU - serious fantasy AU - which is a pretty recent (last 10 years) phenomenon in HP fanfic.

The AUs you're talking about are the traditional AU's like coffee shop stories and college stories. These have been around since the first wave of HPFF in the 90s and are generally more character oriented - it's easier to write/understand characters when they're not tied to a magic system or specific plot line. And some people just like seeing the characters brought into their own world.

/The Mirror of Maybe/ begs to differ. Hooked me on fanfic back in 2002 and it is still one of the most creative fanfics I've ever read. I'm forever traumatized because it was never finished.

There are so many great bits of magic included in it (like wizarding tattoos) and things that have become my head canon (how it's explained that Veritaserum works).

tbh it is more like an OC/Snape fic.

Forela? I remembered it (though it has been more than a decade) as the mirror transporting him to another world, no him living in a simulation, lol.

Anyway, I don't really hate the H/Snape part much, as 1) Harry is an actual adult, and 2) This was written pre-Snape leaking the prophecy to V.

There are some things, such as the way that the author stylizes thoughts, that night trip you up at first but overall it is an excellent fic and I definitely recommend it.

** I think people like Non-magic AUs when they're more focused on the characters than the plot(Romances are one of the genres that best utilize this), since some people find it easier to flesh out a character in situations that they have experienced rather than a story with magic.

*** This right here is the answer. Fanfiction can have the characters, the world, or both.

People write stories with the characters AND the world when they want something like a continuation of a funny story in between parts, or to change some big event in the story.

They write stories with the characters but not the world when they want to explore interesting character dynamics, like romance or mentorship etc.

They write stories with the world but not the characters when they want to explore parts of the world they're interested in (American magic school, etc).

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life.

** The main nonmagical AU I've read was reimagining the whole canon plot with (sometimes futuristic) technology substituted for magic. Instead of Quidditch, Harry gets into the firearms team and proves to be a natural at that. Instead of being guarded by a portrait, the Griffin dormitory has a palm scanner. I liked the cleverness of how the author made all the replacements, and especially how the kids were all a bit smarter and sneakier than canon because "Harworts" is training them as counter-intelligence agents (with a side order of possible assassination).

Also, it can be read stand-alone but is actually part of a larger series, which crosses over a bunch of stories; the canon universe is still there and made an appearance in earlier books, but this one is showing the backstory of an alternate Hermione.

** I think it boils down to the fact that, if a situation is possible, someone will write about it. A lot of the time it is totally the result of a runaway imagination and if you let any preconceived notations go, it just becomes another story with a somewhat familiar character. People fell in love with the HP characters and want to try them out in different situations. It never has to make sense; it's fan fiction. AUs, more than most fan fics, take the ‘what ifs' to extreme levels. They ARE character driven and situational. And we kinda love them for it.

Why rewrite the entire backstory when you could just have a coffeehouse in Diagon Alley. Or even Harry going to some Muggle coffee shop during his lunch hour.

** Those are for shipping basically, they are works entirely focused on the shipping so they strip any of the actual elements of canon. Thus the fic is mostly just the characters flirting and fucking in some mundane setting. A high school AU presumably could at least have like some other drama based on grades or football or drugs or something, but the coffee shop AU is basically shipping boiled down into it's purest form. I don't like romance so I don't read any no magic AUs personally.

** First I feel hp x twilight fanfiction is the highest xover ever, yet I've yet to find any good one, though I gotta say I didn't search that much, I gave up after first few pages.

I actually like when the creators break apart the story and recreate the story from the ground up, I think it give the the creators a free reign to do anything with the characters, and it's good for us readers too as we get something new to read, I mean I love HP but it get repeated as we know what will happen.

I think every fanfiction is for all intents and purposes an alternative Universe or dimensions, with canon being the original Universe. Though it doesn't mean all of them will be good.

*** I would mostly agree with you on this, except for the fact that I'm old as far as the Twilight fandom goes, and there were one or two good ones back in the heyday, before the last book came out and everyone realized how bad the books were. There were some great Twilight fics that were actually really good and plot heavy, and there were some pretty cracky ones that were great to read for laughs. I'm not sure if they HO crossover ones are still up, but if they are I'll try to link them.

Edit: I agree with you fully on the role of fanfic though! Some of the best fics I've read were like that, but sadly some of the greatest writers haven't updated in years.

** I also don't like complete AU's that are only with character names, but I would still like a muggle AU with the same story as canon. so Harry is still with the Dursleys and he goes to a boarding school his parents went to. and he makes friends with Ron and Hermione and enemies with Draco and their chemistry teacher. the plot would have to be different of course, like maybe he is trying to find out who killed his parents. so it would be a muggle AU but still Harry Potter.

I don't like AU's where you could just replace the character names and it will stop being a fanfic. I thought maybe the authors want more clicks/reads and that's why they do that. but idk.

caffeeshops AU is a no-no. it also annoys me with other fandoms that don't have magic, the characters that know each other since childhood suddenly don't know each other. like why?

*** This is basically how I feel about most AU I have read. If you switch the names from Harry to Hector it would be a original story.... well write an original story. The story I wrote about in my original post was a Muggle Harry living with his parents in Forks where he met a non Vampire Edward and fell in love..... no explanation of why Harry was un Forks, was his parents were alive (which lets be real has an enormous impact on his backstory) how Edward would still be alive in 2010s if he was not a vampire and why would he live with the Cullen if he was not a vampire (where are his parents, why is he in Forks)....

I hope that by reading some of the recommendations here I will get an idea of a good AU.

I don't get A/B/O but it clearly does something for some people because there's so much of it out there; my response is not to read it and to gladly leave others to read and write it if it makes them happy.

There's all sorts of people. Most of them aren't you, but that's okay, because there's room in the world for everyone, and there's nothing wrong with liking some genre or disliking some genre.

If you don't like coffee shop AUs, then read something else. It's pretty simple to avoid it if you don't like that stuff.

Often it's not even the characters. It's literally just using the names, with maybe a bit of their temperament. People who think Harry's character is being named Harry are weird. The fact that he's a Wizard born to parents who died in a war is kinda integral to his character.

I think it's basically a way to trick people into reading (shitty) original fiction... don't really see the appeal.

** I enjoy (writing) AUs as a sort of puzzle exercise. For example, I have a story that sort of lands as a standard HP non-magic mystery AU with definite notes picked up from Hannibal with a slight aim towards countering some of the tropes of highly imbalanced/abusive relationships that show up in protag/villain ship fics in both those fandoms. (To clarify, it's influenced by Hannibal, but not a Hannibal AU.) Half the fun of that is working out how to rework the characters to come from similar backgrounds that would make them feel similar while obviously different. So in this story, Andromeda Black ran off with Ted Tonks, which was a problem because Ted Tonks was a broke communist, not because he was a muggleborn. The aurors is a specific branch of law enforcement, the RRS, that happens to hire a lot of alumni from the same school because of networking. Bill Weasley works for banks as a security hacker. Arthur's the head of a very small government department that no one takes seriously and mostly deals with alien hoaxes, but if there /is/ ever extraterrestrial contact, he's probably going to be the most important person in the British government. Harry isn't magic and he isn't a national hero, so the Dursleys rejected his acceptance at his parents' alma mater (Hogwarts) without even telling him about it, leaving him to grow up in completely different circumstances as a teenager.

Yes, it could be original fiction with a different set of characters, but for the same reason we're all here reading fanfiction exploring the same story taken a million different ways, it's /fun/ and interesting and maybe comfortable to play with these familiar characters, and to share the reimagining with other people who enjoy these characters as well.

For writers, it can be fun to prod at different aspects of a story, making them more or less important, adding in or stripping things away. If what you like about the story is a handful of characters, then when you go to write a fanfiction with them, there's no problem putting the rest aside. On the other hand, if what you like is the world-building but you could care less about the characters or the plot, maybe you're writing a story set in the same world, but completely filled with OCs.

** Theoretically, the appeal is in the characters: if you have compelling characters, you should be able to put them in pretty much any situation and get an interesting, or at least enjoyable, story out of it. Now, /in my own personal experience,/ people who write muggle AUs (and, well, people who write in this fandom, in general, but that's a whole other rant) tend to change the characters until they're basically OCs who happen to share names with canon characters, so at that point, the only connection to Harry Potter is arbitrary and superficial, hence, I assume, the widespread disdain.
