Owls don't even have /eyeballs/. Their eyes are shaped like tubes, which can't move at all. That's the whole reason they have swivel heads.

I don't care how sassy your bird is, it ain't rolling its eyes at you.

**** Actually, owls will do their blinking one eye at a time so they never are completely blind, even for a fraction of a second. I've seen it happen. So yeah, totally winking.

*** Oh, I completely misunderstood what you were saying there. I thought you were saying someone was writing a story in which the protagonist crucio'd themselves and it felt good.

A reverse crucio would be hilarious, though. Running around zapping people with Power Word: Orgasm would make for a great crack fic.
