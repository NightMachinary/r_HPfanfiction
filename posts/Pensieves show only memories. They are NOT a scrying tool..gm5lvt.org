Been reading a lot of fanfic lately due to the lockdown. It's something I had noticed earlier, but never really considered to be a major issue.

I went back and looked through some completed fics all the way from 2015 and nearly all of them use pensieves like a damn scrying tool!!

Pensieves show memories of the person, allowing them to view it perfectly and with perfect recall even though their conscious mind may have forgotten the details.

Fics more often than not show the memories and the events that follow even AFTER the source of that memory is no longer conscious or is in a different room. If the source has not witnessed it, then how the hell is it part of memory?! Sure you can include sounds heard through the door, but you can't show actions and movements and subtle interactions!!!

Wanted to know if this was really as widespread as I think it is and if someone knows how this misconception began in the first place.

If there are any other posts on this subject or on the use of pensieves in fics, please link them in your comments.


** In one fic, Prince of Slytherin I believe, the canon explanation of Pensieves was expounded on to explain them as a complex combination of memory and time magic. The original memory providing the basis around which the time magic looks into the past to fill in the details. A power which makes them extremely rare.

An interpretation that I like a lot personally is that the spell to withdraw memories for a Pensieve pulls in ALL of the sensory information that our bodies collect and then interprets them all together without filtering them the way our brains do.

Our brains stitch together information from one eye eith the information from the other in order to give a forward view that doesn't include our nose, which it filters out.

The Pensieve is able to combine information from all 21 physical senses as well as possibly a magical sense and then interpret them down into visual and audio only.

A viewer of the memory then is able to see and hear things better than the person that experienced them firsthand. An example would be if the person in the memory glanced behind them at one point on the memory and then not again. The Pensieve could combine that initial visual with sounds from behind them (like daredevil style echolocation) to come up with a representation of a page falling off a desk for example.

While not flawless the representation of what is going on out of the view of the memory holder is more so than their original perspective. Areas where there is not enough sensory information to create an image are progressively fuzzy until the enchantment fails and there is just a blank at the edge of the memory.

A key issue is that interpretations from other senses can be wrong if there is not enough detail, which is why Pensieve memories are for personal use and not admissible in court.

*** This is definitely an interpretation that I can get behind. It provides the most extensive and definitive definition and working principle I have seen so far.

I am not exactly sure where the “time magic” factors in, but this still doesn't support the fact that out of view interactions can be displayed regardless of how many senses coincide because ultimately you need sight for it. Unless magic fills in that role. In that case there are a lot of things that can be answered with “It's magic”.

Regardless of all that, thanks a lot for this explanation of the pensieve. It's definitely going to be the one I adhere to.

**** The fic I mentioned basically has Pensieves as audio/visual time machines rather than 3rd person memories. The pensieve uses the memory as an anchor to do some time travel shenanigans to provide a 100% accurate view of what could have been seen and heard by a third party observer if one had been present for the memory.

The explanation after that was separate and is one of my own. A lot of it revolves along the idea of sensory deprivation based "super senses" of comic book level logic. In real life a blind person can experience heightened senses at the loss of their sight, giving them an alternative view of the world, but it's not daredevil level. The idea is that the magic of the pensieve is on daredevil level.

So person a walks into a room and sees everyone present before sitting on a chair in the middle of the room. They can no longer see the people behind them but can hear them. The person on their own just hears sound like normal, but the pensieve recollects sound at Daredevil levels and builds a fuzzy Daredevil like image of what is going on behind the person from that. Then it maps the original visual onto the fuzzy echolocation mapping of the environment to generate a passable visual. Combined with any additional pieces of information that can be used to flesh out things, minor reflections a normal person would never notice, the sensations onntge back of a neck from disturbed air, etc, etc.

The idea then is that when enough pieces are present, the visual seems flawless. But if for example that person had been led into the room blindfolded, the 3rd person view of the back of the room would be fuzzy and undetailed.

The other idea is that the extrapolation and interpretation done by the magic can be wrong. If the memory holder sees a person wearing purple robes sitting behind a desk and then that person stands up while the memory holder isnt looking, the visual mapping might expect the rest of the robes to be people as well instead of the stylish shift into deep blue that the lower half of the robes actually were.

****** Confirmed that the fic in question was in fact linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

The nature of pensieves is a relevant plot point at a couple of places so far and the explanation is from chapter 70. The fic is one of the more often recommended ones on the subreddit and is a very popular Slytherin Harry story. It is large and in progress with occasional updates.

The relevant quote from chapter 70

"Professor, how accurate are these memories? Surely Luna can't remember with perfect recall everything that's written here." "Pensieves, Miss Granger, are peculiar things. We don't rightly know how they work, as there's only one magical village in Africa where they're produced ... at a rate of one every ten years, which is why they're not more common. The village in question, naturally, guards the secrets of its techniques zealously. What we do know is that pensieves somehow operate at the intersection of mind-magic and time-magic. The pensieve uses the inserted memory to track its way back through time to create a highly accurate vision of the place and period depicted therein, one which is in many ways more accurate than the original memory. For example, it is possible to review the memories of a deaf man and actually hear words uttered in his presence that he himself could not have heard. It is also possible to review the memories of someone who was blindfolded and see things that he himself was prevented from actually seeing, and, of course, it's no problem at all to examine someone's memory and review people and events that the person wasn't even paying attention to at the time. The only exception is when the donor's memories have been altered through Obliviation or Occlumency, though in the former situation, the alterations are readily apparent in a pensieve. For the purposes of this excursion, you may assume that everything you see is exactly as it was at the time in question."

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** I do believe in limitations on pensieves, though if that wasn't clear. If the memory starts in a room there wouldn't be enough information to represent anything outside the room. If a person is knocked out then the memory ends, if the person leaves the room and the viewer doesn't follow them along their memory, the visuals of the room will degrade rapidly before failing as the magic struggles to extrapolate what it could look like after the person leaves.

***** Yea. I got that part. It's understandable and follows the definition well. Just confirm the fic when you can.

How is the fic though? Worth the read? Cause sometimes the plot is amazing but the writing just ruins it. Sometimes it can't be avoided though. Anyway, that's something for a whole other discussion.

Just link the fic when you find it yea? Thnx a lot!!

****** I wasn't sure if you were thinking that the Time Magic was part of my personal explanation or not. I linked the fic in the other comment thread. The world building is great, the pace is slow, the foreshadowing excellent. I recommend giving it a try to at least halfway through first year.

** Haven't seen that at all but yeah I agree. I mean most of the fics I read barely have any pensieves whatsoever. Also, it might be because Harry could be in the memory they think that it could expand to outside of what was happening in the memory?

*** Linkffn(Honour Thy Blood)

Read this one. Extremely well written. Re-reading it atm. Read this in one of the chapters and it's what got me started looking up other fics and ultimately led to this post.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** Imo, the best way to write pensieve scenes is to keep in mind the senses of the memory-provider. If they are in a different room but can still hear, and the viewers remain in the room they just left, the memory's visual appearance would distort - people and objects would become pale mist and shadows, their position in the visual space depending on how the provider heard them move.

If there is an explosion, or the provider is blinded by a lumos spell, then all sound and visual information in the entire memory apruptly cuts off - Same with people behind the provider, who would be less detailed, their faces emotionless facsimiles based on memory or placeholders until the person saw them again.

People further away would become blurred even if the viewer walks up to them, but this also depends on if the provider knew who they were. So someone walking away would always be sharp, though their movement would become more unnatural and their face would lose all emotion over time.

Time in general would be heavily distorted in a pensieve. stretches of time and space that were similar would compress down, for example.

Additionally, I've always had memory clarity in a pensieve be dependent on the provider's skill in Occlumency. A novice would take out a fragmented memory, with bits and pieces still attached, stuff bleeding all over the place and details ignored or misinterpreted, while a master would extract a memory that encompasses all their sensory information from that period and reasonable guesses based on available knowledge for anything they didn't percieve.

** I don`t remember seeing anything like this.

The most I saw is one where Dumbledore gets three or four sets of memories of the same event and "stitches" them together in one memory so the overlapping parts have more details and they can see parts only one person saw at the same time. Apparently it`s quite hard.

All of this so McGonagall can show Hermione how wrong it was to attack Ron with conjured birds.

I never saw the pensieve showing more that the memories.
