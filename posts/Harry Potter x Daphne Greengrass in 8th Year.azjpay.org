** Does it have to be 8th year specifically, because there's always linkffn(Contractual Invalidation). A contract that should have been activated by HP's 18th bday was lost due to the LV takeover.

** I'm writing one now. It will have smut but plot also. It's grown a lot larger than I expected but I should have the first chapter or two posted soon. I haven't been able to find any memorable ones myself.

****** Hey, mostly, just got held up from editing/publishing with a few big life changes (read, having my first kid + moving house + working on a job promotion all at the same time). Follow me on AO3 or FFN and you'll get the update when I'm back to writing, just got to get things settled down first. :-)

** I dont know how to do fanfiction bot thing.

It's a bit slow and its unfinished but I thought it was pretty good. Its post hogwarts but close enough that you could call it 8th year

*** The update rate was quite regular (once a week) until a month ago and then there was a sharp drop. I hope we'll see the end of it because I really like it. One of the best recent ones
