I've recently finished The Cactus and the Toad linkffn(12919788) and really liked it so I'm looking for something similar -- (relatively) light-hearted fics about/featuring Snape that focus on friendship rather than romance.


** "I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love" linkffn(11923164) is a good one on his friendship with Luna. I haven't read The Cactus and the Toad, so I cannot comment on how similar it might be.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** Perhaps linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary) fits.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasly loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)
