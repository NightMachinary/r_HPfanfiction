We've seen some really interesting Grildelwalds in fanfic. From Altered Destinies to Taure's fic "The One He Feared" to numerous other fics (there are a really high number of them and I can't possibly remember them all, but the Warlock's Apprentice by Phantomfool is another one) that show off Gellert's influence on the Wizarding world.

With the new Fantastic Beasts movie coming out this year I was curious as to how you guys think this canon Grindelwald is going to turn out. We all know that he desired to have Muggles under the rule of Wizards and most fanfics seem to involve him in the thick of World War II. Yet from what we know about the new film, Dumbledore and Newt will be involved in trying to stop Gellert and this still takes place in the 20's and early 30's.

So overall I was interested to see what you guys think about Fanon Gellert and your ideas about what the film is going to do. I'd also like to know your thoughts on Newt being involved in the capture of Grindelwald.

** Haven't seen the movies but in my headcanon Grindelwald was into Arianna while Dumbledore was into him. After the duel which killed Arianna, Grindelwald blamed Dumbledore and swore vengeance. He left for Eastern Europe and spent decades studying the Dark Arts. He also saw the horrors of the first World War and decided to unleash it at the British because public opinion was with the rising star Albus Dumbledore.

Since the likeliest enemy of the English were the Germans and their new Chancellor had a warmongering rhetoric he approached Hitler and made a deal. For some magical assistance (Veritaserum, screening his guards, runes to enchant weapons) in exchange for a few favours, like a magic homing version of the V1 and bombing runs on empty fields (hidden Manors).

When Grindelwald realised the extent of what he unleashed (2nd world war, holocaust) he tried to stop it but was hindered by an international magical coalition, making him fight the "good guys" so that he could stop Hitler, which was difficult since he previously did everything in his power to prevent that. He succeeded after realising that his "enlightenment" project ended in blood and ruins. He wanted to surrender himself to the International coalition but when Dumbledore was there it turned into the famous duel.

** I kind of feel like Grindelwald is everything Voldemort could have been, if he didn't go crazy. (Not that Grindelwald's all that sane, but there you go.) I mean, they're both said to be young, handsome charming characters at their origins, they're both Dark Lords, they'd both like to rule somewhere in Europe and they're both trying to play with Death. I feel like these parallels aren't by accident: I think maybe J.K. Rowling was trying to tell us that in the grand scheme of things, Voldemort is insignificant, as is Grindelwald before him and whoever will come after him. The struggle between good and evil, light and dark, is eternal.

I feel like I'll be disappointed by movie-Grindelwald, partly because he's super evil and crazy in fics, but the movie has to be appropriate for children / young teens (I thought I heard somewhere the thing was going to be PG). Also, he's being played by Johnny Depp, who was great as Jack Sparrow, but who I feel like never graduated from that role.

Just low-key, I love the headcanon with Ariana! Are there any fics that explore this Ariana Dumbledore Grindelwald scene with. Good character development? That would be amazing!
