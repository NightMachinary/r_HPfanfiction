Not sure they exist. Maybe it's the lack of concrete descriptions of the castle that make people hesitant to write it (an issue that's annoying me in a story I'm doing).


** The closest (and best) american fic is the Alexander Quick series.

It was created long before Ilvermony though, and significantly better.

** Problem is, that's like asking if someone has made good fanfiction off of half a chapter of a encyclopedia you read once. There's not much at all to /do/ with it.

**** Has known context and is standing two feet left of the protagonists during the story. You can build her character through the plethora of different contexts afforded to you via seven novels. We know her culture, her blood status (I think), her school, her house, her possible friend groups. All building blocks to build a nothing character into a person.

You cant do that with a few paragraphs on a website for an entire school.

***** That's just silly. We have more than a few paragraphs. We have a general idea of some of the cultural issues of the nation (Rappaport's Law, Grindlewald's activities), some of the highly regarded families there (the descendants of the original Aurors, like Percival Graves), respected people in the society (including those who attended Ilvermorny, like Queenie and her sister, famous wand makers) and the history of the school from its inception.

If you are seriously saying the canon information and role of Daphne - which is literally just her name, her blood status, school House and her sister) - are enough to build her character, your argument that Ilvermorny cannot be done because of lack of information is a contradiction. I agree the lack of certain kinds of information makes it harder, but I don't think it's much different than the fanon use of Daphne (making up her character whole cloth).

** I did come up with an idea for an Ilvermorny story, but I was told that I would be better off just writing an original story rather than writing there. So I'm not going to write it. Clearly there is no point.

Summary: Ginny died in the Chamber of Secrets, so that Tom Riddle could live. Ginny and the Chamber were never found; so, Hogwarts was closed. Five years have passed since then and Hermione has just started her 7th year at Ilvermorny. Her last year was supposed to be one to remember. It would be one to remember, because of the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. [HG/TR, HG/DM]
