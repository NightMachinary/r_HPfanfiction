Years ago I remember a story in which Dumbledor bans caffeinated muggle drinks, not because they're muggle but the caffeine, the main character of the story who i think is harry dresses as Vader walks into the great hall at mealtime and does the" What is thy bidding my master" bit, Malfoy mouths off and as he does the hand motion for a force choke dumbledor, who has seen StarWars and knows this is a prank yells NO!

I remember there were a number of fairly original pranks in the story but can't remember much else if anyone could help I would be much appreciative.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

  “Ah. Well, yes I suppose that does place my age a little more specifically than I would like.” Dumbledore smiled beatifically. “However, we don't permit caffeine here either, and I presume that is still an ingredient?”

  It is a repost of Tenhawks story that is on wayback machine. It is BTVS/Harry Potter/Addams family crossover. A step to one side in time, a shift to another in space, and you would be surprised at the changes one might wreak on an unsuspecting world.
