This idea intrigues me a lot, but any time I look for it, I find fics where they either aren't in character, character bashing is involved or the summary is extremely uninteresting and doesn't motivate me to read. All I ask is for one that doesn't do any of those.


** The first half or so of Isolation, by Bex-chan, could be described as 8th year. Without giving away too much, it takes place during Hermiones 8th year, and her and Draco are at Hogwarts, but few people know Draco is there, and he doesn't attend classes. The second half of the story is outside Hogwarts, however.

*** I plan to get to that one day, but I'm going for something that ideally happens after DH (without Ron and Hermione getting together, obviously)

**** Well, Isolation meets the second criteria, but not the first. Funnily enough, I know plenty of Dramione fics that are both post DH and don't have Hermione with Ron, but none of them are 8th year fics.

** I totally know what you mean, OP. I love Draco/Hermione but that pairing (unfortunately) suffers from quite a few poorly written fics.

Since I started keeping record of what I'm reading, I haven't found any really good 8th year fics. One that was okay (I would give it an 80%) would be Presque Toujours Pur linkffn(11153333) but know that maybe 1/3 of that story is about another pairing that is not Draco/Hermione.

  Bellatrix's torture of Hermione uncovers a long-kept secret. The young witch learns her true origins in a story that shows the beginning and end of the Wizarding wars as Hermione learns about her biological father and the blood magic he dabbled in that will control her future (Slight AU OotP---DH) Dramione - Pureblood!Hermione - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes.

*** Thanks for the rec! In certain situations, I kept thinking "this is so outlandish, how is this believable" but the author came up with some pretty good explanations. I mean, the story as a whole was still on the other side of believable, but I still enjoyed it!

  Back for her 8th Year, Hermione finds herself alone at Hogwarts for Christmas. That is, until a chance encounter with Draco, the one other person who's stayed behind, leads the two of them on a domino effect that can only end under the mistletoe. "There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them"

  8th year Dramione work-in-progress with no update schedule or acceptable summary. It does include, however, high quality alcohol, expensive sheets, and beautifully hand-illustrated star charts. Also bitterness, depression, and rage. You know, the normal stuff.
