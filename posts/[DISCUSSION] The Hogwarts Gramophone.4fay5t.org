So we know that gramophones will work at Hogwarts from GOF's dancing lesson (or Lupin's turntable in the movies), so...

If there was a gramophone in one of the common rooms, what sort of record would you chuck on to see reactions for? I'd like to see what people expect of the differences between music cultures.

I'd like to see a group of wizarding kids who'd never been exposed to his music suddenly try to make sense of a Prince record.


** Skrillex of course. Maybe soften them up with something classical first, like Public Enemy.

** Reactions to hip hop would be interesting. There do appear to be rock sorry, wrock bands, and I'm sure they also have explicit songs, and heavy metal, but I'm not convinced the wizarding world would be acquainted with rap. So that might be a bit of a cultural shock.

As for specific artists...I love to think Alice Cooper actually IS a wizard, or at least a squib, and Muggleborn fans minds would be blown to find out he's popular in that world, too. I'd probably throw Gangnam Style and What does the fox say on and teach them the moves. Mwahahaha. Then again, Uptown Funk and watch me whip probably would be just as peculiar to them

Personally, I'd love to be the first person to Rick Roll Hogwarts.

*** Yeah, definitely. I mean, while wrock obviously has lyrics about dancing like a hippogriff, I'd quite like to see wizards respond to Muggle songs that talk about magic or use it as a metaphor.

But also, I want to see a bunch of Pureblood, twelve-year-old wizards with Queen's Fat Bottomed Girls stuck in their heads.

** I'd go for Queen ;) and maybe for something that criticizes government (the ministry needs reform badly after all and getting people to think is always good and IMHO noble!) oh and something that criticizes SCHOOL (as Hogwarts over all - IMHO - isn't a good school: The Professors aren't great (defense, potions and history are good examples for shoddy teaching IMHO!), the building itself is dangerous, bullying is allowed (or at least tolerated!), the point system is to easy to abuse, the equipment is outdated (astronomy telescopes, school brooms etc.), important things (like economics, maths, politics etc.) aren't taught etc. etc.)

** Early-to-mid nineties? Rave music, Slayer, early Rammstein if there're any Durmstrang kids around (imagine their faces when bueck dich starts playing...) followed by Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, select works of the Red Army choir, La Marseillaise, the Internationale, Eurythmics and, finally, the Sesame Street Song.

** This is an interesting question, because it addresses something I've been thinking about a lot lately: the fact that the Wizarding World doesn't really have any sort of pop culture (or at least anything near what Muggles have) due to a general lack of mass media. We can argue all day about who would win a normal war, but the fact of the matter is that a culture war between wizards and Muggles would be a Muggle roflstomp. Which is why I really want to read a fic where the Internet is introduced to the Wizarding World--they'd never know what hit them.

*** Muggles certainly seem to have the advantage in "high culture", but I'm not sure that they have the advantage in entertainment. There's so much that you can do with magic for entertainment that Muggles have to put in books and TV because it's not possible to actually do... but wizards can.

Just think of how much entertainment value alone you could get out of hanging out with friends and transfiguring each other into animals. That's the kind of experience Muggles can only dream of. And indeed it may also count as "high culture", though wizards probably don't think of it as such. But it's the kind of thing Muggles write about - see, for example, Thomas Nagel's celebrated essay "What is it like to be a bat?"

**** Self-transfiguration is supposed to be extremely difficult and dangerous (which is why Animagi are so rare), but I take your point. What I really mean when I say "culture war", though, isn't necessarily entertainment alone. It's Muggles' ability to spread ideas: "memes" in the original sense.

Wizards may have the advantage in almost every other area, but I don't think they really have an equivalent for this, which is why I find it so interesting. It would be really fun to read about a "Muggleization" of Wizard culture via the Internet: it's so useful that even Wizards would want it, but it spreads Muggle ideas to Wizard nations that are usually hyper-isolationist. Even if they have better /entertainment/, that doesn't necessarily mean they'd be immune to that effect.

** Drop 'em in the deep end with a Sigur Ros album. Let's see them try to wrap their heads around that.

But, otherwise, give them a real taste of all the period-approriate music their missing out on. New Order/Joy Division, The Smiths, Iggy Pop, Echo and the Bunnymen, The Cure, The Clash, Pet Shop Boys, Depeche Mode, Bowie, Massive Attack, etc.

Or better yet, just throw on the soundtrack for Trainspotting. That's pretty much the late 80s and early 90s UK music scene condensed into one record.

*** That is assuming wizards use original muggle devices (it's obvious why they would appear in the films of course) or, in their own home-produced versions (wizarding society doesn't exactly favour going for supplies from the muggle side, even if supplies wouldn't have dwindled by now), obey muggle-set standards or the technological limitations of muggle construction.

Which seems rather unlikely.

Thus you can rest assured that a wizarding turntable will turn at any speed it needs to turn, with the flick of a wand.
