Want to start writing HP fanfic, but dont know where to start. Anyone have ideas on easy prompts


** I dont think it's a good idea to start to write a story if you dont even have the most basic idea about it. And also people may need more information, do you want an idea for a oneshot or something like a saga ?

Anyway you can probably write some over used plot that people already read ten thousand times :

Harry learn about his heritage (Heir of 15 families, 23 house, 1345346 galleons in a vault with 9086695 sickles and 087546884 knuts ), and how Dumbledore is a manipulative old coot. He then decide to create a 3rd Grey side to the War between the Dark Lord and the Light Lord (also become as strong as Voldemort cause he trained 2 months in magical trunk and all the named female characters want him cause reasons )

They Dursley are monsters who abused Harry (not the "go sleep in the cupboard " kind, the "I 'll break every bones in your body every week and maybe let Vernon "visit " you at night " kind ). But the abuses only made him stronger, so now he is sorted in Slytherin where every one speak like in the Victorian Era and will make political alliances because every body know that 12 years old are the true power behind the government. Also make him best friend with Hermione cause she is smart and bash Ron.

Or I guess you could just search the Prompt in this sub forum and see if one catch your fancy.
