** I believe you are looking for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7182157/1/Tale-as-Old-as-Time][Tale as Old as Time]].

Fred goes into a coma after the final battle and wakes up believing that he and Hermione are together. As you already stated, the kicker in this is that his family practically begs her to play into it on the grounds that he might lapse into another coma or become seriously damaged...or /something/.

Surprisingly good and adequately fluffy, I say.

Edit: purified the evil link, next time I'll make sure to remember linkffn exists ;)

*** You are aware that you linked to Chapter 32?

I mean, yes, I could have been more alert, but damn that is one evil way to spoil a story.

***** Don't worry. After reading chapter 1 and 2, I decided that it isn't for me anyway. The ending was fluffy enough.

But for the love of god, edit your post!
