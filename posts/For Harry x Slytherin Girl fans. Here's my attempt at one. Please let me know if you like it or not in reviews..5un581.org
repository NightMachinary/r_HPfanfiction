** Read the first chapter and have no desire to continue. The OC feels like an OC, and the first chapter just feels like it's being used to set up how great she is compared to the characters from the books.

Sorry mate, I quite enjoy Harry/Slytherin but this story just wasn't for me.

**** If you're still interested, please read from "fiery redhead spitfire" and on. The chief purpose of the fic is to place an ethical dilemma. Dumbledore's Greater Good without any of the benefits vs a reasonable peace plan at the loss of personal freedom.

Dumbledore sees Harry sacrificing himself as heroic and self-sacrificing. A more narcissistic personality, who still cares enough about Harry's wellbeing, would see such a thing as mental torture to force a young man into suicide.

Who is right?

** You're going to lose people for the fact the Slytherin girl you chose isn't from the books but that other monstrosity. Personally I felt cheated by the whole life debt thing. You shouldn't be able to earn a life debt from simply not killing them. You'd have to save them from an otherwise certain death. Otherwise you could go around claiming life debts for not Avada Kedavaring people. It feels cheap. The rest of it, yeah what others have said with regards to your Slytherin girl, it feels like less of a story more you telling us how great she is and how'd you fix all the flaws in Harry Potter. You're bending things to make it happens and it cheapens a potentially interesting story. If you're enjoying it then keep going but bear in mind that some people will likely leave less than pleasant reviews for what we've said. Some might do that simply because they can though so take it with a grain of salt.

Oh boy. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever read.

**** Run around pointing your wand at people and choosing not to curse them to force them to accept orders clearly was the creation of the first house elves.

***** Holy necro batman!

But in canon, life debts aren't this magical compulsion that makes people slaves.

And Harry was showing Wormtail mercy by making someone else not kill him. He never threatened Wormtail.

The idea that you could hold a knife to someone's throat, pull it away, and somehow they're your magical slave is ludicrous.

****** I took liberties with fanon that sort of make it to be that. Honestly, the life debt concept doesn't make sense if there is no sense of obligation. It may as well just be a cultural belief, not actual magical compulsion as it was implied in the books.

** In the process of reading, but I've noticed an issue with your dialogue tags (at least in the first chapter).

You write...

#+begin_quote
  "Hey, I love cake," *S*he said, sitting down.
#+end_quote

Should be...

#+begin_quote
  "Hey, I love cake," *s*he said, sitting down.
#+end_quote

The tags are fine in later sections, but just in case it escaped your notice they aren't fixed at the very beginning.

*** it does that automatically, sometimes it's hard to spot. But whenever I click space, it automatically puts "She" instead of "she"

** I'm pro OC-ish Delphini Riddle appearing in more fanfics. A non-Daphne is a good angle to take.
