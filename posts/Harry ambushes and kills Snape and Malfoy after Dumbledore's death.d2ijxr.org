No matter how good a duelist you are, a /Sectumsempra/ across the neck by an ambusher is going to kill you.

Harry, upon realizing that they're escaping to the Hogwarts gates, summons his broomstick and uses his invisibility cloak to set up an ambush ahead for Snape and Malfoy. Both are killed.

I know it happens in linkffn(I Need You by chem prof). Any other stories?


** I've always been puzzled over Dumbledore's insistence that Snape be the one that tells Harry that he needs to die, for this exact reason -- Harry has no reason whatsoever to trust Snape, and to him, killing Snape in an ambush can be nothing but a good thing.

No matter what you think of Snape, him dying off in such a case is going to make things very problematic.

  What if Hermione's parents had pulled her out of Hogwarts after she was nearly killed by a basilisk in her second year? How would Harry have managed without her? Years later, she returns and learns about his life in her absence. H/Hr

*** Because the whole night was Malfoy's fault. The only redeeming feature Malfoy had was being too much of a coward to do the deed himself.

*** Malfoy nearly killed Ron and Katie. He let Death Eaters inside a school full of children. He's been spouting his blood bigotry for years and was glad that he was a Death Eater, only to get scared when he realized that there would be consequences if he failed.

There are plenty of reasons why anyone would be enraged enough to kill him. He's a coward. He's never shown to be remorseful only fearful.

**** Indeed! Hell, Draco may be a spineless coward and a follower (who can't stomach torture and killing because he's a spoiled, pampered asshole!) but those are even more dangerous (they'll stab you in the back instead of coming at you from the front!), especially if you corner them! So taking this dangerous enemy (who might also buy his way out of prison, especially since he hasn't truly commited any truly bad crimes yet!) is kind of common sense IMHO! Just like killing every deatheater and snatcher is (not every purge of a society is bad, if done for the right reasons and during war then it can be a very good thing!)

***** I'm assuming Malfoy being a kid would be a great comfort to the victims of his crimes? And Harry killing him in combat wouldn't be murder; Malfoy had employed lethal, /unforgivable/ means in the past and it would make sense if his opponents retaliated likewise.

Legality and even morality is irrelevant to the request anyway as long as the premise itself is not /implausible/.

Harry may not be a killer in /canon/ which is why I've asked this in a /fanfiction/ subreddit.
