I am looking for fanfictions like methods of rationality or Harry Crow. Harry should be raised differently, or maybe have the same life but just be a different person, i.e. more like a ravenclaw or more like a slytherin. Hope this explanation is enough, it is kind of hard for me to find the correct words. Thanks a lot! And sorry for bad English ðŸ˜…

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** So, Hermione pairings?

More seriously though, considering Harry's raising the way he was with the Dursleys left him more well-adjusted than we have any right to expect, not many things would realistically change much about how Harry developed.

That being said, here are some good alternate Harry origins stories:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) is a more magical AU where Harry was raised in an orphanage and his parents were killed by Grindelwald.

linkffn(Reign of the Serpent) is another AU where Harry has to deal with a different world where Slytherin won the battle between the founders and changed magical Britain.

linkffn(What You Leave Behind) is one with a bit of a mystery behind Harry's background, but I recommend this fic solely on the quality of the writing and magical theory.

linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) has a Harry who lived his early life in Germany because Voldemort won the first war, before being adopted by the Dursleys (Voldemort-won AU).

There are more, but I suspect that is enough for now.

You mean fanon or canon Ravenclaw? Canon Ravenclaw is Cho: a crying, overemotional mess of a girl who likes quidditch, instead of reading and studying.

#+begin_quote
  or more like a Slytherin.
#+end_quote

Canon Slytherin is: Crabbe, Goyle - two intellectually stunted boys who are terrible at magic. And Draco - a boy who cries for his dad every time something doesn't go his way, who's too much of a coward to help EITHER side in a war (stays quiet about harry in malfoy manor, can't kill dumbledore or crucio anyone), and constantly gets his ass beat despite his superiority complex.

But I'm guessing you don't mean that, do you? Nah, who needs real, three dimensional human beings! Let's have: everyone is a super nerdy bookworm, or, everyone is a political mastermind - because apparently ambition can ONLY ever be used in service of FUCKING POLITICS. Like fuck, nobody ever have the ambition to become a doctor, or a store clerk or some shit? Or how about "cunning" being used as a counselor or a psychiatrist to prod somebody into a self realization to get more help?

There is no "More like this house or that house". And that view needs to die. It's reducing everyone to one trait stereotypes and cartoon characters.

I've seen complaints about the house system, but JKR didn't put them in a box. The fandom does 'cause, for the most part, all the characters could be in a different house.

Tbh, Ravenclaws are eccentric like Luna, Trelawney, or Uric or dumb like Quirrell and Lockhart.

*** I find it baffling that some people seem to find Canon Characters Three Dimensional when none of them are, to begin with. Slytherins are Evil, Gryffindors are Good Guy, Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs exist. Fanon did a better job than canon in this matter. But the sorting system is silly for that matter too.

Ambition is about social standing in society. Nobody would judge ambitious someone whose greatest dream is to be a store clerk. Because any lazy ass can become a store clerk and nobody cares about the store clerk. Ambitiousness is egotistical by nature. Some people like to be a doctor to save lives, others like to play the savior. Which one of them is ambitious? Which one of them will probably end up in Slytherin?

#+begin_quote
  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!
