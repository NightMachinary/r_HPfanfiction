I'm looking for a fic where Harry defeats Voldemort with a strange/silly power. For example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5125667/1/Shake-on-it][this fic]] is one of my favorites. Any suggestions?


** Awhile ago I wrote a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4116182/1/Scourgify-The-Power-He-Knows-Not][series of drabbles]] along these lines: Harry defeating Tom Riddle with Scourgify, a game of Truth or Dare, a game of Strip Poker, Knock-Knock Jokes, etc.

** While not a magical power this fic and its sequel are a good twist on the power he knows not.

** I would like to read a story where the 'Power he knows not' is ancient Egyptian magic. Perhaps with a ritualistic component, and since we don't want Harry just roflstomping Voldemort then we should add an element of tension. So the ritual will be one that the two of them compete in and the winner lives, while the loser dies.

Now, Voldemort has his soul split, so we need to account for that. I would suggest instead of straight dieing his soul and mind are sent to some form of shadowy alternate dimension.

The only component left is to have the battle be some form that Harry can stand up to Voldemort.... Perhaps some form of children's card game...

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8100119/1/Ring-Around-the-Wrong-Neck][This]] is the only story I can think of that fits his description. It's a Yu-Gi-Oh crossover. (Actually I guess there could be plenty of other Yu-Gi-Oh crossovers that fit, that's just the only one I've read.)

*** I'd think that Voldemort would have learned all he could about ancient Egyptian magic, whatever it was, particularly given how preoccupied ancient Egyptians were with stuffing bits of themselves into jars for preservation.
