:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Maybe a year or so ago I read a fic that was a hp/avengers crossover, leaning more towards hp. Harry was either adopted or blood related to Tony and he was super into runes/arithmancy and was possibly (but also maybe not) in a relationship/friendship with Daphne Greengrass. He still went to Hogwarts. I've been searching and just cannot find this story, it was either on ffn or ao3, and it was complete.

If anybody knows this fic- or can rec something similar- I am all ears


** There is linkffn(3933832), but that's incomplete.

*** Funnily enough, I think this might actually be the fic I was looking for ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I don't tend to read incomplete fics, but somebody else recommended it and I got to the end before realising it was incomplete, thank you very much x
