In canon, it's always that Lily sacrificed herself for Harry and it makes me feel like no other mother would do the same thing. James gets brushed aside as a side note.

So I'm looking for something where Harry learns more about his father, he's praised more for sacrificing himself for his family and no one casually calls him 'idiot' every single time they lovingly remember him

Thanks in advance :)

**** Return is basically just OP!GoodGuys with Harry basically destroying everyone. It contains a bunch of tropes like magic trunk apartments, magical animagus with majority of the "Marauders" animgi and evil Dumbledore and BWL Nevillemort with no editing or proofreading in the story.

Basically a guilty pleasure fix if you want to see antagonists get destroyed by everyone.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

  Transported into a parallel universe, Harry finds himself in the shadow of an evil growing force. Amidst old and new faces and the chance for a family that he never had, Harry must come to the terms that although there are two worlds, there can only be one hero. *AU Dimension travel, No slash, Abuse, Contains Angst*

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

** Secondstarontheleft has a story where a widowed Lily mourns James a lot, connects with Petunia again, etc. Several of the Durmstrang Harry stories, the ones that aren't pro Death Eater, have a more sympathetic view of James---there's one where Sirius raises Harry alongside Narcissa and Draco and they rescue Bellatrix's daughter. Many of the Sirius/Remus stories that have them raising Harry, if you click on the tag, say a lot of good things about James.

  In which James Potter isn't as dead as everyone thought and Harry has a strong mistrust of all adults.Reconnecting with his son isn't going to be easy, not just because Harry's in Slytherin.
