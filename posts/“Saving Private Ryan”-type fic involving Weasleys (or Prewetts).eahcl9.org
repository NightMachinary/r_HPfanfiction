/My husband actually came up with this idea as I was telling him about a discussion I had in another sub. Someone had commented that they would have killed off both Fred and Percy in DH, and I jokingly replied killing more than one Weasley child would have caused readers to riot in the streets./

He proposed a fic based on the concept behind Saving Private Ryan (and/or the real story of the Niland brothers on which it was based), where all but one or two Weasley kids are killed in the Second Wizarding War, and someone decides the surviving one(s) need(s) to be rescued and sent home. I suppose this could work best with Ron as he spends a good chunk of time wandering the country in DH, but it could be made to work with any of them.

It also occurred to me it would be interesting to do this with the Prewett family during the First Wizarding War, as we know Molly's brothers Gideon and Fabian were both killed. A third brother could be concocted, or it could be about Molly herself.


** This sounds amazing and I would totally read it. I also have to go rewatch Saving Private Ryan
