I remember reading a story where Harry's uncle (not Vernon, Lily's brother) takes Harry and trains him to be a soldier. I think Nevile was involved too. Can anyone tell me where to fine this story?

** I think there's one about Harry having an uncle who used to fight nazis but I'm not sure if that's what your looking for since I haven't finished it

** Harry Potter and the Ring of Five

I think it's this one you're talking about

Edit: didn't realise till later this was in violation of rule 8, so I have removed the link.
