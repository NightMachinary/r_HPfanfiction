In honor of the birthday of our favorite Gryffindor beaters, magical mischief makers, and joke suppliers of the the wizarding world, let's talk about Fred and George.

1) What are your favorite Fred and/or George focused fanfics?

2) What are some common things that fanfic writers do when it comes to writing Fred & George that you like? That you hate?

3) Favorite ships for the twins? How do you feel about canon George/Angelina?

4) What are you favorite bits of canon involving the twins? Least favorite? Would you change anything?

Happy birthday to the twin suppliers of laughs during the darkest of times!


** My favourite part of the twins is the scene with their joke-shop at the start of HBP. The garish, over-the-top shop in the middle of all the doom and gloom. Great stuff.

I read a story once, can't remember which, where Fred and George randomly decide to switch girlfriends. George says something along the lines of "Angelique finally found out I'm more handsome". Made me laugh, and I think that's the whole point of the twins as characters.

Least favourite part of the twins: I think it's because I've read about it too much, but Fred's death doesn't faze me at all anymore. So when I read those post-Hogwarts fics and I see a wall of text where the main character grieves about Fred, I just skip it.

** 4) Fred's death. I can't imagine how George could possibly cope. Saddest death in canon for me.

*** I have no idea what you're referring to. Fred never died.

** 1) Fred and George's Busy Day by Northumbrian (plus his other F/G fics) linkffn(5486126)

2) I love when they're written canonically. Hate constant twin-speak/Gred+Forge, because this isn't canon! They only did it once!

3) I like canon ships. I am 100% good with George and Angelina; they were housemates for 7 years and teammates for 6, so they have a good background. Personally, my headcanon is that Fred and Angelina went to the Yule Ball as friends only, because people seem to really hate that George ended up with Fred's alleged ex-girlfriend. On the flip side, I've read good fics where Fred /did/ date Angelina (quite seriously), and George and Angelina bonded over mutual mourning/grief. Basically as long as the fic doesn't make it into some tragic thing where Angelina went for George because he's practically Fred (which he isn't, they actually have slightly different personalities, and it's noticeable in canon).

4) U-NO-POO, their departure from Hogwarts, all their brotherly antics (making fun of ickle Ronniekins and Percy). I like the PoA bit that's like:

  Percy: why are we taking ministry cars

  Fred (deadpanning): It's for you Perce, they're going to have flags on the bonnet with HB on them

  George: For humongous bighead.
#+end_quote

I don't like the bit where Fred dies, although I think it was a good literary choice because it /was/ the most traumatic sibling to die (Ron and Ginny are not options).

  Harry, Ron and Hermione are on the run from Voldemort. Fred and George Weasley are successful businessmen. Death Eaters control the Ministry and Muggleborns are being rounded up. The wizarding world needs heroes, it needs freedom fighters. The wizarding world gets Fred and George!
