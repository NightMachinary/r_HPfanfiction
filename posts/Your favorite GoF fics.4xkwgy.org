I'm not sure why GoF, in particular, appeals to me most. Perhaps it's the diversity introduced - three schools makes for more interesting character interaction. Perhaps it's the competitive nature - there's a tense, exciting feel to it all.

Anyways, *please don't link anything that sticks to the stations of canon* with no deviation unless it's /extraordinarily/ good.

I'll start with some of my favorites: linkffn(The Denarian Renegade; Magicks of the Arcane; Hogwarts Battle School)

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

** linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) starts out at the start of the GoF year, and most certainly ignores Stations of Canon. In particular, each of the four Triwizard tasks has an elemental theme (Fire, Water, Air, and Earth), and there are several competitions (dueling, cursebreaking, and maybe one other) held for the non-champion delegates from the three schools.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

I agree with almost all of this, but I didn't mind the ending (sappy as it was). There weren't a lot of genuinely happy moments in the main body of the story, so a bit of fluff and wish-fulfillment in the epilogue didn't seem /too/ out-of-place.

Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
