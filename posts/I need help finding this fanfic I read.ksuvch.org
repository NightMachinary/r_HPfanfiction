:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I have read a fuck ton of fanfic for Harry Potter but I also read a lot of other stuff like manga and light novels so sometimes I forget what I have read or sometimes I can't find it again. This fanfic was really good from what I remember harry travels to a different dimension/timeline where at least lily potter lived unsure if James potter did as well i don't remember but he had siblings as well he had a little sister(like under 10) and an older sister(unsure of age but around 2 years older or younger than him)he may have more siblings. From what I remember this harry was described as having longer red hair and a fair face he was also a total fucking dick and a psycho before harry replaced him his family wanted to love him and have him as a part of the family and he refused even hurting them or intentionally cutting/burning his sisters or breaking their things now that the Canonverse harry is here he wants to become a part of the family he so longed for. I am also 90% sure he ends up in a relationship with his sister(she hated him and didn't think he actually changed at first and it took awhile for her to come around but then they become really close)he also might with his mother but idk about that and I'm pretty sure there are others as well. I don't remember much about the plot or relationships tbh just that he is brought to this new harry and trys to show his family he wants to love them and be loved. he also tells them why he changed so much(from psycho who wants to kill them to caring loving sibling/son/nephew) because of a dream showing him how horrible he was. Remus and Sirius are in it for sure I know its almost nothing substantial to go off of but its bugging me I really wanna read it again and if anybody can help me out I will be really grateful

*** Fair enough I fixed it up a bit but I'm not amazing at writing and this is super jumbled.
