:END:
It's been a literal age since I read this fic. I'm not sure exactly where I found it, though ffnet seems the most likely culprit. Maybe skyhawke? Hard to say.

The story begins with Sirius falling through the Veil and into an alternate version of HP canon. In this other universe, all the HP characters live regular lives as Muggles. And it's implied that other people have likely been pushed through the Veil without their wands, but Sirius actually still has his. The AU people are concerned and think he's dangerously unstable because he believes magic is real. Sirius learns /he/ is married to Lily instead of James, and Harry is his bio son -- and his family hates him? I think? because he was apparently abusive/neglectful before canon Sirius arrives in the world. At first Sirius wants to go back to his own world, but he's unable to find a way back and he gradually creates a happier life for himself. I think he becomes friends with AU Snape eventually?? But the AU world is clearly intent on destroying him.

It was a bizarre read but it has always stuck in my head. I'd love to find it again. Thanks in advance to anyone who has any leads.
