*** Technically speaking as long as he doesn't run the DA in sixth year he's no longer teaching DADA

** Mhm that makes me wonder. I know that Harry wasn't employed by Dumbledore or anything when he taught DADA, but he did in fact teach it, and yet he didn't bring back DA after Umbridge left. Wonder if the curse affects (anything), that has to do with the DADA, even if the person isn't employed.

*** I don't think so. Canon implies it's a curse on the official position itself. Why they don't just cut DADA from the curriculum and replace it with a "Magical Defense" class is beyond me unless the curse is a lot more autonomous than that, but the explanation is pretty vague to begin with.

My theory is that the Diadem horcrux has enough autonomy to recognize and curse any teacher in charge of DADA-like classes, and it's removal/destruction/containment breaks the curse. It's possible that the students are under stricter protections by the castle itself than the teachers since adults would be expected to take care of themselves, so the horcrux can only target teachers- but it's not autonomous enough to take out Dumbledore, so it just fixates on Riddle's greed for the DADA position

**** Umbridge taught nothing that year (even though she was employed by Dumbledore, even if Dumbledore hadn't wanted her), Harry did teach. Umbridge didn't come back, Harry did come back, but not to teach again, just kind of seems like strange coincidence to me.

But then again as much as I love JKRowling, she would often show us big things, only for them not to be that relevant in the future.
