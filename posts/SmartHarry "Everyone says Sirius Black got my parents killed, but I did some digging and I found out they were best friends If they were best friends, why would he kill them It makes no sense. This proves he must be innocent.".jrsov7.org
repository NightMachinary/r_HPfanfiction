"On an unrelated note, my best friend, Ron, has been giving me love potions so Dumbledore can steal my vaults. Anyhow, back to the topic of Sirius and how betrayal by a best friend isn't real. Peter Pettigrew's body was mostly destroyed, but that's impossible, because I've examined every spell in existence and none of them can possibly blow stuff up. Furthermore, one of Voldemort's horcruxes --- we don't know how many he made, so I'm just going to guess seven, definitely seven --- was in Malfoy Manor, which in and of itself proves beyond all shadow of doubt that another horcrux is in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts. Also, my name will definitely come out of the Goblet of Fire because it's Halloween."

My pet peeve in fanfics is when characters deduce information out of nowhere using moon logic, and are proven correct. I feel like I see this constantly? I know I joked about the Ron thing, but it's definitely not restricted to bashing stories, it seems like it shows up anywhere where the author wants to make Harry look smarter or wants to accelerate the timeline and doesn't bother to make it work?


** I think that it's a lesson that writers need to re-learn from childhood, but now applied differently.

A young child has to learn how to separate things they know from things other people know. An experiment that is often used is to have someone place a cookie, or a ball in one of two jars in view of a child. They then leave and someone else moves the item from one jar to another. When the first person comes back in, the examiner asks the child which jar the person is going to pick. Until they pass a certain threshold in development, they always pick the one they know the item is in.

​

The original Sherlock Holmes pioneered the field of foriensics because it was the first time anyone had thought to apply that sort of reasoning to crime scenes in a wide fashion. The fact that Conan Doyle was pulling things out of his arse didn't change that those things were done intellegently.

#+end_quote

This isn't limited to fanfiction. This occurs anytime you have a writer (even a professional one) who wants to write a character who is smart (in terms of inductive or deductive reasoning) but is below average in that regards themselves. To the writer that kind of reasoning seems magical, sort of like when you turn on a computer for a non-technical person and they suddenly think you must be a genius who can do anything computer related.

Since the writer doesn't /understand/ the basics of deductive reasoning they just assume it can do anything, like how computers were often written in the 80s and 90s (where a character typed something into an 80s computer terminal and suddenly they could fly or shoot lasers from their fingers because /computer/). And so for a writer who doesn't understand how more reason-oriented people deduce things it seems perfectly reasonable to write moon logic since that's how they perceive it happening: a 'smart' person rattles off some related facts and then suddenly knows the answer. It's a magical superpower!

*** Yup, this was a major failing of the Sherlock TV series too. Sherlock just deduces random things to have one specific cause, even though there could be a million things that would have caused what he's looking at.

Writing good deduction requires the ability to disassociate from one's perspective as a writer and being honest about what a character could possibly know.

#+end_quote

I chose not to reference that show even though it's the first thing that came to mind (it was too extreme of an example to get across my point clearly), but since it's out there I may as well post the famous breakdown (not written by me).

#+begin_quote
  Why does nobody like Sherlock? Because it has smart characters written stupidly.

  Anton Chigurh from No Country for Old Men is a smartly written smart character. When Chigurh kills a hotel room full of three people he books to room next door so he can examine it, finding which walls he can shoot through, where the light switch is, what sort of cover is there etc. This is a smart thing to do because Chigurh is a smart person who is written by another smart person who understands how smart people think.

  Were Sherlock Holmes to kill a hotel room full of three people. He'd enter using a secret door in the hotel that he read about in a book ten years ago. He'd throw peanuts at one guy causing him to go into anaphylactic shock, as he had deduced from a dartboard with a picture of George Washington carver on it pinned to the wall that the man had a severe peanut allergy. The second man would then kill himself just according to plan as Sherlock had earlier deduced that him and the first man were homosexual lovers who couldn't live without eachother due to a faint scent of penis on each man's breath and a slight dilation of their pupils whenever they looked at each other. As for the third man, why Sherlock doesn't kill him at all. The third man removes his sunglasses and wig to reveal he actually WAS Sherlock the entire time. But Sherlock just entered through the Secret door and killed two people, how can there be two of him? The first Sherlock removes his mask to reveal he's actually Moriarty attempting to frame Sherlock for two murders. Sherlock however anticipated this, the two dead men stand up, they're undercover police officers, it was all a ruse. "But Sherlock!" Moriarty cries "That police officer blew his own head off, look at it, there's skull fragments on the wall, how is he fine now? How did you fake that?". Sherlock just winks at the screen, the end.

  This is retarded because Sherlock is a smart person written by a stupid person to whom smart people are indistinguishable from wizards.

******** Same with other common "oaths", actually. I never liked the way authors play it fast and loose with oaths - having a character swear innocence (in a world where a dark wizard can say "imperio. kill him. obliviate" and nobody is the wiser).

Not to mention, the "punishment" for the oathbreaker is never anything interesting. It's almost always the very dubious claim of "losing magic" - which has no canon support, and indeed is very unlikely to work, based on what we know about magic (it is of the soul) and what manipulating the soul requires.

How about some more inventive punishments?

Swear on your name -> an oathbreaker loses their first or last name, or both, and must take a new one.

Swear on an eye -> an oathbreaker is blinded in that eye

Swear by a finger -> The oathbreaker's finger withers away

Swear on vocal abilities -> the oathbreaker becomes unable to lie, or to tell the truth, or to speak english

Swear on luck -> the oathbreaker experiences worse luck

etc etc. Not everything has to be "on magic".

"Everyone says Sirius Black got my parents killed, but I did some digging and found out he's my godfather! He had to take a magical oath which would stop him from hurting me or doing anything malicious that would cause me pain, so he can't have revealed the Fidelius I know about for reasons. Also, he was an auror for a while, so I doubt he killed 12 (10? I can't remember) people."\\
"On an unrelated note, my best friend Ron has been giving information about me to Dumbledore- I overheard with my invisibility cloak and the powers of hiding around a corner. His little sister has been giving me love potions so she can marry me and take my money, but I'm a paranoid bastard and I constantly use potions that stop that type of thing from working- also, the love potion she used has taste, and is one of the many I taught myself to recognize the taste of when I realized how widely-known the fact that I'm rich is. Anyways, back on the topic of Sirius' non-betrayal. Peter Pettigrew's body was supposedly mostly destroyed, but that can't be right because explosive spells would leave viscera around the area, which there was none (because no muggles were that close), and any vaporizing or more targeted spells would take his finger with them. Furthermore, one of Voldemort's horcruxes- I've had some experts examine my scar and figured out, through the power of division since each horcrux splits the soul by half, that he has seven- was in Malfoy Manor, so he probably hid others with trusted Death Eaters which I'm gonna search through (including Bellatrix Lestrange's vault). Also, Voldemort has caused bad things to happen every year on Halloween, so something bad will happen this year- like, I don't know, my name coming out for the deadly Tournament which has been said to have caused a lot of deaths.
