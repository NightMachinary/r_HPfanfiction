Slightly off-topic question for this Sub, but I've recently become very interested in Harry Potter fan-art, and although I have zero artistic talent, it never stops me from admiring these wonderful illustrations.

It always bugged me that I wasn't able to properly view the art that stayed at the top because of all the symbols/icons that were put in front. So, anybody has links where I can view the images properly? And maybe, links to more works from the same artist?

*** That's perfect! Thanks a ton!

The art is incredible - I haven't seen anything like this before.

*** Oh wow! That's a brilliant interpretation of Dobby!

Any links to the artist's other works?
