  When one was faced with eternity the only thing that could make the passage of time bearable was a companion. Death knew that, which was why it made sure that his Master ran into the only other person in the Universe who knew it too.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

** Snakeskins is a really interesting Hetalia x HP crossover... and itÂ´s one of the longest (if not the longest) fic I ever saw, over 1.000.000 words!!! It may fall into bashing sometimes (wich I usually dislike) but the magic of the countries is so amazing and it fits so well with HP unverse that I have to commend it.

  Pottertalia. Twenty years after the end of the Second Wizarding War, tragedy at the world's safest school prompts a clash between two Magical Ministries and an inquiry of a different kind. If the students and staff of Hogwarts School can't earn back the world's trust, then one Nation may do what the Dark Lord could not and close its doors forever. Long-term fic. Hiatus.

** I had a lot of fun writing this House MD/HP crossover fic. I confess that I wrote it largely to write Snape and House quipping and snarking at each other.
