I recently had an idea of a Succubi being mightily offended that instead of Harry's soul, she only got Voldemort's horcrux as "payment" for her being summoned. In general I have noticed there is very little in terms of demons around the fandom which isn't utter edgelord shite.

So, yeah... Do you folks know some fic in which demons take part and are somewhat important to the well written story?


** It's really not aged well but it's quite an adventure if you can get over the early hyperbolic time room of requirement, the OP super magic school of Canada and that Harry change his name to Rahkesh Asmodeus.

It's quite a guilty pleasure but it was one of the first fics I ever read. It's a trilogy but the last fic isn't finished and is only a couple of chapters long.
