The level of child neglect tolerated at Hogwarts is because it is much safer for it to happen there than at home. Magical children are regularly subjugated to being around failed magical experiments, magical creatures who like to kidnap them, accidentally binding themselves in a magical ritual that follows them for the rest of their lives, etc.

​

For some reason, the parents of muggleborns always raise a stink whenever anything risky happens at Hogwarts, even though it is much safer than being magical without supervision. And muggleborns always try to change things to be 'safer'. Don't they know that accidentally blood-bonding to your childhood neighbor so that you are fated to be together is just good magic? I mean, better than accidentally wandering into a toadstool circle and spending the rest of your life with the fae.

​

Most stories that want to do some sort of Muggle/Wizard culture clash latch onto 'they are behind the times' and 'most noble house of black' and go super-antiquated blood-nobility. I want something different. Where the cultures are different because owning a cat means you have a not-insignificant chance of having a magical accident that results in you getting eaten by said cat.


** I read a story a decade or so ago (and sadly thus stand no chance of finding it, or even remembering if the rest of it were good) where Harry left the British Islands and went somewhere else, and the school there was a bit like this. One fo the classmates wasn't fully visible because of some family curse, one was a vampire who had been turned in childhood, two of the classmates had accidentally gotten unbreakably married to each other as children.

It is a take on magic that I wish was more common. It isn't something they /do/, it is something they /are/. It would also nicely subvert the 'bring electric lights and email to this place!" when the laptop becomes a prison you have to fight your way out of or something.

*** It is better if the technology doesn't pose a real threat and would be a major improvement but the fundamental culture difference poisons the messenger.

Muggle parents might know some good new techniques for safety and supervision, but they always go bonkers when they realize exactly how much danger there is, and so are ignored. Muggleborns might have a point that modern electronics will change everything, but these are the same naive fools who are easily tricked into magical contracts and don't have the common sense to run screaming in the other direction when someone mentions the word "summon demons".

Basically, I think you can get a lot more complicated/grey culture clash than the current portrayals, which are basically 'wizards are outdated'. I have never really been able to take seriously fics that try to elevate wizarding culture above muggle culture because usually it isn't different, just super outdated'. No, feudal lords are not better than a pluralistic, representative democracy.

But this has the potential of having them be so radically different that the cultures not lining up may make sense...

** A bit hard to do a neglect/abuse story where literally all the students are broken in some way shape or form, but I could definitely do a story where a lot of them are. I once read about fairies tricking humans into marrying them or straight up kidnapping them and I always wanted to make a story where Harry got tricked into marrying some fairy. I do remember reading a fic that had Neville literally killed from his family's abuse and changes were made in the school where all the students were forced into medical check ups so nothing like Neville's abuse would ever go on again under their noses. I've also read many fics that had Severus acting like parent or protective guardian over many of his Slytherins as he suffered abuse as a child, found cases of abuse in other students, and refused to put up with it.
