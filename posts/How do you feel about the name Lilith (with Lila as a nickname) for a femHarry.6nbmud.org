** Thought you were settled on Iris.

Lilith isn't bad for distinctiveness from other fem-Harrys, but the Biblical reference makes it seem like she's the witch of all witches, or a goth-girl attempt at such. Lila is good, though using it a nickname for something frumpy or otherwise unwanted might work better.

Or you could go with Daisy.

*** I changed my mind :P

The demon stuff won't really have anything to do with her though. Petunia associates it with that which leads to Lilith preferring Lila in her early years at Hogwarts.

And I'm not quite sure what you mean with:

***** So it would be better if used that way? Because the closest thing that I have that comes to that is the fact Petunia only used Lila out of fear for the name Lilith, and that kinda made Lila not like Lilith in her early years since negative connotations were associated with it.

****** It's a bit of backstory that might never be told, unless the scene revealing it was useful in further defining her character or relationship. Is it needed? Is it funny? Otherwise it's superfluous and readers will wonder why you wasted two paragraphs on it.

Just call her Lila because it makes sense to you. If I ever write a next-gen fic, Lily Luna Potter is going to be called Lilu [pronounced Lee-Loo]. Multipass!

*** I have Daisy in mind for one fic, but it's more so I can turn it into Daphne, a name I actually like. Her (ir)rational hatred of Petunia and the internalization that flowers are for weak little girls means her usual reaction to her birth name is "I'm not a fucking flower".

** Lilith sounds good, tho it does have some poor rep in the bible, but considering how catholics view magic, Lilith could have easily been some bigshot witch back in Mesopotamia or wherever.

Lila kind of sounds like a cringy childhood nickname that would make a teenager pout. Although it might sound better to native english speakers. Lils seems more natural for nickname

You know, this is a really good point. A lot of "demons" could have just been witches or wizards.

***** James was a pureblood who probably wouldn't even know the demon unless Lily told him, and I doubt Lily was a catholic. I mean, the magical world can kinda crush a lot of people's belief in that sorta thing. What's turning water into wine when you can multiply any wine or food?

It's not like she'd face any prejudice for her name in the magical world. I know a Lilith in real life and she's rarely ever had people say something rude to her because of it. Some people have brought up the demon but no one has really said she was evil because of her name. I mean, naming your kid Adam and Eve doesn't mean anything.

***** In my headcanon the wizarding world doesn't know much about Christianity, despite adopting secular aspects of certain holidays like Christmas. That's why the Yule ball is called the Yule Ball and not the Winter or Christmas Ball. So James and others from the wizarding world wouldn't associate the name Lilith with a demon.

****** Given the fact that the Christmas holidays in the books are called just that I wouldn't be so sure. Heck the whole bit about thou shall not suffer a witch to live but must have had a big impact on the wizarding world. Then there is the whole Sirius is Harry's godfather angle. Being named a godfather happens at a christening.

******* That's why I said they only adapted secular aspects of certain Christian holidays. So muggleborns coming in would call it Christmas and nothing else, because they're little kids obsessed with the holiday that gets them presents. Who doesn't like presents? That idea spreads. But certain traditions, such as Yule, stick around.

The whole thou shalt not suffer a witch to live thing would I think make them anti-Christian, so they wouldn't care about using a name a religious muggle might not like. If that's the case, then only adapting secular aspects of holidays still makes sense because it leaves the whole religious aspect behind.

And not everyone gets a godfather or godmother at a christening. They can be secular too nowadays and not meant to help religiously guide the child.

But anyway, this is getting away from the original question the thread starter asked. It seems like some like the name and others have strong religious connotations with it that would keep them from liking it.

** I think that fem!Harry would probably have a normal British name. I mean, James and Lilly named their son "Harry," not "Lucifer" or "Prospero" or "Nightshade" or anything crazy or exotic like that.

I think we're looking at this from a meta perspective, so we're trying to think of epic sounding names befitting of The Choosen Oneâ„¢, but James and Lily hadn't read the books --- they didn't know that their child was the protagonist. As far as they were concerned, their child was just a normal kid, and most normal kids have normal names. Of course, what's normal in the wizarding world isn't exactly normal for us, but Lily /was/ a muggleborn.

I know we all want Fem!Harry to have a badass magical name befitting her status as a prophesied hero, but I think it's much more in character for James and Lily to name her something boring, ordinary and British, like Sarah or Alice. Iris and Lilith are the sort of names you'd give a DnD character, not your own child.

**** I'm not saying Iris isn't a beautiful name, but it's just not the sort of thing British parents were naming their kids in the 1980's. It's [[https://www.behindthename.com/name/iris/top/england-wales][very modern]].

And I unfortunately can't think of Liliana without associating it with [[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=235597][MTG]].

But honestly, I've never stopped reading a fanfiction just because I didn't like a characters name, so this really isn't that big a deal. Fanfiction writers should just choose whatever they like best.

However, if we were to ask JK Rowling what Lilly and James would name their daughter, I highly doubt the answer would be Iris, Lilith or Liliana.
