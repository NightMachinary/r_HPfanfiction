So, I've recently bought my third tiny houseplant in a month (which is not good considering the size of my living space), and I just remembered how much I like the little green things when I'm not accidentally drowning them.

That got me thinking: 'Where might I find some good plant-based fics?'

Whether the story is about a few Herbology experts exploring the depths of the amazon in search of a rare and mysterious flower, runaway wizards/witches surviving in a magical forest while they hide from Death Eaters, students finding new and innovative uses for potions ingredients, politicians trying to devise a perfect poison to assassinate their opponents, Neville searching for a way to help restore his parents' sanity, or about that wizard in Nepal who's growing /gravity-resistant trees/ of all things...I really don't care. Plants are surprisingly versatile, with loads of possible ways to influence the plot of a story, and I would like to see more of them.

The plants in the Harry Potter universe are amazing (and maybe even sentient, as implied in linkffn(Mandragora by NothingPretentious)). As far as I can tell, most of them have incredible properties that aren't /half/-explored in canon or the majority of the fics I read, and something where the main plot uses them in one way or another would be brilliant.

No preferences for pairings or story length, but please, let's stay /away/ from bashing and/or poorly-executed cliches.

Just...plants. I like plants.


** linkffn(Horrible Herbs and How to Harvest Them) unfortunately seems abandoned, but it was a good stab as one. Fun read.

  Snape swooped around the room like a giant bat, adding ingredients to some cauldrons and stirring others. Then he stopped and tapped his wand against the benchtop impatiently. "Well? What is so important that I must risk a vital brew of Animaserum by having you in the room with it?"His tongue was so dry, he didn't know how he would ever get the words out. "Heartsease, Professor." There, that wasn't so hard. He took a deep breath. Dementors were worse, surely.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
