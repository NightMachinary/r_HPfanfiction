- participates (lol sorry!)

Whether it be strategically or in battles -either works!

Thank you!


** I'm blanking on the name of the fanfic, but I do recall one in which Harry adopts a more adult persona (including aging potion/glamors) to be a key factor to the war effort. The biggest thing I remember is the growing friendship of Dumbledore and Harry's persona, which causes Harry to start seeing Albus more like a grandfather.

​

If no-one has linked it by the time I get back from doing laundry, I'll go look for it, cause I'm tempted to re-read it after I get to the current last chapter of "Harry is a Dragon, and That's Okay." (Which, in case you're worried about reading it for some reason of other, it's actually hilarious. Below is by far one of my favorite bits of it, it's about why Astronomy is a core subject.)

#+begin_quote
  Professor Sinistra looked around. "Mr. Potter, you're curious, and I think that's admirable. So I believe I'll now tell you why I believe it is that my class is core studies, and not an elective like Muggle Studies or Divination."

  Harry sat down, doing his best to look trustworthy and admirable.

  "Professor Dumbledore likes astronomy, and we have an Astronomy Tower."

  After a long pause, Harry blinked. "That's... it?"

  "That, as you say, is it," Professor Sinistra told him. "I suspect it is the same reason why we have a Divination class, or why there are clubs for both chamber music and tenpin bowling."

*** Alright, laundry has been done for a while, but I couldn't find the fic. I'm nearly certain it's on FFN, but it might be on like SIYE or something. I'll look again in a bit.

**** I don't think it's linkffn(2954601) but it does have Harry trying to have a greater impact in the war I believe, and while I would recommend that fic, I hate suggesting unfinished, and unlikely to be finished fics. Hrm. I might have to do a what's that fic to see if anyone else can help me figure it out.

***** Okay, I feel like a major fool now, cause not only is this story on my favorites on FFN, I literally recommended it today for a different reason (Harry having Voldemort's memories) and didn't realize they were the same.

The story I wanted to recommend is Harry Potter: Dark Memories by Blueowl linkffn(3655940)

​

I only figured this out because of two reasons. 1. I made a "What's that fic" thread, and 2, I stumbled upon the author's FFN page completely by accident since I had their "Mysterious Thing, Time" fanfic open and in their bio they had the key thing I remembered from the fic in it. Wow...

There is another however in which Harry transfers the order into proper war killers which Remus thoroughly opposed but I can't remember it

** I'm reading Defiance right now, and its bloody great.

There is lots going on, but Dumbledore and Harry are both a bit more BAFM-ery and Harry gets some crazy training from some people (I won't ruin the story, but its really good) before taking the fight to the death eaters.

  Horcuxes were the pits. Dark Lords with prejudicial god complexes were worse. Ones that abducted and experimented on every magical variant they could get their hands on to 'enhance' power were enough to make Harry outright murderous.
