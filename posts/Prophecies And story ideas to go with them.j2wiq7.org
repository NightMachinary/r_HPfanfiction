So! I had an interesting idea, why not make prophecies and writing prompts? Here is mine!

While living through the post-war years, either good or bad, Harry suddenly feels the weight of fate pressing down on his shoulders once more... (Literally, in the plot bunny I thought of)

*/"Born as the seventh month died with power unknown that defeated the Dark Lord, seven times severed and seven times defied... He will be whisked away, forced to take a burden discarded and he will face his equal once more, a Master of Death and a Deathless Master... but they share a power the other knows not and one must die at the hands of the other, for neither can live while the other survives..."/*

From here, Harry is whisked away to another world, with some actual time to prepare, to do someone else's job as the boy/girl/twins/etc-who-lived-and/or-died. Facing Voldemort once again, I know its been done before, but it's a classic. And because it's an alternate universe you can have fun with it, people can be alive, genders switched, OC's etc... And wither Harry gets sent back or not is entirely up to you!
