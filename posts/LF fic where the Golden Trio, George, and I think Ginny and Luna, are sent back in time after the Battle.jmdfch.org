:END:
The aforementioned are attacked the morning after the Battle of Hogwarts by Death Eater remnants. The Trio (and Ginny and Luna, unless I'm not remembering right) all wake up in their rooms, about a month or two before they go to Hogwarts (a year before for Ginny and Luna). Some time later, George is also sent back, having rushed to their aid and been attacked himself. He has to give Fred his memories of the War to reestablish their twin bond.

  How do you heal them faster? Get sent back in time and correct things. Some chars are OOC.
