I want to read a fic where harry is still young when he teaches like just after graduating or even while in school

This feature a Harry who time traveled from the Final Battle. In fifth year he teaches everyone and not just the DA. He was also invited to sit on the head table with the examiners and teachers during the end of year exams. He was also present to encourage his students during the practical portion of OWL's.

** I recall one where he gets picked during his Sixth year, no time travel involved.

Harry thought Dumbledore was high when he made that decision. So did McGonagall. There is slight blackmail involved: it's Harry or Umbridge.

It's been a while since I read this particular fic but I remember Harry becomes the DADA professor as well taking a leadership role against Voldemort, as the summary says. *chuckles* I should probably re-read it at some point myself.
