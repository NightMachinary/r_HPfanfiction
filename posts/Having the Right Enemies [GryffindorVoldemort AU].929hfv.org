First in a planned series of oneshots (and moreshots) in a universe where Tom Riddle was sorted into Gryffindor and, well, still turned dark, and still started a war, but built a /very/ different support base.

*** To an extent, but there will be more divergences from canon than in All Roads Lead to Rome. For example, Riddle won't be making any horcruxes (he's gotten over his fear of death and, though he'd still like to live for a long time, does not like the risks that come with horcruxes, which he knows about in the first place because he isn't so blindly terrified of death as to make a horcrux practically as soon as he learns about them).

  In the end, it didn't really matter what road he took. Tom Riddle's destiny was, is and will always be in the form of Lord Voldemort.
