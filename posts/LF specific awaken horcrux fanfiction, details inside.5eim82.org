The premises were incredibly similar to "harry potter and the accidental horcrux", voldemort horcrux wakes up and befriend a harry who ends up in slytherin, with sometimes possession and the likes.

But I remember specific differences where Tom and Harry realize that Tom is basically merging with harry and he needs to avoid strong emotions from bleeding between a "barrier" to avoid it.

Last time I read it it was at the end of second year, where harry snaps for a reason I can't remember and he had also merged with diary tom.

It's a bit muddy as far as description goes, but u can't remember much more than that other than he had befriended hermione, Theo and Draco, and had spent at least a night if not more at the Malfoy household.
