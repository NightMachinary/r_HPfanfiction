:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I think it's a Harmony fic. I remember Hermione uses (or threaten's to use) a stinging(?) hex. Another character (IIRC her Mother?) points out that it's a violent act equivalent to hitting someone and she denies it. When she thinks about it later she talks to (again IIRC) Harry, and he basically says that it /is/ a form of violence. He tells her that the reason that she doesn't think of them as being the same is the lack of physical effort and sensory feedback.

When you hit someone either a slap or punch you actually feel the hit yourself. If you hit too hard you can actually feel a sting. There's even the risk of bruising your knuckles by punching someone. If your act of violence is the mere flick of wand then there is no effort or consequence to yourself. Therefore you don't think of a casual hex as an actual assault even though it actually is.

I hope this jogs someone's memory it's the only thing I remember from the fic, but I thought it was an interesting discussion point and I would like to see if I can find it again.

*** Thank you very much /randomizerbunny/. This is the exact fic I was asking about. I love this subreddit it seems like there's always someone who knows and is willing to help. I wish the teen wolf fanfic subreddit was as active/helpful as this one.

** There is a super interesting concept. There are similar issues with dealing with conflict over text/social media because one does not see the emotional reaction/hurt caused by one's words; they are much less likely to be empathetic.

*** That's true. It's easy to be a bit callous about people you'll never meet in real life even if you don't think of it as being insensitive or mean. I'll also say that in the fic I'm currently reading (Harry Potter and the Marauders of the Mind) Draco is constantly being silenced because he's annoying. Every time it happens I have to stop myself from thinking of it as this metaphor for real world displatforming of political figures. I have to remind myself that "not /Everyone is Jesus in Purgatory/".

*** There's two ways to put it, though. Equally you could say that people are more honest and direct over text, whereas in person they are more two-faced.

** I like the sound of the fic.

I might do something on it on this little one-shot I'm writing.

** Hermione actually refused to arbitrarily use a minor hex on someone in class, for this very reason, in Methods of Rationality. Professor Quirrell marked her down for it.

(Not that she was a total pacifist or anything, but she wasn't going to be violent for no reason beyond the fact that an authority figure said so.)

** I like this idea, but I don't think a stinging hex can possibly be comparable to a punch.

A real punch doesn't just hurt. People that get punched hard are not going to be standing up. Punches don't just sting, a hard blow injures the whole body.

Boxers and competitive martial artists resist punches by their movement and they constrain each other by that they could attack and what we see in their bouts is not comparable to the damage that an unresisted punch inflicts.

So punches, in a way, are a whole lot of violence.

*** A stinging hex is comparable to a slap. Which is an act with recoil on the hand and usually meant to humiliate.

Still pretty bad in my opinion.

**** Yes! Stinging hexes could be /vicious/ if used in a barrage or if they hit the face a few times, people need to think about this.
