Looking for the fics you could read over and over and over but would never advertise your love for. Everything from SSHP to the 11 year old genius, master of every magical art, Lord Hadrian Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Peverell-Potter-Ravenclaw-Slytherin to prostitute!Harry. Nothing is off limits.


** Smut. I like to read anything that has sex, no matter what it is. From BDSM, to Incest, to Bestiality.

*** Random but highly personal question (which you can definitely ignore) - does it replace porn usage for you? Or is it smut with plot and you enjoy the psychological plot aspect?

**** I switched to my alt account so I could answer in a highly personal way üòÅ. For me at least, I do prefer smut to porn. Porn always seems over-acted, and if I don't like how a character looks or think they're unattractive, there's not much I can do about it. With smut I gravitate towards stories with characters I already know I find attractive, or if it's an OC or a crossover with a fandom I'm not familiar with, I can imagine the character as looking however I want. It's a lot easier to imagine a character as dark-haired (for example) when it was only mentioned that they are blond[e] in one sentence than it is while looking at their blond[e] head during the entire scene.

Aesthetics aside, another thing I like is that in smut you are told how the characters feel and have to imagine what they look like. In porn you can see what the characters look like but have to imagine what they're feeling. For me personally, descriptions of feelings turn me on faster and more easily than images of bodies.

Also, I find it a lot easier to find stories that cater to my specific kinks than porn vids. Maybe it's just me being bad at finding good sites, but a lot of the more niche porn sites are shady af. Tangentially related, I find it somewhat difficult to ignore the distinction between the character and the actor. I find myself wondering if she's really enjoying herself or if he's been oiled up before the camera started. It really takes me out of a scene. With smut, not so much. I could see how it might throw some people off if the characters are extremely OOC, but it doesn't actually bother me very much. I'm happy to shuffle and readjust my expectation of characters as long as they are consistent within the universe of the story.

And there is so much you can do with smut that is infeasible, immoral, or illegal to do in porn. Like wing-fics. There's no way a porn producer is going to fork over the massive amount of cash required to make that anything more than terrible. Or the massive amount of cash required to make anything magical look anything more than terrible, for that matter. Or the afore-mentioned bestiality (I've read my share of animagus-sex and werewolf-sex stories, but bestiality porn? Considerably less interested).

Anyway, tl;dr: yes, I do prefer smut to porn.

****** One or more characters have wings, and much ado is made about grooming them, molting, possibly hiding them, etc. I've seen it a lot more in other fandoms than in HP, but it sometimes shows up in Draco-is-secretly-veela fics.

** My therapist grumbles about it but when I'm not doing so well I ending up seeking a specific type of fic:

Any fic where Snape is actually as horrible as he is in Canon?

And the main character eventually gains his careful, caring approval?

That's my crack.

Makes me think lots about why I consume fanfic. Is it because I'm vicariously resolving patterns in my life? Is it to validate something? Why do I like doing this to myself? Is it a type of psychological self antagonising?

When I'm content and in a good space I reckon Snape can eat glass as far as I'm concerned. So there you go. Anyone else's fic consumption patterns on their mood heavily?

*** Sometimes I just need to read a certain kind of fic. At the moment I'm lusting after a long TMRHP fic in an alternate universe where Voldemort wins. The Train to Nowhere and Consuming Shadows are the exact fics I'm wanting to read but I can't find any and both TTTN and CS are WIPs. I'm suffering.

Still, I know what I read is influenced by my mood a lot too. Maybe I'm projecting some deep dark desire? Who knows.

** Caring mentor/guardian Snape. In canon he was a bitter, friendless man who bullied the children under his care, allegedly to keep his cover as a spy. (What cover? Dumbledore declared it in open trial!). I like to see what he could have been, if he had not turned his self-hatred outward.

My absolute favorites are Harry's New Home by kbinnz linkffn(4437151) and the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/14893][Redefining Life series]] by OliverSnape - direct link to ao3 or linkffn(5878880)
