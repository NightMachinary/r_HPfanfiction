In philosopher's stone Scabbers goes out of his way to bite Goyle and prevent him from taking Ron's chocolate frog. And he ends up being thrown into a window because of it.

What if this is expanded on where because of spending a decade with the Weasleys he's grown to love them? A fiercely protective Peter who knows he did wrong but tries to redeem himself by taking care of a young Ron and Harry could be interesting.


** But also at the same tkme, really confusing and difficult. Firstly, I don't think Harry is going to look the other way when he finds the person who basically just killed his parents. Furthermore, if we're going by it following a canon storyline somehway, then he'd want to be free of the Dursleys. So, he'd probably do his best to take Pettigrew out, so Black can be released, with him taking custody afterwards.

*** Idk, I can see it. A Peter who genuinely seeks redemption. Assuming he betrayed the Potters to save his own life and not because he actually supported Voldemort, I can theoretically see him having some immense growth of character with the result of him willingly turning himself in during the confrontation with Sirius and Remus in third year. Or perhaps even later when he is caring for a powerless Voldemort. Basically, what if Peter grew a spine during his time as a pet. It would be very interesting how Remus and Sirius would deal with a remorseful Peter. Would they argue for him to be kissed/executed or for leniency and life in Askaban?

**** Yeah. What's wrong with being cowardly? I'm going to be honest here, but if a super evil terrorist captured me, held a gun to my head and said that I could either sell out my friends or die, my friends are going to die.

People who say otherwise are either noble, foolishly brave or lying.

***** Yeah, dude, same, but this is a story. They don't have to be realistic in every way.

****** Yeah. But why does everyone else have at least some depth in their character except him? Sounds like JK Rowling is trying to tell us that you must always give up you lives for your friends or your a bad person.

** Lionhearted!AU on AO3 is an incomplete one but that's the title. It's starting in the Marauders Era, so no Ron yet, but it's a good one imo. Peter doesn't make it to Ron either, but he doesn't give the Potters up.
