Hello! I've been searching for this one for a while now, and figured if anyone would be able to track the thing down, it'd be this community.

The fic starts off with some sort of scandal happening either before or during the start of the school year, which results in the Griffindor house 'exiling' Harry from the house until he comes back in line with what the consider okay, using some very old school ruling that lets them vote him out and effectively make him houseless. This backfires horribly on them when Harry decides to take up an act of insanity, as he can still lose Griffindor house points but not gain them.

Several other people, inclusing Neville and Luna, join him in exile on purpose later on, and they even manage to get Draco in on it at some point further down the line. One of the bigger gags is pulling stunts in Snape's classroom, like turning it into a dance club. I don't remember there being any pairings.

If anyone could figure out what this was, I'd be appreciative. Thanks!
