** ''Kill, me please'' They begged, ''End my suffering now'' They also begged. But no.

A small chuckle eventually evolved into a full hysterical laugh from Harry.

''I'm tickling them to death, because crucio is overrated.''

** It's not exactly the tickling charm, but there's a lot of tickling. It's an old one and you may already have read it : Harry and his little army of psychos, linkffn(4951074)

** There was one fic where Harry gets in a duel with Draco and basically tortures him publicly with low level curses and charms. Ex: breaks his ribs and feet with a bludgeoning hex then gets him with the dancing hex and the tickling charm after silencing him so he can't concede.
