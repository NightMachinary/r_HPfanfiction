I know there's a bunch of posts out there about pet peeves and such. But I'm talking about little details that most likely don't have anything to do with a plot that just irk you. I'm not talking mpreg or slash or Harmony or anything big like that. Just really small, insignificant things. My list is as follows:

- Any character (usually Harry) that doesn't normally have long hair...having long hair. I'll try to ignore it, but sometimes you just can't unimagine the descriptions. Especially when ponytails are involved.

- Any character wearing flip-flops. I'm sorry, I don't know what it is. I just hate flip-flops. Especially in the Wizarding world. And especially on men.

- Any sentences that go a little something like this:

*Harry took off his shirt. "Wow," she thought to herself. "Quidditch really seemed to do him good."*

No. Sitting on a broom all day does not a six pack make.

*I looked down at his lips and suddenly had the urge to kiss him. "Wait, what?" she thought. "Where did that come from?"*

Okay, like has that actually ever happened to someone? I don't know about you guys, but it doesn't just suddenly come as a surprise to me when I find someone attractive. And I don't spend five paragraphs arguing about it in my head either, but alas.

*She took a moment to examine herself in the mirror*

And then comes the page long description of every minute detail about the character's appearance. In a now conditioned response, I cringe slightly whenever a character stands in front of a mirror.

*She rarely ever used any make-up. Just a few dabs here and there to accentuate her natural beauty.*

Please, enough with the naturally beautiful characters.

I could go on and on, but I'll refrain. If anyone else has any weird and random dislikes like long hair and flip-flops please do share!


** I can't stand it when writers don't know when to use /parseltongue/ and when /parselmouth./ E.g. "Ron was horrified to discover that Harry was a parseltongue." He can't be a /parseltongue/, it's a language, for god's sake! I know it's only a detail most won't be bothered by, but uuurrrgghhh...

I also really dislike Harry having long hair. Grow it out a bit - no problem - but hair that reaches the small of his back? No thanks.

Harry the body builder. He doesn't need to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger to fight Voldemort, and I refuse to read fics where Harry wakes up one morning and decides that the road to victory is paved with bench presses and jumping jacks.

When authors write a (in most cases Gryffindor) Harry who is unable to tell a lie, and when he tries always blushes or looks down guiltily. They make it seem as if only Slytherins were able to tell a lie with a straight face, which is just ridiculous.

*** Get a thesaurus but don't overdo it. I've seen plenty of that too, where they get to obscure, or the synonym they selected doesn't mean quite what they want. Synonyms are similar, not always exactly the same.

As for the external sex organs (technical term) being referred to as 'their sex', it's kind of an older thing, big in many romance novels from the 80's.\\
In my mind it follows a logical progression: the external sex organs are what is used when 'sexing' what sex a person or animal is, so 'their sex' is the identifying feature for male/female/intersexed. Of course, that doesn't make it any less clunky. (And for clarity, sex is 'the plumbing', it's the biological makeup, what the DNA says.)\\

*** Calling a genital someone's "sex" isn't, as far as I know, correct, and as such shouldn't be used in the narrative. But dialogue? Sure, go ahead. If all your characters speak perfect Oxford dictionary English, its going to be a very bad story.

And on that note, any aspiring writers reading this, DO NOT use a thesaurus. I'm sorry if this sounds mean, but I feel it is justified - if you do not already have the vocabulary required to write a varied dialogue, you have no fucking business writing fiction either way.

And I say this as a non native English speaker. Almost all the time usage of a thesaurus shows easily, leading to stilted poor writing.

/Stephen King: "Any word that you have to hunt for in a thesaurus is the wrong word. There are no exceptions to this rule."/

That quote is one any fiction writer should live by. There is no need to use fancy unwieldy and unnatural words in the narration, and neither in the dialogue.

If you are writing someone far more intelligent and eloquent than you and need to look up big words, you are already on the wrong path, and I'd recommend changing the setting to something you are capable of writing, or stopping writing altogether.

In the context of Harry Potter fanfiction, the only time I would condone use of a thesaurus is if you /have/ to write some sort of academical text, or a historical one. My previous point about writing something you have no experience with still stands, however, and it would be better to just avoid the text altogether, like Rowling does, for the most part.

When I think of a biscuit I think of something a bit different than a US cookie. To me, biscuits are flatter and usually sold in a tin/roll, and more uniform-looking.

It's not just a matter of find-and-replace, it still sounds weird for Hermione to be told that Hermione's munching on a chocolate chip biscuit.

Oreo cookies qualify as UK biscuits. But (to me at least) lumpy homemade oatmeal raisin cookies and chunky chocolate chip cookies with nuggets of chocolate sticking out the top aren't really biscuits.

I have a huge soft spot for chocolate chip cookies, and I used to buy this [[https://geodip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/foxs-chunkie-choc-chip-e1410834651936.jpg][brand]] (with this packaging) a bit too frequently when I lived in the UK.

The lack of dedicated ranged weaponry in the hp 'verse has always been a serious point of contention for me. I mean this is a society that has discovered limited means of traveling through fucking time. How hard would it be for a dark wizard to come up with a laser gun or a gravity manipulator? Hell, those fightin' statues could take out entire magical settlements with minimal effort if you gave them machine guns, flame throwers and grenade launchers rather than swords, pikes and shields. Give them gravity weapons, effector fields, charged particle cannons and kiloton-range Antimatter rocket pods? Bye bye big bad... and an appreciable fraction of Scottish countryside.

** As of lately, aside from lack of proper paragraph formation and grammar, or obvious signs of a beginner (those are hard for me to read because it reminds me of how I used to write when I was 14 . So much embarrassment.) it's indications and hints of character bashing and certain fic trends.

"Betrayal of Ron and Hermione/All his friends/The Weasleys"- Honestly these kind of fanfics have gotten SO overdone and are often done so poorly and wangsty that I can't take them seriously. Also for sentimental reasons I just hate seeing the breaking up of the trio and Harry being alone and betrayed.

"Evil dumbledore/Dumbledore can't be trusted!" Finding a good "Manipulative!Dumbledore" fic feels like finding a needle in a haystack sometimes. Until I discovered "It's My Life" I was almost ready to write off those kind of fics forever.

I just gave up on an interesting crossover because of the anti-Ron bullshit.

Well, you probably /would/ amass a healthy physique playing quidditch. Probably won't gain large, rippling muscles or anything like that, but I'd imagine riding a broomstick would be a lot like riding a horse. Believe me, after a day spent maneuvering one of those your thighs and abdomen are /so/ /sore/. On a broomstick you would be twisting your torso this way and that, working that particular area on your body (and gripping the broomstick with your thighs, etc.).

Sorry for the paragraph, I just never compared broomstick riding to horseback riding until now. I like it!

Also, though I find this figure of speech ridiculously cool, I'm always rather disgusted with how ugly it is whenever I actually see it used:

**** That doesn't make it any less confusing. Take this example that I found a few months ago ([[https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/05/14/concerning-sexual-preferences/][source]]):

#+begin_quote
  My friend Molly Ren wrote an essay about their experiences being attracted to fat men. They are extremely attracted to fat guys; however, they had a hard time admitting it to themself, because of their internalized fatphobia. They were used to thinking of fat people as unattractive, and that made it hard for them to recognize their own attraction to a fat person. They sort of subconsciously shut it down.
#+end_quote

Two items are being discussed here--a single person and a group of people. If the /plural/ pronoun "they" is used to describe the /singular/ "Molly" rather than the /plural/ "fat people", the reader must figure out on his own whether *each f**king instance* of "they" refers to "Molly" or "fat people".

I really don't understand how anyone can support such an absolutely disgusting practice as using "they" as a singular pronoun, when "it" (or "ze", if you're picky) is perfectly serviceable as a gender-neutral pronoun.

***** "It" has the implication of inanimacy, it's never used in English to refer to people except when being intentionally insulting. "They", on the other hand, is commonly used as a singular pronoun.

******* As much sense as it makes to me to refer to, for instance, an infant of indeterminate gender as an "it", the language has simply moved on. Just like some other early 1900's expressions that are no longer acceptable in polite society, you can't use "it" in modern times to refer to a living person without the usage being taken as an insult.

"Ze" is better known as a bad french accent than as an alternative to a gendered pronoun, and "his or her" is much too clunky. It makes sense to see indeterminate gender as plural since it encompasses multiple possibilities.

***** You cherrypicked an example that's actually confusing, and you know that there are plenty of samples where it's used unambiguously (like the example you gave in your post: "Anyone who uses the Killing Curse will damage their soul"). Even then, ambiguity is a problem not just for "they" but for all pronouns except the first person, or do you also have a problem with the usage of "you" because it's not always immediately clear if it's referring to one or many people? Do you propose that we ban the use of she because some writers are too inept to clarify exactly which female character is the current subject of the narrative? Otherwise you're being hypocritical.

Honestly opposition to the singular "they" is just pedantic. It's been in use for *six centuries*. It's not even the first instance of a pronoun that's both singular and plural (see "you", above). You may find it disgusting but sorry, no single person gatekeeps language.
