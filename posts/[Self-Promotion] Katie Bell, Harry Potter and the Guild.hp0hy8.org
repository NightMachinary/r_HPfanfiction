A few months ago, there was a Prompt thread for [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/f50myv/katie_the_cultist/][Katie the Cultist]]. I liked the idea, modified it a bit to suit the story, and basically went all out on it.

A lot of people really liked it, and asked that I post it on Archive Of Our Own.

Given that I have gotten to a decent spot on the long-fic I was working on, I decided to finally refine "Katie the Cultist" and upload it.

Thus, we have "Katie Bell, Harry Potter and the Guild."

Summary: Harry Potter discovers that Katie Bell is part of a secret society called the Guild, whose purpose is to fight strange sources of dark magic the likes of which he has never seen before.

I fully acknowledge that this is a crack!fic, but I had fun writing it, and will be posting updates on it periodically. I wanted to let you guys know.
