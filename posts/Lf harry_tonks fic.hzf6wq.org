:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a harry/tonks fic. I remember that Godric Gryffindor's ghost(I think it was him) is helping harry get ready to fight Voldemort and tonks mentions at one point that part of her metamorphomagus power is when she touches someone she see what form they would find most attractive but when she touches harry she see herself just as she is right then not matter what changes shes made.


** Is it the one where Godric is a major perv and makes tons of sexual innuendos

*** You're thinking of HP and the Sword of Gryffindor by cloneserpents, but I don't think that's the one the OP meant, since that story is pretty much Harry/Hermione.

*** Possibly. It's been a good long while since I read it. I think it takes place after sirius dies but it could be before I think harry had an inner circle with remus mcgonagall tonks and godric and wasnt going to school that year. Hermione ended up running the defense club I think

This is from *Scion of Gryffindor,* by Crys.

Bonus:\\
Another fic that has little different take on the "How Harry 'sees' her / Tonks' base form" idea is: *The Green in the Grey*, by TheBlack'sResurgence. Linkffn(12886674)

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF
