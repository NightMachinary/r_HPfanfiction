1. Are there any good! or ally! Petunia fics set during Hogwarts years of Harry without portraying Dumbledore as the enemy? It seems that somehow, good Petunia cannot coexist in fandom imaginations with a well-meaning Albus.

2. Are there fics about a Muggle teacher hired to Hogwarts to teach a non-magical subject?

3. Ron / Fleur -- absent ship?

*** Is /Baker Street/ the one with Snape as both Harry and Dudley's biological father? Because I noped out of that fic so quickly, and I'd rather not return to it.

**** It is. Although unlike pretty much every other story, the discovery that Snape is their father doesn't change that Harry and Dudley loathe him, and Snape doesn't change his attitude either.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

  Everybody comments on Harry Potter's eyes. Why? It's not because they look like his mother's. Super Harry, Good Dumbledore. AU. Rated for violence, swearing,etc.

** Not sure about the first one, because there probably are a few, but I've never bothered with those. To me, Petunia (like Snape) is an absolutely despicable bitch, and it's only because canon HP is a eunuch that he still tolerates their shit all the way up to book 7. Anyone else would have killed all three of them long ago, and turned psycho or some such.

Why would non-magical stuff be taught in a school for magic? You don't see the arts being taught in a school for engineering, or the reverse.

As for the third, well, there are some smut oneshots and regular oneshots. Reason why nobody bothered with that pairing is probably because it really is too much to imagine, lel.

That doesn't explain all the Death Eater ships.
