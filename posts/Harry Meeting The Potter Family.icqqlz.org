Hullo peoples. I was just wondering if there were any fics out there, with at least decent writing, that have Harry going back in time for whatever plot reason and meeting those in the Potter Family that are still alive. Thanks for the help!


** linkffn(Wind Shear by Chilord)

An interesting twist on the time travel trope, Harry ends up back in time and takes a stand against the Voldemort's Knights of Walpurgis/Death Eaters, which deviates the past (and present) from canon. He meets the older generations of Potters first, and they never really know who he is, but it's super good. I've read it a few times. It also presents an interesting view of Bellatrix and the Black sisters (and the Blacks as a whole).

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

*** I actually just finished reading that today! I was a little bummed out that it ended so abruptly and that there was no sequel or larger epilogue, but oh well. Thanks for the recommendation anyways.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** Potter family as in James and Lily, or James's parents? The first is in many time-travel Marauder stories (e.g., linkffn(The Winds of Time by ausland)), the latter I don't know about.

*** Thanks for the recommendation! Yeah I was thinking more of Harry going back, whether it was his parents or their parents or just Potter/Evans family at some point in the past, but thanks anyway.
