Any fanfics where Snape's suspicions come true and Harry is actually a lot like his father, arrogant and an attention seeker?


** Isn't he like that a bit in linkffn(3384712). I guess technically in this story he is an amalgamation of Harry and James. Idk... its sort of confusing but a good story. One of my favorites.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** From what I remember, in C'est La Vie Harry is arrogant and rude and mostly lives up to canon Snape's expectations.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Dark times lie ahead for the Wizarding world. Blood will be shed as Harry Potter sets sail in his perilous quest for revenge - by any means necessary. Non-BWL, no canon rehash, dark undertones.
