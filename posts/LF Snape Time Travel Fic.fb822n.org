:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I swear, I just saw a ffbot fanfiction response to a different reddit post. I can't remember if it was a recent Hot Post on this reddit or if I was just dreaming of browsing reddit lol.

I thought the fic's premise was interesting but now I can't find it. I would have definitely screen shotted it to save, or open it up in safari on my phone, but no trace of that.

The summary was lengthy and I remember these points:

- Young Snape trying to escape from the Marauders accidentally gets thrown into the future.

- While in the future, he's said to be a distant relative of the current potions professor (Snape, Ofc) and goes by a name like Septimus or something

- Somehow gets roped into spying for Voldemort, I believe.

- Falls pretty quickly for Hermione, and mentions that the older him is too. So both versions are falling for Hermione.

- I actually think young Snape is put into Gryffindor, if I understand correctly.

This is all stated in the summary, and I remember a commenter stating that's its “Pre-O.W.L.S. Snape”

I used some phrasing that I recall from the summary in my bullet points but it isn't all word for word from my memory. I've tried googling it, and I found one fic, but the summary isn't long like I remember and mentions none of the points above.

I'm just trying to figure out if this is an actual fic or if I just dreamt it up lmao...help?

Please lmk if you know of this fic!
