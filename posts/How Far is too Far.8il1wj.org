Do you think fanfiction authors should try to stick to the source material as best as possible, or is it fair game for any changes they wish to make? Personally, I'm of the mindset of as long as it pertains to the story and isn't too large of leap, write away.


** As a reader I give a lot of leeway. I'll go crazy for an excellent story that manages to stick to canon in even the more obscure places, but that doesn't mean I can't love a thorough and self-declaired AU like /Core Threads/, or a "mostly canon but this and that are changed" like /The Arithmancer/ or /Lady Archimedes/.

As a writer though, or at least so far, I've made it part of the game to not only stick to canon, but to repurpose a bunch of background canon details into major elements of my plot. Jimmy Kiddell or Rufus Fudge as background characters, etc.

*** For me personally as a writer, I'm always trying to keep anything canon as much as I can, unless I HAVE to make a change somewhere to make something work in my story. And if I have to make a change here or there for my story, then I'll make those changes - but I won't go overboard, I hope. So yes, I try to keep things as canon as possible, unless it's necessary for the story to change something somewhere. Also I love worldbuilding and adding on and filling in the blanks of all those places and stuff we didn't see in canon, but that isn't CHANGING STUFF, just ADDING NEW STUFF that could have been there all along for all anyone knows. :)

** Fair game as long as they're clear upfront it's going to be an alternate universe or whatnot, that's the kind of thing to stick in the description, just shove an AU- in front of it at the very least.

*** I think that it's good to have the AU tag upfront. But, at the same time, I think that changing the story too much can kind of take away from what it is, which is a Harry Potter fanfiction. I mean the ones that totally change Harry's character, even his core character traits, until he's totally unrecognizable. At that point it's not even Harry anymore!

**** Ah, that's a different problem all together, I read a quote about it once that fits, "In every first novel the hero is the author as Christ or Faust" - Oscar Wilde. Of course, it's not just first novel- some authors seem to have trouble making a character divergent from themselves- writing completely new concepts and characters is /hard/, that's part of the reason fanfiction is such a big thing- it's far easier to write with a bit of a template than without it.

But... I kind of like wish-fulfillment fics- even if I'm the first to admit they're largely, well, shit, from a literary prospective.

No fanfic author can write true Harry character (or any other one from the books). You can see it in the discussions about them: all participants select traits they like and ignore others.

Therefore it's alright to make your heroes anything you want, because everyone does it.

***** I'm not sure about that. I mean, if all your friends a smoking crack, does that make it okay to do? Obviously I'm using hyperbole to make a point but you know what I mean lol.

****** It's not about okay or not okay. It's about character. If Harry smokes crack, he smokes crack. Smoking crack is part of him. The same as magical eye and constant vigilance are parts of Moody. If an author decides to not use this trait in his or her story it means he or she omits a part of Harry's true character.

The new hero is not the true Harry anymore.

** Three things define what is canon for me:

- the characters
- the setting
- the plot

I personally prefer fics that stay true to the characters and the setting, while changing the plot significantly.

** Personally I prefer closer to canon with HP. I read for more of the characters I've come to love through the books. If there's a major character change, it has to be set up reaaally good for me to continue reading.

I also read to see more of the wizard world. If this is more the focus, it doesn't really matter since there is so much that is still unexplored!

** There are three types of fics I read:

1. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail][For Want of a Nail]] fics

2. Fics that follow canon up to a specific point (like ignoring everything in canon past, say, Goblet of Fire)

3. Fics that take place in another world (usually a crossover, but sometimes dimensional travel fits here) featuring one or more mostly canon characters

I'm not a huge fan of fics that go completely off the rails and/or don't feature Harry or his friends. I'm also not a huge fan of fics that follow canon /too/ closely.

EDIT: Wow, this post makes me sound awfully picky...

** I prefer 'what if' stories, major differences don't bother me as long as they make sense, I like AU. It's fine to stick to source material only in details and diverge from it significantly. If I wanted to read canon, I'd read it. Fanfiction is designed to be something else.

** For me I think the plot could be just about anything as long as the characters are true to their personalities from the books. After poor grammar nothing will make me drop a fic faster than characters being wildly out of character.

** I mean I only read and write canon compliant, but that's a personal preference. I can certainly understand the appeal of changing things, even very drastically. I'm sure there's a point where it may as well be original fiction, but as I don't read AU I haven't come across it.
