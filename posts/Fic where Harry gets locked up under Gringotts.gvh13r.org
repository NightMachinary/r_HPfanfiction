I remember he gets saved by a good goblin, duels Voldemort, uses a spell to heal his broken arm, and also a particularly dangerous one the does a lot of damage to Voldemort. I think Voldemort might have lost his arm?


** There is one where he is traped in a vault gets out but Drops a nuke in the deeps of Gringotts on a timer. It goes of as he is waking out of the Bank. So long Goblins. :)
