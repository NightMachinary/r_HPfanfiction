** Goodbye to the tent, to dittany, to their money, to the person who actually knew how to forage and prep food with magic, and the only one of them who knew how to plan shit.

Harry would be quite shit out of luck lol.

** Honestly, the Horcrux hunt was dumb. At any time they could have apparated to a CVS and got some soup. Invisibility cloak means they didn't even need to pay. Harry is an idiot.

**** I agree with you. The Horcruxes have potential, but they and the Hallows should never have been invented.

***** Those are a different matter. Fetch quest RPG dues ex crap going on there! I really do enjoy the stories made before Deathly Hallows/Half Blood Prince. Seemed like they all had a lot more creative story directions and Voldemort ending ideas than canon came up with.

** Harry would freeze to death except he can't die so idk ron would leave with Hermione and harry would be even more of a fucking idiot than I can think possible Hermione would have tried with ron to get the rest if the horcruxes failed and died along with ron harry would get caught and murdered

Harry potter series over the end
