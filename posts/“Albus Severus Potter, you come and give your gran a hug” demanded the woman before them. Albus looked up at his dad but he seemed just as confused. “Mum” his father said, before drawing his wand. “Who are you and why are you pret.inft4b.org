** Lily Potter smiled.

“Why I'm Lily Potter. I've actually been in hiding for 40 years,” she responded.

“Uhuh. What did Sirius get me for my first birthday?” Harry asked, obviously skeptical and trying to catch her lie.

“A toy broom. I swear it was pure luck the cat didn't die every time you got on that blasted thing!” She exclaimed. Albus looked between Harry who was dumbfounded, and supposedly his grandmother.

“Ok you win that one. Who was the secret keeper?” Harry asked after he had recovered. Lily's face fell.

“That bastard Peter. Never trust a hero worshipper,” Lily replied darkly. Harry stood there staring at her blankly.

“Uh... which magical figure did Aunt Petunia send a letter to?” He asked, knowing this one would get her.

“Dumbledore,” she responded simply.

Harry fainted. Lily looked at Harry's body sprawled across the floor. She gave a wry chuckle and turned to Albus.

“Now Albus, please help your dear old grandmother drag your father's body out of the street will you?” She asked serenely, her green eyes twinkling. Albus looked at her and Harry, then shrugged.

“Alright,” he told her as he grabbed Harry's legs.

Dumbledore faked his death and has assumed Lily Potter's identity?

... I guess it couldn't be worse than another one of those werewolf fics. I'd read it.

**** Yeah. I don't mind Severus being redeemed, but Severus turning out to be Harry's biological dad always makes me cringe.

***** While unlike the other comment I personally never found the idea of Snape getting some cringe-worthy (in fact, I actually like Snily in general), I always found the implication of Snape as biological father offputting. It usually means the fic is giving Lily a pass for being unfaithful due to James doing something stupid (but never irredeemable, since she usually goes back to him after that one time), which is just wrong, or that Lily truly loved Snape all along which makes her marriage to James... disturbing to say the least. I've only seen a fic truly lambast infidelity!Lily for this once (I don't remember the exact Severitus that did this) with the fic heavily criticizing Lily for basically using Snape for revenge sex (exploiting his feelings for her that Lily was fully aware of) just because James was neglecting her in favour of being with his friends instead of, oh I don't know, talking to him about it and try to resolve their relationship issues.

I do like Snape as a father figure or mentor, but never as the true biological father.

** "Harry Potter..." a familiar voice sheepishly whispered.

"WHAT THE- DOBBY?!?!" Harry was shocked. Albus was confused.

"Harry Potter remembers Dobby's name! This is the best day of Dobby's life!" Dobby shrunk down to the form of a house-elf in extravagant, vibrant clothes. Dobby shot Ginny a dirty look.

"HARRY POTTER IS DOBBY'S AND DOBBY'S ALONE!" He drew a knife, the one Harry thought Dobby was killed with, and he flung himself at Ginny. "PETRFICUS TOTALUS!" shouted Ginny. Albus was silent, shock ringing through his ears.

Later, Harry crouched in front of the tied up Dobby. "FILTHY BLOOD TRAITOR WEASLEY GIRL! FILTH! FLITH! FILTH!!" he cried.

"Dobby! Talk to me! How are you alive?"

"Dobby made a Horcrux out of the sock Harry Potter gave him, sir," Dobby replied, "there is a reason you have not seen Charlie Weasley." Ginny lunged at Dobby. Albus and James held her back. "DOBBY WILL KILL YOU FIRST!" roared Dobby. "Dobby went back to Godric's Hollow," he continued, "and used Lily Potter's hair to craft Polyjuice Potion to impersonate Lily Potter."\\
"How did you kill Charlie?"\\
"Dobby Apparated and used the knife Bellatrix Lestrange killed him once with."

Harry grabbed Dobby and promptly threw him out of the house.
