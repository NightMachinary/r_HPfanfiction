**** Sorry the bot didn't make it for some reason. Here is the link [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8596476/1/Starnlicht]]

I remember reading late 2013 and it was a nice change of pace and I've been looking for similar premises ever since.

Here are two Tom Riddle fics set during the second world war, one of which has more action than the other but they're both quite unique and not recommended on here often. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2948443/1/Of-Snakes-and-Foxes]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2501577/1/Riddle-s-War]]

Comment back here to let me know what you think of them if you read them, I've not seen them discussed on here!
