It was probably a time travel fic. I remmeber this scene particularly.

Nott had taken a whole day long boner potion on Christmas so he could fuck his "fucktoy Tina" all day long, but the DMLE take him away without him changing clothes.

Later his boner hurts in his cell, and just as he starts to relieve himself, when a Daily Prophet phototgrapher comes and takes a picture.

This story references Walden Macnair, instead of Nott, as the one to get arrested while still at full mast. I haven't read the story myself, so I can't vouch for anything else.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
