** For some reason, this prompt made me think of "What if Snape had been arrested, and dropped a vague, dangerous hint?

"All I'm saying is," Snape drawled in his deep timbre, "if anyone wanted to find out anything, all they'd need to do is mix Loroot and Twerry Fronds. That's all I'm saying." Snape gave Harry a VERY significant look as the aurors escorted the potion master away.

Unfortunately, neither Hermione nor the twins were nearby to tell Harry and Ron what a bad idea that was, and while they had a vision of a basilisk hunting the halls of Hogwarts, ultimately they both succumbed to Twerry Frond Fever--a malady which causes a person to most desire inflicting others with Twerry Frond Fever.

Harry always wanted to be just Harry then he goes ahead and names his Kids after dead people who have a reputation and places a burden on them. Give the kids their own damn first names, and just have James, Lily and Sirius as middle names.

**** Snape was also the cause of potters parents deaths, was an active murderer in a terrorist organisation who never stopped believing in the doctrine. Was verbally abusive towards children. All of Snapes issues was on purpose. He intends to do harm by both word and deed.

Hagrid never intented for anyone to get hurt, he believed the best of the creatures and never remember the fragility of the avarage human.

Implying that Hagrid is in any way worse than Snape is the same as implying accidentally almost harming children is worse than a murderer activly abusing children.

Snape at least tried to protect Lily who was not really Voldemort's target but could have been a collateral victim. It would make sense for him not wanting to risk his skin for his high school bully no matter how much his crush loved him and there was no point in wasting breath on Harry since he was already marked for death by a seemingly unstoppable Dark Lord.

Which is true. As the post you answered to stated and from what i have seen you yourself agreed. He was an active member of a nazi terrorist group. The only person he wanted to save was lily.

Harry surviving was an unintended coincidence. He had zero intention to save james or harry.

No. To summarize my thoughts on Snape: I don't think what he did was right nor do I think he was an amazing wonderful person. However given his condition at the time when Lily was threatened, I can understand him for not trying to save Harry or James. And anyways, if Dumbledore in his righteousness wouldn't have brought it up, no one would have caught on it. But Dumbledore was also an enemy at the time so he was obviously tormenting Snape. If Dumbledore was so great why did he ask a favor in return from Snape for protecting the Potters other than to humiliate him?

So my main question was for all those that keep saying he didn't care about James or Harry, would they have done even what he did given the circumstances? If not then Snape seems fairly reasonable. If yes then they are rightful to blame Snape as much as they like. My question was fairly simple to understand. No need to debate all this stuff. No one thinks Snape is a saint.
