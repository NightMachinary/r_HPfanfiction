Alright, am I the only one here who is so tired of the "Always" trope? Honestly, I suppose that authors who insert an "Always" in an emotional scene or as a metaphor for "I love you" feel like it's profound, or sweet, or maybe even clever, but when I read an "Always" in a fanfiction? My eyes roll so hard I'm afraid they might just roll right out of my head. I sometimes try to tell myself I've just read too much fanfiction, or maybe I'm just a salty old B, I dunno... it's just one of the more obnoxious things to me, in my own personal opinion.

Tell me I'm not the only one who is so beyond tired of "Always." 🙄

** I always felt it was misunderstood in general anyway.

I don't think it's supposed to come off as a romantic ideal from Snape in canon, as it is frequently interpreted. Snape is never portrayed as being a rational, romantic character. He is vindictive, petty and obsessive.

He is obsessed by his love for Lily Potter, even for so long after her death. It's not healthy for him, and has been portrayed as such. He's a bitter, angry man who bullies 11 year olds in his care, because he is unable to get over his obsession. It has done him no favours.

If he could only have gotten over his obsession, he would have had a chance at being happy by himself or with someone else, but he never could. He is not a romantic character, he is a tragic character.

**** Yeah Lily hadn't been friends with Snape for around 6 years its just creepy . I don't think Lily would forgiven Snape at all, she probably never even thought of him in those 6 years unless it was bad things and she would hold the same disdain for him as any other Death eater.

I wonder sometimes what some of the other muggleborn who got called mud blood by Snape thought about Lily hanging around with a racist I doubt they would think to highly of her.

***** There was one fic I read ages ago (forgot the name) where Snape genuinely only said it because of pressure from other Slytherin's and he apologised, which is great but even then I found it strange that they ended up getting married (their relationship had gone on in-story for a few years). It wasn't the main pairing but it showed up fairly often within the story.

****** Fanfiction often makes Snape a lot more palatable and redeemable than he originally was. It even makes him romantic. In reality, he was /obsessed/.

And yeah --- been there, done that. Teenage hormones are one hell of a drug. But Snape never really grew out of it and let this emotion dominate his entire life. I understand that he was traumatized and coping, and he hadn't had the easiest life, but Merlin's pants --- enough is enough sometimes.

Snape is not a good person. He is a product of his environment, and it's not all his fault, but quite a bit of it is. His actions are still heroic, and he deserves recognition, but probably not redemption for everything he did.

I have yet to see a Snape character study that would get his voice /right/ while having him as a protagonist.

I'm curious about which stories you've gone through as samples?

The Peace Not Promised really gets inside his head, albeit it's a Peggy Sue story, so it's his adult self reliving his teenage years. Still bitter, cutting, harsh, loathing himself and not being a big fan of most other people either, yet devoted to Lily's wellbeing - and able to prioritise, too, not just wanting her to himself, but wanting her to be well and happy even if that means being separated from him, much as that's not his ideal outcome. He's definitely co-dependent, yet he does very gradually become a better person as a result of being around her. (Also, it has a clever and appropriate use of "Always".)

Come Once Again and Love Me plays up his misanthropy and the emotion-suppressing effects of Occlumency, and I didn't like it as much, but it has excellent prose quality. Whether you think his distance from Lily is more or less in character is up to you, I guess.

******** Well, that's on me not looking into the character tags on FFN... It's a Snily story, isn't it? Because I'm on chapter 15 and she just happily declared her love for the man 27 years her senior. Which she knows about. Yikes.

Before I get invested any further, will the fic actually confront this fact? They acknowledge it, which is already good for PeggySue, but I just think it's way OOC for Severus to just brush something like this under the rug.

And yes, I understand that it's in-character for Lily to see the best in people, while Severus can be a selfish asshole and desperate for any positive reinforcement from her... but that's not the vibe I'm getting. I'd really like to be wrong.

********* What kind of confrontation were you looking for? They do wait until she's of age to get married, and would have waited longer except that her father passes away unexpectedly, leaving her with little left after the house is sold to pay debts - so she persuades Severus that if she's starting from nothing, she'd rather do it together than alone. And apart from just after their wedding, their time from then until graduation is celibate, rather against Lily's wishes, because he's too aware of her being the right age to have been his student.

Their relationship is certainly not flawless; the narrative shows them run into miscommunications, personality clashes, and sometimes conflicts in what they value. And Severus is very aware of their age gap, and feels it keenly, but as you might imagine, he wants her too much to break up on that basis unless that's what /she/ wants, which it isn't. So he feels guilty about it, but doesn't walk away.

** What puzzles me the most when I see Snape utter this quote is when I read fics that pair him with someone else in postwar. Like, why would you repeat a quote as infamous at that to someone who isn't even Lily in first place? That's like if he said "yeah sure I like you but I'll always love a dead woman who I never even had a relationship with more".

And I actually like reading Snape-centric generally.

*** I can buy that it became platonic years after Lily ended their friendship but I don't buy that it's "strictly" platonic for the entirety of their time as friends.

If so why doesn't he hate Sirius more than James. Sirius was the one who sent him to the willow. James saved his life. Even in the conversation after the werewolf incident he's way more obsessed with James than Sirius (Potter and his mates, big quidditch hero, he fancies you!). In SWM, both James and Sirius were equally enthusiastic about bullying Snape so I don't buy that James bullied him more and that's why Snape's more obsessed with James.

He felt threatened that James was interested in Lily and Lily would like him back.

**** You don't need to have a strictly romantic interest in someone to be threatened by them potentially having romantic feelings for someone. It's more complicated than that. Lily was a lot more to Snape than just a close friend. For him, she was the first and only good thing in his life, the light in the darkness, the only respite he had from an abusive childhood. His feelings were a platonic idealisation of the goodness she represented to him as a child. What James represented was someone taking that away from him, taking away the only bit of goodness that Snape had ever known.

There are plenty of friendships where one friend becomes jealous and possessive once their friends start dating someone, because they're afraid that they're no longer important to that person. For someone like Snape who already was solely dependent on Lily, this would have increased ten fold, especially since James was his enemy whom he already didn't feel he could measure up against (which is why he panics about him being a Quidditch hero). He was afraid that he was losing his place in Lily's life and becoming unimportant.

** I know it was probably meant to be some hackneyed thing about a forever love and all that, but honestly, with how badly she wrote Snape as this tortured antihero, I prefer to think that Snape always has this guilt about sentencing her to death. He's responsible for her death. In his mind, James was a horrible bully who he still thinks tried to set him up to die by werewolf, and isn't as fussed - but Lily was a good friend that he had loved, and he essentially was responsible for her and her husband dying. So yeah, he's still 100% motived by Lily and always will be - because it's his fault her son needs protection.

** I think it's always worth pointing out that James and Lily must have married as teenagers during a war and died around age 21. Snape would have been around that age too. Sirius got thrown in Azkaban and was probably a bit nuts after the constant torture. Remus was basically not wanted in wizarding society and lost his two rich friends who supported him.

Basically Snape had an opportunity to grow up that many others did not.

He was basically free of Voldemort and legal consequences for what he did.

He didn't take his chance to do much to benefit anyone at all until the end of Harry's fourth year when he goes back to being a spy.

** Always is sweet, sure, but it's Severus's thing for Lily. I'm not a Snape-hater, no, but I don't think of the guy as an angel. He was an arsehole that needed therapy, but I digress. Authors should find another phrase for their relationships. James's phrase for Lily was "until the very end", which is cute, too. I once read a fic where "Ride or die" was the phrase for Tom and Harry. I won't get into that, either, since my shipping choices are often picked apart in fandom. But, well, that's a cute phrase, too. Since Tom was emotionally constipated, that phrase pretty much means "I love you" for them until Tom got his head out of his arse. There are other phrases people could use. Or maybe you could make one. Phrases like that should be unique. It could be something like "Until the end of eternity" or "My love for you shines as bright as all the stars in existence" or whatnot. Find something. It should be short, sweet, and memorable. Using "always" gets a bit annoying sometimes. I don't hate it, but it's overdone.

Redemption is earned, not just by feelings but by actions, and in the books Snape didn't particularly do things to redeem himself. He died in a war that took lots of actual innocents too and he spent most of the years prior abusing children and in particular abusing a child he helped orphan.
