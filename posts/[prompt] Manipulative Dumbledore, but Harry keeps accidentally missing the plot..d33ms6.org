Imagine a Harry that, through no real intent of his own, keeps missing the events of the series, no matter how much Dumbledore, or others, try to get him involved.

He finds out there's a three headed dog guarding something on the third floor? Neat.

He notices Riddle's Diary and returns it to Lucius, thinking the man had just placed it in Ginny's things by accident, thereby preventing it from entering the castle at all.

Sirius Black is on the loose? Well, I'm sure the aurors can deal with that.

He's signed on to a tournament that may claim his life? Unfortunately he contracted a virus that requires he be isolated for three months, and can't put serious strain on his body for six months after that, meaning he can't compete at all.

And so on. I imagine it as a sort of crack fic, with Dumbledore creating more and more insane plans to get Harry involved and to fulfil his destiny, with all of them failing for one reason or another. Of course, things keep working out even with Harry not taking part.


** Harry Potter, Geek of Magic linkffn(12703694)

No manipulative Dumbledore, but Harry is quite oblivious. He thinks detention is prime 1 on 1 tutoring time and gets as much as he can.

Second year he derails the Chamber of Secrets by asking Hogwarts for a place his friends could hang out (Percy kicked Luna out of the Gryffindor common room) and finds the Chamber's back entrance. Harry goes to Dumbledore asking to use the Chamber as a clubhouse and Hermione said the Chamber may have Dark magic so could he check that out? And maybe install a lift while he's at it. The slide is fun but a pain to get out again. Dumbledore is like, "Wat?"

  Quirrell said, "Voldemort was extremely qualified. One of the greatest wizards ever, even his enemies don't contest that."

  "Was he really?" said Harry. "I know he did a lot of scary stuff, but he literally lost a fight to a baby. Can you imagine? Ask historians fifty years from now about Voldemort, and they'll say, 'Yes, British chap, very mean, lost to a baby.'"

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

  I told you that our Potions Professor is a little scary and Neville is a nervous wreck around him. I'm trying to help him prepare for the class, but it's not going very well. Harry has decided that we should get him used to Professor Snape, so, to help Neville, he's made a Professor Snape mask. It's very lifelike, and Ronald is a good mimic. I'm a little afraid of how Professor Snape will respond when he finds out about it.

  Love, Hermione

  Dear Mum and Dad,

  Professor Snape has found out about the Professor Snape mask. He told Harry to hand it in, so Harry wore it to class. Professor Snape usually arrives just when class is about to start, and when he got there, Harry was standing at the front, lecturing about how potions is the best subject. Harry got five detentions.

  A lot of people asked him about it, so Harry's made more masks and he's started selling them. I told him not to. The Headmaster bought one.

Ron and Hermione looked at him with pure horror on their faces. "What- ehm- what should we do now?" stammered Hermione.
