Many of you have read the tawdry comedy Like a Red Headed Stepchild by that scoundrel mugglesftw. While the rogue does at times portray me, Gildory Lockhart, in an accurate light at times, I find that the record is in desperate need of being set straight. Therefore, I have decided to publish my own accounting of the events that transpired during and after my time at Hogwarts, with the help of my good friend Remus Lupin and his son, Edward. While there are few to rival the literary genius that is myself, I do at times find a few niggling words that are misspelled or a bit of grammar that has escaped my attention. Interested beta's should post here, or contact my agent, mugglesftw at fanfiction.net.

Yes, yes, I know. I do have to work with the man on occasion, even if his memory is full of holes.


** You do know Remus's son's name is Edward in canon?

*** Wait, really? Since when the hell is Teddy short for Edward? For crying out loud.

Edit: Apparently since forever. That's just dumb. Ed or Eddy is short for Edward, Teddy is short for Theodore. Makes more sense.

******* Or he ran out of names. Because goodness knows there weren't enough significant female characters who died.

At least she's not “Lily Fred Potter”, or “Lily Cedric Potter”.

********* Personally I think that Nymphadora has to be one of the dumbest names of all time. Even Harry "I like dead people" Potter wouldn't inflict that on his kids.

** You need to stop obliviating your current editor, */Gildory/*.

Or at least keep a note with your own name written down, Gilderoy.
