Hello, everyone,

I apologize for not posting Chapter 1 of *The Accidental Animagus* yesterday. I'm crazily busy studying for final exams (tomorrow is finals week) and I don't really have time for anything else right now. Chapter 1 of *The Accidental Animagus* will go up next Saturday or Sunday.

Merry Christmas,

ThePianoProdigy


** I'm super excited \o/

**** The voice pauses quite a bit, but other than that it looks really good.
