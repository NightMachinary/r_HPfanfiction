I was recently reading “Apt Pupil” by Stephen King where a very creepy kid finds out his neighbor is a Nazi in hiding and the two wind up corrupting each other. It got me wondering: is there a Harry Potter fanfic that is similar to this? A Deatheater in hiding perhaps passing on his hateful ideology? Or is there a “Deatheater Hunter” fic where aurors go after escaped war criminals? Thanks in advance.


** I remember seeing one where I think it was Evan Rosier who lived next door. I'll see if I can find it again.

  At the age of seven, Harry Potter meets the new neighbors, including twin sisters his age. When he introduces himself, they recognize his name. Four years later, a very different Harry Potter takes the train to Hogwarts. See AN for more detailed information.
