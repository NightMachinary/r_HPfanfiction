  “I was going to kill you,” Grindelwald said nonchalantly, twirling the wand in his hand. Harry's blood ran cold, all too aware of his own vulnerability. He inadvertently recalled the row of followers in the back of the dungeon, their reverence and fear of the lord undeniable.

  "What changed?" Harry asked, quiet but daring. His heart was beating loud in his chest, adrenaline beginning to pump through his veins. Grindelwald's piercing eyes finally turned to him, tracing his features unabashedly. “Your resemblance to the Potters.” At the mercy of the powerful Gellert Grindelwald, an amnesiac Harry Potter reluctantly accepts to assist in the lord's search for the Hallows --- by spying on the heir to the Cloak of Invisibility, James Potter.
