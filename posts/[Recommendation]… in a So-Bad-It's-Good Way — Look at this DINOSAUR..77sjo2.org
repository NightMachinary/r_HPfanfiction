** I can't quite decide if it's a crack fic. If it's not, then holding a disabled writer's work up to public ridicule like this is a horrible thing to do. But there is enough inconsistency that I'm inclined to think all this writer's stories are actually crack fics (and most of his reviewers are oblivious idiots). But what really depresses me is that it has twice as many reviews and ten times as many favourites as any of my own stories (and I like to think I have a basic grasp of spelling and grammar).

I think I'll just go and jump under a train.

*** I feel the same way about a fic titled "A Genius Grows". It alternates between calling Harry "Harrison" and "Harold". He has the IQ of 200 and is capable of reading at 30,000 WPM at four years old.

After typing out this comment, I realized it definitely sounds like crack. But I don't think most of the reviewers praising it picked up on that, and the writing is so poor it just might be serious.

*** I feel you. I come across so many stories that have more than a basic understanding in spelling and grammar, paired together with a unique, and original story, yet it doesn't come close in terms of reviews/favorites/follows as other fics which depict a basic re-telling of canon along with the beginning of sentences that aren't capitalized, dialogue that isn't housed in quotation marks, and where the reviewers so aptly call Dumbledore "Dumbles" and Voldemort "Moldy Shorts."

****** Well, I wish some writers would put as much effort into finishing their stories as they do into starting them! And I wish more readers appreciated just how much work and time goes into writing a story. It's not just about being able to spell and use punctuation--though that's the foundation of course. But a story's more about the sum of its parts if you know what I mean. But everyone's taste is different and you can't please everyone.

** That was /actual/ garbage. I've wasted five minutes skim-reading that first chapter and I'm never getting them back.

What the fuck even was up with all those lists? Like seriously what the actual fuck I think it's like half the chapter listing how many orangutan-fucking-dick-million galleons Harry (/ahem, Harald/) has amassed through the 150 different vaults and shit he owns. Not to mention fucking bazillions of books and artefacts and a Potter will and Magical Cores and love potions out the wazoo.

And how he's king/heir of every tract of land under the sun and shit.

I want it to be crack, I really do, because a reality where this is a genuine attempt at storytelling is too horrific to comprehend.

** According to one of the reviews, it has Fred and George teaming up with Tony Stark at some point...I'm still too scared to read it, but who knows, maybe it has some hidden gems?

--------------

...Wow. With page source and a word count thingy I managed to figure out some of the length. Not counting most of the formatting, I /think/ the first chapter is 18,000 words.

And the entire chapter is just Gringotts and Harry going through his inheritance, including all his wives, will-readings, unblocking his powers...

You know, now I'm actually tempted to actually peruse the first chapter, if only to get ideas for deconstructing and reconstructing various HP cliches.

Like...ooh, what if it /wasn't/ Dumbledore who did all the oblivations and magic blocking and whatnot? What if you had something like a Doctor-Who style Silent who erased everyone's memories of encountering it, who was responsible for undermining Harry's magic for purposes unknown?

Maybe it could be protecting a second Statute of Secrecy, like "A genius muggle scientist has actually learned to independently harness magic, we need to obliviate him and reduce his intelligence with potions and hide the evidence so we aren't exposed.", except it's "That child has so much magical power he could accidentally expose us, we need to keep him obliviated and his power under lock and key so he doesn't expose our double-secret world!".

** Years and nothing have changed. I was looking at the 'recently updated' section of fanfiction.net and I came across this story that seems a throwback to the worst days of OP!Lord!Harry Manipulative!Dumbledore Evil!Weasleys craze. Judging from the Author's Notes, the author doesn't even seem to realize how his story risks being received.

** A few times I thought the noble titles must be ending soon, but it just went going. World record for noble titles in a hpfic? It's pretty impressive.

Hope the guy is trolling about being disabled and needing surgery. For all we know this wish fulfillment really means something to him, and he might be devastated to know it's being shit on.

EDIT: And the other multiple lists... I'm kinda into it. I'm actually gonna skim and see where this goes.

** "To Peter Patrick Pettigrew ask Wormtail, we leave 3,000,000 Galleons if he is the one to betray us as he is our secret keeper the following part is void and he is to be locked in an anti-Animagus cell in Azkaban and the key thrown into the deepest sea." So as long as he betrayed them he gets the money and every thing, but if he doesn't he gets thrown in Azkaban?
