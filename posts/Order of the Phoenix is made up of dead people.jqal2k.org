:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi! I used to read a fic back in the day where Harry & Angelina both get killed by AK and they're given a potion to reverse the curse and taken to a hidden society of the order of the Phoenix. They get new identities and given skills. Harry finds out that his parents are alive and have more kids. Harry eventually goes back to Hogwarts hidden and kills Voldemort. I'm pretty sure the title was “Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix” but I can't seem to find it anywhere! Please help!


** Hang on, I asked about the same thing a while back and someone found it. Lemme see if I can find it again in my profile.

*** u/[[https://www.reddit.com/user/PraecepsWoW/][PraecepsWoW]] found it for me a year ago, so credit goes to him for this one.

"That would be Harry Potter and the dueling master by Malena linkffn(330769) it even spawned a sequel linkffn(405377)"

  AU! This is not your average HP fic. It may start out like the others, but it's not. This story involves death, lies, deceit, Voldemort, Death Eaters, the Order of the Pheonix and their weird way of recruiting agents. I hope you enjoy it! RR

** Ahh the creativity of the good old pre-OotP days.

Did you possibly mean linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/826742/1/The-Order-of-the-Phoenix]])

I know it has a dead OotP, but I don't recall the AK scene. I haven't read it for 15 years though.

  *Completed* Harry's fifth year and he's just been chosen by the Order. Kinda strange, especially since the only living member in the Order is Harry! New powers, new friendships, new relationships and old enemies. H/G and R/Hr.
