A Hufflepuff overhears Krum mention Hogwarts is more comfortable and only magical fire is permitted at Durmstrang. The Hufflepuff starts a S.P.E.W.- like campaign to bring warmth and comfort to the Durmstrang students via knitting blankets and making pillows and such.

Some Ravenclaws join because, you know, learning stuff is cool. Like bowties and fezzes. I hope someone gets that reference.


** If you're trying to make things warm, bowties and fezzes are the wrong choice, because they're obviously cool.

*** Lol, I might have to write a fic using movie uniforms instead of book uniforms just to do that. Maybe post war, post McGonagall as Head, new head is a Whovian and slightly alters the uniform.
