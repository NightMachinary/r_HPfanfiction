hope this isn't against the rules but i would highly recommend everyone to check out Bells on youtube, she makes excellent Marauders fanvids - shit genuinely looks like a movie!! :0 id love to hear what u guys think about it, i think they are really realistic and in character and the casting is dreamy (but impossible:()
