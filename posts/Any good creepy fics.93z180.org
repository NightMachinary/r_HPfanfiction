I'm a big horror fan, wondering if you guys came across anything good in that category. I don't think I ever have. There's so much potential for something like that in the hp universe.. I have a couple sitting unfinished on my desktop actually.

Gen if you have it, anything else is ok. just no harems please

** If you haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]], you should check it out for sure. It was really creepy and I was on the edge of my seat the whole ride - and was really impressed with the author's imagination.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10561940][The Lost Children]] is short, but really good. I'd love to read more fics like this, actually.

I also second The Eyes by Shadenight123 - that one /terrified/ me, although part of that was because I was house sitting at the time and the creepy story combined with a house and noises I didn't know played all sorts of tricks on my mind. But it qualifies as horror, no doubt.

** /Deathly Hallowed/ by Shujin1 is pretty great, although unfortunately abandoned:

It features Lily who did something, uh, different to save Harry instead of sacrificing her life.

  An assortment of Harry Potter one shots. Though listed as "Humor/General," the collection also contains Drama, Horror, Family, and Tragedy, as well as a few experimental fiction stories as I work out my stylist chops. Contain crossovers with several fictional worlds, including the Cthulhu Mythos, Starship Troopers, Star Wars, and James Bond.
