I read a fanfic a while ago (some years, in fact) which span the whole seven years of Hogwarts. It was focused on Sirius, and dealt with him growing up and facing his family.

Also he was into Remus after a while, hooked up with Remus, James and Zabini. Supposedly betrothed to a pureblood girl. I think the name was BLACK, but I can't for the life of me find it.

I remember quite a few scenes but not the wording, such as once Sirius and James went into the lake with another two girls, and Remus and Zabini were pissed.

It's 1AM and I have been searching this fic for the post hour, any help? I fear it might have been deleted from ff
