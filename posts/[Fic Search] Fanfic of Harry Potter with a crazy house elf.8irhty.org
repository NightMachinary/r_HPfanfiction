So... First things first. The elf isn't Dobby XD I'm looking for a fic I read a while ago where Harry somehow acquire a pair of House Elves. And I remember laughing like crazy because one of them is completely insane. I think the elf was wanted as a high criminal in multiple countries, and if I remember well, propose to steal mmilitary bombs to use on Voldemort. Can anyone on the site remember it? I'd love to read it again!


** Hmm...[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/620603/Fangalla-Marie-and-Eppy-the-House-Elf][Fangella Marie]] had a pretty zany house-elf OC called Eppy show up in many of her stories. Not quite that loony, though.
