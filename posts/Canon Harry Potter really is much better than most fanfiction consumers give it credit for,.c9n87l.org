I recently read that 'Unpopular opinions' thread on this subreddit. One of the opinions was that much fanfiction had surpassed the original series in quality. I'm not going to say that's a stupid opinion but I do think that that sort of opinion is often held unfairly.

People either point out flaws which in many cases don't exist and are likely an artefact of fanon blending into canon in their heads or point out flaws that whilst valid, don't really take anything away from what makes Harry Potter a great series.

A quick run down of what makes HP special to me, to hopefully reignite some passion in canon for people:

1. The Magic. HP is the most magical rendition of the universe I have read bar none (and I've read pretty much everything worth reading in this community) - and this really is the most important thing in the HP universe. Fundamentally the truly special thing about HP has always been the wonder and whimsy of the magic and no one does it better than Rowling.
2. The Characterisation (A potentially controversial opinion). I think I love the characters more each time I give HP a read through. Take Ron for example - often lazy and mean-spirited but with a streak of loyalty and stubborn grit that always endears me to him. All of Rowling's characters have flaws, shortcomings that makes them so much more real than an autonomous Harry that works all day and schemes all night.
3. The Symbolism/Themes. I can be a cynical bastard sometimes but theres a great part of me that can't help but love the theme of love versus evil. I love that our protagonists have principles that they refuse to violate. I want a moral, principled, honourable Hero god-damn it! I also like that inclusion of so called 'old-magics' like that of Lily's protection and Harry's journey into death. They add a really grandiose feeling to Harry's journey - certain parts of the story feel part of a fairy-tale.
4. The Plot (specifically the last book). In line with my statement number 3., I think that the ending of Harry Potter was really very fitting. If we examine the fundamental mechanisms that propel our plot forward, we find that a major driver is fate and old magics - in other words, the magics of love and death. Lily protects Harry by making a principled, loving choice and magic steps in to avert death. Harry fights Quirrell by way of sacrifice - and again love protects him. Throughout, Harry and his companions refuse to abandon their principles even though they have every reason to and magic rewards them by guiding them to Horcruxes, getting Harry ownership of the Elder wand and all the other things in-between - luck as some would call it. Remember, this is a very subtle force in the universe and it's effects never feel contrived. Harry never feels deprived of any agency. And this ending really really fits. Voldemort is a personification of personal pursuit of power - the ultimate selfish man. He gains unparalleled power because of this but ends up losing to someone who is not even a sliver as skilled. Why? Because Harry is principled and moral. Maybe this ending isn't to your liking but considering the magic of the universe I don't think it's bad plot writing at all. (This is to be clear my personal interpretation of the Harry Potter books and isn't necessarily the actual plot).

I urge the community to give the original books a reread - even if you don't end up liking them as much as I do they deserve that much I think.

EDIT: Apologies for the slightly badly written title (the comma).


** Yes, but ... She is really a superb narrator, and especially she is great on the microlevel. Whimsical nice dialogues, various magical devices, small deficiencies of the magical world. Professor who is too tiny to be seen, so he falls constantly from the heap of books he stands on?, dark and smart professor who cannot make for himself a good shampoo?, lemon drops? some of them are I am afraid inside baseball of the British educational system we cannot comprehend from the outside. Her dialogues are always perfect (and who tried to write a longer story knows how difficult it is to write a good dialogue). But ...

1. She is not Tolkien, she was not a maniacal super-builder of the parallel universe as him. Also, it is another hint how poor idea is a serialized writing of novel. And her task was a way more complicated. It is a way more simple to write a separate parallel universe somewhere (whether Arda is our Earth of not, is immaterial here) than to build a parallel universe working inside our normal world. Magic is for her just a tool how to make her plot working, so I am persuaded that all those crazy problems (why didn't Dumbledore put an age-line in front of Fluffy?, why did he fly to London on a broom and not Apparate or Floo? etc. etc.) are just because those particular pieces of magic were not known to JKR at the time of writing PS. Also, whole category of muggle-world-collides-with-the-magical-one fanfiction (linkffn(11500936) and many others) is centred around this problem.
2. Her particular strength are those small nukes inside one line in a dialogue. I don't know about an author who would wrote stronger lines than ‘“Lucky you,” said Ginny coolly.', ‘“Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!”', and ‘“NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!”' (any other of the similar calibre?). Whenever I read these lines, I get still a bit misty, even after the fiftieth time. However, each of these lines needs a /huge/ build-up to work, and they force some characters into a very flat and one-dimensional creatures. Ginny [[http://www.quibblo.com/quiz/huK3uTO/][practically evaporates]] from the third, the fourth, and the first half of the fifth book, just to return with this bang. Which unfortunately terribly hurts development of Hinny pairing; knight in not so shiny armour save a princess from a dragon, and then ignores her? What kind of fairy tale is it? Molly Weasley must be a meek Kinder-Küche-Kirche type of woman, which hurts depth of her story (never bashing! but I like more complicated and problematic Weasley family like in linkao3(11676102), in the similar vein, I would love to read more realistic and three-dimensional Dursley family than what we get from very unreliable abused teenager narrator; linkffn(12551744) makes at least small steps in this direction). And Kreacher must be ever negative hateful jerk, which forces JKR to make Sirius to much into jerk himself. Only in a fanfiction (was it linkao3(13143726), where Kreacher has a small garden on the terrace of 12 Grimmauld Place? no, it was linkffn(10937871)), we can get slightly more complicated and interesting character from him.
3. Some characters are ... well just not well executed. Ginny is the most famous example (whole Harmony movement is to large extent fuelled by how poorly Ginny is written); see the link above. I personally resent how terribly Dursleys' were written, and another huge discussion in the fandom is driven only how terribly Snape was written (especially, because there are two Snapes: one super negative 2D in the first few books, another snarly tragic hero in the latter ones). Poor Lavender Brown! Of course, we all have list of characters we would love to hear more about (for me it is Susan Bones, I love linkao3(2467277), Professors McGonagall and Flitwick), but that's probably not a fault of JKR, but publisher's limit on the length of the book.

  When she was small, Susie's aunt Amelia had taken her to work whenever her parents asked her to babysit. She toddled around her office. When Susie was older, she got to sit under her aunt's desk in court and listen to her give out rulings, verdicts, decrees. There was tradition there, scripts and structure, and Susie had felt herself lean into them, comforted, strengthened. Over the years, she saw so many ways the system could be corrupted. Umbridge used it like a blunt weapon and blood purists had snuck into it for years like burrowing termites, undermining the foundations, making it their own home.When Susan Bones was twenty-three she would look across her steaming mug and the Ministry breakroom table, and see Hermione aching to burn it all down to ashes. Susan wanted to scour it to its roots, instead, wear it down to its rebar and concrete, and then rebuild from the old, worn foundations on up.“Your parents died for you,” Susie told Harry Potter once. “My aunt died for this. Now either shut up and get me a fresh cup of coffee or try to drag me out of here before I finish this.”But that was a war away. That was a childhood away from now.

** Nobody hates _______ more than _______ fans is a statement that holds true for practically every fandom. No one can pick apart Star Wars like a Star Wars nerd, and no one can rant about the plot holes of Harry Potter like a Harry Potter fan. When it comes to fanfiction though it's not just about a fan of Harry Potter, it's a fan of Harry Potter and of writing. Fanfiction creates a perfect storm of people who love Harry Potter enough to criticize it and who love Harry Potter's writing enough to criticize it too, and JK Rowling doesnt exactly hold back in giving ammunition for that.

I view the canon books the way I view Dumbledore. The books did things a shitty way a bunch and have some major issues, but they also have a massive dosage of nostalgia and emotion. Many people can love Dumbledore for who he "was" without getting caught up with the details of the actions and decisions he was written to have made. Same with Harry Potter as a whole. You can love canon and the beauty of his without getting caught up on the writing problems. But that doesn't mean that those problems aren't there and it doesn't mean those that don't look past those problems are wrong to do so either.

** IMO it's that Rowling turns out to be amazing storyteller, but her skill lies mostly in the 'teller' part and not the 'story' one. When you read the books for the first times it makes you want to continue reading, you are engaged in the story and feel all the right emotions, yet if you take a closer look at it holes start to appear, and the themes of it might be something you don't agree with or even blatantly dislike (like the whole magic-jesus-harry thing).

And also i think that's the reason why HP is the one thing with the most fanfics written about it - everyone knows it and everyone liked it at some point, but the holeiness and lackluster worldbuilding let people dive into it headfirst with their own ideas and create parallel works of fiction, because the basis is rather loose and easy to mold.

Look at A song of Ice and Fire for example - it was published at similiar time, also gained immense popularity (albeit a bit later than HP), yet the amount of fanfics compared to HP is miniscule - IMO because the world is well-fleshed out with somewhat consistent story and trying to play with it the right way requires quite the effort - with HP it's basically '(almost) everything goes because magic'.

****** Polyjuice was touched on once by a man that seemed to mimic the person so perfectly that it was impossible for even his closest friends to spot the impostor. Besides that, it was used only sparingly in Deathly Hallows: once during the Battle of the Seven Potters and once more when breaking into the Ministry and the Lestrange vault. A total of 4 times and the one time it was used as a plot point, it was revealed that it was an impostor rather than Moody Imperius (which would have been much cooler and more of a twist in my opinion). Harry seems to rarely use his Invisibility Cloak like an intelligent person and uses it to hide out rather than follow Malfoy from the Slytherin common room (where Harry knows the entrance is from being there at age 12 years old) and take down Malfoy. And Parseltongue is never touched on except for a one-off time where Ron mutters a word that sound like 'open' in Deathly Hallows. Between Chamber of Secrets and that one scene in Deathly Hallows (off-screen in the book by the way), it's never brought up again...oh wait, I'm wrong; it was brought up once by Harry commanding the locket to open before Ron stabs it.

Don't act like those things were used significantly apart from just pushing the plot along or even making people seem dumber than they are.

******* Look, I think you haven't read the books in a while-which fair enough I imagine most people haven't-but you are just straight up wrong on all of this. I am actually a bit lost at just how to address this because you got a lot wrong. Perhaps look at the wiki if you need a catch up rather than having to re-read? But yeah, anyway.

Harry uses the Invisibility Cloak a crazy amount, so much so it's utterly pointless to list. There just wasn't a time where he wasn't using it to get up to mischief. What do you mean 'take down Malfoy'? Harry isn't an assassin, nor is he the instigator in his conflict with Malfoy.

Polyjuice potions was introduced in the Chamber of Secrets. Which is important because in that book we learn the ingredients and it's level of difficulty (a month to make), and so when Snape reports missing Polyjuice ingredients it's meant to clue the reader into the mystery of the Goblet of Fire (I.e. Mad-eye Moody the imposter).

When Hermione steals it in Deathly Hallows they only /have/ so much and they make sure to use it quite reasonably. They use it the Battle of the Seven Potter, they use it in the Ministry, Harry and Hermione use it to hide themselves as Muggles in the graveyard and finally their last bit is used to disguise Hermione as Bellatrix Lestrange.

And as for Parseltongue, well no again. Every time they communicate with snakes is Parseltongue in the books, which is basically all Nagini scenes. It's used in the Half-Blood Prince when introducing the Gaunt family (who speak in parseltongue specifically) and Voldemort's upbringing, it's used in Deathly Hallows as an important plot point in regards to the Locket /and/ the weird creepy Nagini-Bathilda (Hermione doesn't speak parseltongue but Harry does and most importantly he doesn't /know/ he is speaking parseltongue so he didn't realise anything was up). Like I don't think you can use 'speaking to snakes' any more than it is actually used which despite your claim is quite frequent, it's most important aspect is connecting Harry to Voldemort and the dark wizard association.

Besides this, there's frequent casual mention of all these aspects even when they aren't using them.

Oh I even forgot, Malfoy uses Polyjuice himself in Half Blood Prince, Crabbe and Goyle disguise themselves as girls and warn him when someone is approaching the room of requirement.

But definitely not invisibility cloaks, polyjuice potions and parseltongue which are sort of /the/ elements of the book series. Time turners are also kind of intentionally one use, JK Rowling destroyed them in Order of the Phoenix because they are a bit /too/ convenient. Veriterserum comes up a few more times as well, but isn't too major.

And all of that isn't covered in the movies that much (and the movies probably do stick in most people's minds the most), so I can definitely see the confusion.

** The biggest problem for me has been the tell don't show By JK. We're /told/ that Voldemort was a manipulative genius, never shown it (yes, even in Slughorn's memory). We're /told/ that Hermione is smart, but other than being ahead in books, she isn't all that smart, not thinking of the many ways to use the /half thought plot devices/ introduced by Rowling.

This is what I find the most infuriating in canon. That, and the frankly stupid way of making Hinny a couple. I'm not saying that the couple can't work, I'm saying that Harry feeling a monster inside his chest is not how things work.

** My main complaints are having all Slytherins be evil and characters only thinking to move the plot along sometimes. The whole “none of Harry's friends believe that Malloy could be working for Voldemort” considering that he's known as a bigot, he threatens people with a well feared and known death eater werewolf, he's obviously a bigot, his family are supporters, etc. just seems out of character especially since Hermione goes yeah it is suspicious but he's probably just bluffing. Other than that some fanfics do have better parts than the original Harry Potter world such as for me I like it when there's more magic and there are a lot of strong talented magicals and when the magical and muggle worlds are different because of magic. However, Harry Potter being so light on world building, the magic system not being fleshed out, and we only see through a muggle raised kids eyes makes it so that all these fanfics can exist and not be too drastically different from the source material.

** Honestly, my problem is that we only ever get to see this wonderful world JKR created through the eyes of someone, however strong and moral and worthy he maybe, who is myopic and unmotivated and rather oblivious. If there's any such thing as wizarding culture, we don't know much about it because Harry does not give a fuck. Not only are we, as readers, crippled by the fact that Harry just isn't curious about the things we're curious about, but also the fact that this is a protagonist that characters in the know go out of their way to keep ignorant. Harry is so busy struggling for pieces of information that are essential to his personal history and survival that he doesn't really get the chance to be excited to learn things in this new world he's found himself in. So in terms of worldbuilding there are plenty of fics that have far surpassed JKR, some of them with absolutely brilliant prose and drama and mythical heft to them.

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)

** I'm going to start of saying that it is perfectly fine if someone enjoys the original over everything else. There's nothing wrong with that. I'm one of those people who think that the books are fine if you just sit down and read it and not really think about it.

The characters I kind of do and don't agree. The characters she does develop through the books where pretty developed. Whether they ended up good characters in the end or not is up for debate, but she has a ton more one note characters. Outside the trio, Dumbledore, Snape, and Voldemort; almost all the other characters were pretty much given one trait and written around said trait. Towards the end, only Neville and Draco got more development, but I don't know of Draco gaining redemption through fear and stupidity is better than Neville growing to his own. Strangely enough, I think Neville grew much more as a character than Harry.

I have to disagree with you about point number 4. I find the whole Deathly Hallows and Horcruxes terribly contrived plot devices. I'm kinda thinking you are stretching it with magic rewarding people for following human values. I don't think Magic, on its own, has that kind of sentience. Its like saying god likes you for keeping to your guns therefor he's going to reward you for following the plot.

I do agree that Harry has never been shown to seek power for the sake of power so it makes sense he would give up the Elder Wand.

The Epilogue, I thought, was just a disappointment. It doesn't acknowledge anything that happens in the previous books because it was written a long time before she finished the series, which I think was a mistake. If the Epilogue occurred maybe a few years down the line instead of almost a decade and actually acknowledge the events they had gone through, I probably would have been happier.

** Most of your post can be summarized with "I specifically enjoy those aspects of the series that most critics hate". Kinda hard to debate points that are mostly personal taste.

You might like the themes and plot of the last two books, but they're the most hated in the franchise for a reason. For every fan of reward of principled heroes there's another who'd rather see perfect consistency instead. For every reader that calls HP's magic "whimsical" there's another who calls it "plot convenient" (which for many people is a straight synonymous with bad writing).

You might have liked the love vs evil theme, but to me it felt like a pretty abominable message: good always wins against evil, so preparation and competence are unnecessary as long as there are principles (which are obviously objective and indiscutibly right and white and light compared to the opponent's which are wrong black and dark, 128% of the universe agrees).

** JK suffers from convenience writing.

Things happen because they need to for plot reasons, even if in the process characterisation, world consistency or logic have to suffer.

Most fanfic I read deals with smoothing over those issues and ensuring that consistency is maintained and the story follows logically, while retaining a lot of the core of canon. Naturally, that means it will often surpass canon, as it's doing half the job and the other half was already done.

** My main complaint was that Harry was made pretty unobservant or undiscerning for plot purposes, especially in Order of the Phoenix. As an example, basic knowledge of double-agentry should have told Harry there was no way Snape could openly acknowledge the hint that he had dropped about where Sirius was, and yet he just bulled on ahead heedless of the possibility that Snape /had/ checked in on Sirius, or at least gotten Dumbledore to do it.

I did like the overall theme of an unfolding world that takes us, and Harry, deeper into it and exposes not just its bright shiny side, but its more multifaceted, complex and sometimes quite dark side as well.

** My main complaints about the canon plot is that it is doesn't stand up to scrutiny. The books are very well written, and I'd say less than 1% of fanfiction surpasses JKR's writing. The writing is top notch.

That said, there are /so many/ plot holes that needs to be addressed or explained away. Dumbledore is either a manipulative villain or massively incompetent. Everyone holds the idiot ball one or more times for plot reasons. The numbers rarely adds up, like total number of wizards, number of students, faculty, and so on.

Another problem often addressed in fanfiction is Harry's personality. He doesn't have one. He's a weak-willed follower without initiative. He never acts, only reacts, and doesn't plan or think through when he finally is forced to do something. He's definitely a Gryffindor, brave but not bright. Harry with a spine or functioning brain would go AU immediately.

The moral of the story is to be nice. Good trumps evil, but mostly by sheer dumb luck and not without heavy and unnecessary losses. The parallels between Harry and Jesus are obvious. Personal sacrifice to save others, death, and resurrection. No wonder the Christians were up in arms over the books! Except they didn't read them because witchcraft.

Pet peeve: Whoever writes fanfiction without reading the books cover-to-cover first is doing something very wrong. Too many authors base their stories on the films or other fanfiction. Spelling "stupify" or "alohamora" is a dead giveaway, so is spinning portkeys which is a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8831374/5/The-Power-of-the-Press][bobmin]] invention done for important plot reasons.

** I think they're pretty damn good /especially/ considering it wasn't until GOF that Rowling properly had the wherewithal and resources to stop writing them as fast as she could and with the minimum of effort and attention to detail to get everything to make sense and set up the next bit.

Of course, by then she was also hampered by what she had set up in the first few books and had red lines to work within that she couldn't retcon too heavily.

I feel like we forget - or don't take into account often enough - that unlike a lot of creators, and especially a lot of children's/YA authors, JKR wasn't coming from a place of privilege and resources, with all the time and energy she could have to make her books airtight and rock solid before pitching to publishers as her life's work. She was a young single mother who'd been left by her partner, unemployed, and living off the British equivalent of food stamps in a pretty expensive city, and Harry Potter was, she hoped, her ticket out of that. The first book was a labour of love but it was also a meal ticket, and then when it did well, she would have been pressured by the publisher and her agent to rush-release sequels while the iron was hot and before her locked down readers aged out of the cohort to still be into the story.

With that in mind she did pretty damn well I think. Sure, they might not have been perfect - but at that point /she probably didn't intend or need them to be/, as long as they got finished in time to be brushed up by an editor and put out to market. I'm sure they didn't anticipate adults going over them with a fine tooth comb two decades later.

** As a writer, Rowling is great, with each of her books surpassing most authors in quality. However, her world-building is marred by her awkward transition from the kids to the young adult genre.

You go from an active protagonist to one that passively reacts to events, becomes average, when he shaping up to be rather skilled. The story doesn't need a child genius protagonist, but the laudable themes did not fit the dystopian later books.

** Yeah - no!

The characters in canon often behave way more stupidly than they should! Hell, Harry himself is a braindead moron in canon! He knows he has a super-powerful psychotic dark lord after him and what does he do? He slacks off, he puts chess and quidditch above his education, he choses bad electives that will not help him one bit, he avoids the library like the plague etc...seriously, I would enjoy the books more if the teachers and most main characters weren't so stupid! That includes supposedly super-smart Hermione who never figured out that Harry was abused at home (even I figured that out with people I was close to - I had two friends who came from neglectful and borderline abusive homes!) and it also includes (Mo-)Ron who never grows up...hell, neither does Hermione! For all her smarts she's often abusive (she attacks Ron with those birds for example)

Rowling crafted a beautiful world, but I prefer fanfiction over canon!

** Absolutely. People definitely forget what the best aspects of Harry Potter are, it's not because it's dark and gritty or because it has morally ambigious circumstances. What makes Harry Potter good is exactly what you have stated: it's the fun and whimsical characters, plot and magic.

There is some truly fantastic and well written Harry Potter fanfiction, but rarely are those fanfictions actually keeping to the /essence/ of Harry Potter. They aren't comparable to each other, and I enjoy them specifically sometimes because of their different take but that doesn't mean I don't adore the original canon take.

Very few books (and fanfiction) have given me greater joy to read than Harry Potter. There's a reason they are so, so popular.
