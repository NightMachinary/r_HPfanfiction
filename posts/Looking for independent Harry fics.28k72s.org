Whenever I search for a new fanfiction to read, I feel like I've read "everything" there is.

What I am looking for: An independent, but not evil Harry. Meaning, in case of a dark Harry, there has the be more to "dark" then just being evil (like in "out of the night", for example, where dark is just a different approach to magic that the "light" wizards want to get rid of).

Optional things and supplementary Information:

I'm okay with AU, if it is explained properly before hand. (I hate it when you start finding out what is different while reading, wondering everytime "eh.. that's not how I remember it".) I also don't care when Harry gets independent or why. So nice Petunia who prepares Harry or Harry being raised by someone else who prepares him, or Harry learning on his own to get away from the Dursleys is just as appreciated as if Harry starts to get independent somewhen during the Hogwarts years.

Dumbledore may be as focused on the greater good as he was, or be really manipulative or even the real evil, Voldemort and the Death Eaters may be as evil as they are, evil for "right reasons" or just painted by an evil Dumbledore as the bad guys. I'm pretty flexible as long as it is written in a way that makes sense (aka if the background is layed out at one point or another).

If, because of his independance, old friends of Harry don't like him anymore, that's also alright, as long as it doesn't turn out to be a ridiculous bashing fanfiction just for the purpose of bashing certain characters. (Bonus: if he gets along with some of the Slytherins, friendship, mentoring, family, etc)

And probably most importantly: Only stories that are complete (including sequels, except if reading only the story itself is satisfying in the end.) There are too many great unfinished stories, or stories with unfinished sequels that it's terrible frustrating and I don't really dare to start anything unfinished anymore.

Also: Please don't just link to the Dark Lord Potter list or something like that. Because of my aversion against evil Harry, browsing their archive didn't really result in much because it's not categorized good enough (or I was too stupid to browse it correctly)

I think that's all :D So if anyone could give me a few pointers and recommend a few fanfictions that fit my criteria roughly, that would be really awesome.

*** I did look through at least two with "independent" in the name. But there's the "the summary doesn't tell all that much" problem again. Powerful-Harry (in my experience) often turns out as over powered Harry, and with dark there is that "but I don't want him evil" problem again. And when the summary makes it sound like either of those is the case, I'd rather not start reading and notice halfway in (in case of long stories) that I won't like what is to come. (And just because stuff is in a community, doesn't mean it is good by any standards other then the owerns. Found some that looked promising but turned out very rushed/ooc without building the character change up)

That's why I hoped for explicit recommendations. But, I'll take a look through them again sometime, if that's what it comes down to.

**** I can't really recommend any particular stories, I'm afraid. I've read /so many/ fanfictions now that I no longer remember their strengths and weaknesses. I can't even tell from the title if I've read it before or not.

I usually search by first sorting by "favourites", then I read the description, and then I check out the first couple of pages of reviews. Quite a few of the "most favourited" stories turn out to be surprisingly bad.

Another search strategy is to sort by "update date" or "publish date", and then check the new-ish stories that racks up "favourites" quicker than the other stories.

I wish I could search by "favourite votes per month" or something like that.

Weird search strategies gave me [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]], a bit of a hidden gem at the time, but a surprisingly good read.

***** I know what you mean. Already happened a few times to me that I started reading a story that sounded very good but "as if I've already read something similar" only to notice a few chapters in when it gets more detailed that I already read THAT story..

After I've noticed that even my "I wanted to write something because otherwise I keep thinking about it" short stories get favourites, I don't give that much on those numbers. But combining it with reading a few reviews might do the trick.

I came by that once but got put off by the crack-warning. But might give it a try now and added it to the file I saved the communities in. Thanks.

****** It's definitely more "slightly cracky" than an all-out crack-fic.

Basically Harry jumps to the wrong conclusion based on insufficient evidence early in the story, but it's so close to the actual truth that he manages to make it work anyway.

#+begin_quote
  "I'm not human," Harry said. "I know I look like one, but I'm not."

  "I think I'm probably an elf," Harry said after staring at his notebook for a while. "They can talk to animals and disappear like I can, and they have green eyes and they live in the forest."
#+end_quote

I think you'll like it. Harry's very independent, not super-powered, and not dark. He struggles and wings it most of the time, but he manages. I don't remember anyone being wildly out-of-character, either.

[[http://forums.darklordpotter.net/][The library on the actual website]] has Dark Harry fics in their own section, Independent Harry is in the general fics section, and most of the alternates section is independent Harry as well, just AU in some way.

That was part of my problem. I got tired of having to open every single story to find out what it was about. Would be ton's easier if they had more prefixes for complete stories or something. Gets tedious to click one link after the other, then read the summary and then see that it's not what I want. Even ff.net is clearer laid out with at least showing the summary and genre on first glance. So yeah, I tried to find things there and gave up after a page or two. (Edit: and they seem so snobbish over there, I've stumbled over some discussions about if a fanfiction should even be posted there because it includes some cliches)

**** I agree, but it's just a forum, not much they can do about story descriptions until you open the thread, it does say if the story is complete or not in the title though.

I personally like how snobbish they are if only because I like the type of stories they encourage over there. I've been lurking about there for 8 years, and it's where I get most of the stories I read (good Dresden Files section as well), but I have no desire to participate with them.

***** Yeah, the complete-prefix is at least something. But after a page or something of searching and not finding something, I didn't have that much desire to read anymore and did something else.

I can be picky, but not THAT picky, I can live with a lot of stuff if it's still fun to read, so I felt like they just might limit it down too much and as a lot was from ff.net anyway... But ff.net's search is kinda bad. Getting less results for only searching a substring of a previous searchword (but still getting search* results) confused the hell out of me.
