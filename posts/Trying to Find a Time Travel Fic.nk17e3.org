:END:
So basically Hermione has the last time turner after the war [in which Harry never won the duel with Voldemort]. She is on the run with Neville, Ginny, and Luna for some time. She uses the time-turner to go back in time to change the outcome of the war, and as a result, goes back to her 1st year at Hogwarts. She is OOC and it is a different trio, instead of Ron, it is Neville.

Thank you!


** That sounds awesome
