** Dumbledore is a master of transfiguration, when he enters the battlefield, the battlefield itself flows at his command, he doesnt need an exsessive(spelling?) amount of power he needs quick wit and fast reaction time imo

Voldemort is all power and mind games. Flashy shows of magic to intimidate. When Voldemort enters the battlefield he looks for who's death will make the biggest impact and relieves them of their life in a show of strength and dark curses.

I dont know much about Grindenwald unfortunately but needless to say he had to have effected the battlefield in his own way.

Magic is fairly consistent except when wielded by a master, then it becomes free form and that makes it all the more dangerous. These three men were known as the strongest because they chose something and made it their own

** I mean it's kind of assumed/implied Grindelwald and Dumbledore had a relationship, which gives Dumbles the advantage on defeating him.

** In canon? The best wizards are generalists in canon. Voldemort and Dumbledore both transfigure and cast curses in their duels.

Grindelwald is slightly weaker than Dumbledore who beat Grindelwald even though Grindelwald had the elder wand. Voldemort probably edges Dumbledore out a little bit because Voldemort would have beaten Dumbledore had Dumbledore not had Fawkes and the Elder Wand.

**** Yeah, well he didn't have any issues casting lethal spells at his lover when they were still together. Decades have passed. Oh, and the final duel itself was called great. I highly doubt it would have been called that if they were hesitating.

*** Yes but that would not be the case if Dumbledore aimed to kill...there's a bit in ootp where Dumbledore fires a spell and Voldemort simply creates a shield in the air to block it. If Dumbledore used an Avada Kedavra then he would have won since Voldemort would have tried to block it in his arrogance

**** Gonna be honest, pretty sure Voldemort, who passed 4th year defense knows not to use a protego against a killing curse.

** Dumbledore in Harry's mind says that he was more skillful than Grindlewald, and given he won despite Grindlewald having the Elder wand, I'm inclined to agree.

From what we see of them dueling in Order of the Phoenix, the same is true of Voldemort. I don't know who has more "power" in the sense of more raw magical strength, but Dumbledore is undoubtably the most skillful and intelligent, and probably has the broadest and deepest understanding of magic while the others are more focussed on the dark arts.

** Generally, differences like that fall into 'speed, strength, cunning, creativity, preparation, and type/area of expertise'.

So, Dumbledore could be faster and more creative with his spells (that are mostly 'Light' and Transfiguration) while Voldemort casts spells with more Oomph and uses them more cunningly/is more tricksy about using them and focuses on darker and more esoteric spells.

** I wouldn't say that Grindelwald would be necessarily the less powerful of the trio. I assume they were evenly matched power-wise, it's simply more fun to watch.

What I would call the deal breaker in a fight is a mental state: what motivated them? What is their goal?

- while Grindelwald (and young Dumbledore) think more globally, Voldemort (and older Dumbledore) stick to their home turf and concentrate on Britain. I think first instance speaks of more imagination or at least bigger ambitions/self-assurance. Grindelwald exploits would be more sucessful than, say, if Voldemort suddenly decided to invade America, simply because of what they believe themselves capable of and what they are prepared to do to succeed in their path

- important would be immediate need/goal. Are they believing in the thing they fight for? While Voldemort detested Muggles it was questionable if he really cared all that much about other goals and his Followers. He very much cared about his own live and immortality tho so it stands to reason that spells cast in self-preservation would be more powerful that any protecting someone else or even harmful curses affecting others. On the other hand Dumbledore valued lives of his students over his own so magic protecting them (like Harry in the Ministry) would be more powerful and swifter than defending himself and, yet again, attacking. We don't know about Grindelwald but I assume that one of the more probable reasons for his downfall was if his situation wasn't great at the end. He was already losing, his dream slipping through his fingers. Duel with Dumbledore just finished him off.

Both of those things should have impact on casting as we are repeatedly told that *magic is all about intent*. And obviously it mostly alludes to the concentration in the moment of casting but what if it's also /boosted by convinction/? Unwavering, deep, powerful enough to affect the others. That would neatly tie these three: geniuses, visionists, people who shaped the century.
