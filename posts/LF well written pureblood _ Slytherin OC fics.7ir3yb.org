Hey there :) I have just finished reading 'The Brightest Star' and its sequel 'The Brightest Star' by the author 'Roses and Lavender' and they are easily two of the best fics that I have ever read, and I am trying to find something similar, I strongly recommend that if you haven't already to give them a try...
