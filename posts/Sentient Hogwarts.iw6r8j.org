Are there any good stories out there with 100,000+ words with a sentient Hogwarts? Thank you in advance!


** If you're okay with slash / Drarry, linkao3(319257) has that.

  Hogwarts students are in danger; Harry is determined to save them all. There's only one thing he knows for certain: Draco Malfoy is somehow involved.

** I recall a fic where Voldie made Hogwarts itself into a Horcrux during Harry's time as a student, but I think it was abandoned just as that happened. I remember Harry arriving at the start of a new year and the school feeling actively malevolent towards him. I'll try to dredge up the name of the thing, but I'm hoping by posting now someone else will recognise it and help me out.
