  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** In canon, I like the wizarding sayings like "hold your hippogriffs" and also when they use Merlin (like Merlin's beard). I don't like when fanfiction deviates too far from that. I like things like "sweet Circe" or "Morgana's tits" but not "by the Goddess" or "so mote it be."

** I actually have a running list of "Merlin" exclamations that I've come across while reading fan fiction that is currently 35 exclamations long. Some of them are pretty raunchy!

A couple of my favorites are Merlin's Arse Fluff! Or Merlin's Skimpy Pink Knickers!
