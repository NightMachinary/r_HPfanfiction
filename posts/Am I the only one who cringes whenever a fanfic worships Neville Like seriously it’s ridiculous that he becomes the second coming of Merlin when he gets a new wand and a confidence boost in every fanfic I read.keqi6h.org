** No, you're not the only one. I've stopped reading a lot of fics because of this same reason. It's really annoying to see and to read. It really serves no purpose and its just wish fulfilment of most people because the actor was more attractive than rupert Grint or the authors are riding the Ron Bashing wave to promote their story, and hence need to push Neville in to take his place.

Most authors have a fundamental misunderstanding of Neville. They think if Neville is there, Harry will be more open, have more friends, learn more about "wizarding culture". I disagree because Neville primarily had no friends through 6 years of school. His popularity only rose in the end when he led the resistance within the school. He isn't social. He is ready to fight just as often as Ron. If he's willing to be more social, it's probably because he's a push over who is desperate for friends and will do whatever peer pressure tells him to do. Also they think Neville is loyal. He isn't. Neville didn't do shit for Harry during his problems in second year or fourth year. It's all based on trying to glorify s character that was never there. So yeah, it's bloody annoying.

Loyalty isn't in itself a character trait, it's relational. Your loyal regarding someone or something. Bellatrix is a loyal death eater, she isn't loyal to the ministry.

I take it that in canon Harry and Neville aren't friends. What is he supposed to be loyal to, exactly?

**** Fair point. They might not have been friends, but they were known to each other with Harry having helped Neville atleast on one occassion prior. Not friends maybe, but well known acquaintances on more than friendly terms.

Yet inspite of that Neville never stood up for Harry, supported or helped him even once. But ok, that might not be considered loyalty, but rather a lack of gratitude.

If you look towards loyalty, I see a member of the house being alienated and ostracised by the majority of the school population. (2nd and 4th year) I would hope that other house members would stand up for that. Granted none of the other members did perhaps there might have been an exception in Ron and Hermione, highlighting the fact that Gryffindors aren't really known for loyalty.

He might not be Harry's friend, but he definitely owed Harry. Harry had been kind and helpful to him in the past but Neville didn't really reciprocate it in any manner, by way or aid or assistance. He didn't support his acquaintance or housemate.

Therefore this is my argument to counter the common misconception that is associated with the trope that Neville is more loyal and a better friend than Ron Weasley.

His loyalty and support towards Harry is often assumed, when in fact there is little supporting that fact, but also instances that speak against that idea.

They threw the party to celebrate for themselves. They were proud that their house had a champion. However they did nothing to stand by him when the rest of the school pretty much bullied him. No one aside from Hermione or Hagrid actually supports him at that point. While the badges and the mocking went around, Gryffindors were awfully quiet. Taking a reason to celebrate is different from loyalty in my opinion. It can be argued that when he vanquished Voldy the first time, people celebrated. Doesn't mean they were loyal to him. They turned on him pretty fast.

*** The only counterpoint regarding Neville's sociability is the "social courage" aspect, which was in GoF, when Ron and Harry were incapable of asking a partner to the Yule Ball, Neville summoned the sense and self-confidence to a) identify someone within his league* and b) just ask them before it was too late.

*Ginny is within Neville's league at this point because she cannot go to the Yule Ball unless invited by an older student. Neville is exploiting this circumstance - which is a social skill.

As for the rest of your analysis, I totally agree. Neville is not than interesting a character, and he tends to come to the forefront only when fic writers want to remove Ron from the plot, but still feel that Harry needs to have a pureblood male best friend in Gryffindor...

**** You're right. In that sense Neville is more courageous than those two idiots. He actually asked Hermione first, got shot down, swallowed the rejection and asked a person who was desperate to go. Smart move. Not exactly noble, or how he is portrayed usually but worked for him. I'd like to think Harry was a coward but I can't blame him. He had a person in mind he wanted to ask but he hadn't spoken to her ever and she was older so yeah. In school that actually does matter a lot.

He probably should have been smarter, moved on, but we've all been teenagers with less than intelligent ideas so I can't hold it against him.

Kudos to Neville on that bit though. I completely agree with your point.

But it also raises a question. If he was capable of social courage as in this instance, and I agree with you that he did display it.. then his lack of support towards Harry during CoS and GoF, was because he didn't believe Harry or he was a sheep? I really don't know which one.

Neville is a character whose glorification has constantly puzzled me.

Ask plenty of guys, many would have had crushes on seniors, but of them, very few would have approached their crushes.

The main point, I'm trying to make is, they weren't strangers. They were housemates who had interacted with one another more than other housemates. Even if you don't care for your housemate that much, if you saw a kid get treated like Harry was being treated, and you had experiences with him where he was decent to you, would you just disappear?

No, he did laugh almost every time Neville was jinxed by Malfoy. Here's an example:

#+begin_quote
  At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.

  Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling.

Do you want more quotes? Because there are multiple times where the exact same thing happens, so it wouldn't be too difficult for me to find them.

So it's fine for Harry to leave Neville in the dust in PoA when he was barred from being told the passwords or for him to laugh about how Neville was so pathetic that Hermione lied about having a date to avoid going with him in GoF, but it's suddenly horrible for Neville to not go out of his way to defend Harry? He was never described as "disappearing" or avoiding Harry in any way. He just didn't defend the boy who laughed at him multiple times when he was jinxed and bullied, abandoned him when he was ostracized by all of Gryffindor in PoA, and mocked him behind his back. If you still think that Harry being decent to him once or twice is enough to make up for all of that, then /that/ simply points towards a lack of decency.

There are various other instances of Harry and the rest of the Gryffindors laughing at Neville (and this time, I actually can produce more quotes if you want), but it's a bit redundant to list them all.

Also, laughing isn't the only way to bully Neville. The way he treats Neville even when nothing is happening is just awful. He never defends Neville when Ron insults him, he ignores Neville when he's speaking, he stands up Neville to go to Hogsmeade, he thinks of Neville as incompetent and pathetic, and he was even amused when McGonagall was tearing into Neville in GoF.

*** While I do agree with you, there are a few authors that actually take the time to develop him as a character, and it really pays off. In a fic called Rise of the Technomancers which starts shortly after 5th year, Neville is forced into a role similar to what he had in book 7 because Harry was expelled. He's not at Hogwarts to be friends with Neville, he's not even in the country for quite a while, so we end up seeing Neville grow without any interference from Harry and becomes pretty impressive on his own. He also goes through a lot of hardship both from those you'd expect and those you might not, which ends up making him a character just as compelling as Harry despite having almost zero interaction with him until the most recent chapters. Sadly I'm pretty sure the fics been abandoned but damn that author knows how to write compelling characters.

*** Criticising Luna shouldn't be a brave move, but it often feels like it is...

But the truth is, Luna ain't all that. She is the weird conspiracy-theorist kid that most people would get frustrated with and/or avoid.

I have in fact dropped fics that I was otherwise enjoying because they made Luna too prominent a character, or a main love interest. Yes, Luna is a character with great potential, but fanfics tend not to give her any development, they just treat her as totally perfect as-is, and anybody who criticises that (like Hermione) gets treated as though they've been unreasonable or cruel.

Harry was far away from all the Voldemort stuff, only having a connection through James that is an Auror. So he has a different set of friends, with a different House and different adventures, while Neville faces some of the plots in different ways.

In other he goes through a different childhood with Andromeda because he doesn't need any protection and his home was attacked by the DEs.

It opens up a whole lot of possibilites for both characters.

Now, Harry, Ron, and Hermione don't feature in it much until like the second half, since they're on the run, so Percy doesn't really meet them until then, so I planned to make him befriend Neville (who is a lot more confident than he was in his first year) and Luna. But I don't reallly want it to turn into one of those fics that you're referring to. Does that seem okay, or does it 'place him on a pedestal', as you put it? Just looking for advice here.

** I like when fics expand on Neville and his character, but it has to be done in moderation and throughout the fic. I can see how people can see it as annoying when a fic hero worships Neville, but I think Neville is often overlooked since his character could of been built more on in Canon. There is a reason he is a gryffindor. Some fics do a great job of exploring Neville's character and not all of those fics hero worship him. Also, maybe its just me, but even if I feel the fic hero worships him a bit, it most often can be looked over for the plot in the story. You definitely see and have a harder time ignoring super powered harrry fics, then fics that worship Neville. Not to say that super powered harry fics are bad, because I have seen many with a good plot and cool magic theory, or world building. Just trying to make a comparison to make my point. Thank you for bringing this up as a discussion, it is interesting and fun to look and think about everyone's opinion on this trope in fanfiction.

** Worship? Yeah. Just like with Harry. Fics like A Marauder's Plan, tho? Where they build his character, confidence and don't bash other characters (read: Ron) or instantly make him Harry's best friend? Nah, that shit is amazing. I see Neville (and Luna) as characters so underdeveloped in canon, that there's just a lot of room to work with. Why couldn't he be confident if someone showed Augusta her mistake giving him Frank's wand? Why can't he be good at other subjects (as McGonagall stated he got better after having his own wand) beyond herbology? And yeah, he's a shy boy, but why does that mean he can't have friends at all? I hate that people think like this and want him to perpetually be a side character when he can be much more. And Luna? Why does she have to be the bullied excluded kid bc she's eccentric? Why can't she be a Seer? Not super powerful, but still there, somewhat like Trelawney. I don't agree with people bashing Hermione, but I also don't like how narrow minded Hermione can be sometimes, it's about balancing things. Neither have to be invisible in fics. They have a lot of potential.

#+end_quote

No offense, but I honestly don't get why people say Luna is open-minded. She's basically the epitome of close-mindedness. When her ideas are challenged, she gets aggressive and refuses to listen to the other person's argument no matter how much evidence they have. She even tries to accuse Hermione of being close-minded for not believing in her conspiracy theories, even though Hermione was willing to listen to her if she had any actual evidence to back up her claims.

Believing in crazy conspiracy theories doesn't make someone open-minded. If that were the case, flat earthers and anti-vaxxers would be our top scientists.

Hermione, on the other hand, seems to be much more open-minded than Luna, since she'll actually change her beliefs once she's presented sufficient evidence. I think that a lot of people forget that the definition of open-mindedness is receptiveness of new ideas, which Luna is the antithesis of.

**** Good you are referencing the books. If you may remember Neville's character has been apart of many of the books.

In the first book he was with Harry in the forest of Death. Sure he didn't play to heavy a role however he did break the rules to try and warn Harry and Hermione about Draco trying to get them in trouble. That's pretty ballsy for suck a weak-willed character and he stood up to Harry, Ron and Hermione when they were going after Snape and the Stone

In the Goblet of Fire they showcase Neville's interest in herbology, nothing to exiting however it did help Harry in the long run

In the Order of the Phoenix Neville was apart of the group who stormed the Ministry of Magic when it was taken over by Tom Riddle.

In the Deathly Hollows never was the leader of the DA when Harry, Ron and Hermione where locating the horcruxes. Secondly like I said earlier he not only stood up to Voldemort when everyone thought Harry was dead but endured torture from the burning sorting hat and killed Nagini.

All in all he isn't a perfectly fleshed out character however when you build a world around only one person or a small group everyone else tends to be left out.

** The only time used a strong Neville is if there is something to reinterpret the original prophecy. If prophecy is open ended and the prophecy is talking about either Harry or Neville have them at equal strength. On the flip side maybe have Dumbledore potentially the dark lord. Even if Dumbledore is a good guy he's doing the wrong things for the right reasons. Story wise you could have Snape bring it up. Basically other any potential romance or whatever you have going in the story you would have the prophecy as a subplot. Harry is worried he is the boy who lived and potentially went through hell by dumbledore manipulation, Neville is worried he might be the true boy who lived or a planned backup in the case Harry dies. Dumbledore could be worried he's a monster and became what Voldemort or Grindelwald wanted (basically his multiple positions and political power) and Voldemort being Voldemort. Snape could be basically seemingly showing how Dumbledore could be classified as a dark Lord in the hopes both Dumbledore and Voldemort are dealt with so he could be his own man again.
