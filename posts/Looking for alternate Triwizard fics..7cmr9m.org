** linkffn(A Marauders Plan) The second task required complete cooperation from the champions.

linkffn(Accidental Animagus) The first task has the champions going up against a number of magical creatures, all of which have some ability to disappear. (Demiguises, Tebos, Chameleon Ghouls, and Diricawls) The second task had the champions rescue their hostage for the first part, then work with them to reach the end.

linkffn(Weres Harry) The first task is a Dueling Tournament, the second is the same and Harry's commentary leads to the third task being based on /The Princess Bride/.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

** Linkffn(Inspected by No 13) is still the same three canon tasks, just done in a humorous manner.

Can I also throw a shameless self-plug in? It's incomplete and there's only the first task (out of five tasks) as of now. And it's fem!Harry.

Chapter 9 of my story, linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise) is the first task. It's 20k words long, so I might have actually overdone it, to be honest. You might have to read Chapter 8 too, since it gives you more information on the task.

The dragon is still featured, but it's like a fifth of the full task, if even that, and while a broom is involved, it's not the solution that works. The rest is all new, and the spectators see all of it. It's a stupidly dangerous task and features numerous magical creatures the champions have to get past.

#+begin_quote
  She's sarcastic, reckless, quick-witted, sassy, and much more, but when faced with future tasks, not just from the Triwizard Tournament, there's one trait Iris Potter is willing to throw out --- laziness. Five mostly unique tasks, Animagi, humor, numerous magical creatures, and the beginning to a morally ambiguous and powerful but not overpowered fem!Harry. No bashing. Fourth year.

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

** In my AU story "Patron", the Triwizard Tournament has four tasks, each styled after one of the four traditional elements, and additional competitions between the tasks for those students who didn't get chosen as champions - Duelling, Curse-Breaking and Quidditch. All of the tasks are organised in a way to appeal to spectators.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
