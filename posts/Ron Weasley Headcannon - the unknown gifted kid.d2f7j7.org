So, I've had this theory for a while and have several years experience in education to back up the idea that Ron Weasley could be a gifted student with a profile that may be a mix of the Challenging/Underground gifted type.

Ron Weasley starts off his academic career with his brother Charlie's wand, a wand that arguably never chose Ron as it's wielder. Ollivander places a huge emphasis on the wand choosing the wizard so one could argue that Ron spends the whole first year of his schooling with a wand that is not a fit for his magic. Then, in his second year, it breaks and doesn't function properly for the rest of the year.

How is a child at a magic School supposed to achieve any kind of success if he doesn't have a properly functioning wand? Magic inherently is a demonstrative skill, one cannot claim mastery of a spell without performing it. No amount of essay writing will establish any kind of skill in charms or transfiguration, for example.

What if, sometime during those 2 years of trying and failing with an ill-fitting, then broken, wand Ron just stopped trying. What's the point of trying when you continue to fail no matter how hard you apply yourself? And by the time he had a wand that did work it was too late to change his attitude towards schooling. He's stuck in an academic ennui.

Thoughts?


** Not only was Ron using his brother's wand, but he was using an Ash wand with a unicorn hair.

According to Pottermore, Olivander /specifically/ notes that an Ash wand with unicorn should /not/ be passed down from the original owner.

#+begin_quote
  The ash wand cleaves to its one true master and ought not to be passed on or gifted from the original owner, because it will lose power and skill. This tendency is extreme if the core is of unicorn. Old superstitions regarding wands rarely bear close examination, but I find that the old rhyme regarding rowan, chestnut, ash and hazel wands (rowan gossips, chestnut drones, ash is stubborn, hazel moans) contains a small nugget of truth. Those witches and wizards best suited to ash wands are not, in my experience, lightly swayed from their beliefs or purposes. However, the brash or over-confident witch or wizard, who often insists on trying wands of this prestigious wood, will be disappointed by its effects. The ideal owner may be stubborn, and will certainly be courageous, but never crass or arrogant.
#+end_quote

The fact that a scuffed up Ash wand with a unicorn hair care worked at all for Ron indicates that he was both more talented than people give him credit for, and that he was stubborn and courageous enough to win the wand's loyalty.

Easter Egg: Note that the first time that Ron successfully used Wingardium Leviosa was when he was using it to save Hermione from the troll. It's at that moment of courage and determination that he earned the loyalty of a very stubborn wand.

** To go with your headcanon, Ron did transfigure food without meaning to. He literally did the impossible by breaking Gamp's laws. Yes, I know that it's most likely a mistake from JKR, but hey. It's fuel to headcanons.

And he also made it snow inside hodwarts and iirc, that wasn't supposed to be something that could be done by the students. If Fred/George was able to do it, it would have been a disaster.

There was the non verbal spell casting as well. It is a sixth year variation iirc.

The way he did the Levitation charm for the first time in a pressure situation was really cool as well. Like you said, he had to do it with Charlie's wand as well.

I don't think he is a gifted student in canon (he is above average though. Like that guy said, Harry and Ron are pretty identical academically and Ron is probably the best duelist/fighter after Harry in his year). There is enough fuel here to make a pretty convincing headcanon though.

Shame that a Slughorn wasn't there to see Ron's work in those earlier years. It could have helped him a lot if an adult gave him the attention he deserved.

It doesn't specifically say that Mushroom was edible but I always though it was meant to be something edible. Maybe it's my memory playing tricks on me. Either way it's good headcanon fuel. Again though, I don't say that it's canonically correct.

***** Did she? I thought she was just using magic to stir it.

Also I think Gamp's Law is just about creation of food, not transfiguration. So you can't magic food out of nowhere, but you can manipulate it - e.g. using magic to stir a sauce, or magic to reheat a dish. Whether you could alter the food (e.g. turn a pork pie into a sausage roll - essentially the same ingredients, but different composition) is a bit more grey.

******* To try and provide an argument (and do JKR's job for her):

It's quite possible that you can't create food in the sense that conjured/transfigured food will disappear or revert back after a certain amount of time, therefore it will disappear from your stomach (which could do anything from cause a vaccuum in your stomach to just not allowing you to absorb the nutrients) or revert back to it's untransfigured state (like, if you turned a rock into bread, you'd have a rock in your stomach after it turns back). However, when it comes to something like conjuring sauce or seasoning, since it's such a small portion of the food you're eating, it doesn't matter that it will disappear after you consume it, it's just there for flavor. So, you won't suddenly have your stomach emptied and you won't lose out on nutrients.

** He only did poorly compared to Hermione, he got the same marks as Harry at everything except DADA, basically they're both 3.5 GPA students to Hermione's 4.0. There's no mention of his getting way better after getting his own wand so I think Charlie's wand must have been reasonably compatible. We have Neville for comparison who... actually this might just be fanon ...got much better after getting his own wand. I view Hermione as having been mostly successful at getting them to study so Ron's innate laziness never ended up actually hurting him much.

Charlie's wand was an ash wand with unicorn hair core. I think it just might be overstated how important a wand really is. It's kind of like a suit tailored for someone else. Sure, it's not your exact measurements, but it's still wearable. Why else would so many wizards throughout the series have no problem using other people's wands?

***** Not only that, he had just left Hogwarts the year prior, so how do you put your wand through so much shit in only seven years? Maybe Charlie got it secondhand as well. But besides all of that, if you lose the wand that was essentially tailor made for you, how do you replace it? Does Ollivander take commissions? Are there other wands that would work just as well?

** I doubt that Ron - Mo-Ron as I call him - is gifted at anything!

Hell, even if he had given up on academia, then he would at least have been a good keeper (but it took Harry pretending to slip him Liquid-Luck to make him play better than the jerk Harry didn't want on the team!)

IMHO Ron had given up by the time he came to Hogwarts ("If I do anything, my brothers have already done it! Oh woe is me!"), but he wasn't anything special before either (the other Weasleys came to Hogwarts already knowing what they want, they were also talented - Ron however doesn't know what he wants, he has no talents or skills that we see (ok: Chess, but we do not know how good he really is, Harry is probably just bad at chess!))
