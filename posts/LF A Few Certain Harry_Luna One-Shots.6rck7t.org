1. Harry and Luna get locked in a bathroom for a couple of hours. Luna is Luna, doesn't care about whether she is showing much skin so just hops in a bath. At the end Ginny, who I think is the one to lock them in the bathroom in the first place gets together with Demelza Robinson I think ? Definitely a girl.

2. Harry is walking to the Burrow, completely missing Fred and George. They get his attention after he steps in a puddle they tried to warn him about and work out that he is feeling down because of a girl. After a couple of guesses one of them realises that he is looking towards Luna's home. When Harry and Luna go on a walk later they set off fireworks that say Luna is more beautiful than a moonbeam.

Thanks in advance


** I don't recognize the bath story, because I don't think I've read that one, but I recognized the fireworks story instantly:

  Harry is having trouble admitting his true feelings for Luna. All he needs is a little push . . . and the Weasley twins are happy to provide it.
