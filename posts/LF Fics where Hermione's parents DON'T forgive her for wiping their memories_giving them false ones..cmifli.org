I've seen too many fics where her parents get (rightfully) mad, Ron and Hermione throw their weight around, and Hermione is instantly forgiven because her parents don't want to lose their child. Linkffn(13204936) has an interesting subversion, and [[https://iulia-linnea.livejournal.com/879736.html]] plays the lack of forgiveness straight, but most everything else is "Hermione was right because she's a witch and the stupid Muggles just don't understand why she had to do it without discussing things with them, who cares about what /they/ think?" Any fics that play the lack of forgiveness straight, or at the very least show Hermione putting in work to repair their relationship?

** Non-forgiving Grangers is one way how to play it against the tropes, but I have lately playing with the idea of Grangers, bad parents. There seems to be huge fanon that they were the best parents imaginable (Accidental Animagus, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12117770/1/][Who Will Fill a Coward's Grave?]], and others), but what if they were not? The current state of my thinking is on [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/hermiona_nonsearch_parents.html]], but it is still way early for it to be published.

*** It's an interesting approach.

I think the real answer is somewhere in-between, although Hermione's mind-wiping of them is a bit screwed up.

*** It is linkao3(20141410) now. Also, I have meanwhile found linksub([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/crjnh9/lf_hermiones_parents_divorce_after_she_obliviated/]]), which seems like an interesting twist on the less-than-ideal-Grangers idea: they are kept only by Hermione, and without her in Australia, they quickly divorce.

  Exercise on reasonable breakup of Hermione and Ron (and Ginny and Harry in the background). Written as criticism on too often used stereotypes in Harmony stories. Without any longer plot.

** My series of one-shots [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1263350][nineteen years later seems pretty far away]] linkao3(1263350) has several that deal with this. The first in the series [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17910446][Lessons in Lying]] has Hermione explaining everything that has happened in the magical world since her first year just prior to wiping their memories.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19146814][early onset]] deals with Hermione's father being diagnosed with dementia and their strained relationship.

And lastly [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19398193][fragile peace]] most directly answers this prompt. From the point of view of Mrs. Dr. Granger, after her husband is moved into a care facility she moves in with Hermione, Ron and the kids. Following a lunch at the Burrow they have a conversation about the thing that tore them apart.

I'm currently working on a longer piece that will fill in the gap between Lessons in Lying and the other two which will more directly address the recovery of Hermione's parents and the growing rift but it's far away from publishing.

**** naw. Doing some searching there seems to be quite a few of these, but the one I recall was a "Harry decides to go with Hermione when Ron decides he can't go" and it involved giving back the parents memories and them... chewing them out for it and (her parents) were unsure if they wanted to return to britain...

  Harry has a nightmare. As always, Hermione is there for him. And maybe he's just beginning to really wake up? I never expected this story to be so popular, and this story's loaded with problems (New Zealand, anyone?), but if you can look past that... it gets better.

  You can only deny the chemistry for so long. The catalyst is inevitable; they are undeniable. A Harmony-focused story of what happens after in five-parts.
