A topic of discussion that I'm curious to hear others opinion on. As an avid reader of fics of considerable length I've noticed that you can often see a writers skill and quality of writing progress as the story goes on and often times many authors go back and update their earlier chapters to correct the grammatical errors. Though one side effect is they tend to have decent quality starts and ending and a poor or bearable quality middles and/or they create a myriad of plot holes and inconsistencies in their stories.

So my question or topic of discussion is: Do you prefer a fic in its original entirety with bad grammar or do you prefer proper grammar at the cost of story inconsistencies?


** I'm probably more likely to give a story that has good writing a chance. But if the story doesn't hold up to the writing I'm probably unlikely to finish it.

I'd say there are more decent fics on my finished list with somewhat bad writing than there are bad fics with good writing. But if it's riddled with grammatical and usage errors, I just won't read it.

** I think grammar is a decent gauging tool to the quality of the fic. I tend to catch a lot of mistakes when I'm reading. Most of them are spelling mistakes or typos, but while that does distract me, they're usually not terrible or confusing and I can easily move on from them. I think the problem really starts when the sentences are wonky. It's difficult; I can write some pretty run-on, ugly sentences too. They aren't at all nice to see back because those are the kind of sentences that will make me abandon a fic if it happens several times in a single chapter. When there are fewer or none of those grammatical horror sentences, the fic usually has better layers. It helps make sense to the story and that can be a great benefit to the plot.

Grammar is important to me. I am not going to wade though hundreds of pages that utterly baffle me in an attempt to figure out what the author has written just because the plot is interesting (for as far as I could understand it at that point anyway). If the plot is interesting, I have plenty of other things I would rather wonder about that.

** Grammar is important, but a good story will cause me to ignore moderate grammar issues. One writer I really like has extremely poor sentence structure (not gonna call her out so don't ask).

If a writer goes back and re-edits their earlier chapters --- which, as you say, can create problems that weren't there before if they're not careful --- they need to *clearly say so*. I save my favorite fics offline, so I need to know when I need to update my saved files.

What I really hate is when they take down the original, unfinished story (warts and all) to rewrite it, post one or two chapters, and then we never hear from them again. I'd rather have the flawed original, unfinished but longer, than two "improved" chapters where there were once 30.

So, I guess the tl:dr is, I'd prefer they start a new story file but leave the old one as well.

** The story has to be exceptional for me to ignore bad grammar. I usually give stories with bad grammar 2-3 chapters (I go past that only if a friend recommends them), and if the story doesn't keep me going, then it's bye bye.

*** I've found some stories that have the most atrocious grammar with authors saying english is there 3rd or 4th language and have wonderful plots that are enough to keep you reading and I've also seen stories with immaculate grammar with bland basic plots that are more boring than a terms of service contract. Frankly I'd take the bad grammar with the good plot. I guess so long as the general story can be inferred from the surrounding text that poor grammar can be overlooked.

**** Let me clarify: I did read my fair share of great stories with bad grammar along the way, because the story itself was worth it. Especially if the writer has English as a second/third/fourth/etc. language, it's doable. But if the writer is a native English speaker, and I have better grammar with English as a second language when drunk out of my skull, I tend to check out and move to the next fic.
