So, I was thinking, if Peter died either by deatheater or Sirius's hand, who could fill his role in the whole going to find Voldemort, nursing him and offering their right hand for his new body? As Peter is dead something is probably diffrent in this universe so it could be someone who died in the first wizarding war against Voldemort.


** Barty Crouch Jr.

***** In that case, someone else needs to be at Hogwarts to guide Harry through the tasks, and make sure /he/ is the one who reaches the Cup.

Or Voldemort and Co. need a better plan to get Harry to Little Hangleton.

***** Didn't Junior only get out of his father's Imperius thanks to Voldemort and Wormtail?So, without Wormtail, Voldemort would need more time getting back to the UK and releasing Barty, which would basically set his comeback a year later at least.

Actually, Voldemort coming back when Harry is a bit older would be a very interesting read.

Edit: Oh, and also, with a dead Wormtail, Sirius would never break out of Azkaban and no one would never learn of his innocence. (which is kinda depressing)

This was the 2nd time. The 1st was in the top box at the world cup when he took Harry's wand.
