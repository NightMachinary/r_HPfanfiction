...and caused him to shift in front of someone?

â€‹

As far as I'm aware no one has done this, and if they have I've either not found it in almost ten years of reading fanfiction or forgot.


** I'm pretty sure i've read one where he somehow managed to get through a whole year unharmed, and the Crookshanks got him on a train back to London and dropped him on the train tracks. Muggles found him, put his bones together with metal plates, and when he tried to transform back into a rat - the plates didn't went along and ripped him apart.\\
But i don't remember what fic that was, sadly.

** What if Crookshanks managed to catch Wormtail whilst he was sleeping, and actually just ate him. What would have happened in that case? How would dying in your Animagus form affect you? Sirius probably dies laughing finding out Wormtail was eaten by a Cat.

**** We don't know for certain. Mrs. Crouch didn't revert to herself when she died as her son in Azkaban, so I'm inclined to say that an animagus wouldn't revert either.

***** I've read fanfics where either happens though they mostly involved Rita Skeeter, though I think I did read one where Scabbers died in first year was buried and latter reverted back to Wormtail.
