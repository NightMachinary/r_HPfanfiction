** Firstly, [[/u/octoberriddle][u/octoberriddle]] 's post.

Secondly, why? Daphne is pretty much a blank slate. I don't care, I don't subscribe to these inane fandom clichés about this super boring princess trope. And neither should you. The only thing we know about canon Daphne is that she hung out, at times, with Pansy. That's it. Make of her character whatever you will. Drug addict, secretly in love with McGonagall, plays Gobstones with Filch, crossdressing Muggle-born, fence for illegally pleasurable sex-magic artefacts. It doesn't matter.

Your prompt shows that you feel the need to highlight Daphne being something that'd defy fandom expectations. You're wrong. If anything, you should strive to always subvert expectations of dusty old tropes.

*** Hillbilly also implies a subpar intelligence, which I'd love to read.

For some odd reason, it isn't palatable to read a dumb female character. People did it with Ron, but Daphne? She doesn't even show up in canon except for the OWLs and she hung out with Parkinson.

Still, I mean like Crabbe and Goyle smart.
