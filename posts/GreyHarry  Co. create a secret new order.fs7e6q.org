:END:
There was a fanfic that I read once where it featured Grey!Harry, maybe some political stuff, and Harry and Dumbledore became comrades against Voldemort while Harry was under Polyjuice....? Maybe? I don't remember much, so I am eternally grateful for anyone who finds it.


** Sounds like it could be linkffn(harry potter: dark memories by Blueowl)

  Voldemort didn't just give Harry some of his powers that night. He gave him all of his memories. With them, his allies and friends, Harry shall change the Wizarding World like no one ever before. LightHarry. GoodDumbledore. Chaotic magic. COMPLETE!

**** Yes! Yes, It is! As soon as I pulled down the chapter drop-down and saw the chapter 'In The Eye Of The Storm', I knew that this is the one I was looking for!

Thank you!

**** I don't think there was pairing during the story but in epilogue I think he was with Susan, they made family together or something like that
