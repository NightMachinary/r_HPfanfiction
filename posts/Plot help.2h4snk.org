So I'm doing outlining for a story in which diary Voldemort gets a body after second year. As far as harry is concerned there is no difference in for him. But, I have a dilemma, harry has a summer ahead of him and I don't like the idea of sitting around wasting 3 months, I also don't like thinly veiled power loading. Does anyone have any suggestions how I could organically give harry some useful skill over the summer.


** Why does it have to be useful? Maybe he takes up painting. Or the viola.

Maybe he gets tired of the Dursleys starving him and locking him up, and he decides to break out and steal food. The power that Voldemort knows not is the power of a catburglar.

Maybe Harry gets upset by his messy hair since Petunia always makes a big deal of it. He cuts his hair and likes the result, and he spends the summer cutting hair for Dudley's gang. He considers fleeing to Norway and becoming Scandinavia's finest magiskefris√∏r. This is, of course, Voldemort's weak spot, since Voldy is bald.

** Harry gets a job with Florean Fortescue. He improves his potions skills (at least when it comes to mixing flavours) and makes an impression on new students before they even get to Hogwarts, because everyone visiting Diagon Alley for the first time has to stop and catch their breath and have a bowl of ice cream.

** When he meets with the Minister and is told he'll be staying in Diagon Alley, Harry asks if he can possibly intern at the Ministry since surely he'll be safer from Black there than if left to his devices in the Alley.

From there, you could go any number of ways--have him work for Magical Law Enforcement (possibly meeting Tonks early, getting some Defense tuition on the side), work in the Dept. of Magical Transportation (Portkeys, Apparition), the Committee on Experimental Charms, the Department of Mysteries, etc. Lots of possibilities.

Wow, wow hold on a minute here. What exactly does this all mean? Did Ginny die? Is the school closed? Is Dumbledore sacked?? What happened to lockhart? Is the basilisk still out there? This little sentence has HUGE repercussions that cannot just be ignored or glossed over....

*** I'm sure they won't be. I'm also sure that Harry would still end up at the Dursleys that summer. There could be bombs falling on London and Death Eaters controlling the ICW and the UN and dogs and cats living in harmony and Harry would still have to spend his summers with the Dursleys.

**** As evidenced by Dumbledore telling Voldemort to go back to the orphanage when bombs were /literally/ being dropped in London.

** It's been a while, but he blows up his aunt marge and runs to the leaky cauldron around July 31st in the books, could do it earlier and have him helping out/learning from the shops in the Diagon.

Also, he could just have access to his class books and he actually reads and studies them. It'd at least help with theory and spell chaining.

Edit: Or he could start wandless magic.
