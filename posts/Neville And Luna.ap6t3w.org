I have been thinking this for a while but wasn´t sure but why do Luna & Neville never get married or get together because i think they would make an amazing couple to be honest i would love them to be a couple. Because like Neville says in the film he loves Luna so i was surprised that nothing happened between them i was quite upset.

What were your thoughts?


** One reading of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7900250/23/Raindrops-on-Roses][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7900250]]) (which is very firmly my headcannon of Neville) would tell you he is completely incompatible with Luna. Whereas he is more homely, father-of-family type, Luna is still slightly out there. They may be good friends, but I just applaud him being father of a barlady and living over the pub.

** I find it kinda annoying as a side pairing because it feels like most authors simply pair them up so that everyone has a partner because clearly, you have to date your future spouse before you become an adult, NO EXCEPTIONS! Luna/Ron gives me the same vibe.

IMO they also don't work as the main pairing (at least above a certain story length) because, in order to fully develop Luna as a character, you have to either make her insane or take away her "Lunaness". You can definitely write decent short stories with Luna, but the longer the story gets, the more difficult it gets to make sense of her character without either dropping what makes her endearing or embracing it, which makes her annoying in large doses.
