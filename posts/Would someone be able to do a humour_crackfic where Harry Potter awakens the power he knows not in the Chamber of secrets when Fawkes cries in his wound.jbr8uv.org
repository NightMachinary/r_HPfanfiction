The power in question is the unconscious manipulation of probability in order to keep himself and people he cares about safe - in the same way that Taylor has this power in the worm fic It Gets Worse linkffn(11651073).

To summarise the power, it can predict the future with a high degree of accuracy, and will make tiny changes to events so that when the time comes when someone chooses to harm Harry a tiny thing can be changed that causes the attempt to fail in increasingly more embarrassing/lethal ways depending on how seriously/often they tried to harm him.


** There was a story where Harry was doused in super concentrate luck potion and weird "coincidences" kept happening to people. If I remember correctly it was mostly written in an email or memo format but I can't remember the title.

Really digging your excellent story though. Thanks for mentioning it.

**** Yep, something like that, but more fleshed out, without an obvious cause, and without the extremely good luck on Harry's part.

  This is a Taylor Hebert centric story, starting just after the locker. Details after that are sketchy ...
