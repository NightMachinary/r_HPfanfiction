Literally anything. I've written two things, both HHr, one called ‘Smiles/Sorrows' which is HHr with a jealous Ginny, and one called ‘Cake Show' which is fluffy, features Harry after the war, and the two reuniting after several years.

** The fic I'm working on is based on the idea of a metaphormagus Harry (or fem Harry) being raised as a completely different person for the sake of their safety. I'd change Harry's grandparents to Charlus and Dorea for the sake of a blood connection to the Blacks, and make Harry raised by Cassiopiea Black (because I've always really liked that name.)

A concept I want to explore is some of the last surviving Blacks realizing their obsession with blood purity has actually kind of destroyed their family. The new generation starts taking steps back from that legacy, but struggles with the undeniable fact that their family has a history of being violent racist (and insane) bigots and the related reputation. I see a lot of Black family fics that white wash them, and I want to write something where historically the Blacks were awful but the new generation and some of the survivors are changing for the better.

I will probably never finish writing however because I'm not a very confident person and I get put off by the daunting task of actually writing it all, but I have ideas, that's /almost/ the same thing.

** I've been writing a Slytherin Harry fic. It involves a lot of exploration of Magical and Muggle history (particularly the more grim and gruesome episodes), and Hogwarts is at the centre of it all. It DOES feature a re-imagined Voldemort, a bunch of OCs, and a good Dumbledore. It DOESN'T feature slavish canon rehash, Slytherin child politics, and a more general dependency on the overused Slytherin fic tropes.

I wrote about 50k words in March-April, but I don't know how much I still have to write. Safe to say that there's a long way to go before I'll publish, but I'm liking my progress so far!

** I've been working on the 18th chapter of my /My Hero Academia/ fic /Fire and Blood/, plus three separate HP plot bunnies that I'm 100% sure I wouldn't have had, if I hadn't been lurking on this sub so much.

One is called /Convergence/, it's a crossover between HP and /Skyrim/.

Another is /A Foot in Both Worlds/, wherein Harry leaves Britain and joins the FBI. It's a crossover with /The X-Files/.

The third involves Loki not falling off of the Bifrost, and being sent to Earth as punishment. He's incarnated as, you guessed it, Harry James Potter.

** Little disjointed bits of my WIPs. Part three of a series, although part one is unpopular and part two is barely outlined.

I started an original novel a little while ago, set in the “present day” in my hometown of NYC, since it's a lot of work to look up what Great Britain was like in the 1920s, so I figured this would be easier. Now I read the news about NYC and I can't write anything. I wonder if I should declare it a period piece, set in the historical pre-plague era.

** I'm writing a Slytherin Harry fic where Harry is a child prodigy, the same way Tom riddle was. I have high hopes for the fic, but between online classes and helping around in the house I'm bot finding much time for it.

** I decided to try to write one of those dimension travel things, the whole "falling through the veil" thing. It's HHr, and I think it's looking pretty good so far. I only have 5 chapters out right now, but it's been a lot of fun to write.

Maybe I shouldn't have started to post it yet, though. I still haven't finished planning the damned thing.

Also, I'm very disappointed in myself. I impulsively put some Snily in the fic and I'm disgusted by it, but since I've already posted it, I can't really take it back.
