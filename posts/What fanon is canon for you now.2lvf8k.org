Daphne being the ice queen and Tracey being a bubbly half-blood. It's irrationally weird to me when these two aren't as described above, and friends. Even in fics where they're barely mentioned.

Susan was raised by her Aunt Amelia. IIRC canon only goes so far as to say that she is Amelia's niece, but never actually specifies that she was raised by her.

*** DAYD is problematic for me. On one side, I appreciate the attempt at making everything gritty and dark without being moronic and angst-ridden. It is a good read and well written (though it fails on "show, don't tell" on too many occasions to be super top-tier). On the other hand, while I think the interpretation of Snape being an unrepentant sadist is fair enough... he's just not particularly smart in that story. No matter his goals, he could have (easily) been more competent at achieving them with a few hours of thought behind his actions - which while we readers don't apply (well, readers that aren't me, since I'm obsessive that way), he would have.

I suppose my biggest problem with the story is how out of place it feels next to JKR's writing, where even at the darkest hours, there was a sense of wonder and magic. DAYD tries too hard to be a Batman Begins and not enough a Harry Potter. Otherwise, I could point at my nitpick and wave it off with the classic "wizards lack an ounce of logic" (though even when Hermione said that, she meant that Snape was an exception).

I've never read that particular concept. But it fits with my notion of Snape, who wants /nothing/ to do with teaching, and would much prefer a quick charm and dismissal to dealing with students any more than necessary. He just wants to brew potions, but finds himself trapped at Hogwarts by Dumbledore's (Machinations|Protection|lack of work for former DEs|etc depending on the type of fic).

***** I don't think Snape would hurt anyone, and I'd even go so far as to say that he probably isn't /that/ bad a person (not like Lucius Malfoy or Peter Pettigrew)... but may very well be a sadist. Just unlikely to mix business with pleasure (at least beyond insults) - he didn't hex Sirius, students seem like a stretch. For someone who had as little as he did in his life, I doubt he'd betray his office (which was essentially bequeathed to him by Dumbledore /and/ given by Voldemort) like that.

My problem with DAYD is that his actions have no pattern other than to show "Snape is evil, hurr", which serves no purpose. If he'd want to galvanize the students into an army, there were better ways. If he'd want to cow the students, there were better ways. If he'd want to exert his power on a power trip, there were better ways. His actions, in this context, add up to "Snape had no plan and gave no thought to long term goals", which is Bellatrix/Fenrir/Carrow territory (because of insanity/animalism/stupidity respectively, none of which are characteristics of Snape).

Would he use memory charms? Even if he had, he'd be smarter about it than what was presented in DAYD... where Snape is just a tool to show how brave Neville is. Even if you think that Snape is a monster, he's a different form of monster than what was presented here - he could have been replaced with Bellatrix and things would have been exactly the same, and that's just bad characterization.

Another few points: the Fidelius Charm can only be applied to a location (and only with the consent of the owner, at that).

Neville is just as powerful as Harry, except he's working with a contentious wand and significant confidence issues.

Arthur Weasley is not an idiot or hen-pecked, and in fact he uses his interest in muggle technology to help put the muggle-raised (Harry, the Grangers) at ease.

Basically if a story breaks one or more of these rules, we're automatically dealing with an AU, and I have to distrust all normal assumptions about how magic (and human behavior) works.

I agree with everything but this. Snape in that fic is too flawless, everything bad he did in canon is explained perfectly. Heck, even his big fight with Lily was just a misunderstanding iirc and the Marauders are non-existant for most of it.

**** That's where the 'most of' applies- all the pre-Hogwarts to 1975 backstory is great, but it whitewashes his interactions with the Marauders, Lily and especially Harry. If you take it as 'just as flawed by viewpoint as canon', it works.

EDIT: Lol, misread the thread title. Thought it said "What is canon for you now?"

*In my view, canon is:*

1 Books 1-7

=2 Fantastic Beasts

=2 Quidditch Through the Ages

=2 Tales of Beedle the Bard

5 Pottermore

*Basically, it has to be:*

a) published

b) in an official source

c) coming directly from JKR herself

d) not contradicting something higher up in the hierarchy

*Not canon:*

Interviews (not official source, occasionally contradicts the books)

Movies (not from JKR herself, definitely contradicts the books)

Video games (not from JKR herself, definitely contradicts the books)

*** In my headcanon, enchantment requires a mix of symbology to sustain the Charms that would otherwise fade. It's referred to as Runes even though it isn't exclusively derived from Norse script systems.

A perfect transfiguration is permanent, but charms won't last without something to 'remind the universe' that the magic should stay in effect.

Ancient Runes as a class, however, isn't about enchantment so much as the history of enchantment; what the base symbology was that led to the modern versions of Runes used for enchantment as learned in NEWT-level charms class.

It's like learning Pascal and Fortran and the original C coding language. You don't need it to build a website, but it teaches the fundamental building blocks and enables the student to look at old code (like the Curses in an Egyptian tomb, for example) and know what it meant.
