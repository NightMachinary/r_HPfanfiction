I'm looking for fics with fights where characters fight with words as much as their weapons. Think the Sword fight from The Princess Bride, for example. It can be insulting ("You're a mean old Dark Lord!"), persuasive ("join our side please!"), performative ("Look how terribly it's going for the other person!"), or whatever else. Just looking for any fic with battle banter, no matter the topic or intent. :)

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. Basically, anything goes. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

  Hermione Granger, master spy, and Severus Snape, spymaster to the Order. An unlikely partnership, forged to defeat the Dark Lord on his own ground. But to do so, they must confront their own darkness within. Spying, torture, angst and love. AU after fifth

***** Heh. In my experience, non-native English speakers tend to speak better English than the locals. :)

But thanks, that's a good endorsement for it.

** You mean something so absurd as:

  “I have nothing more to say to you, Potter,” he said quietly. “You have irked me too often, for too long. AVADA KEDAVRA!”
#+end_quote

"irked me"? WTF? Ginny and Harry in “Wallpaper Moments by St Margarets” linksiye(2036) made fun from this word a lot.
