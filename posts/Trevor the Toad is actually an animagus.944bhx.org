This is both a prompt and a request - after all, the actual animagus-pet was extremely boring and just slept all the time....whereas not even the cats seemed as adventurous as Trevor. What if he were a spy? Or a thief? Or a really determined researcher who'd been banned from the (apparently amazing) Library for whatever reason?


** What if Trevor is really Nicholas Flamel watching over the Philosopher's Stone? I could certainly see that being a cool little plot twist.

** Maybe he's a humanimagus. A magic toad that has learned to take on wizard form. This is why he is never revealed during sweeps for regular animagus.

*** There are sweeps for animagi? I can't believe that, or Rita would have been caught.

What if he was a person, turned into a toad, and was trying to find a way to fix himself. Or send a message.

**** I would presume that hogwarts itself was swept for such at least once. Likely as a precaution while looking for Sirius. Rita would have just not been there.

***** A sweep for animaguses during the hunt for Sirius? I thought Remus didn't actually tell Dumbledore, and then why didn't Pettigrew get caught?

I suppose there could have been sweeps afterwards though, just in case there was any more of them. I can't remember if Trevor was mentioned after Philosopher's Stone though.

*** That would be interesting. We already know the benefits of an owl or a cat. Hedwig carried letters, and also protected Harry. Mrs Norris was incredibly smart for a non kneazle, and served as a spy and warning system. What would a toad have? I don't know anything about them.

**** Well, in D&D, a toad familiar gives +3 hit points. Not a huge deal, really, compared to a +3 to a skill check or a +2 on a saving throw.\\
Aside from that, you have frogs being traditionally a symbol of fertility (strange, the Weasleys should have had toads), they provide rejuvenation in Chinese medicine, some supposedly possess a toadstone which wards against poison, while on the flip side toads as witch familiars were supposedly used to cause poisoning.

The only thing the Harry Potter wikia says for them is that they're apparently useful for testing potions on.

**** Prince of Slytherin mentions Trevor as a poisonous frog, but maybe you could run with it further. Trevor is like "weights" in DBZ, and by learning to cast magic while close to Trevor, Neville becomes stronger in the long run.

** There was a Harry Potter/Naruto crossover where Trevor was one of the toad summons who'd been spending a few years "training" in the HP-verse as Neville's familiar. Can't remember the name of it though.

** It would also be cool if Trevor was a human forcably transfigured into a toad, and explains the multitude of escapes as him just looking for help.

Edit: road into toad.
