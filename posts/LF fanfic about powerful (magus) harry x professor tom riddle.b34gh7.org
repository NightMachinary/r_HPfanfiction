It was on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] at some point in time but no longer there! Here's all the info I know:

- I think the title was something like 'magus' where Harry was powerful, did not require a wand to do magic as he 'was magic'.
- Tom Riddle is a professor and teaches Harry to control his power
- There is a neutral magus involved somewhere.......
- Harry breaks Lupin (and more werewolves?) out of prison
- Harry is able to 'unweave' wards

Hope that helps!! Would love to find as I just remembered it and would love to reread.
