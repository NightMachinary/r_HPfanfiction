** My go-to for smutty reading is OracleObscured.

Linkffn(Teaching Miss Granger) is...incredibly smutty and also very well-written.

linkffn(Getting Personal by OracleObscured) is also very smutty. Less so than TMG, but yeah. The Snape in this one is a bit milder - still in character but he's had some time to mellow from the much harsher Snape in TMG (the stories are not set in the same 'verse, but TMG takes place in and immediately after Hermione's seventh year, while GP takes place several years post-war and incorporates details from DH).

I love both stories and the smut is fantastic, but I prefer the characterization in GP over TMG, just because I find the Snape in TMG kind of terrifying (he's not a /bad person/ he's just...well, I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with him, no matter how good he is in bed, or against the wall, or on the floor, or over the desk...)

linkao3(Getting Past Broken by TycheSong) is also very well-written, beautifully in-character and the smut is great.

** I wouldn't call it the filthiest (although it is messed up in places), but this fic has one of best characterizations of Snape I have ever seen. It's also probably the most realistic in regards to sex and him not being a sex god, turning super nice for no reason like most other smut fics make him out to be or forgetting that he is kind of emotionally messed up. Its an amazing character study of him at times. Hermione and everyone else is also very in character, with lots of perfect dialogue and interactions. Linkao3(Hermione Granger and the intended vessels).

It's only very smutty in the beginning though, although the smut is quite explicit with a good amount of dubcon. It really does have some great writing and has a really well thought out plot line (especially considering the entire premise is just bizarre at times) and turns into an awesome AU fic with a decent amount of world building, action and twists and turns.

  ((originally posted elsewhere as "Bride of the Potions Professor")) Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.The guilt from killing Draco is bad enough, and knowing she saved Dumbledore doesn't help it, but when a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. But, of course, she's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

** A majority of my favorite fics contain some helpings of smut, but I can't think of many I'd label "smut fics." Sometimes the porn is a small percentage of the total fic, but if it's surrounded by UST and emotional complexity, it's way hotter to me than a fic that's purely smutty. Character studies with sex, maybe? So I can offer a few examples, but I'm not sure they're filthy enough or have a high enough smut content to comply with your request.

I can think of a couple of others that aren't exactly in character but are more smut-focused, but I won't link them unless you're curious.

With one exception, these all involve Snape, and they're all slash.

linkao3(154785; 1128354; 12046410; 10637565; 520098; 69622; 205792)

One of those is a self-rec, which I hope you don't mind, since I can't, as the author, vouch for how well-written or in-character it is. But I figure whatever isn't to your taste you'll just skip anyway, so it shouldn't be too much of an imposition.

  When an illicit book comes into his life by chance, seventeen-year-old Severus Snape discovers sex magic (or the next best thing to it). He embarks on an experiment (for entirely academic purposes), enlisting the caretaker as an unsuspecting but eager test subject (for purely pragmatic reasons), only to find the results more interesting than even he hypothesized.

*** If you like Snape slash you should check out linkao3(Of a Linear Circle). It's not my usual type of story, but it is very well written.

The smut is minimal but turns up now and then. Great story and great characters though. It's a multi part story. Three parts done so far. The author updates regularly.

**** Thanks, I'll take a look! I recently started reading a fic by flamethrower and wandered away after three chapters or so, but I'm willing to give most authors another try.

Smut isn't a requirement (unless it's all about the UST and then fades to black - that's just frustrating), but if the author's good at it, it's a nice bonus.
