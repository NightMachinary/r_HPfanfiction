  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.

  Well... Harry is pissed, his relatives tipped his inner balance, so he snapped and turned dark. Yes, this is a very dark!Harry story. This is also going to be HarryBellatrix. So if you don't like it, don't read it. Contains also some graphic violence.
