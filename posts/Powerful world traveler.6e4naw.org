** No. I'm planing to write one, because I have the same itch, and think I could satisfy it if I invest enough time, but it's so much work. I loved "A long journey home" and searched for a while for good world-travelling fics, but came up empty. So I wanted to make my own. And now I understand why rakeesh updates so slow.

I have some ideas for a general story, several sub-stories, more ideas for potential settings I think are interesting to explore, but:

I've only been to three continents, and of Asia only a small part of India, and that has been four years ago. But the research I'd have to do for the 2000s India living, old myths for the region I plan to have to story play in, capturing the feeling of that place as well as rakeesh can do it hard - and that doesn't even mention my technical skill at writing, which isn't too great.

And then you still have to come up with believable /characters/ of that region, which I personally find the hardest.

Basically: A story like that would need a huge amount of research, optimally travel to /see/ and /feel/ the place that it's super-hard to do, which is why it's basically the rarest kind of fan-fiction that still exists, with two good stories.

So it's quite daunting, and I'm only making notes at the moment.

** HP and Dumbledore do bit of travelling together around the world for a bit of it.

linkffn(Magicks of the arcane)

This trilogy doesn't have a powerful Harry touring the globe but its about him being raised by Sirius whilst globetrotting.

linkffn)[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4062601/1/The-Wise-One-Book-One-Becoming]])

This fic is a crack fic to the core but it involves HP travelling the world with a hell of a lot of luck.

** There's lots of travelling in [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327625][Starfall]] the sequel to [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327625][Ignite]] . It's not a time-travel nor are the characters particularly powerful but the author did a really good of creating some fascinating magical history/culture (and in some ways it reminds me of A Long Journey Home).
