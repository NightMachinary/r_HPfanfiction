Preferably some sort of time travel where she goes back in time to kill Harry but ends up falling for him instead but I wont be picky. I would like either completed or still in progress (as in going to be completed/ last update was less than a year ago/updated on a regular basis )


** Cursed Child was so shite that even the most terrible of fanfiction writers won't touch it with a ten foot pole. That's how bad it is.

Which is a shame: a reimagined Delphini Riddle character going back into the past to try to foil Harry from stopping her father, only to realize that her dad was a complete cunt? And eventually falls for Harry?

"Huh... so you're telling me you're Voldemort's daughter."

Deli nodded at him, swallowing her apprehension as best as she could. She was surprised when he boyfriend started to giggle.

"So, I not only killed the evil bastard, I'm dating, fucking, and am in love with his daughter. Oh, sweet Merlin, if that's not the greatest revenge, I don't know what is!"

She froze. "Love?"

He froze. "...I used the L word too early, haven't I?"

And that, dear readers, would be relationship angst destined for another time, another place...

Oh man, the insults...

"And now, Harry Potter, you will die."

"Yeah well, I'm fucking your daughter, so there."

*** Yeah I never got around to reading cursed child because it's set up as a place but I always found Delphini's base character interesting

** Unfortunately there are no good fics for this pairing. I suspect it's mainly because people don't like CC

*** I knew it was a long shot the closest thing I ever found was one where bellatrix was good(ish) and Delphi was more of an OC. And it wasn't even that pairing. I think it was Damaged Raven

  Not all wars are black and white, as Harry learns when the second war with Voldemort seems to be painted in nothing but shades of grey. In which Harry is confused, Tonks is overwhelmed, Barty is a genius, Snape hates everyone, Dumbledore is trying his best, and Voldemort is having the time of her life. fem!Voldemort

** Is just daughter of Voldemort okay? it's a bit of a spoiler I suppose, but anyone could've guessed it in the first chapters.
