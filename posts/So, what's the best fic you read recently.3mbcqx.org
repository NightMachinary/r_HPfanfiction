Shadow of Angmar is looking very promising. LotR crossover. Harry is not too overpowered. Actually he is basically reduced to potions at this point since he has no wand. The OC's are likeable for now and the representation of Middle-Earth is well done.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew and Harry's inherent nobility leave a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature Harry bearing more effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance...

  When Sirius Black ran away from home, it was the result of five years of being tugged between his Dark family and Light friends. Contrary to what he told Harry, nothing about choosing sides had been easy. He was just an excellent liar, especially about his mixed loyalties, his Dark past, and his role as the Dark's most successful spy. (Sirius's early Hogwarts years.)

We don't have editors and betas don't find everything, so I look over that on a regular basis. I even look over there/their mistakes and other things that some users find unbearable. Its just when stuff like Occlumency is spelled wrong, I cringe super hard. I cringe even harder when well known names get slaughtered. Sirius Orian Black was just not ok.
