I'm in the mood for one of those cheesy reading the books series, but all the ones I can find have been abandoned before they actually read them up to the point the story is based at.


** This series has finished the first 6 books, and started on Deathly Hallows. Last updated a week ago.

  Harry is lost back in time with four people he felt he really should remember...with no memory and only seven books to find out the truth of his life, before it's too late to save his new family. A reading the book series with no actual book usage, for a copy that does contain parts of the book easier to follow along, shoot me your email address and I'll send it along. UPDATE 02/23/21- This particular book has been edited by yours truly to try and get rid of some of the egregious grammar mistakes. If you'd like me to send you the updated copy, feel free to ask. Also, if you ever spot a spelling or grammar mistake you'd like me to edit for future republishings I email out, feel free to let me know.
