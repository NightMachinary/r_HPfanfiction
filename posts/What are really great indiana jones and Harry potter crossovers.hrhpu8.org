** Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider. Sort of. linkffn(13052802)

There's also a sequel that's probably closer to what you're asking for, but you should read it in order :P

#+begin_quote
  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.
