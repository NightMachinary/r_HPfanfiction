Harry Potter tossed down his quill and stood, stretching, a grimace stretching his face as his back popped loudly enough Hermione's cat, Princess Mjolnir of the Stars, awoke with a start. "Sorry, Molly," Harry muttered then grabbed up his briefcase, stuffing essays into it. "Let's go to dinner."

As he walked the halls of Hogwarts---followed closely by the kneazle, students nodded politely and/or got out of his way. Known for six years now as The Daemon of Devon, Harry had pulled down a satellite, using its kinetic potential to destroy a cabal of dark wizards and their servants and the town they had overrun, earning himself the new nickname and an official unofficial warning from the ICW: "Stick to teaching, you go too big!"

Harry had been happy to be exiled back to Hogwarts.

His twin girls with Hermione were starting at Hogwarts the next year while his and Tonks' son---from a one-night affair caused by a lust and fertility potion slipped to all three[Hermione's muggle birth control had protected her]while they were meeting in a private room at Rosmerta's---was graduating this year. Teddy, Tonks and Remus's son, was a fourth year in Gryffindor.

As he walked past his son---a Ravenclaw---he flicked the boy's hair and he smirked as the lad swiped at Harry.

He took his seat and nodded at Neville as he sat down as well. "Where's Hermione?"

"Ministry Library, last she said," he replied. "Shacklebolt gave her access to finish her monograph's research. And she's checking on some stuff for me."

Everyone knew Harry was researching something but he refused to speak about it to anyone. All they knew was that he was discussing it with American and Japanese wizards and had somehow finagled a time-turner to help in his research and it involved enchanting. The fact he was the DADA professor led most to believe he was building weapons of some sort.

** What is 'freewriting?'

- Stretching 2x in the first sentence is repetitive.

- ^{that} between enough and Hermione's.

- It's a Kneazle or a cat. Pick one, but if it's a Kneazle then capitalise it.

- 'Grabbed up his briefcase' sounds strange. Try picked up or grabbed.

- 'Daemon of Devon' sounds like power/darkwank.

- 'Pulled down a satellite...' .... wat

- You've set off a series with 'and' 2x. I'd suggest using commas instead.

- 'You go too big!' I have no idea what this means.

- So Harry has three kids by two different women? Right. Because Hermione is definitely the type of person who would stomach infidelity.

- Lust/fertility potion: Yucky plot device that removes all agency from your characters.

I kinda stopped reading after this, sorry. It's incredibly hard to follow, none of the thoughts seem to flow well together, and the characterizations seem /extremely/ strange. Is this the point of 'freewriting?'

***** Because i explicitly said i forgot what it was about and asked for suggestions ABOUT WHAT DIRECTION TO TAKE IT, my reply and downvote were warranted.

****** No. You just ask: 'Suggestions?' Nothing at all regarding:

#+begin_quote
  ABOUT WHAT DIRECTION TO TAKE IT
#+end_quote

You've used god-awful tropes, poor grammar, and terrible characterizations.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Downvote away, then. But if you can't take criticism, you're never going to improve.

******** u/MacsenWledig:
#+begin_quote
  "forgot what it's supposed to be about"
#+end_quote

Does not easily lead to

#+begin_quote
  ABOUT WHAT DIRECTION TO TAKE IT
#+end_quote

I'm glad you're doubling down on the snark, though. Shows that you're not really interested in getting help.
