I'm sure we've all read a few time travel fics. Usually they seem to involve a character travelling back and ending up in the consciousness of their younger self... possibly with allies in a similar situation. Sometimes they're a bit more like The Cursed Child in that you end up with independent physical bodies (which, outside of HP fanfics, is definitely the more common form of time travel... compare Days of Future Past with Looper, Back to the Future, Endgame, Doctor Who, Primer, Deja Vu or Deadpool 2). Similarly, most time travel fics eventually end up being anti-Voldemort stories that become increasingly divergent from canon.

However, I was wondering about time travel fics where the time travellers accidentally end up in an AU. So, not like The Gates of Azkaban where they know they're going to an AU but, instead, where they deliberately try to travel back to an earlier point in their own timeline only to discover they're in an AU (sort of like Back to the Future 2 with the 2015 to 1985 journey in the rich Biff timeline).

I think this would be a fairly rich concept in the sense that whatever plan the travellers have is now complicated by their future knowledge perhaps being completely irrelevant. So, that gives rise to a "discovering the world" phase before moving on to trying to carry out the original plan or, alternatively, trying to get back to their reality.

I tagged this as a discussion but it's sort of that juncture between prompt, discussion and request.


** I really want to see this taken to the extreme, Harry sends his consciousness back in time in an attempt to save everyone who died, but ends up in the body of like... CoffeeAU!Harry and has to work at starbucks, while trying to undermine Tom, his asshole manager.

*** Wow, I need to read this. This is great. I am imagining a power play between Tom and Albus two managers within the same district and they both want to become district managers. Tom is the penny pinching, charge for tap water, corporate loving manager while Albus is the make the cafe like a home, free refills, customers are your family, let the homeless guy bathe in the bathroom kind of manger.

**** Harry just want's to Avada Kedavra Tom and be done with it, but he doesn't have magic in this body, so he'll have to settle for getting him fired. Unfortunately, Tom is blackmailing corporate, and can't be fired until harry finds and destroys the 7 pieces of evidence Tom has hidden around the store.

***** Yes, but then he finds out that he's not the only one on Tom's case. Ron and Hermione, have been closely monitoring one of their neighboring cafe's managers (Tom), due to the fact that Ron's dad knows some of the higher people and heard rumors that they were being blackmailed. They bonded over the mystery of Tom Riddle. When Harry finds out, he's (somewhat) thrilled that he gets to go on an adventure with them, just like the old times.

And so, they collect and destroy or do whatever they do with the 6 pieces of evidence they've collected. But they're stuck on the 7th. Where could it be? Right before he goes to sleep, Harry has an epiphany. In his magical world, HE was the last horcrux, so he had to confront Voldemort so he could destroy it.

That means that Harry would have to confront his manager.

Hope someone DOES write this. RemindMe! 1 week

I'm not so sure about that. Most of time travel stories that I've read have been about just the mind going back in time. Thought I do read lot of isekai manga, but it's also common trope in alternate history fiction. It's even used in regular scifi like The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August by Claire North.

** One thing thay I've been thinking about lately is, once the person goes back and time and changes things aren't they in an AU? Also if they go back and the act of them going back changes something are they considered in an AU or just going back in time? Like in Harry Potter and the Gift of Time.

*** I'm a little iffy on the difference between "canon divergence" and "AU" but what this post is about is definitely a situation where the past is different to the time traveller's memories even before they start changing things. The best comparison I know is The Gates of Azkaban where Harry, Snape and Ginny know they're going to a first war marriage law AU. The difference between that and this concept, though, is that the time traveller here was trying to get to their own past without any AU elements.

For sake of argument... imagine an AU where Harry and Ginny disappeared so Hermione and Ron decide to travel back in time in order to prevent their disappearance. Naturally, Romione's intentions are to stay in the same timeline/universe they left from but just at an earlier point. However, they end up in, say, the coffeeshop AU as mentioned elsewhere in the thread.

The traditional time travel fic would have Romione arrive and maybe they accidentally squish Umbridge or something on the landing. So now they have to either fill in for Umbridge so they can save Hinny or they have to allow the universe to realise Umbridge's been squished and risk never discovering what caused Hinny to disappear. We might, for clarity, call this situation a time travel caused divergence plot rather than an AU in a coffeeshop or even Lord Hadrian Potter-Black or female!Ron etc sense. But, again, I'm not sure how people use the term. Is a Slytherin!Ginny fic canon divergence or AU or both?

It's a WIP but I don't think it's abandoned (updated in September).

I think it's pretty good... there's a cool action sequence at a wedding for example... and I think it has a fairly complex attitude to several oft bashed characters (most notably Ron and Dumbledore). However, I also think it's a bit too sympathetic to Snape, which isn't really my cup of tea.
