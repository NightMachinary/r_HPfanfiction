So, recently I've really wanted to read something where Snape is a vampire. Only problem? I can't find one that isn't /really/ creepy. Seems most of them are Snape/Harry or Snape/Hermione pairings, which I don't read because... well... the whole adult/child thing weirds me out as much as the teacher/student thing. My other issue seems to be length. As in, I strongly prefer fics at least 80,000 words or greater. (I actually prefer between 200,000-350,000, but then I'm one of those +freaks+ people who reads the Wheel of Time books).

Am I just plum out of luck?


** I think your post title is kind of funny. Vampires are creepy, Snape is creepy, put them together and it better not be creepy. I get what you mean, of course, creepy like pedophilia, but... It may be harder than average to find what you're looking for, considering the track record of vampire-centric stories.

That said, I'll be keeping an eye on this thread because I'm curious to see if there is anything good!
