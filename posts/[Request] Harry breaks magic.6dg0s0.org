Any fic like linkffn(12026631) where they tells Harry that magic has limits/rules but he's like "fuck that, its magic" and makes magic his bitch?

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

** Excerpt from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/5/Blindness][Blindness]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/717542/AngelaStarCat][AngelaStarCat]]

  If this worked, Harry should write a paper on it. They could get /published/. Maybe create a false name and submit their research to the Transfiguration Board.

  But Harry didn't care about any of that. He wanted to create life, for some reason, probably because the magical world said it was not possible.

  Anything their books claimed was not possible had become their next problem to solve.

  "A challenge, not an impossibility," He would declare, and Hermione would know to purchase yet another notebook for yet another project.

  Already they had defeated several key principles of Charm theory, discovered wand movements were basically unnecessary if visualization was done properly, and created several new theories regarding transfiguration, two of which had been tested that very afternoon.

In this one Harry is blind but have a weird sight. He starts using magic without a formal education and in later chapters can do stuff most claims impossible.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is Worthy of Magic and who isn't.

** Breaking magic- struck me as akin to Lev Grossman's Fillory (bookverse), Quentin having to fix the small things and put the world back together etc. I think I'd like to read a Harry Potter riff on that. Reciprocal Potterverse/ Fillory intertextuality.

Magic starting to leak from the world through the veil, as Death attempts to draw the hallows back into his realm. Voldemort is the big bad akin to Martin Chatwin/ the beast but then magic itself seems to be trickling away, endangering Hogwarts and so forth. Diverting but half baked notion...
