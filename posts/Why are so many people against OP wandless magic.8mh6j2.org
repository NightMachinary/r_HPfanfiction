I can definitely understand if the wandless magic is OP, without Harry (or any other character) working hard to become OP. Furthermore, I can understand if the wandless magic is inconsistent/poorly-written/"cheap" etc.

Yet, it seems as though a lot of readers don't like OP wandless magic as a whole, even if the magic is well thought-out, not a massive cop-out, and the character's struggle with learning the magic is frequently shown. Why not have the character (e.g. Harry) travel across the globe, fail time and time again at wandless magic, before triumphing in many aspects, while still continuing to learn? Moreover, I guess that brings me to another point regarding crossovers: why have Harry stick with wanded magic, if he can learn wandless magic e.g. a la Doctor Strange?

Overall, it seems as though OP wanded magic gets a pass far often than wandless.

** It's because wands are a tool. Just because you can dig a hole with your hands doesn't mean that it is somehow better than digging a hole with a spade.

Wandless magic should be for emergencies or convenience as a way to perform simple actions when your character is without a wand. Wands can help make magic easier and more precise, which is why everyone uses them. This idea that not using a tool will enable you to do everything with your mind, while everyone else is just relying on a crutch is just weird.

I'm of the opinion that wandless magic should be for simple actions that can be brute forced. e.g. summon an object to your hand, or push something away from you. There is no way that complicated magic should be done wandlessly using just your mind.

**** Right, but she also specifically mentions that their specialisms lie outside of Transfiguration and Charms, which you need a wand to be really good at:

#+begin_quote
  Uagadou graduates are especially well versed in *Astronomy, Alchemy and Self-Transfiguration*.

  The wand is a European invention, and while African witches and wizards have adopted it as a useful tool in the last century, many spells are cast simply by pointing the finger or through hand gestures.

#+begin_quote
  The magic wand originated in Europe. Wands channel magic so as to make its effects both more precise and more powerful, although it is generally held to be a mark of the very greatest witches and wizards that they have also been able to produce wandless magic of a very high quality. As the Native American Animagi and potion-makers demonstrated, wandless magic can attain great complexity, *but Charms and Transfiguration are very difficult without one*.

** Aesthetically, wands are a major characteristic of the HP magic system and it feels very different wandless. I don't mind wandless magic in the sense of using other tools to perform magic (e.g. potions), but "bare hands" magic always feels very different. I think you can get away with it for some things (magic which is invisible, largely), but any kind of "shooting spells out of your hands" is I think a very different aesthetic.

Functionally, it also seems almost pointless. If you have been disarmed in a duel, 99% of the time it means that your opponent is better at magic than you. So being able to continue the fight without a wand isn't going to allow you to win. Its application is really limited to situations where the opponent underestimates you because they think you cannot perform magic and you're able to surprise them.

*** The best way I've seen magic done with no wands (in my opinion) is in Steelbadger's Shadow of Angmar. Harry is in Middle earth with no wand and has to figure out how to do magic. He ends up with a) the best potions system I've ever seen, and b) a staff like Gandalfs that doesn't make him OP. He has to really work for it to figure out how to do magic, and it doesn't always work for him.

** Well, if I had to give my thougths on this I would say that there are two main reasons:

1) Pavlovian reflex: there are sooooooooooooo many bad OP wandless Harry fics, when you have been a reader of this fandom for a certain amount of time, you can't help but associate the idea of it with bad, sloppy, cheesy, powerwankin' writing.

2) The difficulty to have a sound plot structure with good opposition when using this trope. Because let's face it: if you remove the wand and keep the power level the same, it's pointless. So you gotta crank it to eleven and make Harry at least a minor god compared to other wizards. Then in order to have significant opposition, you have to make other minor god characters or upgrade existing ones. Unless your fic is all about how awesome Harry is and it is a veritable tragedy that everyone doesn't just bend the knee in his presence (classic powerwank, pointless and childish, has been done to death already and often very badly).\\
So in order to get that opposition you have to change the world a lot (and expose it very well to the reader). That's just a massive amount of work and for what payoff, I wonder, considering the fact that the whole point of Harry Potter is that there are wizards, so, already minor gods compared to muggles. I mean if you realy want that vibe for your story (or parts of it), just make the MC interact with muggles; You can even make wizards rarer.

In the end, I think that for all the reasons I've listed, the concept can only apply well to crossovers... but then again, a good writer can make everything work, just like a bad writer can shit the bed with the best idea in the world.

*So, to summarize: Because most of them are crap.*

** I think the weirder thing is when people act like wandless magic was something reserved for only the greatest wizards, such as Dumbledore/Grindelwald/Voldemort. Similarly, some people act as if wandless magic used by anyone other than Dumbledore/Grindelwald/Voldemort is exclusive only to the movies and other non-canonical stuff.

Even though in the books, both Lupin and Snape perform wandless magic in PoA. Lupin conjures a ball of blue fire in his hands for light; Snape straight up uses Incarcerous without his wand by snapping his fingers, a NEWT-level spell given the fact its considered Conjuration. Back in the first book, Quirrell also used Incarcerous on Harry when he tried to escape.

Both spells used can obviously be used in a duel, so wandless magic isn't restricted to passive, non-combat spells like Accio. Wandless magic is like non-verbal magic in that any spell can be performed non-verbally (yes, that also includes the Unforgivable Curses), any spell can be performed without a wand.

Remember that all that wands do is make certain spells easier and more efficient, such as some wands being good for Charms, others being good for Transfiguration, etc. In other words, Dumbledore/Voldemort/Grindelwald could wandlessly perform any spell that they could with a wand and just as easily. The only thing that using a wand does is make spells more efficient, such as making their Charms or their Conjured item last longer.

Even then, the only time that someone like Dumbledore would negatively be impacted by not using their wand would be if they were dueling Voldemort or Grindelwald. The likes of Dumbledore/Voldemort/Grindelwald are so far above the calibur of even elite witches and wizards (e.g. Snape. McGonagall, Bellatrix, etc) that the disadvantages of not using a wand wouldn't change the outcome of a duel whatsoever. I'd wager that Dumbledore wouldn't need a wand to wipe the floor with multiple Death Eaters, nor would Voldemort need a wand to curbstomp multiple members of the Order. In Voldemort's case, I'd argue that if he just went wandless during his final duel with Harry, he would have instantly won. The Elder Wand couldn't turn on him if he wasn't using it, and Voldemort would have beat Harry in DH if he either used his original Yew wand or if he just went wandless.

However the likes of Snape and Lupin still need a wand because they can't afford to not use a wand. While talented, neither of them are significantly more skilled than the opponents that they could defeat them without a wand (though in Snape's case, this likely excluding Lockhart and HBP Harry). Unless a witch or wizard is in the same tier as Dumbledore/Voldemort/Grindelwald, or if that witch or wizard is vastly superior to their opponent, wandless magic isn't any better than wand magic.

Mostly it is, at least o utside of very brief things. Incarcerous is not a NEWT spell just because it's conjuration. Draco conjured a snake (without any apparent difficulty) in his second year so Incarcerous might be one such easy spell (Edit: nvm, wiki says it's a NEWT spell).

But as an example, Riddle could intentionally use a bunch of wandless magic before he entered Hogwarts: controlling people (or maybe it was just animals), inflict pain on them, levitate objects, etc. The Lupin and Snape examples are rather tame by comparison (Hermione was using the bluebell flames in first year with a wand).

After the holly wand was deatroyed, at least. If Harry's wand was still functional, it wouldn't matter if Voldemort was casing wandlessly, the wand can recognize Voldemort whether he has no wand or uses a different wand, like at the beginning of DH.

Just noting, I mostly agree with your post!

#+begin_quote
  Snape clicked his fingers and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands.
#+end_quote

However even if that example was ignored, Snape's attempted use of Legilimency on Draco in HBP was wandless and nonverbal, just like Voldemort's use of Legilimency. Granted it didn't help him since Snape isn't as good with Leglimency as he was with Occlumency, but since Leglimens is the incantation for using Legilimency, Snape's lack of wand or incantation is an example of wandless magic.

Lupin also conjured the fire with just his hands

#+begin_quote
  "There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the compartment. Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames."
#+end_quote

We know Lupin did it wandless because he later pulled out his wand to use his Patronus.

And Quirrell did use incarcerous wandlessly and also undid it wandlessly.

#+begin_quote
  "Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry."

  "Use the boy... Use the boy...” Quirrell rounded on Harry. “Yes --- Potter --- come here.” He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off.
#+end_quote

Contrary to popular belief, wandless magic was never special even in book canon. A wizard doesn't need to be Dumbledore/Voldemort/Grindelwald to do wandless magic, as even wizards like Snape, Lupin, and even Quirrell can use wandless magic. Granted, Snape is one of the most skilled wizards we see in canon and Lupin is really talented too, and even Quirrell we can assume to be a decent wizard himself.

Even in the first Fantastic Beasts movie, the fact that nobody was surprised that Graves was capable of wandless magic. Even though Graves was actually Grindelwald, the fact nobody seemed surprised or impressed by his wandless magic implies that Aurors (or at least elite Aurors such as Kingsley or Moody) would be skilled enough to to use wandless magic if they wanted.

Wandless magic is just too worthless to use in a duel since if someone like Voldemort was disarmed, using wandless magic isn't going to give him an advantage if he got disarmed while using an actual wand. If a wizard lost a duel using their own wand, using wandless magic isn't going to help them win if they weren't skilled enough to win using a wand. Wandless magic is only really useful when not used for dueling, but like the Animagus transformation, the time spent learning it outweighs its usefulness in combat.

*TL;DR: In fanon, there is a misconception that wandless magic is some elite, all-powerful ability that only Dumbledore-tier wizards are capable of. In canon, wandless magic can be learnt by wizards far less talented than Dumbledore/Voldemort/Grindelwald but it's deemed impractical.*

** Wandlore in HP is a point where I wish we had gotten a backstory in the books.

Because it makes sense right? Wands/Staves/Whatever just weren't immediately available when humans discovered magic. They were made after the fact. And matching the wand with the magical is shown to be important.

Are wands amplifiers? Foci? Both?

Introducing windless magic in the series throws that for a loop if it's just a focus. If you can cast wandlessly why the big to do about the wand?

But if they're amplifiers shouldn't the wandless casting of Incarcerous have varying strength versus the wand cast version?

I like to think the wands are both a focus and an amplifier and certain spells have a baseline effect and others can vary in ‘strength'.

So in that case I don't like wandless casting that creates a stronger version. It sorta spits in the face of what wandlore we got.

I totally understand where you're coming from though. I'm just not sure I can totally agree. A strength doesn't always mean amplified. Here with James's wand if he was pants at Transfiguration his wand wouldn't be used to it's full potential but it wouldn't mean amplifying any transfiguration and suddenly James is good at it because of the wand and its strength. Merely if James happens to be good at transfiguration then his wand makes it easier to cast with. Or allows for more difficult changes because it's aiding its master.

Wands focus one's magic, making it more efficient, wandless magic should either be really simple stuff or really large stuff that you don't need to put a lot of thought into (e.g. telekinetically moving a car out of the way). It shouldn't be a replacement for a wand, it should be much more restricted.

** If you want OP wandless magic, you need to give the character a Handicap and a reason why. Like have Harry incapable of casting a spell with a wand, that it's a glorified stick in his hands, but he can cast the spells without one with some extra work

*** I like the idea that wands are a magnifier. A witch or wizard can summon small household objects wandlessly but if they're moving the couch they get their wand.

They can teleport 100 miles without a wand but they can teleport across the world with one.

That kind of thing.

**** I like the idea that wands become a Crutch. Because you can use Accidental Magic as a child, far more than the shown uses of Wandless Magic, and it stops when you get a wand, theoretically you could just control your accidental Magic, and, if you never used a wand, would be equal to using one, if you learned well enough.

***** is it really a crutch when you're learning 7 spells in your first year but it takes the same amount of time to learn 1 spell wandlessly and for less power?

****** Depends how you want to do it. Given that Harry apparated accidentally Pre-Hogwarts, learning to control all of it could be possible if you never touched a wand and only focused on controlling the Raw magic, you could learn most if not all the spells. Summoning is a fourth year spell, and babies can do it, after all.

******** The way I look at it is it takes much, much more work to master wandless magic, so wands were created to make magic easier, but now no one wants to put in the work for wandless magic.

** In your example, the character pays for their power with time. That's an opportunity cost.

What are their rivals and antagonists doing? While Minerva is learning the supremely powerful art of wandless transfiguration for a couple years, is Augustus Rookwood learning and crafting better spells for killing many people quickly? Have all the Death Eaters learned how to create horcruxes and combined them to make a fifty foot tall Archon of Purity that can cast with a dozen wands at once?

If it's just a wish fulfillment power fantasy, then Harry (because it's always Harry) should grow in personal power faster than his enemies, and the degree is up to the author. I don't particularly enjoy that sort of power fantasy, but that's fine.

** The Canon magic system (and let's face it, calling it a system is already generous) focus on only 2.5 things. Wand movements, incantations, and sometimes emotions (0.5).taking away the wand is taking away almost half of an already shitty stop-gap system.

** Wandless magic should always exists otherwise wands would not have a reason to be invented, wands after all are just tools to help the user, just like spells. I find fics that don't use any wandless magic to be stupid, and those that have adult wizards waving their wands and shouting out loud spells to be completely retarded. Any magic that isn't long lasting or requires lots of power or focus should be doable without a wand and without stupid words and motions, even if the results are much worse than with one.

** I don't mind OPness as long as it has drawbacks. Do not make it a substitute for normal magic, or make it so that it's cast from hit points.

Or give the enemies something greater.
