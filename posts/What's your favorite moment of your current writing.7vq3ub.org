  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** From a Death Eater!Lily fic that I haven't published yet (I want to get it more or less complete before posting) - Voldemort decides to experiment with the protective ritual Lily had planned to protect Harry, and the Imperius curse, while at the Lestrange manor.

Lily was already kinda splintering mentally before this point, what with James dying canonically and her being coerced into taking the mark to protect Harry after Voldie figured out the trap, but from here on she starts to really lose it.

#+begin_quote
  A trio of loud cracks announced the return of the Dark Lord and the other Lestranges, alongside a fourth man, arms wrapped around Rabastan and Rodolphus's shoulders loosely for support.

  And all of a sudden, the surreal, almost homey atmosphere collapsed.

  Straw-colored hair. Square jaw. Blue eyes.

  “Podmore,” Lily breathed. Sturgis Podmore's eyes widened in shock.

  “A newer guest of Lucius's home,” said the Dark Lord. “Severus was most helpful in ferreting out his location. The loss of Owens and Montjoy will be mourned, but any Order wizard taken is, of course, worth one or two lesser servants' lives.”

  “Lily,” Podmore begged. His voice was weak and raspy and shocked, he sounded like he'd been in a cell for weeks, not days -- he was shivering, aftereffects of the Cruciatus almost certainly. “Help.”

  “He is also uniquely susceptible to the Imperius Curse,” Voldemort went on. “An experiment is in order...pushing the boundaries of the Dark Arts is a worthy goal in and of itself, and whether we succeed or fail here, he shall not have died in vain.” He smiled down at Podmore and brushed a hand over the man's blood-matted hair almost gently. “Take comfort in that, Sturgis Podmore.”

  “They're going...to kill me...help.”

  “Oh, we aren't going to kill you. Lily is.”

  Lily stared in horror.

  “Summon a house-elf,” Voldemort ordered. “We will use an elf as the object of protection, I think, I have reconsidered...for this experiment, we will test the effectiveness of an Imperiused sacrifice by casting a Killing Curse. An elf can be the object? This will not interfere, I take it?”

  Lily shook her head mutely, then forced herself to speak. “N-No, my Lord.”

  There it was. There was the look of betrayal on Podmore's face. There was the despair. Merlin, they were going to make Podmore push his own throat to her knife and she'd have to slit it --

  “Excellent,” Voldemort purred. “Then let us begin.”

  Bellatrix ushered the children out of the room. Rabastan waved his wand and cleared the furniture to the side, giving them a nice open space to work with. Rodolphus summoned an elf -- the oldest they had, already with one foot on the other side of Death's door, so if the experiment failed it was no great loss. Lily watched, sickened, as Voldemort himself cast the Imperius that dulled the terror in Podmore's eyes and made them docile and glazed-over as his will was stolen away.

  She conjured her usual knife on the third try. Took a steadying breath. She couldn't back out of this, she reminded herself, she couldn't refuse, if she refused she would die and then Harry would be an orphan and hunted down like an animal --

  She was doing this for Harry.

  Someday, she thought with a slightly insane giggle, Harry would learn exactly what she had done in his name, and he would be horrified.

  She would make sure of it. That would be her litmus test. The day Harry looked at an honest accounting of what she had done in this war and lost his lunch in revulsion, was the day she could say she had succeeded as a mother. He would have lived long enough to hear the account, and he would have the morals to realize it was monstrous.

  The nameless old house-elf stood still, admirably stoic, as Lily knelt before her and carved Sowilo into her forehead. That rune would have marked her son, she thought miserably. It would have kept Harry safe. If everything here went well, it would keep the younger Lestranges safe, but now it would also grace the brow of every Death Eater -- she was sure of it -- if she had stumbled over a foolproof defense against the Killing Curse and lesser magics, the lightning bolt would be as sure a sign of a Death Eater as the Dark Mark itself --

  There were two ways she could go about this -- she could order Podmore to devote himself and his life to the protection of this one house-elf, or she could take a measure of his blood and draw runes of binding on the elf with it. It was the latter method she chose, because she had no faith in the effectiveness of the first, given that he was already being coerced into offering himself for the slaughter.

  Preparations complete, the Dark Lord directed Podmore to kneel and expose his throat. The Order fighter suddenly opened his mouth and declared in a monotone, “I willingly give my life to protect this rather useless house-elf.”

  Lily shot a look at Voldemort. He shrugged nonchalantly, a slight grin playing around his mouth. “It can't hurt to make that clear, can it?”

  She swallowed nervously and nodded. Then she stepped forward and pressed the edge of the blade to Podmore's jugular, and tried not to think about the Christmas party she and James had thrown where Podmore got drunk and danced with their Christmas tree.

  Then, she slit his throat.

  (It's not blood.)

  Blood poured down his neck like a waterfall. She daubed her fingers in it and tried to pretend.

  (It's just red paint.)

  She went over to the elf and painted the necessary runes. Runes for binding, runes for protection, runes for love (This is so utterly perverse oh God oh God -- ), runes for shielding.

  She made three trips. On the third she just cupped one hand and let it pool in her palm, like an artist's palette.

  (It's just red paint and I'm painting a picture.)

** From a Warcraft/HP crossover I've been kicking around for a while, featuring Hermione Granger, who has been adopted and raised by gnomish engineers.

#+begin_quote
  Everything had been made ready. The barrels of plague were loaded, the apothecaries in position with their catapults.

  "Soon. Very soon. Both the living and the dead shall tremble before the might of the Forsaken!" Grand Apothecary Putress growled, clenching his rotting fist around a vial of the modified plague. "All these fools shall-"

  "Excuse me sir, but do you have to time to take a survey?"

  Putress paused, glancing around to see an imp, a human teen, and a brown haired gnome.

  "What is the meaning of this?" Putress demanded.

  "Hi!" the gnome said brightly. "I'm Social Expolsiveer K Lee Smallfry! This is my assistant, Hermione Granger. We're here today to conduct a survey regarding your satisfaction with your current state of unlife as a part of our broader survey to determine beings satisfaction with their current state of life/unlife."

  "I...what?" Putress asked, utterly baffled.

  The human teen stepped forward, smoothing a few stray strands of frizzy hair away. "Hello, I'm Hermione Granger, intern for the Gnomish Department of Social Explosiveering. This survey is confidential, no personally identifying information will be retained in our records or sold. This information is to better understand the state of unlife/life and how explosiveering can help with the transition between the two. First, I need some demographic informaiton. Are you alive, or unalive?"

  "Foolish girl, I am Grand Apothacary Putress of the Forsaken! I am here to unleash the New Plague upon the Horde, Alliance, and Scourge!"

  "Oh we know," Hermonie said, waving a hand dismissively. "Well be sure to interview the newly arisen undead. We already interviewed the living troops, and we'll be doing a double blind study to see how they feel both before and after their transformation into the undead. Now, as a forsaken I'm going to put you down as 'unalive.' For how long were you alive, prior to becoming unalive?"

  "I...I was 38," Putress said, utterly baffled as the human scribbled something down.

  "And what was your race prior to unlife?"

  "Um, human, from Lordaeron. Aren't' you concerned I'll just kill you and expose you to the plague?"

  "Very good, very good. And how long have you been unalive? And do note that any hostilities against us will result in your immediate transfer over to ex-unlife via the massive bomb my imp is carrying."

  For the first time, Putress noticed that the imp was wearing some sort of explosive vest.

  "Pal, trust me, you are just better off answering the questions and moving on. I've already blown up three times today and let me tell ya, while it sucks for me, it REALLY blows for you."

  "Oh. Er, you're not going to try and stop me from unleashing the plague upon the deserving?"

  "Of course not!" K Lee said, horrified. "That would be a gross violation of the scientific method! As scientists and explosiveers, we must remain neutral observers!"

  "Or incendiary ones," Hermione added. "Really, there isn't any middle ground here. Now, for the next section, I'm going to ask you to rate your experiences on a scale of 1-5, with one being Very Satisfied, 2 being Somewhat Satisfied, 3 being Neutral, 4 being Somewhat Unsatisfied, and 5 being Very Unsatisfied. Do you understand this rating scale, or do you wish for me to repeat it?"

  Putress eyed the imp, who seemed to be twitching slightly. "Er, I understand it."

  "Excellent. How would you rate your experiences while living?"

  "Um, a 2, I suppose. I remember being vaguely happy most of the time."

  "And what about the transition to unlife? How would you rate it?"

  "Well dying was certainly painful, so a 5 on that. And coming back to this wretched existence... another 5. This is why I must spread my vengeance!"

  Hermione nodded, carefully recording the answers on her sheet. "Good to know. And how would you rate your experiences in unlife?"

  "Well it is a daily torment where I can feel nothing but pain, suffering, and a desire to destroy my enemies. So, well, the torment and all is a 5, but getting to slay all who still revel in life in mockery of me...that's a 1."

  "Hmm. We'll just average that out to a 5. And finally, to ensure that you are a real unliving individual answering these questions and not a magical construct, please answer 4 to this question."

  "Four?" Putress said, confused.

  "Thank you very much for your time," Hermione said, snapping shut the folder she'd been writing in and smiling at Putress. "The Gnomish Social Explosiveering Society thanks you for your time and responses. Please, have a wonderful day, and don't forget to contact the Social Explosiveering Society for all your social needs."

  "What exactly do social explosiveers do?" Putress asked, still confused.

  "Mostly blow people up," K Lee admitted. "We're working on that though. Soon, we hope to have an entire range of marketable social explosions, perhaps as a part of a program to transition from life to unlife. Now, we'll just go to a safe distance while you unleash your own social explosives upon your foes so we can record additional data."

  "Bye!" Hermione said, waving cheerily as she and her suicide imp hurried away to the shelter of somenearbye rocks. "Good look with wrecking vengeance and all that!"

** In my story (a time-travel-do-over AU job), Harry has a really intense discussion with an imaginary manifestation of Sirius Black from his original timeline about murder and the kind of decisions Harry is going to have to make - and that there's no one who can make them for him any more.

Although the Harry in my story is essentially an emotionally compromised, angry, broken individual, my version of Sirius from the story's original timeline I am /beyond/ pleased with. He's considered, honest, but also darker, more bloodthirsty and more damaged than Sirius Black ever was in canon, and I found that dialogue for him - particularly in relation to killing and what he sees as its importance in warfare - flowed beautifully, whilst not diminishing his apparent care for Harry as his godfather.

I felt like the scene really captured an essence of revelation, confronting an unpleasant truth, and sheer creepiness - with just a touch of heart in the right place.

** im writing a HP parody tentatively called 'Harris Porter and the Tides of Oblivion' where everything is jumbled up from canon because why not. But Harris' version of Sirius, Romulus Ash, was the technical skill behind the Marauders.

His breakout scene is by far my favorite thing I've written so far, and I'm not sure if its because he jury rigged a device that drastically slows his perception of time and powered it by leeching off his magic-suppressing cuffs, or because he delayed his jailbreak plans by like, three months, just to make a runic array to play the song 'Abracadabra' by Steve Miller Band while he dodges everything the aurors shoot at him.

** I had a concept of a fight scene between Diary!Tom and Ginny Weasley that I ended up writing out. I am currently trying to storyboard a story to go with it :P

Here is a section from the end of that fight: "/But it can be different;/ declared Tom /I am his nemesis. Without me, Harry's story can not conclude. With me, it will be an epic for the ages. You will become a necessary instrument, a key part of the story./ Tom knew what the girl wanted to see, the fantasy she had conjured up from her storybooks. He brought to life an image of himself and an older Harry facing off, grim and solum locked in combat with himself. Her brother and the mudblood were in the background, engaged with his Death Eaters, but all had cleared a circle around the primary duo. The sweat gleamed heroically off of Harry's face, as he made his stand.

/This is Destiny. This is where it is all headed./ Tom brought down the other images, leaving only the final battle. /You will be part of this. You will allow this to happen. With your sacrifice, he will become what he is meant to be./ He collected himself, putting everything left in the diary into the next command: /All. You. Have. To. Do. Is. YIELD/

Ginny's cohesion finally collapsed, her essence lacking the will to maintain its structure. The fire that Tom has been leeching off of over the previous year was nothing more than an ember, holding on by the most primitive of human principals. Unable to counter Tom's assault, it flared in defiance, shouting its purpose: /I am important; I deserve life. I exist./

/No/ thought Tom /You do not./

And with that Tom reached out snuffed out Ginny Weasley."

I was intending it to be as brutal as possible, and I think I have succeeded. I donno, we'll see how it looks in the context of a greater story.

** Particularly proud of this bit of action:

#+begin_quote
  Ginny and Ron had been circling above the battle [on a flying carpet]. They couldn't see any of their family and the death eaters were moving so quickly that targeting any of them seemed pointless. Ginny had resolved that chaos would be to their advantage, so she'd gathered a collection of tricks they'd stuffed into their pockets and launched them into the fray.

  When the golden cage blew apart it threatened to knock them, carpet and all, into the sea. They were hurtling downward and only at the last moment did Ron recover control of the tassels and flip them to skim across wave tips until they were upright and stable again. Ron turned back towards the island. Ginny ordered him to fly up towards where they saw Harry falling. He snapped the reins and they shot forward, but halfway there they saw Harry Disapparate.

  "Didn't know he could do that," said Ron.

  "Me either."

  Seeing the battle picking up steam again, Ginny loaded up another hefty collection of missiles into her palm and Banished them with enough oomph to reach and detonate around Voldemort. Brown, stinky clouds surrounded him, but a blue spell shot forth from the mess right afterwards, fanning outwards in an arc towards them. Ron banked away just fast enough that the spell only ripped through the trailing corner of fabric, though that was enough to set it aflame.

  Clouds of black smoke marked their flight path- even disillusioned, they knew they could easily be targeted. Ron dove the carpet back down below the curtain wall and intercepted an ocean swell to soak them with seawater. They hit it and flipped over, all landing in the angry sea.
