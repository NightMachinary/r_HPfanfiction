:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, a relatively long while ago I read a really weird fic. It was where Harry was sorted into Slytherin (i think) and there was this weird kind of flying tournament that was held secretely in the forbidden forest by students. I think it also included Daphne Greengrass as one if the main characters. And basically, because all kinds of injuries happen, they all learn healing and stuff. Unfortunately I cannot remember anything else. If any of you kind redditors know which one I'm talking about, i will forever be in your debt. Thanks in advance.


** I know what fic you're talking about, but for the life of me I can't remember the name. I'll have a look though my favorites and try to find it.
