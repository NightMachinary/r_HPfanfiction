To clarify TLIV=The Lie I've Lived & TOHF=The One He Feared. I'll take anything as long as it's not slash , mpeg , or fem harry.


** Personally I think linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall) would be a good read for someone who liked TLIVL but many here would disagree.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway, yet miraculously he lives. Even so, the question of how remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** linkffn(In Light of Silver Memories) is similar to TOHF in that it features Harry, who receives Dumbledore's memories by the beginning of DH. IIRC, Taure was inspired by this fic to write TOHF. And like TOHF, it's abandoned.

I'm not sure about any other story where James and Harry's identities combine, but if you're looking for a story where Harry inherits another person's memories, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge) might be a good read as well. This time, it's from Voldemort, and it's the best written out of stories where Harry inherits Voldemort's memories.

Additionally, you might like linkffn(What Lies Beneath) which is an excellent fast paced psychological thriller.

  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.
