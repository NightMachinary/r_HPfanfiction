We've all read those fics. The ones that /could/ have been great, but there's just some fundamental flaw in it that keeps you from really loving it.


** I don't actually know what my favourite fic is, but I do know that linkffn(Resurrexit by Master Slytherin), while very good, falls just a little bit short of being ideal for my tastes.

Without spoiling, there is one segment in the later half of the story that feels a little bit out of place, and the ending doesn't /quite/ have the payoff that I was looking for. It's still probably the most competent fic I've ever read. There are some other fics that, despite being technically more flawed, I enjoyed more.

** linkffn(11669575)

This fic does so many things well, but also fails miserably at things. The biggest problem is Harrys age, which is stupid because the author could've just waited until Harry was actually an adult for this stuff to happen, or just made him older to begin with.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** I've read part of this one. The author also forgot to mention that the story is taking place in a year much closer to 2016 than the canon 1991, because there's internet and RPGs and League of Legends references, of all things.

***** Then where do you draw the line between anachronism stew and deliberate timeframe shift? Anyone reading a Harry Potter fanfiction with the main character being Harry Potter would assume that the story is set within the canonical timeframe. Anachronistic elements within the story would come across as errors by the writer if there is no indication - either in an author's note, or with some in-text mention - that the story is in fact being re-cast in a different time setting. Assuming, of course, that the writer has not simply forgotten that his story makes references to significant technological developments and things that did not exist during the canonical timeframe as they only came about over the last twenty years or so.

****** The timeframe of Harry Potter doesn't matter. Dates aren't ever mentioned, except for a reference to Playstation in PS it could be any time in the last 100 years and it would have no effect on the story.

If a story starts with the author saying 'This story is actually set in X' I close the tab, because if science and technology matter I'm quite certain that the fic is going to be shit, and more importantly if the author thinks that needs to be said in an authors note they definitely aren't capable of telling a proper story.

******* ....................................it is explicitly stated in canon that the attack on the Potters happened on Halloween 1981. Aside from the existence of certain objects which weren't invented yet within the original timeframe, there are also other aspects such as social norms, speech style (eg. slang), and other things that are very obviously different from the original setting, thus it should be made clear that the writer has decided to shift the story into a slightly more modern context. A single sentence stating the change in the summary would've sufficed.

If someone told you she was going to write a fanfiction story about Romeo and Juliet or Jane Eyre, the natural assumption would be that these stories are set in the Elizabethan and Victorian periods respectively. If the story is not set in the original timeframe, the writer would need to point it out. However, for these examples the differences between Elizabethan/Victorian times and modern day are obvious enough that it isn't necessary to make a clear statement in the author's note. But late 20th century and early 21st century are close enough that it would be much clearer and less confusing to state the change.

** linkffn(On the Wings of a Phoenix by Makoyi) would be mine. I love this fic so much, or rather, the idea behind it, but there's just some things that feel out of place. Harry is slightly too whiny and passive at times (and too forgiving, but only when the plot calls for it), and the Harry/Ginny stuff feels really out of place as just a Plot Point, where the rest of the story is quite world driven and flows well. The story could have been a masterpiece.

** You've gotten a bit of flak over the wording of this request, but I think it's a great and fresh idea. People shouldn't get so hung up on the literal second fic on the favorites list vs great fic with just the one thing that bugs you.

linkffn(fair lady)

This one is very different and is often refreshing to read. The only thing is it lacks coherence from chapter to chapter.
