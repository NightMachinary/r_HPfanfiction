Hello! I'm looking for fics (long or short) that focus on either Draco OR Hermione (but not them together) after the war, and they're either on a solo adventure discovering themselves or just introspective pieces from their POV. I see so many great Hermione fics that focus on her life and career with her friends, but she's never alone, and I can't find many solo fics. The same with Draco.

Please help!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]], linkffn(6432055): Draco was sentenced to 5 years without magic after the War. His mother wanted to force him to marry another ugly pureblood woman, so he fled to the Muggle world. Draco's characterization is well done, and watching him struggle there was kind fun.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

*** Thank you! I've read at least half of this and then got depressed that it's not finished yet. I'm going to come back to it when it is.

** /pace/ the ongoing debate about censoring threads, I'd suggest that this would have been better done as two threads rather than one.

**** I'm not seeing a lot of crossover between fans of Draco and Hermione, so having two threads would be a better idea - in my thinking. I brought up the rules thread because I'm trying to point out that criticism of the op aren't necessarily invalid
