I've read almost everything out there in regards to my usual ships, so I'd like to try a new one. I need some Draco/Hermione recs. I'd prefer they be completed and I'm interested in believable stories, where you really get a good plot and a good understanding of the dynamics between the main characters. I also like adult stories as I am an adult. Thanks very much for your help.

**** It's been quite a while since I read Eight and Eighth. I don't really remember anything about it. We Learned the Sea is one of my favorite fics ever, though.

** Isolation by Bex-chan might work for you. It's on Fanfiction.net (no direct link, I'm on mobile, sorry). Recently-ish completed, great character development, attention paid to characters that were minor in the books, and it develops the relationship. There are also fan videos on YouTube.

** The Fallout. It's on hawthorn and vine by everythursday and it is probably one of my favorite Dramione fics. It's dark, a war AU, and a good length.

*** This is the only one I've read so far, and it was quite good.

**** Her other stuff is pretty good too. I'm almost done with Parade of the Sun and I recommend it as well.
