you know how "The Wizarding World" encompasses the whole world but we ignore all but England and some of Europe. how "all spells are in latin (faux latin nonetheless) but magic is intent (so could I not say fly and with proper intent and power make something fly) wandless magic is not considered the major feat it is in Europe in places like Africa and the Americas (cannon according to Pottermore.) is it that farfetched that there would be parselmouths other than the Slytherin and gaunt families. say western Asia. there are different spells for different things in latin so what about ancient Chinese or Norse or old french. how does the language used, if language is used, affect spellcasting?

tldr: are there any fics that are less eurocentric or more multi-cultural


** linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A harry Potter adventure) is one of the few memorable fanfics set outside Europe that I remember. There is both AU European magic and Aztec magic at work here. At least I remember it as Aztec, but it's been years since I last read it.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

** Since most writers are from English speaking or other European countries, we can't expect too many stories involving other cultures.

I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/White-Squirrel][White Squirrel]] is your best bet at moment. Since "The Accidental Animagus" has already been mentioned, I'm just going to recommend "The Mountains of the Moon", linkffn(12306845), next. This story will soon be dealing with Uagadou in Uganda.

** I enjoyed linkffn(Where My Thought's Escaping), a lengthy Cho-centered one shot centered on Deathly Hallows, in which Cho's family returns to China due to the war. I last read it a while ago but I remember there being a fair bit of discussion of the Chinese perspective on magic. There is also an interesting mechanism regarding the interaction of language with magic.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) has been getting multicultural in these past few updates ([[/spoiler][Jim, the BWL, travels to India to learn Asian magic]]), but that's only like the last 3 chapters or so.

linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) features characters from Aboriginal and Latin American magic traditions as well.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** You want multicultural? You get multicultural. Aka my most posted recommendation.

Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - Crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of neither. Matou Shinji, protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focus on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts?

Japan and Mahoutokoro play significant role, we've also had a chapter from MACUSA president perspective, met character from Hawaiian magical school, and soon the Potion Championship with all big magical schools will come. Most of the fic still happens in Europe though, but there are ofudas and youkai familiars used heavily.
