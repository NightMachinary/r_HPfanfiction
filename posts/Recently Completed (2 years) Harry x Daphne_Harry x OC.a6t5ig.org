I've read most of the Harry/Daphne and Harry/OC pairings in the past, but I was hoping for recommendations for relatively recent completions of these pairings? I'm down for most genres, but I typically prioritize any mystery/thriller/crime genres towards the end. I'm a simply person looking for action and romance.

I think the last completed one I've read is From New York to Southhampton? That was a good one. There was a OC pairing from taliesin19, but it seems that it's been slowly updated, so I was also hoping to find something to satiate my OC pairing as well.

Much appreciated in advance.

  “NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!”The world seemed to move in slow motion, as Rose Potter, the girl-who-lived, beater of trolls, new marauder and many other less pleasant titles, watched as the blasting spell hit her godmother, the only real family she had left, her rock, her teacher, she watched her slowly being thrown in the veil's direction.Until a mysterious green-eyed boy changed everything!AU!
