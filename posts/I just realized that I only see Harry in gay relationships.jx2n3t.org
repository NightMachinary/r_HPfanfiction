In general, I don't know why. I'm just annoyed lately with ships where Harry is with Ginny / Daphne / Hermione / Susan e.t.c

At the same time I was overeating Drarry and Tomarra, most of the stories are the same. Is it the only one I have? Because I am starting to fear that this coronavirus changes my view of the world and everything in general.
