** I'm not sure if this is what you mean but, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8479548/1/George-Weasley-and-the-Computational-Error][George Weasley and the Computational Error]] by pisoprano might be something you'll be interested in.

The first chapter is really George being irrational going back in time to attempt to prevent Fred's death. However, as the story progresses it actually becomes a decent read. No one knows that there's another George that travels to the past. Older George also have a sort of a mind link with his younger self. This causes problems with the younger George and Fred and they become quite stressed out about what's going on.

Overall, the story is a unique read. Plus there's just a lack of Fred and George fics out there even if they are the popular Weasley's so this fic really emphasizes the Twins differences and their bond.

  The Weasley family is deep in mourning after the battle of Hogwarts, but George has better ideas than to sit around and cry about something he'd rather just fix. And Charlie believes he can do it. Post DH, Charlie's POV.
