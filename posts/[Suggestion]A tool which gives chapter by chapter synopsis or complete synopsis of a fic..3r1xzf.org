I had read Make A Wish by Rorshach's Blot and then some other fics.

As I start the sequel, The Hunt For Harry Potter, I am having a trouble remembering the plot happenings during the latter half of the story.

I would love to catch up but it would make me hate the first one, to read it again so soon.

So I thought, what if there was a tool that did this:

Chapter by chapter synopsis for incomplete stories

And

Full story synopsis for a complete fix or both.

This may sound a bit impractical. But we could do this as agroup effort, for big famous stories.

Maybe make a wikia.

Tell me what you think


** Easy, "too lazy to create this tool" solution.

1. Open two tabs, one with fic, one with [[http://freesummarizer.com/]]
2. Decide how many chapters (or even all, if necessary) you'll need to recall.
3. Copy text of chapters to [[http://freesummarizer.com/]].
4. Summarize (10-20 sentences per chapter will cover most chapter sizes)

EDIT: For high chapter amount, low chapter size fics like Make a Wish, it might be better if you download the whole thing and the pasted chunks of chapters per summarization.

** We've got the [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/][HPFF Wiki]] in the sidebar, though it only has summaries and metadata details from what I can tell. We could just try to add those details to pages on the wiki.

** Sounds like a lot of work. We'd need people to write the synposis, wouldn't we?

*** That's the idea.

Wikias are maintained by fans(AFAIK)

Suppose you like a story, got time, you can sumamrise a chapter and put it up.

And /definitely/ not for all fics

Since people who do this will be fans, there will most likely be summaries of big stories
