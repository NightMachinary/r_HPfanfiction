:END:
So Basically lily disowns Harry and magic pulls the most compatible person to be his mother to him which happens to be Bellatrix. And Sirius and Bellatrix end up together Orion used a potion to make any children he had with walburga take in more of his DNA I believe.

I can't remember if I starts out as a fem Harry or not, but Harry is female after Bellatrix becomes his mother.

When lily disowns Harry he loses her eyes and takes on Bellatrix looks, it happens at hogwarts in the great hall.


** I remember this scene, but I'm stuck with you; no idea where it comes from. It's probably gonna bug me for the rest of the day now, too.
