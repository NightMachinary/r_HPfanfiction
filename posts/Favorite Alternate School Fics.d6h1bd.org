What are some of the best alternate school HP fan fiction stories that you have read? For example Harry ends up going to Durmstrang or any other wizard school that isn't Hogwarts. Preferably him having gone to the alternate school from the beginning and not a case of him being kicked out of Hogwarts or him transferring.


** While your flair is listed as discussion, the body of your post seems to indicate that you are looking for requests. So I'll give you a couple.

Well, a commonly recommended one is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by the Santi) Harry starts off in Hogwarts but after a few months he decides to transfer to Durmstrang and save for the first couple chapters the work is set in Durmstrang. I really liked how the author established the culture of Durmstrang. Fantastic world building.

While it takes place in Hogwarts, linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) makes Hogwarts (and its students) barely recognizable as both the curriculum and the student body are much more competitive and combative. It's basically Ender's Game adapted for Harry Potter. I enjoyed it immensely.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.

  Being a gay Hero hunted by a crazy Dark Lord with delusions of immortality, a barmy old Headmaster who thinks it's his job to save the world, and the odd vampire trolling through the halls at night looking for a midnight snack isn't easy. Just ask Harry.

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

  "The Ministry must be seen to do something", and with that, Harry Potter's wand is snapped. Expelled in his second year, he is invited to a new school famous for being the home of one of the Eight Great Repositories of Knowledge. But with Voldemort alive and the Chamber of Secrets still open, he will need every resource his new school possesses to stay alive in the coming years.

  With the end of fourth year Voldamort has returned, but Harry isn't waiting for him to make the first move. He has found a way to maybe put the bastard in his grave for good. Snow point Academy, hidden in the frozen reaches of the Antarctic Ocean is nothing like Hogwarts, but that seems to be just what harrys going to need to survive. Darker and more terrible things are moving in the shadows however, and in stepping onto the international stage more than one set of eyes are now on him. But Magic and Destiny have a few more tricks up their sleeves. fusion with Heralds of Valdemar(fut. AU)
