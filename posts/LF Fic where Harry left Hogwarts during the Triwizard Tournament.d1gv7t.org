:END:
I remember Cedric's dad helping him go to the Middle East, he brewed potions and stuff for and with a few of the people who hosted him, and moved around a lot when the British Aurors came looking for him. Dumbledore and later Snape found him to convince him to come back but he refused. I think it was a one- or two-shot, but I can't be certain of that.

#+begin_quote
  Harry sees only one option when his name comes out of the cup - to escape where the contract can't follow; across borders where the Ministry's laws can't follow him. Where he goes changes him, and those who remained change too. Desperate measures implemented change how paths are walked for not just Harry but others too.
