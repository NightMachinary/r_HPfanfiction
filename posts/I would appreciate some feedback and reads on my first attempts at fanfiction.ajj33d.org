Howdy,

I've written one complete story, a two-shot, and am working on a longer project. I'm new at this and would appreciate any advice y'all can give me. I promise I don't say y'all in my writing, so don't let that scare y'all off. Here are the links:

The longer one: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17533160/chapters/41310626]]

The two-shot: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17514488/chapters/41258894]]


** Read your two-shot and left you a note on Ao3. It's very nicely done!

The premise on your longer one is interesting, I'll have to add that to my list.
