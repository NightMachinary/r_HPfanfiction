#+TITLE: Hey I thought I'd look for stories where Harry loves the dark arts, gets addicted to them or is Power intent. So that he becomes dark. Everything is ok from student of Voldy to cruel dark lord or or ruthless anti hero. It would be nice if he slowly and gradually falls into darkness.

*** Every time my brain manages to finally block out that Harry/Daphne/Pansy scene, I see this fic linked again and the trauma resurfaces.

10/10 fic though, just make sure to have a bucket nearby if you have a strong imagination.

I'm not 100% sure on this as I skimmed over the chapter heavily but they may have also involved the corpse.

  Ten years after Voldemort's death, Harry and Ginny's marriage hits the rocks. When he's kicked out of the house one night, he decides to stay at the old Black home at Grimmauld Place, now part of a museum about the war years. Harry's always had some personal problems -- like having the remnants of Voldemort's horcruxes stuck in his head -- but that night, everything seems to catch up with him, and it sends him down a dark path.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
