** If Harry's not married to Ginny or Hermione, then Luna is the prime candidate to be Mrs. Harry Potter, and I think I have a selection of high-quality H/L stories that you'll like.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4133728/1/Family-Reunion]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4390341/1/Song-Of-The-Sea]])

JJ Rust wrote a number of really lovely H/L one-shots, some focused on the couple during Hogwarts and some focused on their later married years. These are two of the best from the latter category; the first one answers the timeless question, "What would happen if Vernon Dursley, who thinks wizards are odd, met someone who was odd even by wizard standards?"

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8619117/1/Luna-and-the-Toaster]])

These two by the author LiquidThoughts are also pretty fun.

"Gazer": This is a really sweet little vignette featuring Harry and Luna on the roof. It's not explicitly stated that they're married, but they're cohabitating, so... close enough.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2751554?view_full_work=true]])

"The Things We Love": Finally, when you've made it through all the above stories, here's the motherlode: a series of nearly thirty H/L one-shots, all written by the author based off of readers' prompts, and most depicting them as a married couple. This one is still updated periodically, and the author is also working on "Tomorrowland", an excellent H/L story-in-progress.

****** You are correct. That said, if someone has not read it... read it. I just did and enjoyed it a ton. And it was recommended to me when I requested post Hogwarts relationship fics where Harry was not involved with Ginny/Hermione.

So very similar to your request outside the "marriage" aspect. Cut nypism some slack ;)
