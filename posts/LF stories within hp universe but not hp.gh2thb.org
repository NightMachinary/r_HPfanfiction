** I enjoy the Alexandra Quick series by Inverarity. It takes place in Wizarding America, but not Rowling's version as this was started before she revealed her vision.

It might not be everyone's cup of tea but the fifth book just finished so there's quite a bit to read.

*** linkffn(3964606) For those among us who would inevitably want a link, here's the first "book" in the series - although in my opinion it gets better from Book 2 onwards, to be honest.
