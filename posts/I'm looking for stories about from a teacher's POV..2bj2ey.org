I recently read a fanfiction in which an older Harry ends up being potion master during his parents time at Hogwarts. I was wondering if anybody knew of any fanfics similar to this.

I don't really mind when the story is set or who the protagonist is, but I would prefer the story to be about teaching and the students rather than about the war, though I'll war stories if you got 'em.

The story I mentioned by the way is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]].

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

All I can say is that it's fucking amazing. I love every word of it.

*** Cool, thanks, that's pretty much exactly the kind thing that I was looking for.
