Like I said in the title, I cant remember the name of this story. From what little I do rememver, Harry and Ginny, I think, were soul bound and could hear eachothers thoughts, but since they were kids they thought it was an imaginary friend or somwthing of that nature. If I recall correctly it was pretty good as well. It may have been hermione but I am positive that it was Ginny who was the partner in the soul bond. I just wish I could remember more. If any of you know what story Im talking about Id be grateful if you could share the title with me.

Edit: The fic search is over. The correct story has been found

** The title would be funny if it was sold/bound to Ginny, just imagining the Weasleys buying Harry from the Potters.
