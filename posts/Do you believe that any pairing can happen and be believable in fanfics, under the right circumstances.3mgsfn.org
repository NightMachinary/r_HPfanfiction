I find it weird enough that we have fics about ships like Bellatrix and Hermione or Harry and Lucius, but it seems to be common belief that if the right scenario happens and particular decisions are made, then these ships can happen and make sense. Do you agree with that theory?


** Yes! With time travel and dimension hopping any pairing could work. I never would have though Harry/Bellatrix could work but Delenda Est was good.

*** I think what makes Delenda Est work is the fact that when the story begins, Harry sees Bellatrix just as the reader does. Harry sees the idea of a friendship (much less a romantic relationship) with this sociopathic Death Eater as rather abhorrent. But as Harry becomes more comfortable with Bellatrix, so does the reader. Even then, Harry will occasionally take a step back and acknowledge the dissonance and the fact that this relationship seemed so unlikely to work out.

Multiple people have said that they were surprised that the pairing could work, and you get the feeling Harry felt the same way.

** Yes and no. For some characters yes. For some no.

I don't think Bellatrix and Dumbledore could fall in love, no matter how many time travel and bizarre tags you put on it.

I do think two characters who aren't inherently evil can. An example of this is HarryxTonks. Yes it's a stretch for most, but in the right set of circumstances, where the two characters have time to show each other how they are decent people, love *could* blossom.

That said, if it's an AU as all of these are, cannon characters aren't really shown. It's how someone wants to bend them, and that's great, but it's not the cannon character. It can still be a wonderful story, and in some cases it's outstanding (maybe it's just me being partial to romances).

** A hesitant yes.

For all the hate on cross-generational pairings, we sometimes think too much like Muggles on this one. These guys can potentially live upwards of two centuries, so age itself isn't an issue. Power dynamics still are, however, so teacher/student relationships really should remain platonic in a non-crack, non-squick fic.

Orientation (if we're talking about being somewhat faithful to canon interpretations) is a really tricky one. There's probably a case for many canon characters having a fluid sexuality, but for say, Harry to start banging Draco, Snape, Lucius, Voldemort /and/ his mother's house-elf while denying that he was ever attracted to the opposite sex in the same breath is just... well, you get my drift.

Then there's interspecies relationships... even interanimate relationships (I'm personally a consummate shipper of Hogwarts Castle/Giant Squid, though the Castle is arguably animate... maybe even sentient. Not sure what the term for this would be)

When people complain about cross-generational pairings I've never heard them complain about, say, Remus and Tonks. But even if it's not a teacher/student relationship, if one person is a teenager and the other an adult there's going to be a power imbalance. The difference in maturity and life experience makes it impossible for that to be an equal relationship.

** It really depends on circumstances.

For example, Hermione/Lucius, with canon personalities, at any point 1997 onward? Nope. It'd require a no-war AU, a Lucius that wasn't a blood supremacist, and/or a Lucius that changed sides early on. But throw in some time travel to way before the first war, stick them both as the same age and before way difficult decisions have been made, and there could be a shot. Awful ideas as a teenager (like blood supremacy, racism) can go away with the right reason.

What's difficult is keeping the characters in-character long enough to establish them, then having the charger development be long enough to justify the changing of their personality from canon. Just about any two characters can be tossed together and work.

The problem with this pairing, or any other that doesn't really click with their canon personalities, is that people try to make it happen quickly. Characters change over the course of a story, Harry and Hermione in DH could probably work out, if they both weren't already involved to some degree with another. However the problem lies in people trying to get Harry and Hermione together for the Yule ball. Or in Hermione and Draco getting together in their Hogwarts days instead of a decade later when grudges have cooled and opinions have changed.

However, if you can see past little tweaks like that, I believe almost any pairing can be believable. I've read some convincing and not to mention fantastic fics with Bellatrix and Hermione pairing, for example. I think it mostly depends on the author and their capablilities. If they can really dvelve into the slightly hidden characteristics of the characters in question, then they can make a story that makes sense. However, it will probably (and usually) require a lot of development between the characters.

With a lot of hurt, a relationship can take place if a situation allows Bellatrix to open up to Hermione.. As mentioned though, it would require a very good author to pull it off. Also, I think it can surely develop if the story allows Hermione to harden while Bellatrix softens, personality wise.

So, when you have something like Snape/Hermione, the only way that's going to happen is with some extreme personality changes, and then, those characters aren't actually Snape and Hermione. They're two OC's who just happen to share the same names.

** Yes! I think that anyone can get together under the right circumstances because circumstances change people, especially with time travel.

** I see character's sexualities as part of their personalities. I know that there's a little wiggle room and I know that sexuality can be seen as more of a spectrum, but that's how I see it for the most part. Changing canon Harry's sexuality is like making him blonde. You can do it, but it's not something that happens organically or for environmental reasons. Of course, if it's a background character, we don't really know what was going on. I don't think Harry's gay, but I don't see Seamus being gay as a huge break from his canon characterization.

I also think that a fic that pairs Harry (or Hermione) with a more important character (like Fleur or Hermione or Luna or Draco or Snape) is inherently OOC because we know that the relationship didn't have legs. In a different universe where canon!Harry sat in Susan Bones' compartment, maybe Harry could have fallen in love with Susan Bones.

But canon!Harry and canon!Hermione weren't compatible, and to make them compatible requires changing the characterization of one if not both. Same thing for any romance that involves two primary characters, like Snape and Hermione.

In AU stories, it very much depends on the pairing as well as the structure of the story. Some pairings are more plausible than others, and it depends on the point of divergence. In a world where Hermione was sorted into Slytherin, maybe she would have fallen in love with Draco. But in a world where the point of divergence is Ron dying the final battle, Hermione falling in love with Draco is a lot less plausible.

** Not without a good amount of backstory changing or being brought to light. Mostly for characters being homosexual.

I'm a hypocrite when it comes to females and bisexuality though...

But Evil characters falling in love with Good characters and vice/versa requires as much history change/retelling as turning a typically known "hetero" character "homo". Doing both in the same story pushed the limits.

Making women all a little bit bisexual or willing to share a guy like Harry ... is fantasy, it had better have at least SOME reason for it to happen that is believable if you squint really hard and are willing to ignore it. Same for men I suppose, but that isn't for me...for those that are into it I suppose the fantasy is good enough reason for them to keep reading it.

A well done fic will have enough background changes explained, that you can believe anything that happens. Even if it is Harry falls in love with Voldemort or Hermione and Snape. I have not read any fic that did it well enough for me to finish them... but that is probably a predisposition as much as poor writing.

TLDR To each his/her own. For me, anything can be explained well enough to be believable within that fic...I just havent seen it done well enough to explain things I would never think of writing myself.. personal taste plays a huge role in whether it is believable or not.
