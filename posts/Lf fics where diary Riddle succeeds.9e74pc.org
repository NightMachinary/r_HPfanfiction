As the title says. Besides HP and the Dark's Rise (which is what inspired me to ask this), are there any stories where Tom Riddle's diary comes back, whether by killing Ginny on the Chamber or another way?

No restrictions. Slash welcome. Longer stories preferred.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052): He didn't kill Ginny, but someone else, much earlier.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186430/1/Thunderstorm][Thunderstorm]], linkffn(7186430): A rather large AU in which Voldemort was female and Harry was older. Harry and fem!Riddle eventually got together.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12118000/1/Wither][Wither]], linkffn(12118000): Horrific Epilogue-compliant one shot.

** linkffn(Solace in Shadows). This one is really good. It's not slash, though harry and tom have a bit of a twistedly positive relationship. The Fictionist always writes good stories.

​

​

As far as slash goes, there are so many where diary tom succeeds. Off the top of my head...

linkffn(A Dangerous Game), which uniquely has an older Harry discovering the diary

​

Oh, and Lithium on ao3.. Of the three I've mentioned though, Solace in Shadows is the best

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10785698/1/Transcendence][Transcendence]] - This is my favorite "the diary wins" fic. It has some great interaction between diary-Riddle and the Death Eaters, as well as the other pieces of Voldemort's soul. This version of Riddle is a chessmaster-style mastermind who cruelly manipulates everyone around him.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7932144/1/Solace-in-Shadows][Solace in Shadows]] - The diary kidnaps Harry. The story is an exploration of Stockholm syndrome focusing on the interaction between Harry and his captor. Unfortunately it seems to be dead.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11031294/1/Bound-by-Souls][Bound by Souls]] - This one is a crossover with the /His Dark Materials/ series in which people's souls are personified by animals (called Dæmons) that accompany them throughout their lives. The horcrux in Harry causes him to have a different sort of Dæmon than other wizarding children, and there's eventually some interaction with diary-Riddle. The premise is well executed, but the plot gets a bit scatterbrained in later chapters.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12764993/1/A-Dangerous-Game][A Dangerous Game]] - Mostly a Diary Riddle/Harry smut fic with some plot thrown in.

  Tom thought that perhaps fifty years of utter isolation and stagnation in a diary was a small price to pay to gain the advantages of being a living Horcrux, even if he was probably a bit mad from the experience. After all, being mad was no impediment to a Dark Lord.

  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark... Warning: Deals with Stockholm Syndrome and dark themes.

  Things go differently, down in the Chamber. Instead of pouring herself into the diary, Ginny opened her heart to it, her heart and her mind, and that means a different path for Tom Riddle to take. No message saying Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever; instead Tom takes Ginny down to the Chamber one empty afternoon and waits for the last of her to die. When it is all over Tom flicks long red hair over her shoulders, picks up Ginny's wand (not a perfect match, but better than nothing, better than fifty years without a wand) and leaves the Chamber. Saunters out of Myrtle's bathroom looking like nothing more than a little eleven year old girl.

** I've put the following four stories under spoilers for anyone perusing this as the reveals happen some way into each story.

​

Prince of the Dark Kingdom: this is an epic story, but also an unfinished one. Brilliantly written and with a Tom Riddle from the diary who has a significant part to play in the plot.

​

An Old and New World: this is a crack!fic. The story is insane and bizarre and quite depraved, but also good fun. Throughout the diary has taken over Ginny's body rather than gaining one of his own, and he ends up on the 'good' side of affairs.

​

Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus: a work in progress. This story is convoluted, amusing and quite surreal. The diary does succeed, though for how long he'll succeed is another question.

​

Harry Potter and the Natural 20: another work in progress. A young wizard from a D&D universe enters the Harry Potter universe and proceeds to mess things up gloriously. Well written with tension, defeats for both good guys and bad guys and a really thoroughly plotted storyline this is a must read. I can promise that at the current time Tom from the diary is out and about.
