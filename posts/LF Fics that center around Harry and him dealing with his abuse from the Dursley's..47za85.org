Something akin to either Digging for the Bones, or A Hero, both of which I genuinely loved.


** Linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/7093738/2/Brutal-Harry]]) the sequel gets weird though.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help? Additional Story Notes FYI: a. AU Summer before Fifth Year Fic, b. Not particularly fast paced.

** There is one that I forget the name of now, where the Dursley's abuse Harry so bad psychologically, that his own magic basically places a curse on him where he has to do whatever other people tell him. It was a work in progress the last time I read it maybe 5 months back.

e: It was also very much rated M.

  AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8984932/1/I-Alone][I, Alone]] focuses a great deal on Harry dealing with his abuse, and I have to say that the first Hogwart's Express journey is one of the best in all the FF I've read. I don't know why, but I found it really beautiful. Try it!

  A rogue Foot soldier finally acts on a long suffering obsession he has on a certain turtle whom he is convinced is destined to be his soul mate. A dark tale of madness, cruelty, obsession and abuse. Not for the faint of heart. Consider yourself warned. ((Nominated for 2013 AFFAs: Best Don, Best Mike, Most Outstanding OC, Best Twist, Best Multichptr, Best Horror, Best Non-Con))
