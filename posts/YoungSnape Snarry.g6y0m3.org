I don't know why this is like my favorite thing ever, but there's decidedly little of it that I'm able to find. Or if I do, and love it, it's abandoned (See: Elective Affinities, my go-to every few years when I'm in the mood *cry*)

I've read Rapture and Escaping the Paradox also...also combed the previous posts of this type on this Reddit and skimmed tags all over the place. Surely there must be more. Help a gal out if you know of any good ones out there.


** I've posted these before, so you may have come across my recs on [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]. But in case you haven't seen them:

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=1929&warning=4][Just Another Soldier in the War]] by Ziasudra. Harry is thrown back in time.

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=1265&warning=4][Cockroach Clusters, Please]] by Ziasudra. The Room of Requirement conjures young Snape because Harry needs his help. This one ends with canon-age Snape and Harry together, however.

This is a de-aging fic, and at the end Snape reverts to his canon age:

The Sleeping Prince by who_la_hoop.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/41215]])

In this one, Harry goes back in time to when Snape is already a professor, but it's early on, so he's only 22 or 23. Again, the fic ends back in canon time:

Sweet Afton by babygray

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2749223]])

Harry boards a train by Lilian

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11890905/chapters/26857806]])

I haven't read this one, but it's about Harry boarding the train at King's Cross instead of going back to fight Voldemort and ending up "somewhere" in the past/the afterlife trying to change Snape's destiny.

**** I just read part of the first chapter of "Harry boards the train," and it's ... hmm, a beginner's fic, I think, which is a stumbling block for me. Typos and misspellings and so forth. But not everyone has my issues with SPaG and characterization, so it's there if you're curious. The other fics in my list are more polished.

  It's hard to ignore your past --- and impossible to do so when you can't remember your future. But a meddlesome portrait, a dragon with an ancient grudge and true love's kiss teach an unlikely Prince that a regrettable past doesn't have to mean an unhappy ending.

  "Oh yes." Dumbledore smiled at him. "We are in King's Cross, you say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to...let's say...board a train."- Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows After talking to Dumbledore on 'King's Cross', Harry decides to get on a train instead of going back to fight.This is where the story starts: He boards a train. Too bad that it's already occupied.
