Hello, I'm looking for some recommendations for stories focusing on any of the following:

- Tom Riddle school days, gaining minions, building power
- Tom Riddle protagonist or major character (e.g., Imposter Complex, 7th Horcrux)
- Grindlewald's war
- Extreme AU (the further from stations of canon, the better) (e.g., Hogwarts Battle School)
- Darke Lady Hermione (e.g., Applied Cultural Anthropology; Hermione Granger, Demonologist)
- Competent Lockhart (e.g. Magical Me!, Applied Cultural Anthropology)
- Dark Lord Voldemort/Tom Riddle/Harry/Hermione/whoever currently ruling over Magical Britain (e.g. Prince of the Dark Kingdom)
- Really interesting magic, especially dark arts (e.g., Blood Crest)
- Unique premise with great execution (e.g., HP & Prince of Slytherin, HP & Nat20, Pureblood Pretense, In the Bleak Midwinter)
- Good crossovers or SI's (Magical Me! and What'shername in Hufflepuff are the only SI's I've ever read that aren't terrible, so I don't have high hopes for this one)
- Realistic/well done politics
- Side character MC
- Ultra-competent/smart Voldemort (i.e., not canon)
- Ritual magic
- Marauders Map is a shared Horcrux for the 4 of them

What I'd like to avoid:

- Romance as the main focus of the story
- Soulbonds (unless subverted and done /really/ well)
- Gratuitous bashing
- Bad writing of any kind (rife with typos, plot holes, juvenile wish fulfillment)
- Leaning too hard on fanfic tropes

Thanks in advance!


** I'm not recommending my favorites, just the fics I consider noteworthy in a few of these categories.

Grindewald's war/Tom Riddle POV - Realignment

Tom Riddle POV - The Imposter Complex

Extreme AU - Untitled Tome, Firebird (dubious quality, very disturbing AU), Lord of Magic

Interesting magic - ectomancer

Imposter Complex and Ectomancer are both great and exactly what I had in mind for those categories.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Reign of the Serpent is a good extreme AU, with incredibly interesting politics (Slytherin v Grindelwald v Voldemort v Dumbledore v ???), and really fascinating magic.

Blessed Be is a short 13,000-word story about several pagan festivals which are really intriguing, romance is not the main focus.

The Changeling has interesting Slytherin politics, but it would come up in the later years.

Six Pomegranate Seeds has Hermione go back in time to play the part of a pureblood heir in order to fix a magical mystery. It's really good, the first few chapters are a bit too philosophical, but try to read until she meets her designated Hogwarts house-elf. There's Slytherin politics and a great deal of magical experiments.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** Obligatory mention of Methods of Rationality. Downvote if you must, but if so, I'd request that you leave specific feedback about why.

#+begin_quote
  Unique premise with great execution
#+end_quote

I'm not exactly sure what you'd call the premise - perhaps "a differently-raised Harry attempting to showcase and implement critical thinking techniques" - but I certainly haven't seen another fic like it, except a few that were inspired by it.

"Great execution" is partly a matter of taste, but in terms of objective criteria, it's long, complete, has quite a bit of humour and very few spelling/grammar errors. And even if you disagree with Harry and hate his guts, his views are still thought-provoking.

#+begin_quote
  Extreme AU (the further from stations of canon, the better) (e.g., Hogwarts Battle School)
#+end_quote

Yes, it's very different from canon first year (and even when something vaguely approximating the stations occurs, like the troll attack, it doesn't feel similar).

#+begin_quote
  Ultra-competent/smart Voldemort (i.e., not canon)
#+end_quote

Very much so. Even when people hate Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, they normally acknowledge that he has an impressive antagonist.

There's a good summary at the start of chapter 22:

#+begin_quote
  /Something, somewhere, somewhen, must have happened differently.../

  PETUNIA EVANS married Michael Verres, a Professor of Biochemistry at Oxford.

  HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES grew up in a house filled to the brim with books. He once bit a math teacher who didn't know what a logarithm was. He's read /Godel, Escher, Bach/ and /Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases/ and volume one of /The Feynman Lectures on Physics/. And despite what everyone who's met him seems to fear, he doesn't want to become the next Dark Lord. He was raised better than that. He wants to discover the laws of magic and become a god.

  HERMIONE GRANGER is doing better than him in every class except broomstick riding.

  DRACO MALFOY is exactly what you would expect an eleven-year-old boy to be like if Darth Vader were his doting father.

  PROFESSOR QUIRRELL is living his lifelong dream of teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, or as he prefers to call his class, Battle Magic. His students are all wondering what's going to go wrong with the Defense Professor this time.

  DUMBLEDORE is either insane, or playing some vastly deeper game which involved setting fire to a chicken.

  DEPUTY HEADMISTRESS MINERVA MCGONAGALL needs to go off somewhere private and scream for a while.

  Presenting:

  HARRY POTTER AND THE METHODS OF RATIONALITY

  You ain't guessin' where this one's going.

*** HPMOR is great. I got caught up on Significant Digits when it was about half done, and never finished. If you've read the whole thing, how would you say it compares?

If I had to nitpick HPMOR, I'd say the first few chapters are cringey and poorly written, while the tone of the work is a little preachy and tends to sacrifice story and character for imparting rationalist lessons. But I really enjoyed it overall. It's a lot funnier than people tend to give it credit for, and Quirrell is completely fascinating as a character.

**** It's quite different in tone. Less jokes, more historical flashbacks. I'm not sure how satisfying you'd find the ending; it depends on taste. The combat scenes were well executed, though.
