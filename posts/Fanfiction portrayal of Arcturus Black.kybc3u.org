Arcturus Black in fanfiction, is portrayed as someone who has power, wants his family to rise, sometimes fears his family of murdering him or Don't fear them. He wants to do something but he could have done it before Harry has born. I could understand Harry has to be involved, in logical sense he could have done it before. He is paradoxical. Let us discuss him.


** I think there is no canon explanation for his death or about him in general. Besides his name, believe it on the ancestral carpet and Sirius's comments, we don't know anything about him. You mean Cassiopeia Black(1915-1992). :)

Now that we have canon out of the way, in fanfictio, there are countless theories as to why e.g. Andromeda was allowed to survive.\\
He wanted to ensure the survival of the family(or Bloodline) or why Sirius remained the heir despite that his mother burned his place on the carpet etc. But these are all theories, he died in 1991 according to canon by the way.

** My head cannon and the way I plan to write him is as a Tywin Lannister type figure. Idk I just get that vibe from him and it makes sense that the head of the black family would be like that.

Another reason is that I love Charles Dance and want an excuse to have him in my fic lol

** Wasn't he in cannon poisoned by the Malfoy ?

Anyway, I think that he didn't do anything because he had family on both sides of the war, Andromeda, Nymphadora, Sirius and Dorea more on the light, and Bellatrix, Narcissa, Cyrus, Regulus, Walburga, Orion, etc... on the Dark. Then there is the Black matriarchs who married kinda everywhere (Weasley, Longbottom, Goyle, ...), Alphard, and the Black women who didn't marry but I cannot find the name of...

So seeing as family was fighting family, I suppose he didn't do anything so that some family members could be spared if either side of the war won (with favors for exemple).

Finally, he must have been kinda old, if he fought during Grindelwald's war, around 100 I'd say in 1981, so maybe he was just tired, as powerful as he might have been.

That's my opinion on his inaction, tough one might say that he probably still attended the Wizengamot from time to time.

**** I think I heard something about him being given "potions" by a Malfoy elf on Abraxas's orders probably, passing it of as a repayment of a favor.

The potions were to heal him from something, but instead accelerated his death, or even caused it, who's to say he was /truly/ ill ?

***** This is fanon, though it sounds like a cool story. It might be based on Wizarding World material JKR wrote on the Malfoy family about Abraxas Malfoy, which is that he got rid of the first muggleborn Minister of Magic:

  Abraxas Malfoy...was widely believed to be part of the shady plot that saw the first Muggle-born Minister (Nobby Leach) leave his post prematurely in 1968 (nothing was ever proven against Malfoy)

** I envision him as a bit of coward and a bad guy who wanted redemption, but didn't actually make a go for it beyond leaving everything to Sirius. A last fuck you to his more decisive and crazier cousin, Pollux.

** I see him as a tired man, he saw horrors in Grindelwald's war, he saw countless dying in front of his eyes as he fought against the Lord of Nurmengard. Then in the First Wizarding war, he saw his family break apart, some leaving to other nations to escape the madness, some fighting for a madman who wanted power and was willing to raze the world for it, while one forswore his own family and listened to the words of a man who manipulated for the "Greater Good" , the same ideology he once fought against. He saw entire families die, pureblood families who had been a part of their world for centuries, all proclaimed as Blood Traitors just because they were against the bloodshed wrought by a man-turned-monster who had a bad childhood and was alienated by the manipulator. He saw his world crumbling,family falling, kin killing kin, he saw his nation falling to ruin, all because of a corrupt government, a power obsessed madman, a man who thought that he was right above all else. Arcturus Black was a man who watched the world burn.
