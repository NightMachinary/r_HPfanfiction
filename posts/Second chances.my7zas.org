  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.

  Draco Malfoy died at the venerable age of 107, and who awaited him at the crossroads? His mother? His wife? No, it had to be his eccentric former rival, eventual best friend, and far too often partner in chaos Harry Potter. Oh, and of course he had a deal to offer Draco to live his life anew, and obviously there was a caveat to it all that he wasn't privy to, damn Potters.Fem!Draco

** Not all of those are fix-it's but Time travel is definetly involved

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25836640]]) This one is called "Of Gods and Men" and it's a Sirius/Harry fic In the future a disease called "magical consumption" devours wizards and witches, stealing their magic. And somehow the power get's tranfered to Harry, who tried to kill himself the release it but it doesn't work. So he intends to travel back in tim to let himself being killed by Voldemort during the battle, but somehow he ends up in the marauders era where he is forced to pretend to be a student. MoD Harry. Very good engaging story

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]]) Time Turned Back by TaraSoleil. Probably my favorite Harry in the Marauders Era fic. Harry and Hermione both end up in the past. Harry/Sirius Hermione/Remus

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21527806]]) This one is a gen fic called Princeps by Lomonaaeren. The summary should give you a good overview, sequels are also finished. Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go too wrong.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15930521]]) Step back in time. This one is very good, in which an older battle-worn Harry doesn't quite end up in the marauders era, but around the time his younger self was left on the Durleys doorstep. He basically adopts himself all the while navigating magical Britain, the people who want to meddle with Harry's life and the upcoming rise of the dark Lord. He doesn't take shit from Dumbledore either, young Harry is a sweet kid. Highly recommend. Endgame is Snape/Harry. There are multiple works to this series.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24339502]]) This one is a WIP in which Harry amd Hermione ending up in the past because Harry wanted to save Sirius but travelled back a bit too far. Harry is still a student in that

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23486791]]) This one is also not a Harry ends up in the Marauders era, but a young Regulus ending up in the future fic. Pairing Harry/Regulus

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966]]) Don't know if you know this fic, it's called "The Second String" Harry ends up in the past. He pretends to be a Squib and ends uo working in the Hog's Head. Pairing is Gideon Prewett/Harry Potter. It's a brilliant fic! Highly rec

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3188624]]) Also not Harry in the Marauders era, Snarry fic, features Harry as a Professor

When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1648439]]) Another Snarry fic. Not quite Marauders era either but also good. Things are going poorly for the side of the light, and in a last-ditch effort to fulfill his destiny, Harry goes back in time to try again.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16816447]]) This fic is called the man out of time, not quite what you're looking for, but this is the summary. Harry gets hit with a piece of the veil, and falls into Sirius's past. And back again. Loosely inspired by The Time Traveler's Wife.

Some *Harrymort/Tomarry*

Flight A brilliant fic. So much Worldbuilding in terms of dark magic and Horcruxes. It's very good and interesting. Tom pov. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16497056]])

MoD!Harry Time travel fic. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15562401]])

Harry travels back in time and ends up in Tom Riddles year. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/266699]])

Time travel fic. Harry is in his twenties in this. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5648098]])

This is one of the best Tomarry fics I ever read. Ending with a twist. Basically what if Harry acted like a Horcrux in Tom Riddles mind. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11244426]])

Very interesting. Harry gets trapped in a memory inside Dumbledores pensieve. He changes timelines. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/995179]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23965102]]) Rather good as well, features Grindelwald as a threat

  Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go too wrong.

Well, this is just brilliant, she thinks. “And you didn't even get the year right!”Or: the one in which Harry is done with the war and thinks it's time he got something he wanted for a change.

  When Sirius runs away in 1976, Regulus starts writing him letters he never intends to send. They're simply a way to talk about all the things he can't say out loud to anyone - a chronicle of his descent into the Death Eaters, and the eventual realisation that he made all the wrong choices. In 1997, Harry is searching for the Locket-Horcrux at Grimmauld Place. Instead, he finds a stack of yellowed parchment that not only tells a tale that's more captivating than it has any right to, but might also hold the key to information on the remaining Horcruxes. Regulus Black installed a failsafe. Though neither Regulus, nor Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Sirius expected the result of the ritual to be quite this literal. With an Ex-Death Eater who was assumed to be dead in their midst, the Horcrux-hunt goes a bit differently. Regulus is mostly conflicted if his unexpected second chance is really worth all the trouble his company keeps putting him in.   Spoiler: It is. He just likes to complain.

  When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.
