** So what you're asking for is a short drabble, a few hundred words at most, which is about one or more of the Marauders discovering some strange and potentially idiotic muggle thing and deciding to try it out?

...I can't actually think of much that that could apply to. Ice bucket challenge? Cow tipping?

*** Crop circles. It becomes a contest to make the most elaborate ones without pegging the ministry to come down on them for mugglebaiting.

*** Well I think it is pretty opened, it could actually be that one of the maraudeur is pranking Sirius, encouraging him to do something by telling him it's a muggle thing.\\
I was more thinking in that direction myself when I had the idea of that little bit of dialogue, but I thougth I could leave it as opened as possible and see if someone had a fun and surprising idea.\\
Maybe I left it so opened as to be more confusing than interesting ?
