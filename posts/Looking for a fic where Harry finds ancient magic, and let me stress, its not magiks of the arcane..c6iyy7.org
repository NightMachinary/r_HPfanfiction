:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
From what I remember, it's an unfinished 4th year fic where Harry starts learning magic that is implied to be seperated into two parts: Actual battle magic which could completely alter the landscape of the battlefield, and lesser magic which is still amazingly powerful but many times weaker than the real battle magic.

Towards the last chapters of the fic Harry uses the lesser magics to defeat the dragon for the first task.


** Was it northern magics that he learned?

linkffn(13082443) I think it's this one.
