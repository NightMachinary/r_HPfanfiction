I had three vague ideas about this sort-of prompt:

Ever since Harry met X on the first train-ride to Hogwarts, they've been antagonistic towards one another.

However, for X it quickly became more of a "pulling the pigtails of the one you like" sort-of thing.

The older years, and some teachers, find it oddly adorable and bemusing to see Harry get all anger-flustered at her for getting under his skin.

When they study boggarts, his isn't Voldemort or a dementor: it's her, either as she was now at 13 or when she's older (like 17), in a muggle wedding dress, humming "here comes the bride". Or of them saying vows.

He freaks out, naturally.

The second is that it's James who sees this with Lily: in a reversal of what you'd expect, the idea of marrying his crush actually terrifies him (as he's only a kid, albeit a cocky one). Lily, unfortunately, takes that in the way of "oh, so I'd be good enough to be your girlfriend but not a wife?". She's... rather indignant, to say the least.

The canon situation sort-of reverses itself over the course of a year: James ends up practically running, and she's the one chasing him.

The older years, who liked the James/Lily entertainment? "Called it. You owe me two galleons."

The third?

In a twist of the Ice Queen Greengrass trope, what Daphne sees is her worst nightmare: her, older, as a prim and proper dutiful wife; a marble statue that's unfeeling and cold. Bland. Boring.

Like her mother after she married her father.

The tomboyish, sparkly girl *freaks out*.

And thus she begins to irrationally traverse a path to avoid this fate at all costs.

Unfortunately for Harry, she quickly figured out that by dating him and eventually getting a ring on her finger from someone who's the antithesis of her background and Slytherin as a whole? Best way to avoid that "future". Yeah. she's not exactly rational, and her single-mindedness is beginning to freak out her friends.

Poor Harry: it's James and Lily all over again -- except he's the Lily!


** I really like the third one.
