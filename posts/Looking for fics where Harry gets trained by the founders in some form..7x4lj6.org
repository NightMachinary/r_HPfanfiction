#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** linkao3(11284494)

This is a (so far) 5 part series - I love it! It builds slow but all will be revealed! I love the characterization in it, and I usually hate founders fics. And yes, it may not seem like it from the summary but Harry is most definitely a main character in this fic.
