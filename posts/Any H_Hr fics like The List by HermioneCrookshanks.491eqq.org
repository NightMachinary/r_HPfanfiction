I'm looking for some fics that aren't so down and dour. I have nothing against serious drama in shipping and usually enjoy it, but I'm looking for something a bit more lighthearted at the moment.

** Have you read "I'm Not Neurotic: The Diary of Hermione Granger" (also by HermioneCrookshanks)? I really like "The List," but I think "I'm Not Neurotic" is better overall.
