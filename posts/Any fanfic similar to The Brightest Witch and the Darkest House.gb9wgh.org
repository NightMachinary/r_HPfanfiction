I'm searching for stories where the main character is ruthless when it concerns their enemies and are creative in their use of canon magic. For example, Valeria (the main character) uses often Feather-Weight Charms to make herself lighter and allowing herself to run faster or Colour-Changing Charms to better hide her identity while she sneaks off. She also exploits Neville's potion mishap from their first Potions class and turns it to eleven when Malfoy corners her alone in the stairs and attacks and insult her because he learnt about her status; she sneaks in his dormitory during the night and petrifies Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle in their sleep before dropping the enhanced potion mishap on them and lets the potion make its work during the whole night. As a result, the three boys are sent to St-Mungos for a whole month. I really like the different perspective of the story and how much magic is explained and how much more full the years' curriculums are. I'm really searching for another underdog main character who is able to pass the challenges it faces because they are able to examine what magic can do and its potential and exploits it without caring for other peoples' feelings (except their friends). I also want them to change meaningfully the story. I don't really have specifics for pairings and such, but I'd prefer the story to focus on magic and world-building than romance.

Linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House)

I recommend linkffn(7613196) Pureblood Pretense + sequels. Fits what you're looking for regarding exploring the potential of magic and exploiting it, although Harry is much less ruthless than Valeria, and generally tries to resolve her conflicts non-violently.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.
