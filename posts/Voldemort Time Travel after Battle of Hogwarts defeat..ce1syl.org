** Probably not what your thinking of at all, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12473233/1/][Time Travel with a Twist]] Is a hilarious riff on the Reptilia28 "Don't Fear the Reaper" challenge, Where after Tom died he was told to go back and fix destiny or ELSE.

  One Shot - A random idea inspired by the usual Harry dies and his grim reaper sends him back in time and tells him to get together with his soul mate. But a thought popped into my head, why did it have to be Harry who was sent back. And thus this was born.

  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

  What he hated most about his perfect plan going wrong, is how much his nemesis enjoyed being brought along for the ride.
