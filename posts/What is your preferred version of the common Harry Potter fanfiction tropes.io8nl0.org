I like the Wizengamot made up of Lords but no actual titles like Earl. Each member family is counted as Noble for doing great acts on behalf of the Wizarding community of Great Britain. No Ancient and Nobel that's just something the blacks made up to sound more important, The same with the sacred 28 just trying make themselves sound more important. Each family can only control 1 vote no single person having 3986 because they went to Gringotts.


** - Heads of family are called "Lord" but it's a courtesy title that only denotes they are the head of their family. The "Sacred 28" and "Most Ancient and Noble" are pretentious titles that the super-rich got together and conferred on themselves, but have no practical purpose other than to denote who is "us" and who is "them."
- Goblins are not actively hostile (they aren't in the books), but they are not volunteering to help Harry either. They provide "banking" services (really just secure storage and money exchange), not advice on how Harry can get himself emancipated, nor are they going to make Harry the Crown Prince because he remembered Griphook's name.
- Yes, there is a Potter Family vault. The Potters had /stuff/, not just money. Unless there was gross negligence and/or theft, that stuff has to be somewhere.
- The exchange rate is 1 Galleon to 50 pounds. (This was the original rate, but then JKR was convinced that was too much. Changing it to 5 pounds was ludicrous, as it meant the Weasleys were absolutely destitute, with less than 10 pounds in their vault. She obviously just wanted it to be a number that's easy to multiply --- ironic since she set up the sickles and knuts with prime numbers that were deliberately difficult to multiply.)
- Wards exist. (They existed in canon, but JKR just didn't bother to call them wards.) A ward is a spell that protects an area through exclusion: the protective spells the trio cast around their campsite during DH were wards.
- Arithmancy is a spellmaker's tool, and Runes are carved and activated to create lasting spell effects. (Canon descriptions of these two classes are just plain stupid.)
- Magical ability is a sliding scale: on the lower end you have squibs who, while they cannot manifest magic, still have some (or they'd be Muggles). They are not affected by Muggle-repelling wards, can take potions, and use the floo and other items that do not require active magic from the user.
- Not every magical child is invited to Hogwarts, because not all of them have enough magic to get into the premier magical school in the UK. Like most posh schools, "legacy" students (those whose parents attended) are accepted regardless of magical strength.
- Dumbledore's external positions (Chief Wizard of the Wizengamot and Supreme Mugwump of the ICF) are mostly ceremonial, and have no real power. I feel this is necessary because otherwise I just have to hate Dumbledore for all the times he did nothing in the face of gross injustice.
- Lily's sacrifice was the final step of a protective ritual. (Otherwise there'd be a lot more children-who-lived, because most parents would refuse to step aside to let their child be killed.) Because it required human sacrifice, even though it was of the caster and not a (forced) external person, it was likely illegal.
- "Dark Magic" is a designation originally invented by the various governments, meaning "spells we disapprove of." Some of it has been codified by the ICF as forbidden in all member nations.
- There are nations who are not members of the ICF.
- Like any government, the departments in the Ministry of Magic are pitted against each other in a cesspit of infighting, backstabbing, rumor-mongering, and petty political shenanigans. There is no other explanation for Umbridge's rise to power.
- Harry's scar was not a proper horcrux. (This is Word of God; not in the books but in an interview. JKR says that she had Dumbledore use the word "horcrux" as a convenience when telling Harry that part of Voldie's soul was in his scar, but that a horcrux can only be made deliberately. Whatever spell or ritual is required, Voldie didn't have time to do it.)
- There are OWL and NEWT tests for classes not offered at Hogwarts, that students can apply to take at the Ministry.
- Yes, you can get a trunk with expanded space big enough to live in, like the wizarding tents.
- Ravenclaw's emblem is an *eagle*, and the colors are blue and *bronze*. (Yes, I do prefer non-licensed merchandise because the person who approved the house emblem with a raven was an idiot. They didn't make Gryffindor a gryffin, so why did Ravenclaw become a raven?)

Wow, this is super long! And yet I am sitting here wondering what else I can add.

*** These are all pretty common and I quite like them, although for my own I'd add a couple:

- There are a lot more wizards in the UK than you'd think from the Hogwarts numbers. Adult immigrants, and other schools not in the Beauxbatons/Hogwarts/Durmstrang 'Ivy League' existing, combined with the long lifespan of wizards makes it almost inevitable.

- Homeschooling is a thing. Compulsory boarding school education is only a thing that's enforced for those the Ministry considers a threat, ie Muggleborns and second generation immigrants. If a wizarding family wanted to they could homeschool their kid and have them sit their OWLs at the Ministry the same as the subjects not offered at Hogwarts. The main reason the upper crust send their kids to Hogwarts is social prestige. The Weasleys sent their lot because they had legacy acceptance and as a Department Head at the Ministry it would look bad for Arthur not to.

- The Statute of Secrecy is doomed. Deathly Hollows leaves off in 1998, and Google Maps comes online in 2005, with ready access to satellite photography for everyone, and cellphones are everywhere. Not to mention the UK's CCTV antics.

I disagree with this one. There's no reason to assume that muggle devices would be able to get past magical protections and repelling enchantments. Also, just because the muggle world is advancing doesn't mean that the magical world remains static. With wizards able to access the highest levels of muggle government without issues, they can easily maintain secrecy.

***** The magical world, as we see it in the books, is at least a hundred years behind the muggle, and not advancing remotely as quickly. They're still relying on obliviating witnesses in the late 1990's.

Not going to have much luck memory wiping a video that's already stored on a server halfway across the world by the time you realize someone's filmed something you wish they hadn't, are you?

Short of global-scale handwaving shenanigans they're screwed by the relentless advance of technology and the result is going to either see them extinct or drag their society kicking and screaming into the modern age.

****** Alternatively what we frequently see as them being stuck in the past actually /is/ just their trends and traditions (the fact that someone likes to wear old-style clothes doesn't make them stupid, and with all the feats of magic we see so often it stands to reason that they could make any kind of clothe comfortable -besides, let's be honest, pants, are not particularly comfortable) and don't reflect on how far their society progresses (which would be a fair bit as their inventors/geniuses would have longer life-spans in which to advance more on their researches/inventions). I think this take was better done in linkffn(More Equal than You Know).

Mind-whipping is clearly a good strategy as it prevents witness of exposing the secret even if they want to and as far as we know it is irreversible and impossible to protect from without magic (eg. Lockhart still being stuck at Saint Mungus), so nothing of that ‘willpower wins against reality crap. We don't really know how they are hiding their settlements or if the charms have any boundaries at all, the Fidelius can hide a secret in someone's /soul/, maybe unplottable actually /means/ unplottable, as in, the location of the place is completely unknowable without managing to fit certain conditions. Linkffn(Albus and Harry's world trip) does it in a nice way.

Plus the whole war scenario would probably end in a Pyrrhic victory for whichever side outlast the other, the muggles have guns (assuming that wizards can't protect against them without preparation or just shrug them off), nuclear weapons (not going to be able to use until nearly the end as the magicals are in places close to (or even inside) big cities, plus all the problems it would cause to both sides with the fallout), numbers (only counting military personal and ignoring that it is implausible that the wizarding society is so small as many make it seem and that there are also many other species that would also fight -like the goblins and merpeople) and the other sides ignorance about them. The magicals would have teleportation, the other sides ignorance about them, their own mass-destruction and unstoppable weapons (Mandrakes kill by sound, get a good number in the right place and it is goodbye to even big cities like NY or Beijing and all their population, while Fiendfyre is easy enough for even a relatively dim seventeen years old be able to cast, will actively seek more to devour, plus being able to devour pretty much anything and can only be stopped by magic, water alone does nothing to it), the ability to control the minds of their adversaries without being noticed, limitless space... it would probably drag on until one or both sides pulled the big weapons, then the death-toil would get so great and the fallout would become so bad that eventually the planet itself would become inhospitable.

** I like these fanon better canon:

- Ancient Runes is needed for enchanting items
- Arithmancy is needed for developing spells
- "Ward" sounds way better than "Magical Protection", and simpler
- Tempus and Warming Charms exist
- Lucius Malfoy should be in the Wizengamot
- Wizengamot seats are mostly hereditary, with some Minister appointees
- Lily used blood magic to protect Harry. As long as Voldemort killed her, the sacrificial protection would be activated. It didn't matter whether Voldemort offered her a choice or not. I actually dislike this part, because it's just another one of long chain of lucky events that brought down Voldemort. Why can't good guys be proactive and ruthless at least for once?
- There is no Time Turner. Most fics featuring time turners either get abandoned in an overcomplicated mess, or rehash that frustrating timeline. Also, no time turners => No Cursed Child!

  I like all of these except tempus, because I find it fascinating how complex timekeeping actually is IRL and the idea of a basic charm that gives you nicely formatted locally correct time (including daylight saving offsets) doesn't feel like it fits in well with the arbitrary and whimsical nature of canon.

In linkffn(harry is a dragon and that's okay), that's actually what makes the spell tricky. At one point, it tells Harry that the time is currently "now, in this galaxy," which is technically accurate but completely unhelpful.

He also gets a few results based on fictional time systems, like Star Trek.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes.

** My elaborate Wizengamot headcanon/interpretation:

I see the Wizengamot as having no lords- there is an informal aristocracy based on on pure blood bullshit and wealth, and members of those families do sometimes get seats, but there's no formal feudal system (thus why we don't see Malfoy, Augusta Longbottom, etc in the court, also the Black family are pretentious twits). There are 49 seats (7x7, a powerful magical number). In theory, people are appointed if they have performed exceptional services to the Wizarding World (like Dumbledore beating Grindlewald), if they are well-respected or of exceptional magical talent, or head a Ministry Department. In practice, a lot of appointments are down at least partly to nepotism and bribes. Appointments are made by the Ministry, and are generally for life- however the Wizengamot can vote to expel a member, and votes on who the Chief Warlock is (see Dumbledore's removal). The Wizengamot is the primary check on the Minister's power, as while a Minister can appoint members to fill vacancies, they cannot expel members without the Wizengamot's approval, thus limiting their ability to stack the court. Theoretically, the Wizengamot can vote to criminally convict a Minister, and the threat of this (charges for negligence or complicity in covering up the return of Voldemort) is what forced Fudge to step down after Order of the Phoenix. The Wizengamot is also the body that votes on whether to give someone an Order of Merlin. There are no formal political parties-the population is too small to support them-but there are two informal factions, these being the Reformers (de facto leader Albus Dumbledore, later Kingsley Shacklebolt), and the Conservatives (de facto leader Cornelius Fudge, but really Lucius Malfoy, later Scrimgeour, finally subsumed by Voldemort's coup). There are also a number of "neutral"/swing seats (de facto leader Amelia Bones).

The Minister is the only directly elected position, elected by a popular vote of British Witches, Wizards, and Squibs aged 17 and up. Magical creatures and Muggle relations of Witches and Wizards do not have voting rights. However, the Ministry has been known to appoint an interim Minister during a crisis without holding the election.

Other tropes:

*Manipulative Dumbledore-* Dumbledore's faults are a product of a decent, well-meaning man trying to do at least three jobs that aren't really compatible simultaneously.

*Marriage contracts-* You could have one, of course, like any other magical contract, and its been known to happen on occassion. But its illegal and treated as the forced marriage/rape it is.

  德拉科发现自己被困在一个重复着同一个二十四小时的时间循环里，这肯定是波特的错。最开始，这个时间循环像是一个给了他自由。他可以做任何事，说任何话，不顾及任何后果。但在不停的循环中，他发现他逐渐爱上了那个傻瓜。突然间，这个时间循环像是个大陷阱。但他要怎么在这个短暂的时间循环里让波特爱上他呢？
