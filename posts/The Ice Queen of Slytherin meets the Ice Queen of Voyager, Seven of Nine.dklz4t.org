** There are way too few Harry Potter/Star Trek crossovers, they offer great possibilities. There were some great ones in the past, but some have been removed and others fell through.

Still, I think that Seven of Nine vs a pureblooded Slytherin would be a great interaction.

There are many issues to consider, but I think it would be worth it. The only one of any quality we have right now is Through the Wormhole, which is nice, but not super great.

Harry's Trek and Lost are okay stories but they aren't great or super funny.

** ...who would the Ice Queen of Slytherin be, exactly? Pansy, Daphne?

*** I had Daphne in mind, because she's the one I always see portrayed as an ice queen. However, if you think Pansy works better, by all means, use her.

  My take on the manipulative Dumbledore stories - from Dumbledore's point of view. Written late at night, not proof-read. Will probably go over it later, if people think it's worth a tidy-up.
