** In [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], Hermione is an adept hacker.

There's no magic in the story. It's kind of James Bond with mild superscience. Hogwarts is morphed into an elite spy school, populated by the younger scions of British nobility (pureblood analogues) and unrelated kids who somehow showed their potential (effectively muggleborns). I rather enjoyed it, though it tries to stick to the canon storyline more than feels natural.

*** Speaking of hacking, I especially enjoyed the part where she implanted a dozen fake IDs into the GCHQ database.

**** Harry Potter and the Sorcerors stone is 77k words. That book was bigger than most. So, logic would dictate that 42k words is fairly good for a book.

***** As I am a fast reading I burn through 100k word fanfic like no business. So I always try to seek out fics at least above 65k. I don't limit what length I want in the description cause some ppl like smaller size fics.
