In my opinion, Draco Malfoy should have been expelled /at least/ for his actions during sixth year. Yet I've seen during discussions on the main HP sub, and also in various fics, a form of desperate apologetics concerning their brief duel. Often it turns out that not only is he excused from any culpability, but Harry himself gets villified for injuring him! Sure, Harry used a dangerous spell in immediate self-defense, but if he hadn't then he'd be subjected to an unforgivable curse. It could even be argued that he saved Draco from achieving an Azkaban-worthy crime. I get that a lot of people (for reasons I'll never understand) hold some kind of obsession for Draco, but how many attempted tortures and murders would he get away with before being punished? It's a nitpick of mine but it's just incredibly annoying.


** This is a bit wtf moment in the books for me. Harry gets in trouble for almost accidentally killing someone who was going to purposely torture him. And fucking Snape wanders in, throwing Harry all the blame, as usual. If there is a fic where people get remotely upset with Draco for attempting this, I would be super happy.

** This is just speculation, but here's what I think. First, Snape is the one who found them. If it was any other teacher, Malfoy would have been in a lot more trouble. The fact that it's Snape is important.

Now, Dumbledore would have been the one who expelled him. If Draco would have been expelled, his mission to kill Dumbledore would have been a failure. Had he failed, Voldemort would have killed him as punishment for him and his family. Dumbledore explained on the top of the tower that he never did anything to stop Draco because he was trying to protect him. By not expelling him, he was still trying to protect him.

I would honestly rather believe that he's protecting Draco to keep Snape breathing (which he views vital to the war effort, perhaps only 2nd to Harry), due to the unbreakable vow he gave to Narcissa (are the motivations for that ever explained?)

Otherwise, protecting someone with three attempted murders and unforgivable use is just plain evil stupidity.

**** Yeah it's not like Dumbledore is evil just for shits and giggles. He just has his own agenda (protecting Snape and winning the war) that takes precedence over his duties and protecting his students.

I often get into this argument with Dumbledore lovers who are under the false impression that I consider him "comically" evil. He's just evil like any other regular person: Rationalizing himself into a position where he has to do evil things to continue.

***** Perhaps with the difference that he holds power so his "evilness" becomes more apparent. Jane in accounting can spit in your lunch if you piss her off, Dumbledore has the power to bend the law to his will, like getting Snape off without a proper explanation or sweeping all the messes at Hogwarts under the rug. He can place a child in an abusive home whereas the aforementioned accountant can't do even a fraction of that.

*** I think it's also worth noting that Harry was the only witness, and since Malfoy didn't complete the curse there wouldn't have been any evidence. And Harry's account couldn't really be considered unbiased - it was well known that he and Draco didn't get along, and Harry would've had motive to lie about his actions being in self-defense.\\
Even if Dumbledore had wanted to expel Draco (which he obviously didn't), I doubt he could have justified doing so.

**** Yeah, in a world with mind reading and flawless truth serums, there'd be no way to verify Harry's account... Sorry for the sarcasm, it just feels incredibly silly when I hear things like that. The Malfoy name had already gone to dirt, Lucius was a confirmed and imprisoned Death Eater in a society with a shitty court system.

And Scrimgeour (no clue if I spelled that right) would have been chomping at the bit to have A) Have a verifiable public record of doing something against the Death Eaters and B) For saving the "Chosen One". There's not a chance that without Dumbledore handling the situation to his liking that Draco would have gotten off for half of that stuff.

Except that everything we see of the wizarding justice system suggests that they don't use those methods? After all, innocent people get thrown in jail (and not just Sirius; Scrimgeour arrested Stan Shunpike) and guilty people walk free with alarming regularity in the series, and whenever we saw court proceedings (Dumbledore's memories in GoF, Harry's trial in OotP) neither Veritaserum nor Legilimency were used. They aren't even mentioned as possibilities, which strongly suggests that they're not admissible in court. Plus, both Harry and Draco were underage at the time, and it seems reasonable that there would be strict regulations on using Veritaserum or Legilimency on a minor.

And sure, the Malfoy name didn't count for much at that point, but arresting or even expelling Draco on such limited evidence would set a precedent that I imagine a lot of prominent, powerful families would find quite concerning.

Sirius was imprisoned without a trial, and thus without having the opportunity to provide any defense, Veritaserum or otherwise. Shunpike wasn't convicted, just arrested, I'm pretty sure. Even if he wasn't, was he ever /confirmed/ not to be a Death Eater? He sure was weirdly intense about Sirius when he thought he was a mass murderer.

#+end_quote

Harry's trial in OotP was a kangaroo court - they were deliberately messing with the system to get a guilty verdict that they knew wasn't true. Using Veritaserum would be directly counter to that. I think that during Karkaroff's trial he actually WAS under Veritaserum. When he says that the literal prosecutor's son was a Death Eater, everyone takes it seriously instead of writing it off as a desperate prisoner saying whatever he thinks will cause a stir. Why would they react that way, unless they KNEW he was telling the truth.

******* But Karkaroff isn't behaving anything like a person under Veritaserum. When Crouch Jr is given Veritaserum after the third task, he's described as talking "in a flat, expressionless voice" (GoF Chapter 35) and is calm throughout the whole thing, while Karkaroff is described as shouting and sounding panicked. (Also, Karkaroff didn't name Crouch Jr as a Death Eater in the books.)

As for Shunpike, we're clearly not supposed to believe he's a Death Eater. Mr. Weasley says "I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he's about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as though they're making some progress, and ‘three arrests' sounds better than ‘three mistaken arrests and releases'" (HBP, Chapter 16; note also that Shunpike isn't the only person the Ministry is holding on dubious evidence) and it's not like Scrimgeour tried to convince Harry Shunpike was actually guilty.

And of course Harry's trial in OotP was a kangaroo court, but if Veritaserum or Legilimency were generally admissible then Dumbledore would've requested they be used.

Plus, I think it's telling that when Harry confronts Scrimgeour about Shunpike's imprisonment, Scrimgeour doesn't even try to convince Harry that he could be guilty.

****** The problem is Sirius was apparently caught red handed and thought to have been insane, so his testimony (Veritaserum or not) was considered inadmissible; Harry was not thought to be insane. Draco was a student, son of a convicted death Eater and while Harry was a popular, living witness to give an account and who could volunteer to take the truth serum (Scrimgeour was desperate to get Harry on board months later, after all). In the examples you mention those people were all presumed guilty (or else already in prison, e.g. Kakaroff) or the court cases were farces (Crouch Jr. and Bellatrix), the result was immediately obvious in every case from the beginning. Veritaserum was never said to be illegal at all, Snape even threatened Harry with it in OoTP.

And I doubt precedence would have been an issue at all. People were thrown in prison without a trial right after the first war, but that didn't spread out to judicial practice as a whole as Dumbledore confirms in OoTP by pointing out how excessive Harry's hearing was.

******* I never said that Veritaserum is illegal. I said it's not used in court, which is different. Lie detector tests are perfectly legal, but you still can't use them to get someone convicted (at least in the US). I don't understand your explanation of Karkaroff not being given Veritaserum, either - you say it was because he was already in prison, but the point of his hearing wasn't to evaluate his guilt, it was get the names of other Death Eaters. If the Ministry had a "flawless truth serum" that they could use in court proceedings, why on earth wouldn't they use to make sure he truthfully gave all the information he had? And similarly, if Veritaserum was an accepted part of court proceedings, why didn't Dumbledore request that Harry be testified under it at his trial?

******** The difference is current evidence suggests lie detectors are maybe 65% accurate, Veritaserum assures compete honesty (short of mastering Occlumency). But as I said, the restrictions on it appear to be in cases where the person is thought to be insane, so their honest opinion isn't worthwhile in court. A sane witness to an attempted crime is something can come before a court, especially when the purported criminal has so much going against him.

The Kakaroff point wasn't about Legilimency,.I'm saying that generally when the full court is called in it's on a case which has already been decided beforehand. There exactly zero reason to use a truth serum on someone you've already decided is guilty. Crouch Jr and Bellatrix were thrown away in record time and Kakaroff was only brought before the court because he was giving up names. As Dumbledore pointed out, having the full court meet for a hearing for underage magic was extremely unusual. The reason I brought these up is best you mentioned them in your initial response but you didn't consider that these were highly irregular. Harry wasn't originally supposed to be in court, he was set to have a meeting with Amelia Bones alone, and the others weren't hardly court proceedings (Kakaroff's wasn't even). When asked about this, JKR said that it /is/ used in interrogations but that it wasn't taken as gospel because of the insanity and Occlumency possibilities. As for why Harry didn't take it, there's plenty for reason. Imagine Fudge asked him "Is Dumbledore working against me?" He'd spill the beans on the Order and Sirius's presence at Number 12, even if the Fidelius prevents the Ministry from going in. That would put lots of people in jail.

** I'm not sure why you're hoping for Malfoy to get punished - while Draco makes an attempt at the curse, Umbridge actually casts the curse and is rescued from the centaurs and freely walks out of the school back to her Undersecretary job. AD was the one who rescued her - if he can manage to "forgive" Umbridge using an unforgivable, he will "forgive" an attempted one as well.

I cannot say for sure, but worst case scenario, a criminal case between HP and DM, the persecution would go as "HP cursing DM to point where he bleeds rivers of blood over something DM was trying to say". Any lawyer worth his salt would trash HP's case. I doubt saying "cru-" is enough to get off of using a hack and slash curse on a person.
