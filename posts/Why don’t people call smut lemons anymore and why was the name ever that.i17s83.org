** I gotta say, I've been disappointed for a while that we never got to the point of ironically calling the fluffiest non-explicit whatsoever heart-melting fluff pieces Peaches.

I feel like a lot of giggles have been lost to this development never happening.

** According to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lemon][TV Tropes]], the origin of the term is the "Lemon List," a mailing list of erotic fics named for some old hentai called Cream Lemon. I'd guess that as the "old guard" moved on and new people took their place, the significance of the name diminished until it was forgotten.

*** It's a referential name which wasn't actually any better than 'smut' so it makes sense that once the people who used it as a reference died off the people who had to pick between lemon and smut equally would just pick the simpler more descriptive one.

** [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Lemon]]

"Lemon" comes from the title of an anime called Cream Lemon, which is PWP in animated form. As far as I am aware, "lemon" refers and has always referred to any kind of explicit NC-17 sex in a story, and not specifically to F/F. Other shades commonly used in anime fandom are

- "lime," denoting a tasteful seduction and fade-to-black or simply the R-rated version of the sex scene,

- "lemonade," denoting a WAFFy lemon fic, and

- "citrus" or "citrusy," indicating a strongly erotic tone without necessarily including graphic sex.

- "Orange" sometimes pops up to describe stories involving just necking, but most authors don't bother.

** I think I still have a couple of Cream Lemon VCR tapes from early 80's in the basement somewhere. That is where the term came from to the best of my ancient and decrepit knowledge.

** Citrus used to be used to describe the degree of smut, the stronger citrus indicating stronger smut.

** I've always thought it's because lemons are sour, you know? As opposed to sweet like other fruit? I've heard the term “lime” used as well, but I can't remember if it's for more or less smutty scenes.

Lemons/limes are sharp and strong and and make themselves stand out, just as smutty scenes contrast themselves with non-smut “sweet” romantic scenes. Does that make sense?

Lol just my two cents though. I have no idea where the term came from. As for why no one uses them anymore, maybe it was an early 2010s phenomenon? Trends in word usage come and go irl, and maybe the fact that fanfic has these trends is a sign it's really settling itself in as a genre.

*** Lemons are explicit sex scenes.

Limes are non-explicit.

At least that was the original usage of the terms. Don't know if they've changed or not.
