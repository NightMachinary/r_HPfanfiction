** A challenge site I follow has a collection of reposted works on Ao3 (they're removed from the challenge site periodically). I find the writing generally pretty high-quality. The challenge site is multi-fandom, so I'll link you to just the HP ones (some of which are crossovers):

[[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/RoughTradeNaNo13/tags/Harry%20Potter%20-%20J*d*%20K*d*%20Rowling/works]]

I'm particularly fond of How to Save a Land, and Future's Past.

** I agree that Future's Past is amazing.

Looking Beyond is pretty good for Fem!Harry, although I can't remember how close it follows canon as it does go through each of the books.

** Harry is not the protagonist but I have really enjoyed [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/809115][Renascentia.]]
