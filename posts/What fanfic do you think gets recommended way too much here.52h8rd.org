** Probably any answers here are going to ruffle some feathers (because if it is commonly rec'd, a lot of people in this sub must like it) but here are mine:

- Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty - THE Bellamione fic but a super poorly written Hermione IMO. Couldn't even finish.

- Secrets by Vorabiza - Hugely popular Drarry. Everyone was super OOC. There was unclear character motivation for Draco and Harry. And there was a really weird relationship between Harry and Snape that didn't really make sense.

- The Original Naked Quidditch Match by Evilgoddss - This is a famous fic that is supposed to be really funny. I did not really understand the appeal.... It started out strong with emails going back and forth between characters about the naked quidditch match But everyone, and I mean everyone was OOC and it wasn't really even that funny.

- A Curse of Truth by butalearner - It is 200K words of stream of consciousness (for the most part). The author even explains that he didn't know half the time what was coming up and just wrote each chapter as it came - which made for weird and unfulfilling plot.

*** Prince of the dark kingdom is not perfect, but I just can't help but love it. I am rereading it now and I still think it's awesome. It's just so adventurous and humorous at times with great dialogue and characters (even if some of the OCs are kind of meh which is strange since there are some good OCs as well). I wish more fics incorporated the sassy and sarcastic side of Harry, it's fun to read and a good break from all the angst and seriousness.

Also, I don't think that H/Hr shippers have a lower standard - it's that, to me, there's a lot less quality H/Hr written sheer number-wise than there is, say Drarry so I would think a die hard H/Hr shipper will take any half-decent story they can get even if it's really not the best story all around.

** Well I've only been on this forum for a few weeks and it certainly seems to me that a very significant proportion of the recs (maybe even half?) are the same ones over and over again. I've glanced at most; none caught my attention, although to be fair the things I really want to see are more or less nonexistent anyway, and I do look for good prose before I get as far as the plot. The only one I gave more than a brief look at based on the glowing reports, seems to be a blatant self insert without any detectable accompanying plot. I could vaguely understand why people liked it (it's certainly undemanding!) but it doesn't seem to justify the attention it gets.

Maybe the question should be why the recs seem to be so very limited in scope, given that there are tens of thousands of fics to choose from. I find it quite frustrating.

*** I would hate to be presumptuous and assume anything here, but I just wanted to address one thing you mentioned. You see, not all OCs are self-inserts. I know a majority of them may be, especially among younger writers. But here's the thing, some of us can distinguish between ourselves and our characters. Personally, I would find it dreadfully boring and rather creepy to write myself as a character in a story, and I'm sure others would feel the same. Some writers create OCs because they really do need to fill a certain role that isn't covered by any canon character.

In my case, I wanted to write a story about a muggle finding out about magic. So, I created an OC. To be honest, it's getting pretty tiring (and somehwat amusing) to hear that she's a self-insert because, well, she's really, /reallly/ not. I'm sure any writer in a similar position would feel the same way, which is why I felt the need to address this.

Anyway, I'm sorry for this long response. It's not really directed at you personally. It's just my little defense of OCs or any character an author writes that isn't established in canon.

I'll see myself out now.

***** They are a lot of self-inserts and more generally, badly written OCs. But it's the same as OOC canon characters. Good characterisation, whether of original or canon characters, can be hard to do, especially when the author is new to writing.

I often wish that authors would just have straight made an OC instead of making the character so OOC much it's pretty much an OC wearing a canon character's name.

******* I'm not equating "recommended" with "good". They are two separate qualifiers, and hence, when you take each and apply them to the stories that have come out this year, you get a single digit number. You have "recommended" which is the largest category of fics here, then "Good," which is a smaller number of those fics, and then "this year" which narrows it down to just a handful.

As for the second part, I'm not implying anything against the writer - this is about stories. Bad writers can write good stories, and good writers can write bad stories. It's nothing against the author itself. Heck, I've written several stories this year, and I don't consider myself a good author, but I'd like to think I'm getting better.
