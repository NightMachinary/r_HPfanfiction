Like the title says I'm looking for a good fic that has Harry going back in time. But, not back to Tom Riddles time nor back to the founders. Like, ancient Rome or Ancient Egypt, I'm also okay with Merlin related stuff as long as there is no Hogwarts involved. I also dont mind cross-overs.

A fic that I did enjoy is [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1713721][Servus ad Harenas by StarLight_Massacre]]

Thank you.


** I'm not sure if you've read it, but there's the classic 'A Long Journey Home' with fem!Harry being sent back over two millennia in time and becoming immortal. It sounds really trope-y and cringy, but it's well written and I keep returning to it!

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
