Why do people say 'magical trunks' are cliché if they're canon? Harry's school trunk is implied to have small expansion charms, Moody was imprisoned in a trunk for a school year, Hermione's purse is a version of a trunk, and Newt's Trunk in Fantasic Beasts is VERY elaborate. Yet, despite magical trunks being an aspect of canon, I see people criticizing magical trunks all the time in fanficiton as 'cliche'.


** The main reason --- I think --- is because such a big deal is made about Harry getting one. You'll notice that even though they are canon, magical trunks fulfill specific functions in the plot. For example, Moody and his imprisonment. Even then, they are never really pointed out.

An example of this: If Harry goes 'shopping' for the first time in diagon alley, buys an expanded trunk then walks away from the store it's fine. But if Harry walks into the shop and gets an entire lecture about all the possible trunks and how they work, buys the most pimped out trunk he can find and then never uses it for anything plot related then it becomes a red herring. Most writers don't really care about this or rather don't know how to pace themselves and have all these cool min-max ideas, that they end up getting tunnel vision. So after 10 or 20 fics where Harry walks into a store and spends a chapter ogling trunks, it becomes a bad cliche.

The same goes for edgy dragon skin boots, pants, and panties. In fact, the entire diagon alley shopping trip has become such a cliche, that even if you had a legitimately good and plot-wise-oriented idea, it would be received as cliche.

*** Maybe unpopular opinion, but I kind of like those scenes? Sure they're overplayed and boring if they go on forever, but I love a good cliched shopping trip, because it's the start of the wizarding world! In the first book, we barely get a taste of magic until Harry finally steps through and really interacts with magic for the first time as a shopping trip. It kind of cements it in place in my mind. Also, I would be a kid in a candy store if I had the run of Diagon Alley, so it's a guilty pleasure to see what cool magical crap the author thinks up.

** TL:DR Write good fiction, and no one cares what tropes/clichés you use.

Here's the dirty secret about clichés, and they tropes they originate from: they're good things. As humans, our brains naturally categorize things, and latch on to specific things that are deviations from the norm, but are still reoccurring.

Here's the problem: Copy cat authors rarely actually try to use said trope correctly, instead seeing the interesting parts of a story, ie, the tropes, and not the rest of the work that was put into the story to make the trope useful.

For example, using a different trope, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by S'TarKan was an excellently written time travel story. The author took the time to effectively set up a world that needed fixing, and established (in a pre-evil Dumbledore fan fiction community) reasons why he shouldn't tell an authority figure. It established a need for the trope, and then followed through on the ramifications of the time travel. linkffn(2636963) if you haven't read it. Of the thousands of copy cat stories that I've seen since then, a rare few have bothered to do these integral parts of the story justice.

Another example, with a different trope, was Partially Kissed Hero, by Perfect Lionheart, which for all its many flaws, did an excellent job of spending the first few chapters establishing that Dumbledore actually was a villain before laying out all the evidence that has been practically copy-pasted into thousands of other stories. In canon, in the most objective light, Dumbledore is better viewed as a plot device rather than a character. In this story, Dumbledore is established as a character, logic is applied, taken to the nth degree, and that then, is taken to its logical conclusion. Linkffn(4240771) if you wish to give it a try.

It's not enough to put a cliché into your story.

First, the cliché or trope needs to serve a purpose in the narrative. If you're spending 1000 words on the purchase of the trunk, it should be central to the narrative. If you simply wanted Harry to have a cool trunk, then in a scene that is already moving the plot forward (because each scene should do multiple things to move the plot forward, if it isn't combine it with something else), mention that Harry got an enchanted trunk, in ten words or less, and then don't mention it again until it becomes relevant to the plot.

Second, if you are introducing a bit of magic or technology to the story, you need to fully explore how that cliché or trope should affect the world around it. Ask yourself the following:

Why does this exist?

Who was it intended to be used by?

How will this affect the richest in society?

How will this affect the poorest in society?

What will the market for this look like?

What will the black market for this look like?

** Expanded trunks are nothing new. Stupidly expanded trunks however are only recently canon with Fantastic Beasts and some people aren't a big fan of them being canon.

With the issue of canon out of the way, why are they seen as bad? Well they render homes obsolete and they change so much about our understanding of expansion charms. If you can have everything inside your trunk then why do people have homes? Why have wizarding tents if trunks can do the same thing? Why didn't Harry use one to have a better living space at the Dursley's?

Moody's trunk was big enough to trap a person. Not to have an entire bloody flat in there from what we saw.

The magically expanded super trunk quickly became a common thing in stories where Harry takes 'control' and buys new wands/glasses/everything and becomes smarter than Hermione more social than Ron, more skilled than Moody etc. A magically expanded trunk containing a library and training room were commonly part of this package. Often providing a bedroom that he could use in the Dursley's. Those stories are one cliché after another and everything associated with them is a bit of a joke.

Newt appears to be one of the highly specialized wizards (ex.

Anyway, you missed the point. They're good at one or two things, but rely less on other things because they are less talented in those abilities. By contrast, Dumbledore, Voldemort and Grindelwald are masters of multiple fields (seemingly), and will vary strategy based on the situation.

How would Dumbledore know it was ‘beyond his abilities?' Seems more like ‘I believe you can do it Newt.' That's much more in line with Dumbledore's character. Anyway, that doesn't matter: Newts creature abilities have clearly been what gave him the edge and make him relevant, not his magical proficiency.

McGonagall and Snape are both excellent beyond their fields-particularly Snape-and are directly comparably to Dumbledore and Voldemort, the difference is they are a tier below not that they have specialised talents (which they do, but as does Dumbledore and Voldemort).

Another possibility, even if it were beyond Newt's abilities, is that Dumbledore created it for him. It's heavily hinted in Fantastic Beasts (and now confirmed in Crimes of Grindelwald), that Newt is Dumbledore's ally and spy. I would think that if Newt were to ask for a case so he could complete his own personal mission and Dumbledore's he would have gotten it.

Over-representation, lazy writing, shitty plot. The famous winning trio.

Canonness or truth have nothing to do with whether something is cliché or not.

As it happens, in canon the trunks exist (though they are definitely scarce and rare artifacts, a bit like Pensieves which some authors would have you believe are as common as tic-tacs or even easy to make as a do-it-yourself 5th year project) .

Use them well and it's all good.

Give them to an angsty 14y/o so that he can escape the stifling grasp of the daft morons that encircle him, and alternatively have monkey sex with everything that breathe, train himself to become the next Merlin and bitch about old manipulative fools or snakefaced moldyshorts (or the three at once), and you, my friend, have some clichéd shit on your hands.

Or as some other type of mockery: Longbottom's brought an enchanted luggage because he's too attached to home and had to bring it with him. Or because he's so forgetful, the only way he'd bring everything he needed was to bring everything.

Fantastic Beasts was not yet published when magical trunks became cliché (and a lot of people ignore it anyway). Moody was the only example of actually living in a trunk, and the movies showed us how unpleasant that was.

***** I know what it means. My argument is that Harry Potter fanfiction clichés are different things than clichés within the HP canon itself (or clichés of the fantasy genre). Harry Potter is full of cliches. If HP fanfic writers couldn't use fantasy clichés, then the story would be so AU it might as well be an original work.

****** Some of the worst cliches in HP fanfiction (Trunks, MoD!Harry, Animagus Transformations, Werewolves & Vampires, super wands, etc) haven't been invented by fanfiction, but they have been expertly driven into the ground, beaten like a dead horse and converted into the tragic remnants of a once interesting idea that they are now.

They've been turned from "interesting canon tidbits" into horrible eye-rolling cliches. There's no contradiction here.
