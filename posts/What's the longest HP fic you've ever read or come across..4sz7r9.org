I'm kind of curious to see what people have found regardless of content. Currently I'm reading one that is nearly 1.5 million words long(which makes it longer than most published works) and one that is just a few thousand shy of a million. What about you guys?


** The Sacrifices Arc, by Lightning on the Wave, is somewhere around 3 million words. linkffn(2580283; 2612486; 2655016; 2720074; 2721625; 2836413; 3014337; 3189131)

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

There's also linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Fifth Element). Both exceed the million-word threshold, though the latter only covers summer and sixth year.

Essentially, it's ridiculously melodramatic in everything that it does. It falls a little tone-deaf in some places (most notably in its portrayal of some non-British characters) and the romantic tension between pretty much everyone is played up to unrealistic levels, but I'm being hypercritical here.

If you want a generous spoon of epicness in every other chapter, then this is the fic for you.

** Well, HPMOR is silly long, of course. Not much more to say.

Longest I've fully read is probably [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HogwartsExposedTimeline][Hogwarts Exposed Timeline]] (warning - TV Tropes link). There's 500 chapters, many of them in several sections, a few of them have interludes, and pretty much everything is a good thousand words long, if not longer.\\
It's definitely the longest fic I've ever seen, in /any/ fandom, in terms of the sheer amount of chapters - not counting the snippets of MLP Loops as chapters, anyway.

Longest HP fic I've ever /came across/ - aside from Hogwarts Exposed Timeline, for which I have no idea what the word count is - is probably A Third Path To The Future. linkffn(9443327)\\
I haven't actually read it, obviously, but I'm seriously considering that if I ever have a particularly free day (or, preferably, two or three).

**** Can't really say, it's been a fair while since I last +wrote+ read it. But perhaps it's not your cup of tea? If you don't like it, then feel free to pursue another story. Not every story is for everyone.

***** It does sound interesting though, and it's recommended fairly often. I often see writers improve dramatically after 100k-200k words, so the bulk of the fic should have great writing. I do want to read that. But that means I have to struggle through a writer's early awkwardness until they get the hang of what they're doing.

I guess I'll just keep chipping away at it and if it doesn't become readable halfway through, then I'll know it's not for me. (And continue lamenting how terrible writers become popular through sheer volume.)

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

** 3 million word series, lots of OC, its unique. loads of smut, invovles elemntal magic and elemental forms(Hermine's younger sister basically becomes a humanized Raichu at will), necromancy, turning muggles into mindless slaves to sell drugs, bondage, harry meets girls by saving them from predators so ofc they fall in love with him. open polygamy harem. angst. never even made it through half of the first story in the series. it goes from like 4 chapters of no smut and plot to like 1 superlong smut chapter then back to small smut it's weird.

** Longest single fic: /A Marauder's Plan/, just under 900k words. Longest series: the core 5 stories of the Dangerverse series, about 1.8 million words, although I admit I skimmed over a lot of it. (For comparison, the canon books total nearly 1.1 million words.)
