:END:
It focused on Ron and his relationship with Hermione. The story picked up where Ron disapparates after arguing with Hermione and Harry while hunting horcruxes. He spends time at Bill and Fleur's cottage until he finds them again. After the battle at Hogwarts, Ron travels to Australia with Hermione where she had sent her parents for safety. She has to give them back their memories of her, and Ron offers support. Later in the story, Ron and Harry start auror training and it's pretty intense. I think I read everything the author wrote, but they hadn't finished the story, so I lost it. I'd love to read it again! I believe it was rated mature.


** Could it be: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7562379/18/Australia]])? Or linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9787334/3/Faintest-Slimmest-Wildest-Chance]]) and its sequel In love and war?

  Although Harry and Ginny both survived the war, each bears scars from their year apart. The end of a war and the death of a brother don't make for an easy romance, but as long as there is the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance... The Weasleys gained and lost a member in one night. Will they ever be whole again? Best Romance and Best Drama/Angst in the 2014 HP Fanfic Fan Poll Awards
