Looking for a fic where Super- Genius Harry Gets tired of M-Britains B.S and creates his own magical continent. He fills said continent up with artificially created magical life forms that don't exist in Canon Harry Potter world.

If this exists I want a link, and if this doesn't then consider it a challenge.(I would do this my self, but I can't write to save my own son's life... if I had a son).


** Linkffn(for the love of magic by noodlehammer)

This fic is controversial at best and contains a ton of smut.

I'm not saying its bad at all, in fact I've been reading it since chapter one and I do enjoy it immensely, but it does contain needless smut. It's worked in well enough that it doesn't really take away from the plot but it still happens.

That said he does create his own island and it has shown him, unsuccessful thus far, attempting to create creatures. It's not done yet but it's updated regularly.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

**** Voldemort has only recently made his appearance in it and there have been some fights but I honestly couldn't say.

If I had to guess I'd say it'll end in the next 10 to 15 chapters but that's just a spitball based on current pace.

***** There's also that other plot [[/spoiler][with the vampire group]] that seems to overshadow Voldemort, so it may still take quite a while after that.

** Well, it's not super-genius Harry, but it's fairly powerful Harry. And while he doesn't make up his own species, he does make his own island and take a bunch of immigrants.

...So...try Rorschach's Blot's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9279255/1/On-An-Island-In-The-Sun]['On An Island In The Sun']]?

(By the way, it's bash-free, I think...Wait, I stand corrected, there's a little bit of Snape-bashing, in the sense that he's an idiot for the fic.)

** linkffn(Core Threads) has him create an island-state after a while, and he's increasingly ludicrously powerful as the fic goes on. It's an awesome read. He even kind of creates a creature at one point, though I can't tell you yet as that would be a spoiler.

Creature creation may be involved at some point in my ongoing fic linkffn(Tom Riddle and the Sorcerers' Stones), but it won't have an independant magical community or anything; as much as I like the idea, this is simply not that story.

** Ah, you might like linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions). This only comes in after a while, but Harry ends up creating a new type of magical creatures, living potions that go out of their cauldron and do things; they're adorable. (EDIT 1: Ahem. Forgive the bot messing up. Is it fixed now? EDIT 2: I think it is.)

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
