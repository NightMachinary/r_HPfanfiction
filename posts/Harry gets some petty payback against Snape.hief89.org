Just had the thought in my head about an older Harry Potter going back in time, but instead of trying to change things he becomes a teacher at Hogwarts just to be as much of a dick to Snape that Snape was to him.

  Wizard lack common sense. Hermione had declared that in their first year at Hogwarts. Well, even after the war, with Voldemort dead, wizards refused to change the things that were important to prevent events that led to the war in the first place to repeat themselves. Time for Harry to make sure, at the right time and place, to teach them.

** linkffn(Oh God Not Again): IIRC, he's annoying to Snape, but it's not a huge part of the fic

linkffn(A Black Comedy): dimension travel, and again, not a huge part of the fic, but he and Sirius and other characters bully Snape

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  COMPLETE. Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.
