...or Ron, or Hermione, or any character really :)

I've just finished a re-read and need more! Would anyone be kind enough to recommend to me some fic which takes place after DH (well, after the battle but before 'Nineteen Years Later')? Any length is welcomed (finished works preferred). I'd really love anything set in Hogwarts itself, the teachers putting the school back together again and so forth.

I'm not too keen on slashy stuff though :)

Many thanks!

EDIT: Thanks again for all the recommendations! These are great :)


** The First Day by Little0bird is pretty popular/good! linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day]])

** You'll find hundreds of 'Nineteen lost years' fics. Almost all of them are similar, so it gets old quickly. Some of them are very well written though, and are definitely worth a read. In particular, all of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][Little0bird]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian's]] works are very good. Most of their stories are after DH and before the Epilogue. In particular:

linkffn(Grave days by Northumbrian): Not my favorite work of his, but readable.

linkffn(Hunters and Prey by Northumbrian): Auror Harry and Ginny playing Quidditch. Pretty good.

linkffn(Epithalamium by Northumbrian): Fluffy, but I love this.

linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh): My favorite of Northumbrian's works. Excellent family dynamics, and a dash of mystery. The rural setting is wonderfully done.

linkffn(The First Day by little0bird): The most well known fic set immediately post DH. Ansty, but pretty good.

linkffn(More than Words by little0bird): The sequel to the previous one.

linkffn(These Cuts I Have by Melindaleo): Another immediately post DH.

linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Goblet of Fire): My favorite one because it actually does something exciting after the final battle. Set immediately after the war but written Pre-DH, so the author invents his own version of the final battle. Ginny goes to Beauxbatons to participate in the new Tri-Wizard tournament.

linkffn(After the End) is an excellent after war story that deals with the same themes that above stories do and in a much better fashion, but it was written pre-OoTP.

There are also a few 'Harmony' versions of this, linkffn(The Golden Age) being prominent among them. I consider these stories absurd, because I find the idea of Harry and Hermione falling in love and then marrying different people because it is 'expected of them' to be ridiculous. Most of them are written by overzealous Harmonians determined that H/Hr be canon despite what happened in the epilogue, so if you are more interested in Harmony canon over actual canon, give it a go.

** I was reading this last night. It's not a great fic, but it's moderately interesting.

Basically Harry runs off to Canada taking pills that make him a muggle, all to hide from his past. Kind of AU, but still an interesting concept.
