I'm looking for the best of the worst. The more irrationally hatefilled the better, and I want fics that take themselves seriously. No bashing parodies. I'd prefer, if there was Weasley bashing, for the twins to be bashed too. I'd also prefer AU, not plot regurgitation, but I'll take what I can get.

Slash, crossovers and dark!Harry are fine. Please no genderbending, harems, mpreg, smut/romance-centric plot or Pottercest. Thank you!


** Can't provide a fic, but I once had a guy repeatedly commenting on my fic raging at me for having Hermione in a position in the Ministry.

I told him that in that particular fic I was trying to stick specifically to established canon plus whatever J.K had said in interviews etc (this was before the volume of her random outpourings became impossible to follow). He still disagreed, insisting that his personal opinion that Hermione sucked and wasn't smart enough to have that sort of job was all that mattered.

That fic was also probably the closest anything's come to a James Sirius-bashing fic, because he was just a total asshole.

*** Ridiculous, specially since people like Umbridge or Fudge were high ranking offices. Clearly deluded that guy, Hermione (whether he/she likes her or not ) is more than competent to get a career there.

** linkffn(3384712) it a really good fic, its not really basihng for the most part but all male weasleys except arthur are portrayed negatively with the twins being potrayed in the worst possible light. romance is listed as as a genre but the fic doesn't resolve its entire plot around it

*** This isn't really hate-filled though. It's more just harry/james screwing around and doing his own thing.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

*** I don't think it's the worst possible light - I've definitely seen worse.

Also, I think part of it has to do with the fact that Fred and George are almost always portrayed ridiculously positively, so it's a bit of a shock to see something like this.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
