I'm looking for a fic in which Harry juste makes spell and other magical devices without caring about classes. He may not be in any house or has created his own or even just claimed a tower and tweaked it a bit. I think it would be fun to see hermit/scholar!Harry. Thanks in advance!

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

** Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) is sort of like this. Harry doesn't go to Hogwarts for several years and the only person he's very close to is Hermione. He's also researching how magic works --- even things like souls, horcruxes, etc.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
