It's a recent story that I'm pretty sure I found on here a while back, but I can't remember its name for the life of me. Daphne and Harry are competing seekers, but they didn't like each other at first, because Harry accidentally pushed her off the boat on the way to the castle.

Both Molly and Bellatrix are duellists or sth.

Any ideas?

  The Battle of Camlann never happened, thus the legacy of Arthur lives on. The blood of the founders still walk the halls of Hogwarts, while ancient enemies clash to this day. Years later, Harry Potter wakes up a stranger in a strange world. Between over competitive house relations and never ending mysterious plots, he must struggle to find the truth about that fated Halloween. AU

*** right on, that's it!

thanks so much, it was doing my head in!

i'm so excited to read more of this, and am kinda sad i didn't wait another year before starting it. same with The Mind Arts tbh, but then there's so much that's already happened there that i'm sorta fine with it.

**** It is definitely interesting fic, kinda like Flye Autumne's Chessmaster series, but with more accent on Harry himself. I hope it's updated soon!

***** yeah i like the AU-ness of that one

it's too heavy on the hermione-wank for my tastes, but can't be surprised seeing as the author is the type to enjoy hermione x snape

i like hermione as part of the supporting cast. it's weird if harry isn't being sassy to her or complaining a bit. for e.g, rustlings in the dark, the never-ending road for reasonable extrapolations of canon.
