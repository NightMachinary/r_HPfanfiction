First thing about is that it was the fanfic version of junk food. Cliche but like a train wreak you can't look away from.

Second thing I remember about is that it was a Harry/Narcissa/Bellatrix fanfic. It got there because harry essentially crashed the economy by calling in everyone's debt to the black family,who along with the Potter's , he just became Lord of. Then Lucius and a lestrange cousin sell there marriage contracts to him,there essentially slave contracts, to him to forgive some of their debt while thinking they can sob story to the press. Andromeda Tonks NDA'S to an inch of there life before they so much as step a inch out of the gringotts room.

Third thing I remember is that Narcissa is not dracos real mother due to all the shit Lucius did to her, and blackmails for money about it, infront of Dumbledore.

Fourth is that Narcissa ..... Is very dedicated to harry to the she remakes Bellatrix using mind arts on her to serve harry like she did Voldemort only saner-ish.

That's all I remember please help.
