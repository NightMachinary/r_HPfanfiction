Looking for a fic where Hermione refuses to date Ron and Harry and the Weasleys shun her for it so she leaves and becomes successful without them. Also any fic where Hermione stands up for herself and does not let Ron and Harry walk all over her.


** I've read Hermione bashing, where's she's evil or spying on Harry our whatever; but every fic out there usually has Hermione walking all over Harry, until Harry tells her to dial it back.

Honestly, what are you reading where Harry is walking all over Hermione?

*** who remembered to bring supplies for their mission? Hermione. How do you learn to put up wards? You take Ancient Rune maybe Artimancy. Who took those classes? Hermione. Harry walks over her simply by expecting her to do all the actual thinking and besides learning Defense never even bothers to try to learn anything else that might help him stay alive.

**** The issue is that she isn't perfect. She does make assumptions without verifying them and she does have a bit of arrogance. Harry isn't perfect either. But I know Harry wouldn't judge her based on not dating Ron.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** There is linkffn(Lady of the Lake by Colubrina) which has Hermione leave Ron and everyone alienating her for it. She ends up with Draco.

Pretty much everyone is 100% OOC, but once I accepted that it was quite enjoyable.

Obviously, heavy bashing of pretty much everyone who turned on her.

  Hermione and Draco team up after the war to overthrow the Order and take over wizarding Britain. "I don't even especially mind belonging to you most of the time," he closes his eyes and just breathes for a bit, savoring not being in pain. Finally he adds, "Just... try to take better care of your toys." Dark Dramione. COMPLETE

I haven't read most of those stories, though.

*** The bashing in those fics is disgusting, but definitely fits the request. I can't really see Harry or Ron ever turning on Hermione like that or vice-versa. I mean Ron might leave temporarily out of anger, but that's it.

Frankly, aside from Ron, no one really had a problem with Hermione dating Krum.

**** Indeed. For me, the friendship of the trio is one of the best parts of Harry Potter. I generally don't like stories where they break up - hell, I even hate book 7 for the stupid camping trip drama.

***** The camping trip drama was completely unnecessary and the implications of the deluminator are shocking.

Mind I think that they should have talked about their problems every once in a while. They took each other for granted too much.
