Looking for an AU story I read years ago --- not on any of the big sites like fanfiction.net or Archive of Our Own --- where Voldemort is still at large, and Muggle-borns are essentially rounded up and forced into slavery or arranged marriage. In order to save herself, Hermione begins a relationship with Severus Snape. Meanwhile, what's left of the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore's Army plot their return in secret, although very few people know they're alive. Both Harry and Ron are presumed dead by Hermione, who never really falls in love with Snape, but definitely comes to care for and respect him over the course of the story. In the end, she is “rescued” by Ron and the others, and the two reconcile following Harry's defeat of Voldemort. It's a really interesting take on the Snape/Hermione relationship, but is ultimately Ron/Hermione in the end. It was one of the best-written fics I've ever read, and I would love to find it again.
