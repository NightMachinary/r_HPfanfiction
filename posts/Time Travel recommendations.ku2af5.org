** Face Death In the Hope by LullabyKnell. A fic where Harry unintentionally travels back into "Just after Marauder Era" (aka late enough James and Lily are married but a good deal before Harry himself is born). One of my favorite things in fics (specifically time/dimensional travel fic) is having characters from different times/places interaction with each other. And this piece is /full/ of character interaction and development. However a side effect of this being it is rather slow paced. I'm fine with it but it may not float everyone's boat, for multiple reasons. The action is slower of course, but what is ostensibly (based in the tags) the "main" pairing has not happened or progressed at all in the fic so far and looks to be quite a ways away. Given it's currently 268k words in (plus a just under 50k word Alternate PoV companion piece), fair warning and all that.

** One Hundred and Sixty Nine- Hermione travels back from the early 2000s to 1981 to kill Voldemort. She has 169 days before he kills Lily and James. She befriends Remus and Sirius, the pairing is Hermione/Sirius (they're the same age and adults). Really interesting, how they deal with the time travel itself and the plot holes that could come of it. Highly recommend. Rated Teen, completed.

** I love time travel the best! I was like ‘I have a collection of time travel fics' but then when I looked it turns out that I still haven't actually put the fics in the collection!

here is one of my all time favourite ones, just because it's so different

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19949440/chapters/47238583][unfogging the future]] (Lavender Brown is sent back in time and it's a really great and unlikely Lavender/Tom Riddle

I love [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19328290/chapters/45976822][the archeologist]] for the same reason (adult fem Harry/OFC but don't let that stop you. The ship is very minor and the story is really awesome curse breaker shit )

And again [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15887595/chapters/37022604][rescuing the senior]] (Hermione saves Tom Riddle Sr and it's a wholesome story)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5733457/chapters/13211932][Nihil est ab Omni Parte Beatum]] (Hermione/Theo get sent back to marauder times together)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6762790/chapters/15456556][Futures Past]] this is a very wholesome romance between fem Harry/Orion Black with kid!Sirius and Regulus

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847/chapters/18163144][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] Hermione goes back to the start of first year, but she comes back as a Slytherin pureblood, and is a very different person, because she has to be. It's really fucking good

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Time Travel AU: Harry Potter had always led a miserable life. That was before his best friend and godfather had their souls sucked out by demons right in front of him. As if things weren't bad enough, he suddenly finds himself in the year 1942. Things only become more complicated when, among others, an enigmatic prodigy fixes her unwavering attention upon him. Harry/Fem Riddle

#+begin_quote
  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.

** Look up the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge (sometimes just Reptllia's Challenge). My favs from that include:

- Harry Potter and the Last Chance; linkffn(11922615) (also the deleted scenes)\\
- Three to Step Back; linkffn(10766595)\\
- Reboot; linkffn(9552519)

In This World and the Next; linkffn(5627314)--not for Weasley fans! But the method of dealing with Dumbledore is fairly unique.

I do have to mention this chapter of Clell65619's The Boneyard: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11642988/19/The-Boneyard]]. It is incomplete, but I love this take on Sirius Black and time travel.

** I really enjoy Before the Dawn linkffn(6897584). Hermione got cast back in time during the Battle of Hogwarts, and has now gone the long way round back to PoA, and she's Sirius's first stop (or close to it - it's been a while since I read it last.)

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  “This is the most stupid thing you've ever done!” Hermione yells after Harry. Then she blinks. They're no longer at Grimmauld Place and, sitting huddled together on a familiar four-poster bed with red hangings, are four teenaged boys, staring avidly at them. Well, this is just brilliant, she thinks. “And you didn't even get the year right!”Or: the one in which Harry is done with the war and thinks it's time he got something he wanted for a change. He misses his godfather, goddammit.
