Always seriously bothered me that Harry would be so utterly careless and inconsiderate as to forget that Sirius, his godfather and the closest thing he has to a parent, gave him a way to communicate with him if ever Harry needed his advice, and Harry just straight up forgets it exists.


** I quite sympathize. Harry would have been on that thing most every day, multiple hours over the weekend. And there's no way in hell Sirius would tell him to call less.

** iirc correctly, Harry was worried that if he told Sirius about any problems he was having, Sirius would rush off and do something stupid and get himself killed. But I'm with you, it really bothered me that he had it for like 6 months and didn't use it once and completely forgot about it.

*** Yeah, which is equally stupid. Sirius is an adult, not a dipshit five year old, and he clearly understands that he has to stay at Grimmauld Place, even if he doesn't like it. Plus there's no reason he couldn't use it to chat.

**** I mean, I like Sirius and all, but he clearly didn't understand he had to stay at Grimmauld Place.

****** If we don't count the one time that he left because he thought Harry was in danger, which is excusable and quoting OP,

#+begin_quote
  Sirius would rush off and do something stupid and get himself killed.
#+end_quote

(which is you know, exactly what happened) he still left the house to see Harry and co. off to Hogwarts.

**** It was a very age-appropriate way for Harry to try to protect Sirius from himself. Harry at 15 isn't keenly tuned in to human behavior and doesn't know enough about Sirius to judge whether his self-control was strong enough to hear about Harry's troubles without choosing to act on them. All Harry had was the desire to keep Sirius safe because of how much he meant to Harry, added with Hermione's expectations that Sirius was likely to do something rash. Her judgement about Sirius' behavior wasn't much better.

It's frustrating for the reader, but well-characterized by the author in a very believable and human way.

***** I don't have any problems with Harry not talking to Sirius about problems for the above reasons, but when Harry /needs/ to contact Sirius, and Sirius has given him a way to do that, the mirror is a huge plot hole that swallows up any need to go to the DoM.

Basicly, he does not know its a two way communication device where he can ask questions etc.

** Didn't Harry not know what it was? Like, he never even opened the present because he knew it was something for Sirius to know if Snape was bothering him, not communicate. It count have been anything.

** I don't get why JKR even introduced the mirror. It only serves to create a plothole/ruin Harry's characterisation, but it doesn't add anything to the plot. It never gets used, as far as I recall, even in the following books.

**** JKR could have introduced the mirror back then, instead of wrecking Harry's character just so she could kill off Sirius.
