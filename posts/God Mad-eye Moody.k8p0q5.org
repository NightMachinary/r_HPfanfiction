So I was thinking, Harry's invisibility cloak is not your classic silly little cloak that becomes trash after some time, no it's THE cloak as in DEATH's cloak one of the hallows, a cloak so powerful that not even Death itself can find you when you wear it. However one Alstor Mad-eye Moody is able to see Harry when he is under the cloak of Death, in other words Moody is clearly more powerful than Death itself and Death should ask the auror department for one of those eyes so that no silly mortal with a cloak could escape it. Jokes aside, have you ever thought about this? Am I missing something or is it just a plot of? Is Moody some time of God of the universe more powerful than even Death?


** Don't remember if there is a official explanation for it. To me is just another plot hole, possibly the hallows wasn't a thing in Rowlings head when she introduced Moody and his fake eye.

*** Or the Hallows were not actually created by death and therefore don't have the properties they're claimed to posses in legends. It's the same way that the Elder Wand is not unbeatable and the Ring doesn't really seem to bring back the dead.

**** If we go that route, and the hallows are not what permits Harry to choose to come back to the living. What was the point introducing then??

** Read some theories that he was given the eye by dumbledore and that's why he's so loyal to him. Dumbledore got it from gridelwald. It shows him having one bright blue eye in his socket in the last movie and there's a theory that he replaced his own eye with the one moody would later have

*** Yeah I read a similar theory somewhere which theorized that grindelwald and Dumbledore might have created the eye together when they were discussing the search for the hallows and that the eye was later passed to moody somehow.

** or mad eye (barty)has other ways of noticing people. fir instance he could go off of sound. or smell. or because moody's (barty's) main target is harry. he could have a tracker on hime or something. i do like the idea though. it would make a good crack fic.

*** I could 100% see Moody building up this myth about his fake eye being able to see through any illusion just so he knows his enemies will try and fool him visually and he can focus on finding them with a different sense.

****** That was unexpected, but thank you! As long as Snape isn't OOC, I'm fine with reading the fanfic.

Just a question; Is Moody the real one or the fake one? [just read the summary; sry]

Will come after reading and edit this to comment :A

** Dumbledore said that the Peverell brothers made the Hallows themselves, and that "Death" never existed---its an in-universe fairy tale. Contrary to fanon belief, Death never created the Hallows nor were they remotely as powerful in reality as in mythology:

*Cloak of Invisibility:* The ONLY advantages it has over a regular cloak is its durability and the fact it is immune to certain spells (i.e. Accio). Other than that, however... Harry's cloak was never special at all---not even in DH.

- The Human-presence-revealing Spell bypasses the cloak as proven not just by Dumbledore, but also the Death Eaters in DH when they go to the Lovegood's house---the latter of which obviously occurred after we learn Harry's cloak is a Hallow.

- The Marauders' Map also sees through the Invisibility Cloak, too---possibly because it works similarly to the Human-presence-revealing Spell. Contrary to fanon, the wizarding world isn't stagnant. Its obvious modern magical creations like Moody's eye or the Marauders' Map could see through what is a glorified, overrated cloak with little going for it aside from its long-lasting nature.

- It can't hide him from Nagini in DH, who called Harry and Hermione over despite them being under it. IIRC, Mrs Norris does something similar in one of the earlier books (maybe PS?).

- Also failed to resist the Full-Body Bind Curse twice in HBP.

- The Disillusionment Charm makes you invisible and is easy enough that Crabbe and Goyle can use it in DH. The Cloak was so garbage that the likes of Dumbledore, Grindelwald, or Voldemort could equal/surpass the Cloak's abilities using their own wand. If they wanted to make a superior cloak, any one of them certainly could. They just don't need to because their Charms skill is enough to make an invisibility cloak redundant.

*Elder Wand:* Hyped up to be an unbeatable wand, but really isn't any greater than any other wand and despite being Dumbledore's equal, it wasn't good enough for Grindelwald to win. Its ability to repair broken wands might come from being made from Thestral hair, or possibly a unique combination of Thestral hair and Elder wood---something wand-makers might not even consider if Thestral hair was deemed an 'inferior' wand core, or if they took the legend about "Death" seriously. We only see Harry repair his OWN wand, so its possible the Elder Wand only repairs its master's wand rather than just any wand. Most wizards would likely be too arrogant to consider using their original wand if they possessed the so-called 'unbeatable' Elder Wand.

*Resurrection Stone:* Doesn't actually revive the dead, but mere spirits who may or may not be illusions conjured from the user's mind rather than their actual souls. Grindelwald believed he could make an Inferi army with it, but Dumbledore heavily implied such a thing was impossible for the stone.

** I just think that Moody put a tracking charm on Harry and since Harry was obviously not there, he assumed Harry had an invisibility cloak, or borrowed one.
