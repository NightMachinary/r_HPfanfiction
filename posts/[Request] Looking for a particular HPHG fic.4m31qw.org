Looking for this particular fic.. I only know vague details Its HP/HG it... I remember it in Ffnet

Harry became an Auror and eventually assigned as a guard for Hermione because she was attack I think

Harry and Ron decided to be auror and thus started training along with others(forgot who) While Hermione return to Hogwarts for her final year.

Harry and Hermione uses a book to communicate with one another. Another detail is they discuss in one of chapters about how they like Vanilla ice cream and they went together in hogsmeade? Because Ron did something that warrant him no break during training.

They encounter Slughorn discussing about Amortentia and how Harry(from what i remember) Preference change and ask Slughorn about th change

Another is not sure abt this but a first year? Muggle born recognize Hermione as someone who broke all the rules..

  After the war ends, Hermione decides to go back to Hogwarts for her seventh year. Without Ron and Harry by her side, her brilliant mind becomes clouded by the ever vocal opinions of her heart...and she's forced to reconsider the logical things in her life. Will our favorite ever be able to get her heart and head to agree? Non-Epilgue compliant. Hermione/?
