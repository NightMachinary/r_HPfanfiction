*** Sucker bet. The real money is on which element is it imbued with, so that it also cuts with fire/lightning/some-funky-demon/love.

  Master Kuzuko was delighted to find that Harry and Hermione were both very quick studies and by the end of the lesson they had been able to cast the 'Plaga' spell which acted and had wand movements like striking someone with a sword, 'Pugilo', which they already had cast during the power ranking test. She also showed them 'Dutus Plaga', which was mace strike and while powerful wasn't as hard hitting as a hammerstrike but still powerful and the final spell she taught them was something called 'Katano', which she explained was like hitting someone with a samurai sword as it was powerful but more importantly with enough power behind it was capable to slicing through their opponent's shield.

** It's a harem story, but one with slow progress though.

The fiction is reserved for people who want something entirely 'new'. 90% of the fic takes place outside of Britain, and a large majority of the characters are rather bland OC's.

All in all, I was intrigued by it at the start, but found the story rather dull and at times just plain boring. I basically skim through the new chapters, but the story utterly failed to drag me in.
