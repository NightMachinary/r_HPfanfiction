alrighty, so, first off: this review is based on my own personal taste. everyone likes different things in fanfic, and i'm not here to argue. debate, maybe, but not argue. this series is one recommended here a lot, by me and others, and if you've been putting off taking a look at it then maybe this'll convince you one way or another. this review contains minor spoilers. fic can be found at [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/993900]]

the main premise of the Arithmancer series by White_Squirrel is that Hermione is a math nerd rather than a book nerd. upon her introduction to the Wizarding World, she requests to test into the Arithmancy class and does so easily, and surprises everyone at Hogwarts with her math skills. as you may have heard, she becomes pretty OP.

.

*deviations from canon*: well-supported and thought out. Hermione in the beginning isn't really that OOC, honestly- a lot of the things seemingly different from how she is in canon could actually have happened. differences later on are easily attributed to the butterfly effect. there's a lot of creative extrapolation from canon lore involving spellcraft and ritual magic, but none of it is contradicted by canon. *4.5/5*.

.

*characterization of the main character*: i like how she's shown to grow and mature over the course of the series, far more so than her canon counterpart. sometimes she's almost a little cringey (for lack of a better word) or talks in ways that i find don't flow easily (we'll get more to that later) but, again, it's in ways similar to canon. she's definitely not a Mary Sue, despite how OP she becomes- she has flaws, and they mature but don't completely fade. it's realistic. *4/5*.

.

*characterization of supporting characters*: Harry changes in different ways than he does in canon; he becomes slightly more confident and comfortable asking his friends for help, and is generally more likeable. his relationship with Ginny doesn't come out of nowhere and feels more organic. Ginny's well-written and her friendship with Hermione is a joy to read. in my opinion, Ron is really well done in this fic, and the good traits implied in canon are all here; the Trio don't immediately make up from Ron's bs in Fourth Year, but they talk about it and do manage to heal in ways that feel more realistic than canon.

i'll talk about this more below, but George is really well done; i like that the author actually bothers making him different from Fred in ways that matter. i also really enjoyed how the author wrote Hermione's roommates. going off that- Luna is well written and isn't a caricature the way she is in some other fics (or canon, imo.) there's a cool plotline of the Lovegoods starting a pamphlet thing for the war.

Professor Vector is a really great mentor figure. she accepts that Hermione will soon surpass her, and accepts when she inevitably does. this fic is host to the rarest Dumbledore of all: one who has faults as well as virtues, and has caused a lot of harm but is not ultimately evil, and who genuinely cares for his students. i actually kinda like Dumbledore in this fic bc he doesn't hide his flaws, and attempts to make amends. Dobby? dope. house-elf OC Sonya? fucking AMAZING. we stan.

Hermione's parents are almost unrealistically supportive and loving of her. they look out for her safety without being overprotective, meaning that they understandably are furious that the school keeps letting her get into danger. overall *5/5*.

.

*the romance*: i like that the end pairing isn't the main focus of the fic- it's very much second to the rest of the plot, because it isn't a priority at all for Hermione until later in the fic. one of my pet peeves is when people end up with their first crush, and this is avoided for the most part here (aside from the Harry/Ginny relationship, which is actually carried out quite well); Hermione actually has a bit of a crush on Cedric at one point before starting things with George. there's a little bit of angst in Fourth and Fifth Years regarding the state of their relationship, and they actually briefly break up before they're even really together. during that time, she dates a couple of other boys. later in the series, they date for real, and their romance deepens into a genuinely healthy and supportive relationship. *5/5*.

.

*worldbuilding*: as stated, nothing directly contradicts canon. the author has some amazing ideas about ritual magic, linguistics, and math-related stuff as well as the history of the Wizarding World. i find it interesting that wizards/witches in this fic all mostly subscribe to the same religions as Muggles, rather than going the badly-researched-homogenous-paganism route that so many fic authors seem to favor. the goblin and elf cultures are well written. *4/5*.

.

*wizard politics and politics in general*: for the most part, we only really see the academia-related side of it. there's a subplot in Fifth Year involving an academic prize. near the very end of the series, Hermione publishes a controversial paper and stuff happens that tie neatly into irl politics. when they're on the run, the Death Eaters manage to tie Hermione and Harry's names to a British terrorist organization that was doing lots of violent shit at the time. i like that these bits are written in; not a lot of fic authors bother looking into the Muggle side of things, or larger cultural issues. *5/5*.

.

*redemption vs. revenge*: heh. vengeance is carried out, and it's carried out well. no spoilers, but let's just say i almost pity Umbridge and Bellatrix. other than that, Narcissa Malfoy kinda-sorta gets forgiven in the next-gen arc? it's not shown much and has more to do with an OC. *5/5*.

.

*diversity*: main characters are all presumably neurotypical, white, and straight/allo/cis. there's a bit of rep in the side characters: two of Hermione's roommates begin a relationship into the series, although it isn't a focus at all. one side character is revealed to be ace near the end of the series. a few characters are strongly implied to be bisexual. there's Dumbledore, of course. there are Hindu and Jewish students at Hogwarts, several of whom Hermione is friends with. Hermione herself has strong spiritual beliefs in the realm of Christianity, which turned me off a bit but that's personal bias.

the author is /very/ emphatic that Hermione in this fic is not mentally ill or disabled; several times Hermione clarifies that while savants do exist, she isn't one, she only got her math skills through hard work. she refers to herself as "lucky" specifically in the context of not being neurodivergent. thing is, the author doesn't seem to have much understanding of how autism works irl; in this fic, Hermione is textbook, from her social awkwardness to her sleep/anxiety issues to her tendency to lose herself in work to her tendency to ramble on and on about math. her anxiety and refusal to get enough sleep in First Year are a major issue for her, and come up several times in later parts as well. she sees a therapist in the summers for troll-related trauma (and later for lingering PTSD after the war). she doesn't come across as neurotypical at all in this fic to me.

this is speaking as an autistic who was diagnosed with "savant syndrome" (ugh) as a child. it's true that i'm biased, but plenty of other fanfic readers are autistic and may also find this off-putting so therefore i'm including it as this is a fanfic review and it's not like your downvotes will kill me. it's not huge but it's there and it bothered me, unintentional though it may be. overall i gotta say *1.5/5* on diversity.

.

*prose*: it's good, though not exceptional. there are some really, really good bits and some bits that kinda fall flat to me. some of the dialogue feels... odd? like, Hermione going "i think i just had a major depressive episode!" and so on and so forth. there are some good speeches, and plenty of quotable lines. readable enough for you to be able to binge-read the whole thing in one sitting, but able to be read sprinkled throughout a week. versatile. *4/5*.

.

*humor, references, and quirks*: this version of Hermione, while not a book nerd like her canon counterpart, does enjoy scifi and classic fantasy. there's a sideplot where she manages to indirectly torture someone by making them think Lovecraft's works were nonfiction. lots of Doctor Who references, more so towards the end of the series- she occasionally tries to get people to call her the Doctor and sometimes they do. if i say more on that it'll be a spoiler, sorry. she actually creates several spells based on things from scifi/fantasy books. imo it never feels forced or inorganic. *5/5*.

.

*the math itself*: the author puts a lot of effort into trying to make it understandable for the average person who hasn't studied up on math since graduating high school, and for the most part succeeds. the reader doesn't really have to do any actual math, but it suffuses the plot; skim through the math-heavy paragraphs if you like. i didn't, and actually learned a bit. if you have a number phobia this fic isn't for you. *4.5/5*.

.

*morality*: Hermione is kinda ruthless in this fic. i don't really think there's any way to compare this to canon bc in canon she doesn't actually do much for the war; in this fic, she argues ethics with Dumbledore, kills bad guys, and defends herself with lethal force. she doubts herself and worries and it's logical and i like how it's done. *5/5*.

.

*overall: 52.5/60 for a score of 87.5%*. that's an Exeeds Expectations, i think?

final thoughts- i definitely recommend this to everyone who likes AUs, Hermione-centric fics, stories with good worldbuilding and spellcraft, well-developed OCs, realistic character development, and the Hermione/George rarepair. this took me an hour to write and now i'm going to make toast.

*** Oh, I'm so very sorry, dear random person on Reddit. Were you offended by the lack of capital letters? Did the lowercase letters bother you? Did it hurt your feelings? Does it make you upset that complete strangers on the Internet choose to /(gasp)/ type in ways that you don't prefer to type in?

Well! Gosh, I'm sorry. I hope that going forward, I'll be able to meet the standards of complete strangers online who have nothing to say about the actual content I type out. My sincerest goddamn apologies!

Look, I like your writing, assuming you're the person who writes the Victoria Potter series. However, and here seems to be the source of your confusion, we are on Reddit right now! The social rules generally lean towards letting people use whatever vernacular and form of typing they want! Isn't that amazing?

However, this does not mean that you are entitled to dictate the way people respond to your writing. If you deliberately choose to communicate in an obtuse way, expect people to think you are obtuse. If you want people to engage with the content of your writing, my suggestion would be to communicate in a way that is friendly to your reader.

***** Maybe you should do some introspective and realize that not everyone cares this much about how someone capitalizes their post.

60% of your comments are the equivalent of a review that's just a list of minor typos, except you somehow put an implicit sense of "do better next time, idiot" into the formulation of your comments. Looks like that writing ability is useful for more than stories extremely slowly!

**** oops, looks like you criticized Taure for being insufferable! Sadly, the reddit hivemind has decided that you must now be terminated. Downvotes have already occured and angry PMs are on their way.

Sadly, people side with Taure all the time, even when they're being obtuse or rude.
