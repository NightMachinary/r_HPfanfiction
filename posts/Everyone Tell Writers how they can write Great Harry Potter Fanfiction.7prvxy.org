** For the love of God, type your fanfic into Word, or the Open Office equivalent, and check for squiggly lines underneath. Those indicate misspellings, words that aren't used properly, poor grammar, and poor sentence structure.

Fully 50% of bad fanfic would rise to mediocre or better if the writer had a reasonable command of English grammar. I'm not even britpicking.

Finally, PROOFREAD. “Lucious” is a name. It is, however, not Draco's father's name. Make sure you are saying what you think you are.

** Leave Hogwarts behind. Its a trap. There is a whole world out there and this readership has read far too many 'canon done right' fics. Hogwarts is formulaic and easy its comfortable ground but its been done. There are three quarters of a million Harry Potter fanfictions. Too many of those slave themselves to a building, to events, to certain characters, Hogwarts is canon, out of hogwarts is freedom. Canon is often a dammed if you do, dammed if you don't situation. Leaving it behind but staying in the world allows for so much more potential. You can write your own stories within the HP universe without needing to talk about Astronomy class for the 56th time.

The readership has grown up. Those that started the books as kids are now adults. Don't be scared to move your universe with you, you can write best about what you know. If its been a long time since you interacted with children you might be way off trying to write them. There is so much scope for grown-ups in the Harry Potter world, so much exploring to do but Hogwarts is safe and Hogwarts is easy and therefore Hogwarts is stifling.

** 1. Don't just read fanfic. Yes, fanfic can be great and give you ideas, but it'll make you forget that "magical cores" is not actually a thing in canon.

2. Don't fail to read any fanfic. If you have an idea, go looking to see if someone else has done it before. The key to an original take isn't just an original idea, but you should be aware of what's out there.

3. Reread canon (even just a scene here and there) and try your damndest to get the character voices right. This is such a huge pet peeve of mine. Go beyond having Snape throw around "dunderheads." Try to hear what they sound like in your head when you read them, and work from there.

4. Invent what you need, use what you want, but "it's cool" is a bad reason to have, for example, Harry get a pet snake or be an animagus or invent a whole new form of magic. If all you want to do is world build and tetris new abilities and modes onto canon that's fine, but most readers are looking for a plot first. Focus on the plot. Everything should be there for a reason. This isn't a history text, it's fiction. We don't need every detail, we just need the relevant ones to the story you're trying to tell here. If Harry needs this new form of magic, that's fine, but we probably don't actually need to know everything about how it works, how he developed it, and so on. You should know those details so you can use them, but the reader doesn't need them.

5. If you're bored writing it, your reader is going to be bored reading it. Skip ahead; summarize; don't dwell in a boring training montage if it's just a boring training montage. Just skip ahead to them being trained, or a much later part of the training where they demonstrate new skill and new challenges. Sometimes this means it makes the most sense to skip entire /years./ This can seem terrifying and impossible and irresponsible. It isn't! Even if important things happen in those years, you can recap. Keep your writing snappy, active, always moving forward towards /something/--it doesn't have to be the main plot goal but it does have to keep moving. Stagnation is the death of interest.

6. Whenever possible, world-build or expose backstory in dialog or in scene rather than in narration. This isn't always possible but when it is, it is so much better. And keep that character voice during the exposition! The way Remus talks about the first war isn't going to be the way Sirius talks about the first war isn't going to be the way Albus talks about the first war.

*** I disagree with half of 4. I /love/ that sort of worldbuilding (inventing new magic, etc.), even for its own sake, be it in fanfiction or original fiction. Of course, there should /also/ be a storyline, but I'm fine with unnecessary worldbuilding details if they're creative. On the other hand, I agree with the first part, the "don't add something just because IT'S COOL and then never use it for anything" with the "pet snake" example. Either make the pet snake an actual character, or skip him; I'd argue that precisely by the same token, if Harry is inventing new magic, then by god, /tell us about this new magic/, rather than just handwave that "he worked long and hard and perfected it" and then only have him throw around previously-unmentioned new spells just because the plot demands it.

** Writing is communication. As such, you need to decide before you start what it is you wish to communicate. "I think Harry Potter is awesome" is a starting point, but dig deeper. What story do you want to tell? A love story? A coming of age tale? Who will be the players in this story, and what are their roles? People on this reddit like to complain about bashing, but really, a well done character bash isn't bad, and in fact can be fascinating. The key though is to know WHY you are doing this, and what the bash seeks to communicate. A bash of Ginny's character that showed how damaging building up your idols to be godlike then having to realize their very human faults would be excellent.

Speaking of what you wish to communicate, your story needs a theme and a moral. No, I don't mean something trite like your theme being Christmas or your moral being "follow your heart." I mean what message is running through the heart of your story and what are you communicating to the reader? For example, a story about Harry in Slytherin could have a theme of the importance of having ambition and drive, with the moral at the end being that if you work hard and are willing to do what it takes, you can achieve anything. A romance story between Harry and Lavender Brown could be communicating that sometimes, it's OK just to have fun and not take life so seriously with the moral being happiness can be found anywhere with the right people. Note that your story WILL have a theme and a moral, but if you are not intentional about it your theme and moral could be really off putting and even go against what you thought they were.

Once you have chosen what your theme is and what you are communicating, choose what characters will help you best communicate this. Yes, you can start with saying "I want to ship A and B together" but at that point you're not so much writing a story as simply writing pornography. This is also when you should think about SI's and OC's. There really are plots and themes that are better addressed with less familiar characters who have fewer preconceived notions surrounding them. Keep in mind that stories live and die on their characters. If your audience can't empathize with your charaters no matter how interesting your plot or important your moral, your story will fall flat. Conversely, you can get a way with a lot of plot holes and a dumb theme if your characters are compelling enough.

Be familiar with the Seven Basic Plots: Metamorphosis, Tragedy, Comedy, The Quest, The Journey, and The Monster. Decide what plot you want your story to follow in a grand, overarching way. Keep in mind that this is just a framework: you need to know your start, midpoint, and end point, but you can fill in the rest of the details along the way. You don't even really have to follow a three act structure, but I recommend it as a three act structure is easiest to read and to write.

Choose how your story will be told. First person? Third Person? Or, if you are brave and daring, second person? Will it be told as a standard literary account? Is there some sort of conceit, like this is a journal or letters or a biography or a story told to a child? Keep in mind what that medium will do for you. First person limits what the writer can know or experience. Third person allows a more omniscient perspective. Letters are written with the intent to convey something to a specific person or group. A journal is about self reflection and recording events and feelings of the author.

Finally, canon and fanon have their place, and sometimes it's on the cutting room floor. Slavish adherence to what has come before is no way to tell a new and exciting story. Want to tell a story where students are sorted in third year? Fine, as long as it fits your theme, plot, and characters. You can write a good story out of the dumbest ideas as long as your execution comes together well. You want to write victorian romance with Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin? You can do it if you have a strong plot and characters.

Oh, one more thing. Know your audience. If you are after fame and acclaim, keep in mind that certain things are going to get peoples attention more. Yet Another Time Travel Power Wank is going to get more attention than a story about Remus Lupins inner struggle with being a werewolf. Dramonie Smut Fest No. 45742 is going to be more popular than a lighthearted Harry/Ginny adventure tale. But no matter what, have fun. You certainly are not getting paid for this.

*** Lots of good points. I forget where i saw this first, but i would say the 5 act structure has a better flow, is better defined and is more natural than the 3 act structure.

If you can handle the "ALL CAPS" or just copy/paste/edit it to lowercase, this is an entertaining read explaining why the 3 act structure really isn't a thing, and the 5 act structure is more accurate.

*** You tell a very step wise writing process. I'll offer my way of writing as a sort of other view on this.

My stories start with a cool idea. My last story, for example, started with "what if Harry and Ginny go on a roadtrip together and are chased by evil guys with guns." The sequel to it that I'm writing now started with "I want to write a Stephen King story". And then comes the brainstorming phase where I draft as many plot points, story lines, themes and individual scenes/shots as I can. Somewhere in that process I start writing the actual story, and after that it's a balancing game between working out the planned out sketches and improvisation while writing.

I do pre-plan stuff like major characters, the ending and POV. But other than that it's not really as formulaic as you described. And that's completely fine. Everyone has their own preferred way of writing. The challenge is simply to write and write and write so that you get to know yourself as an author. Know your strengths, things you can improve, etc. You'll never achieve perfection, but I think the process of becoming a better author and getting to know yourself in the process, that's more than worth the time and effort.

There's also "Ride on the Erotic Express" but once the smut part of that fic is over it goes from 8.5/10 to 0/10.

** To write great Harry Potter (or any other kind of) fiction, first you must write a lot of bad Harry Potter fiction.

It's like drawing, or any other skill. You need to work at it.

Other advice: read a lot: You'll need to develop your taste if you want to make good stuff. Write outside your norms. Get into conversations about writing. Read books on how to write. Learn grammar. Seek feedback, but learn how to parse feedback into useful hints. Learn from other media. Learn form other fandoms.

But the most important thing is to write.

*** Wholeheartedly agree with this. I went through 50k words I've never published before releasing my first story, which was a 2.5k words long oneshot. After publishing 50k words and writing another 50k that will never see the light I went back to my first story and, while satisfied with the plot, the technical side sucked so I reworked it.

And I've read a lot of fanfic over that time, easily 10 million words, over which my tastes changed a lot. My first ever story idea was a Harry/Luna soulbound while I'm nowadays writing a dark mystery story with some Harry/Tonks fluff and international intrigues. I used to like marriage contracts/laws before realising that it was basically rape. I used to like Remus before starting to see him as a shitty man.

Some things stayed the same though. I always hated Snape/Draco/any Death Eater and can't stand them in a good light. I still don't like slash. I still do not understand why the Weasleys are well liked, I absolutely despise the canon pairings and I still think that the Epilogue is a pile of shit.

*Don't just rehash the same thing that's been done a million times. Don't fall into the trap of "cliches done right", since that's often times just worse.

*A story needs a reason to exist - what is the story that you're trying to tell?

*Don't pander to reviewers. The most important critic is yourself.

*Don't be afraid to derail from the stations of canon. There's no point of an OP Harry "Black" in Slytherin if he's just going to make all the same Gryffindor friends and hitting all the same plot points.

  it is slowing down in terms of popular, high quality content when compared to earlier years (such as 2012).
#+end_quote

I have only been writing fanfiction since 2014 and I am already very old, but I'm not convinced about that statement at all. I expect there are less stories being posted as the original fan base moves on and frankly the new batch of material (the FB films and the /Play/) don't seem to lend themselves to the same level of engagement, but I don't see any decline in quality in fanfiction. I wonder if the people who say this have been reading fanfiction for a long time, and it's not the fanfiction that has changed, but their own tastes. They recognise poor writing when they see it now, where they wouldn't have done a few years ago.

I've certainly looked at a lot of earlier stories and while it seems reviews were more plentiful than they are now, an awful lot of the stories are very badly written. I even see stories recommended on here that have spelling and grammatical errors and dreadful prose in the first paragraphs, yet people still like them. And unfinished stories too. (How can you know if a plot is any good until the end?) So truthfully, as long as the writing has a reasonable level of legibility, quality has not much to do with popularity; and for a lot of readers, plot is secondary to simply reading about their favourite characters doing the same things over and over again. In fact I think those fanfiction writers who do work at constructing coherent and interesting plots are likely using fanfiction as practice for moving on to original writing.

** Pacing. Get to the point, cut out everything in between. Otherwise there's a boring wall of text interrupting the actual fic, every other paragraph.

** Well, the most important piece of advice is: Don't shackle yourself to canon. Pick and choose from canon what your story needs, don't bend your plot and idea so it fits canon.

*** I concur. I mean, why bother writing fanfiction at all when you simply write Rowling's story with minor changes? I'm writing a couple stories and I always wonder why people rehash canon. Writing takes time so why would anyone waste time writing that? A creative plot is not difficult to come up with, or even a DIFFERENT take on existing plots.
