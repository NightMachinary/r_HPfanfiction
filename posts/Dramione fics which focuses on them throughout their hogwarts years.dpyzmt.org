As per title, looking for fics that focus on them through all the years at hogwarts, not just eighth year. Preferably completed fics or ones that update regularly. If anyone knows some please recommend! Thank you so much!


** Green Girl does. Like Brothers does, but I abandoned it at about the 4th year. I think Slytherin's Princess does (I only skimmed the first chapter so this is a very vague â€˜I think'). Try dramioneasks on tumblr. This sub doesn't like the pairing, and that blog has a wide enough ship specific following people can probably recommend dozens of fics that meet your criteria.
