(Exactly what it says on the tin.)

(Sorry if you haven't seen the movie and have no idea what I'm talking about.)


** Since dementors are metaphors for depression, I guess it would look like that part where her system console is turned to stone and she's unable to feel anything.

** I would imagine some sort of really cold chill, and the memories, particularly the nastiest ones would activate on their own accord. Maybe this moving darkness would possess their Sadness and make the host go crazy.

** maybe sadness grows or every other emotion vanishes for the time of exposure

** Cages drop down on the happy memories in the archive and daily take. If enough exposure passes then they are sucked away and forgotten, tossed into the abyss thing. Worst memories in the archive are sucked up to the control center one after another to be replayed. Memories that are not removed become tinted with blue hopelessness and despair. Changes have varying degrees of permanence depending on length of dementor exposure. A dementors kiss results in complete erasure of all memories, destruction of all “personality islands” death of all emotions in the control center, and the control console being irreparably broken.

** I imagine that rather than stone, ice creeps across the control panel and the whole of the Room. A fog drifts over the mind, obscuring happy memories and swirling around bad ones. Tendrils of fog can reach into and move the memories around.

** I feel like Fear and Sadness go into hyperdrive, while Joy and Anger get all slow and lethargic. Disgust doesn't really get affected?
