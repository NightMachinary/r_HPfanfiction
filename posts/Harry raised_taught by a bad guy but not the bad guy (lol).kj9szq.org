Looking for stories where Harry is looked after/raised/taught by someone like Barty, Loki (marvel, supernatural), darker Sirius (Remus), death eaters, even a version of Riddle. I like gray Harry stories. The ones where he is willing to fight dirty or use dark magic but isn't evil. I'd like him to have friendships outside or Ron or Hermione. Main baddy can be Voldemort, Dumbledore or even some marvel, supernatural, or other villain. I'd prefer slash pairing or gen. No cartoon/anime crossover don't watch those. also don't watch GOT.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8507725/1/][In Death, Standby]] by Sophisme. After the infamous massacre of the Potters, young Harry Potter went missing. It doesn't really help that years later he turns up again, a bit darker, stranger and more erratic than anyone had hoped for. But Harry hardly cares, in the end it's his decision on which side he will fight; dark, light or no side at all. Eventually HP/LV... of sorts.

Add to that his apparent belief that Harry is important to his plans, and things become just a little bit complicated. Unfinished. FFNet.

FFNet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20182612][Just Like him]] by Rabenschnabel. At the height of his power, Lord Voldemort employed another failsafe next to the horcruxes: his most loyal followers would be able to retrieve them and resurrect him with their help. As a result, Barty Crouch Jr. breaks his father's mind control early and goes off to seek his master. While he is unsuccessful in locating him, he manages to find surprising but welcome allies in the Boy-Who-Lived and his godfather. With the support of the Ancient and Noble House of Black on his side, Barty needs to use all his cunning and guile to navigate the world of politics and Dark Arts.

Because there isn't a demon hiding behind the dumpster, but rather a little boy curled into a tiny ball of thin limbs, large green eyes, and far too big clothing. A boy who is also staring right at him. Despite Alec's very-much-active invisibility rune. Alec blinks. The boy blinks back at him. Huh. Unfinished. Ao3

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/][Culture shock]] by rustbyte. Crossover with Iain M Banks 'Culture' novels. Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go.

** /Say a Prayer/ linkao3(4629198) has Harry adopted by Marvel's Loki. I wouldn't characterize this Harry's magic as gray, but Dumbledore, Molly, etc. get all het up about him being adopted by a "dark pureblood". His strongest friendship in this series is with Neville and he develops a large friendship group.

**** I don't think any of these match your prompt exactly, but mostly.

If you like /Say a Prayer/ then I recommend /Ninja Wizard/ by the same author. That one is a crossover with /Naruto/ but I've never seen that anime and I followed along just fine. Harry rather raises himself in that one, though.

/The Child of Azkaban/ linkao3(15068012) - story complete, series ongoing. James and Lily put a spell on Harry so that if he was ever hurt, he'd be transported to his legal guardian. Petunia hurts 2yo Harry, he's transported to Sirius...in the Death Eater wing of Azkaban. He's raised primarily by Sirius but he also learns from the Death Eaters.

/Patience Rewards Itself/ linkao3(2080986) - incomplete and discontinued. Harry is raised by Jim Moriarty and Sebastian Moran, from /Sherlock Holmes/.

/Sarah's Wish/ linkao3(7240036) - incomplete and discontinued. Harry is raised by the Goblin King from /Labyrinth/. His magic creeps out everyone including Lucius and Snape.

/Fruit of the Golden Tree/ linkao3(16756768) - story and series complete. Harry's grandfather Fleamont wakes from a coma and rescues him from the Dursleys - violently. Then Fleamont avenges James' and Lily's deaths - violently. Then Fleamont teaches [spoiler] that the hereditary Black Madness has nothing on the hereditary Potter Rage.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

  Sebastian Moran's job was simple this time; 'fix' Vernon Dursley. He was prepped to do it. He had no problem doing it. That is, until he sees an unidentified boy with no record of existence at the residence thrown out of the home. Thus, Harry Potter gains an (admittedly unconventional) family, Jim gets a protégé and Seb just hopes that Harry won't wind up quite as...off as his Dad.
