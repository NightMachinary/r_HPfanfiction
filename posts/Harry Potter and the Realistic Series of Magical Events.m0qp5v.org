Hi ! Somewhere here, or in another abysmal cavern of glorious fanfic recommendations, I stumbled upon the glorification of "*Harry Potter and the Realistic Series of Magical Events*".

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1662466][The serie is (I think) on ao3]].

However, I am having a lot of trouble understanding how the serie is organized. There is one prelude, featuring two OC. Very well written, I liked it a lot. Then an interlude, featuring known wizards from Hogwarts.

And then, what seems to be the first book of the serie, " Harry Potter and The Realistic Events of The Half-Blood Prince [Deluxe Edition]" that is also well-written, but that seems to be the middle of another book that I would have missed. Characters are out-of-character from nowhere, and refer to a shared previous background, unknown from me.

Is there a previous book that I missed? Or is it meant to start with that book, and then do I have to hang in there, so that everything becomes crystal clear in a few pages?

Thank you very much !


** Read the comments, they had to take down the previous books for plagiarism, and they are slowly editing it out. (I guess starting with the last two books?)
