*** this is an suspenseful story first and romance as a far second. If you're looking specifically for romance this probably won't be your cup of tea

**** This is a ridiculously long-winded political story first, with very little action at least up until chapter 8, where I ran out of patience with all the party machinations and closed the tab.

***** I can definitely agree with you on that. I ended up reading the first couple chapters, skipping to chapter 9ish, then moving on to 13 and then on to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7370842/1/The-Worst-Muggles-Imaginable][this cracktastic story I found where Harry is the son of Satan.]]

  "Sweet, I got Agrippa!", Harry clutched the chocolate frog card in triumph. "Ron said he'd sell his soul for this card."

  Tiny feet pattered down the hall way heading towards the dungeons, towards Snape's office.

  "Professor Snipe! I need your help!"

  Snape had spent years perfecting as aura of unhelpfulness, so as not to be bothered with the standard trivialities that dunderheaded 11 year olds could come up with. So when Potter of all people burst into his private study demanding help he was sure it was an emergency. He immediately vanished the potion he was working on and picked up his bag of emergency potions.

  "How many dead and how many dieing?", he'd mourn Poppy later, if they were desperate enough to come to him for healing potions, Poppy must have been one of the first casualties.

  "I... uh... what? Is this a riddle? My answer is 'everyone'. Everyone is dead and dieing sooner or later. Did I guess it right?"

  "..."

  "Anyway, I need your help. Ron's willing to sell his soul for an Agrippa card but I don't know how to steal souls yet. My Father usually has contracts for that kind of thing, but I don't have any with me and don't know how to make one."

  "..."

  "Whatever. I'll need minions. Lots of minions. Drago Malfey already has two. It's no fair he's ahead of me on minions."

  Out loud the hat announced to the world, "Better be Hufflepuff!"

** linkffn(9885609) In my opinion this is probably the best Harry x Astoria fic. Doesn't have a lot of fanfiction cliches and has quite a decent plot

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria
