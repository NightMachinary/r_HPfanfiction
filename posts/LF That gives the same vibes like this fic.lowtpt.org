I just read Child of Fire, Child of Ice on AO3. And Oh God! There were so many times that I got goosebumps from reading that. The plots, the strategy, the pain, the relationship, the vows, and so many.

So, I was wondering if anyone could recommend me a fic like that but with Severus Snape as the main character or as one of the main characters. Thank you
