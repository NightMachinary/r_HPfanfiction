So I was always disgruntled of how JKR wrote off such a bad-ass like Mad-eye. Like just that he went missing after a battle and they assumed he died (which he did) but come on! That isn't the awesome death he deserves, so here's a quick fanfic about Mad-eye fighting at the BOH.

After slipping away from Hagrid's grasp Harry threw on the invisibility cloak and went to confront the chaos around him. The battle raged on. Voldemort was in the center shooting curses and flashes of green light all around him. He saw Dolohov send a curse at Flitwick while Flitwick was dueling two death eaters.

"OH NO YOU DONT!" shouted a voice from a few feet away. Dolohov jumped in fear. As Harry turned his head he saw the limping figure of Alastor Moody.

Dolohov regained his composure and raised his wand and shouted, "AVADA KEDAVRA!" With surprising speed Moody jumped behind a column to dodge the blast of green light. Moody reappeared and blasted a curse that hit Dolohov squarely in the chest. Dolohov began to shriek and scream in pain, his screams only grew louder until he screamed no more. Moody let out a long sigh and turned his head toward Harry.

"Potter?" he asked in surprise. Harry looked around in surprise until remembering Moody's eye could see through his cloak. Moody leaned down and whispered, " Ah, I knew they couldn't get you." Harry grinned and whispered back," Professor I don't remember one blast of the Cruciatus curse having the ability to kill, what was that?"

Moody grimaced and replied, " Transmogrifian torture curse, not pleasant, it's a last resort curse."

"Good luck Potter." Moody said and walked away

After walking not walking ten paces five death eaters burst out off nowhere and pointed their wands at Moody. Moody raised his wand and let out a roar of defiance, "/PROTEGO DIABOLICA/!" The death eaters began to shout curses and hexes, but all of the sudden an enormous ring of fire surrounded Moody incinerating three of the five death eaters. The remaining two let out a roar of anger and began to charge at Moody with their wands drawn. Moody gave a little flick of his wrist and the flames met the two death eaters incinerating them instantly.

The entire hall stopped fighting for a moment and looked on in awe and terror. However there was one voice of laughter. Lord Voldemort stepped out of the shadows and faced Moody.

"I'm impressed Alastor. I had no idea you were capable of such magic." said Voldemort with a grin.

Moody stayed quiet and raised his wand and began to fight. Both sides watched in awe as the two wizards began to duel. They were blasting powerful curses and counter-curses at each other. Voldemort let out a scream," /SECTUMSEMPRA!"/

Moody raised his wand and yelled, " /PROTEGO MAXIMA! "/ A huge shield appeared however the curses still managed to break through it. It hit Moody squarely in the chest and he began to be bleeding badly. As Moody fell he flicked his wand at a huge pile of shrapnel and the pieces flew at top speed at Voldemort. Voldemort managed to deflect most of them but a few pieces hit him in the arm and his leg.

Moody lay on the ground bleeding a dangerous amount. "NO!" Harry screamed as he ripped off his cloak and rushed towards Moody's aide. Gasps and cries of shock echoed the halls to the fact that Harry was alive. As Harry reached Moody he feared that there was nothing he could do. Moody looked at him and said,"Go finish him off for me Potter, and remember constant vigilance." Moody's body went limp and the greatest Auror of all time was gone.

Harry felt a surge of rage and sadness as he stood up and turned to face Lord Voldemort.....


** Voldemort is standing over a defeated Harry, gloating about his victory, and Harry's upcoming death.

Then, behind him a voice rings out; “CONSTANT VIGILANCE!”

A curse appears and turns Voldemort into a Foe Glass.

Mad - Eye adds it to his collection. The power of his defeated foes is imbued in them.
