The British Ministry of Magic is somewhat run by idiots, but there are a few competent Department Heads who keep the nation from going completely off the tracks. Yes, bigotry between Purebloods and Muggleborns is a problem, but the situation has been steadily improving for several decades now; xenophobia and the fear of change is what drove people to Voldemort's side. Magical British Society is remarkably backwards in some ways, but quite advanced in others. The SoS keeps them somewhat isolated, but there are no laws preventing wizards from going out, interacting with Muggles, or even marrying them should they fall in love, beyond a bit of discretion (and even that isn't taken all that seriously, to the point where some wizards don't bother to try and dress like Muggles). Hogwarts has room for improvement, but it's still highly regarded, and rightfully so.

Compare this to Magical USA. MACUSA comes off as borderline tyrannical. Forget about bigotry between Purebloods and Muggleborns; like Salazar Slytherin, MACUSA sees Muggleborns as something of a security risk. In Magical Britain, accidentally breaking Secrecy will get you fines, maybe some time in Azkaban if its a serious offense; in the Magical USA, that's treason, and an instant capital offense (with no appeals process or much of a trial). Not only are No-Majs feared and hated, but there are literal laws against interacting with them; all of Magical America is essentially under a restraining order against their fellow (No-Maj) citizens. If you go to Ilvermony, you'll learn fine, but you leave your wand at school until you graduate (in other words, you're screwed if you come across a dangerous magical creature or need to defend yourself magically).

The flaws of Magical Britain are often magnified to a ridiculous degree, while Magical cultures beyond the borders are often overhyped to the point of insanity.


** I've always had the headcanon that in the decades prior to Voldemort and his Death Eaters sewing chaos throughout Wizarding Britain, that there had been a significant swing towards a pro-Muggleborn attitude amongst the majority of the population. And it was because of this fact that Tom Riddle decided to align his beliefs with the blood purists; because in them he saw a useful tool to undermine, and eventually overthrow, the current establishment and replace it with a regime of his own creation. Because from a very young age Tom Riddle clearly suffered from delusions of grandeur, and an overinflated sense of his own worth. That he could back these delusions up with skill, knowledge, and power made him all the more dangerous.

*** I'm pretty sure there's not a single piece of evidence in the Harry Potter books that Voldemort didn't wholeheartedly believe in blood purism. Well, he did consider himself worthy despite his inferior blood status, but fanatics are known for making exceptions when it suits them personally. However, (according to the books) Voldemort never fathered any children, and that's very upright from the blood purist perspective.

**** I think Voldemort cared about Voldemort more than any ideology. I think it's clear he hated muggles and likely muggle or a, but he also clearly didn't necessarily go full “pure bloods only” - we see him allow Snape in as one of his inner circle and choose to go after Harry rather than Neville. It's... interesting, I guess

***** Yes, but it's difficult to say where Voldemort ended and ideology began. Immortality and power were the only things he ever cared about, and the way he planned to use his immortality was creating the blood purist vision of utopia. Snape was a useful underling who also never fathered any children; it's interesting to speculate what the pure-blood fanatics thought about it. And it's unclear whether or not Voldemort's decision to choose a half-blood as the threat was deliberate. Come to think, maybe he planned to kill both Harry and Neville, but just couldn't find out where Neville was kept while his parents were, most likely, fighting against the Death Eaters. The Harry Potter books tell nothing about what Voldemort did about the Longbottoms, and it's purely Dumbledore's interpretation that Voldemort thought Harry more dangerous from the beginning. (Of course, Dumbledore can be considered an in-story authority speaking with the author's omniscient voice, but since we're talking about headcanons, Dumbledore can be considered as unreliable as any other character.)

** Refreshing. I'm rather sick of the whole Britain bashing thing in fics.

Another sign that shows that the rest of the world isn't so progressive is Durmstrang not accepting muggleborn students. Although France seems to be progressive, at least when it comes to magical creatures and half-breeds.

I would love to see a fic about an ignorant muggleborn deciding that Britain was too backward and moving to some other country and immediately geting arrested and deported/executed for being a filthy mudblood.

I'm sorry but, no matter how bad the school may be, it's still run a French one. So unless years of British "gastronomy" completely ruined his palate, the food should be amazing.

(Or the canteen in Beauxbatons kinda suck like the most of the ones in French school, but . . . English food).

***** I would say modern French cuisine is excellent and has a massive global influence, especially in America. There's some traditional stuff that would be just as gross to a foreigner as traditional British food is for non-Brits. It's a matter of taste. Imagine Fleur Delacour poking at a dish full of haggis.

** My headcanon, and what I write in fics, is that the wider magical world is basically like the wild west, and the various Ministries are like desperate sheriffs trying to keep it at least somewhat lawful.

So I basically take the view that the British Ministry isn't necessarily incompetent, but just /massively/ overwhelmed by the challenge of governing a magical society. Because despite how Orwellian and overbearing the Ministry of Magic is, it seems pretty easy to get away with almost anything. We see a ton of law-breaking in canon - often just on a whim - with essentially zero consequences (think of the guy who went round jinxing toilets, and was only caught when one backfired in his face). For this reason, I've always thought of Aurors not as magical policemen but more like SWAT (or western bounty hunters) - how could you ever catch a wizarding criminal with even the slightest sense without a massive dose of luck?

I think this helps explain why Azkaban is such an insanely miserable, inhumane place. Sort of a 'if it's difficult to catch dark wizards, then you've got to have a really good deterrent' philosophy.

I definitely agree that Britain could theoretically be one of the more progressive nations - we don't really know enough to say for sure - but the almost absurd size of the Ministry seems to suggest it has a pretty strong lean towards lawfulness, at least.

We actually have some hints that Britain is pretty progressive in comparison to other western countries:

- Madame Maxime absolute panics when her heritage is in the open - to the point she breaks up any contact with Hagrid until Voldemort is back

- We know that Durmstrang doesn't take any Muggleborns. And it's practically the school for the whole of central and north-continental Europe

- The U.S. is much strikter on Muggle-Wizard marriage that Britain

It could also be due to the importance of keeping the wizarding world a secret. The more staff you have on hand, the easier it is to keep surveillance on abnormalities happening in the Muggle world (e.g., having agents in King's Cross, the Muggle post office, etc.).

I wouldn't be surprised if some Ministry officials are right up there in the highest of Muggle industries, such as satellite surveillance companies, government agencies (e.g., Kingsley working for the prime minister), etc.

Surely someone in the Ministry can see the evolution of Muggles and their technology? I like to think that not all wizards are clueless when it comes to handling Muggle things.

Well, even in Canon the Aurors are not just some Magical Policemen. While the subject is barely adressed in the books, we know that the "Department of Magical Law Enforcement" is a massive one, with the Auror Office only being one office among many.

The closest thing to a policement is probably the "Magical Law Enforcement Patrol" which seem to be responsible for the general law enforcement (though, depending of the sources, Hit Wizards are part of this Patrol and so they may also intervene in High Profil cases).

As for the Auror, their job is to investigate crimes involving the Dark Arts, and to protect high profil target. They don't deal with little offence like a burglary, or a drunk wizard using Magic in front of Muggle. People who interact with the Aurors are either a VIP who need protection (Harry, Fudge . . .), or someone who messed up /a lot/.

**** There's literally only one mention of Hit Wizards in the books:

"Nobody but trained Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad would have stood a chance against Black . . ."

You might well be right, but personally I think of Hit Wizard as an additional title given to a few select Aurors with especially good combat skills, who are called in for that sort of work.

I don't think Magical Britain has the need for a group that /only/ does work like that, and I don't like how it would imply that a team of Aurors isn't competent enough to take down a single Dark Wizard.

********** I agree completely. JKR's strength (worldbuilding-wise) is in her ability to create a sense of whimsey and fun, and I very much believe that this is the single strongest factor that contributed to HP's massive success. Coming up with the more concrete stuff is where she really struggles, and the book's solution to this is mostly to just not go into it - and that works really, for the most part.

And as you say, this is uniquely great for us writers, because it means we have a dozens (if not hundreds) of under-grown plot/setting trees which we can branch off of as we so choose.

It's great!
