  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

** There is a tag on [[http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Pureblood%20Culture/works][AO3]]. I have an interest in how authors build their magical culture, I think it is an area that JKR really could have done more on. Magical's should not just act like muggles with magic, they have had isolated social development for hundreds of years.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

  Everything in Harry's life is pretty terrible, all things considered. His ex-wife won't stop sleeping around, the government is broken, and his life is an endless cycle of crippling self-hatred and bitter sarcasm. So when Draco Malfoy comes sauntering back into it, sharp as a tack and twice as fit as he has any right to be, the only comfort Harry can find is that he can't possibly make it any worse. You know, probably.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

*** Bonfires at Midnight is clearly the best on that list, because I wrote it. Honestly, I forgot all about that story until I saw this post. Wizarding culture has always been a thing I've loved reading about (as evidenced by me recommending the same two stories in every thread like this that pops up). Though, I can't say my efforts at capturing my thoughts on the subject has gone all that well, but it's not for lack of trying.

** The Sacrifices arc is hella long & I've re-started it several times but have never made it all the way through, but it's extremely well-written and definitely explores pureblood culture, linkffn(Saving Connor)

linkffn(Conspiracy by Maethoriel Raina) is one of my all-time favorite fics. It does have Dumbledore/Weasley bashing (which I personally don't mind, but I know some people hate it) but it's not super over-the-top about it.
