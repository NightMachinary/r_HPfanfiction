I'm reading HP for the first time and just finished Prisoner of Azkaban. Are there any good (non-spoiler-y) PoA aus where Sirius's name is cleared and Harry actually gets to go live with him? I just need so much domestic fluff as Harry and Sirius start out as awkward well-meaning strangers and then turn into a family!


** I think it's hard to find non spoilery fan fic unless you look at things written pre book four being released.

  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.
