Are there any good flics like this? There is no setting just like fallout and the Mohave and the statist at the end was awesome but maybe a similar setting similar circumstances hell a similar harry would do.

Anyways the fix is superb and I totally recommend it up with dp&sw:rbsr hpmor and Alexandra quick and all those other popular pieces of shit

Maybe it's the fatigue maybe it's the alcohol maybe it's the setting maybe it's me or maybe the docs just that good or maybe it's some combination of the above but either way the fic is awesome.

Hell I even did a little dance and giggled after finishing the fic before I let out a tear after realizing that the fic wouldn't update and maybe I should go to sleep. Or maybe not. Whatever happy new year


** Dude, lay off the drugs.

Or take more them, I dunno.
