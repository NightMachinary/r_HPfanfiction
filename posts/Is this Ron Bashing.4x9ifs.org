Yesterday, I got a reviewer that very profanely complained that my story is bashing Ron Weasley.

You be the judge. Here's how Ron's arc goes in the story.

/Chap 7/-> He meets Harry in the train, and asks about his scar and if he remembered how he got it. Since my story's harry, unlike canon, has very vivid recollections of the night, Harry feels angry at Ron for having made him relive those memories, and leaves the compartment.

/Chap 9/-> Harry has calmed down, and after a series of events, sees Ron's point of view. Maybe he was just a kid who was excited to meet a celebrity. Harry wonders if he had been too quick to judge the boy in his anger.

/Chap 13/-> Troll happens. Ron puts his life in danger to try and save hermione. There's a short battle in between Harry and the Troll, which harry would have died if it weren't for Ron's help. They lose their enmity, since there are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other. Knocking out a fifteen foot tall mountain troll is one of them.

Its only been a couple of months since I entered the world of fanfiction, so I'm honestly a bit confused.

Does this kind of character arc qualify as Ron Bashing? Or was the reviewer just screwing with me? I did make the lead character dislike him in the beginning, so maybe it does? Idk.


** I think that the anti-circlejerk of Saint!Ron is becoming almost as bad as the circlejerk for Ron bashing ever was. The most accurate depictions are usually somewhere in the middle.

Don't let reviewers get you down, especially ones that have to rely on profanity to make their point. IMO your arc seems fine.

Definitely. Canon Ron was a dumbass at times, but he was also a loyal friend. And it's important to strike a balance. Too many fics tip too much towards one side of the scale.

**** Loyal friend? Then your deffinition of loyalty and mine are very different...I in fact see Ron as a betrayal waiting to happen (he betrayed Harry twice, too - in GoF (he didn't even tell Harry about the Dragons, so Harry could have fucking died!) and latter on the Horcrux-Hunt when he left...)

** NEVER ACCEPT ONE PERSON'S VIEW ON A STORY. IF MULTIPLE HAVE THE SAME VIEW, THEN THEY MIGHT BE RIGHT.

From this explanation, no, it's not. Do you have Ron having terrible shit happen to him for no reason or because of his own stupidity? if not, then it's still probably not a bash!ron story.

Like the majority of reviewers, he sees the story through distorted lenses, he's not dispassionate enough to properly review.

edit: Many people say you have to read something 3 times to truly understand it. It's only one of the reasons why I've tried to stop favoriting a story after I've read it only once. It needs to be read at least once more and probably twice before I know if it's actually good or I was just high on story.

No. I don't. In fact, in the recent chapters, he's starting to play a pretty vital role. Harry is designing the first magical video game, and he relies heavily on Ron for the gameplay designing and strategising.

And thanks for replying and for the advice.

**** the gameplay thing is interesting: in my Darkness!Harry story, Harry et al are basically doing the same only they're just the impetus for the first computer being designed and I was debating having Ron really get into coding because i've already had him show a knowledge of runes(in my story they're on chocolate frog cards along with the original famous witches and wizards) and they'll be the basis of the first magitek language.

** Your Ron here is fine. If anything, I would have a problem with your Harry for flipping out over nothing. Like, "reliving those memories" - does that happen every time he looks in a mirror? Seems overblown.

*** No. He gained a power a few months before the train event that gave him basically a photographic memory.

And no mate. He doesn't flip out over a mirror. He did however flip out when he was /asked to describe the event/.

See, the thing is like this mate, muggle mirrors don't ask you to tell them how he lost his parents. I'm pretty sure even magical mirrors don't do that. And so the first time someone asked him how he lost his parents, his photographic memory showed him /exactly/ what happened. He /literally/ /relived/ the memories.

Which is why he flipped out. Dunno about you mate, but doesn't seem that overblown to me.

** Based on the details you provided I'd say that your fic smells of canon rehash, but not Ron bashing. Didn't read your fic so I don't know what nuance there exists, but from what I see here, no bashing.

One thing though. Why you gotta use the exclamation-questionmark-exclamation combo!?!
