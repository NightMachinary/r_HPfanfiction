I saw this being recommended for Harry/Daphne thread and after seeing the length and reading couple reviews I would like more opinion on whether I should read this.

One of the things I would like to know is if this has good grammar.


** How much do you value your time? I can't tell you if it is worth reading because I don't know what your alternatives are.

That being said, it is decent at best. I personally don't like a lot of it. It does do a lot of interesting things. Magic is better than muggles which is a nice change. There is far too much mugglewank in the fandom. Harry isn't a good person, Daphne is completely irrelevant, if you're reading this for the pairing then read something else.

It is like an extremely mild noodlehammer fic. You'll disagree with most of it. At times you'll feel uncomfortable reading it. As a story it is kinda shit. As an exploration in world building/empire building it is one of the better fics.

** Unfortunately it's been to long since I read it to give a decent review I do remember enjoying it when I did read it and it is on my list to reread.

** All of the pairings are pointless to the plot (he ends up with three wives, and we barely see the /main/ one let alone the other two). If you want romance, look elsewhere.

The story itself isn't exactly /bad/ it's just... Read it when you want a brainless power wank and nothing else, because while some of the worldbuilding is neat it isn't really explored all that much.
