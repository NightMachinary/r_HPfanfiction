Looking for where Harry dies and meets Gryffindor who's a protector of the timestream or something, and Harry has to journey across a bunch of lands or something and turn back time? Something about hollows, and it was probably some sort of super!harry, though I'm not sure. The details are a bit fuzzy on this one, but i remember it being really long.

Thanks if you find it!


** Joe6991's Hero Trilogy. Think this is the end of the first book into the second.
