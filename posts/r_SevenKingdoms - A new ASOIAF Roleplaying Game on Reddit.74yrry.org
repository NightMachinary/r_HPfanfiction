A big thank you to the [[/r/HPfanfiction]] Mod Team for allowing us to post here.

--------------

Welcome folks! We are happy to tell you about our game, [[/r/SevenKingdoms]] !

 

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/SevenKingdoms/][SevenKingdoms]] is a new game merging between more mechanical Powers games and complete RP centric games. It encourages story-telling and advancement of characters while still having strategic game play as an element. Our game balances both roleplay and strategy elements in a way that appeals to a broad range of players. You control your House in 7K and can take them in many different directions, whether advancing their place in Westeros or challenging the status quo.

 

The game will begin officially Tuesday in 188 AC, several years before the canon Blackfyre Rebellion. Dorne has just entered the realm, after the failed Conquest of Dorne three decades before, bringing contentions and issues with it. Summerhall is due to open in 188 in lands taken by the Crown after House Toyne's controversy. Not only the Dornish issue, but the ruling of King Daeron II's father brought about debates, rising feuds, and tensions among the realm. Unlike in canon the future is not yet written and any event could or might happen from a Bittersteel Rebellion to a Second Conquest of Dorne or any number of diverting paths. Claim now to start your House's story in the Seven Kingdoms!

The game provides many opportunities for users to take their characters and build up their stories to tell a fun and exciting tale. There are plots, intrigue, with it possible for small houses to rise to power and large houses fall from grace, as well as interactions between characters and in-depth lore.

*State of the Realm:*

- King Daeron II Targaryen rules the realm from King's Landing. By some he is lauded for having peacefully unified the realm entire under the Iron Throne - though in other circles, whispers abound that his actions dishonor the lives lost fighting the Dornish in years past. He has inherited a realm fraught with challenges, from the shaky peace with his goodbrother Prince Maron Martell, to the tensions still rampant in the marches, and even amongst his own family in the form of his half-brother Ser Daemon Blackfyre.

- Lord Barthogan Stark, nicknamed “Blacksword,” rules the North from his family's ancestral seat of Winterfell. As the fourth born son of the Lord Cregan who once sat the Iron Throne as Hand of the King for the infamous “Hour of the Wolf,” he inherited his position after a series of deaths in the family. With wildlings north of the Wall and Skagosi off the shore, his rule may not be easy.

- Lord Donnel Arryn, Warden of the East, rules over the Vale of Arryn on high from the Eyrie. His family maintains a prestigious position in the realm, with his ancestor Lady Jeyne having once served as a regent for King Aegon III. In more recent days his relative Alys Arryn has earned a royal betrothal to Prince Rhaegel Targaryen.

- Lord Kermit Tully rules the Riverlands from Riverrun. A veteran of the Dance of the Dragons, Kermit is one of the few individuals still around who can recite tales of those awful and momentous battles that shaped a realm. During the final battle of the civil war, he even personally slew Lord Borros Baratheon, earning the enmity of that other Great House of Westeros.

- Lord Loron “The Bard” Greyjoy rules the rocky waves of the Iron Islands from Pyke. Nearly sixty years have passed since the Red Kraken's demise, and their bloody reavings are not yet forgotten. Yet fractures created by the Dance still exist for the Ironborn to gain allies and weaken their foes. What is dead may never die.

- Lord Damon Lannister rules over the Westerlands from the impenetrable mountain of Casterly Rock. With two sons, his line seems secure, though powerful vassal houses such as Reyne, Marbrand, and Crakehall inspired by the famed warrior Redtusk often scrutinize the Lion's actions carefully.

- Lord Leo “Longthorn” Tyrell rules in Highgarden, overseeing the bountiful fields of the Reach. A descendent of Lord Lyonel Tyrell, one of the famed commanders during the Conquest of Dorne, the sacrifices of untold thousands of Reachmen is likely on his mind as Dorne is welcomed into the realm.

- Lord Osmund Baratheon rules the Stormlands from the mighty castle of Storm's End. Although his region has often borne the bloody cost of wars and border skirmishes with Dorne, he now must navigate a new reality wherein former foes on his southern border are now fellow subjects of the Iron Throne - and where the royal family is even constructing a new palace near his own vassals.

- Prince Maron Martell rules Dorne from Sunspear. As goodbrother to the King on the Iron Throne twice over, the Dornishman has won a number of concessions for his princedom's accession into the Seven Kingdoms. Many of these rankle the pride of lords outside his realm, while inside some may still seeth over the loss of independence.


** I'm confused... what does this have to do with HP fan fiction?

*** Not in the same realm as Harry Potter fan fiction but we're fan fiction of the Game of Thrones universe. I thought users writing in the Harry Potter world may also be interested in one based on A Song of Ice and Fire.
