After a recent discussion about maybe doing challenges, I thought it would be fun to test the waters by having some drabble prompts. Feel free to post a drabble and/or a prompt of your own!

I'll start with a prompt:

A Sense of Place. The wizarding world is filled with extraordinary places. Secret from Muggles, sometimes scary, often fantastic. Write a drabble about a special place for your character, whether they're seeing it for the first time or returning after many years.


** Edit - formatting.

Sirius stood on the threshold, unmoving. His mother's screams pierced his already throbbing head as an overwhelming stench filled his nostrils. Of course, the house had been empty for years, but that did little to settle his churning stomach.

Sirius could remember the blood, the runes drawn onto the walls. Incantations that were never meant to be uttered. The sheer power that had only caused pain and suffering. The deepest secrets of magic had unravelled here, and Sirius' own childhood had long been distorted from holding any happy memory.

Remus who had until now been waiting patiently, stepped up beside him.

“Surely it can't be worse than Azkaban?”

Sirius sighed, hand running over his face.

“You've never met my mother,” Sirius said.

Remus raised an eyebrow, glancing down the dim corridor where the portrait was still howling.

“I think I'll skip the introductions.”

** *The Graveyard*

This wasn't the place of his nightmares.

Harry ran his fingers over a cold gravestone and marveled at how it didn't hold him, trap him. His dreams had made this place much more than it was. When he slept, the angels watched him with their flashing red eyes as he stumbled through a maze of towering headstones. He was terrified and desperate to stay ahead of the bloodthirsty horde behind him. In his dreams, he never got out. He just ran and ran and stumbled, scrambling back to his feet to start running again, only free when his eyes opened to see the canopy of his four-poster bed at Hogwarts.

But the graveyard in Little Hangleton was just a graveyard, even at night. The bloodthirsty horde rested in their own graves or in Azkaban.

Harry's hand dropped from the stone that had held him at fourteen. He moved carefully around the covered body laid at the foot of the grave. There was room for another body just there, to the right of Tom Riddle Sr., and Harry would dig it tonight without hesitance or fear.

Voldemort would rest here, a man like any other in a graveyard like any other.

*** Outsider POV prompt:

*The Rook*

Her uncle's cottage in the small town of Ottery St. Catchpole had seemed like an easy way to avoid the stress of London, but Angela was growing frustrated with the lack of inspiration. The noise and conflict in the city distracted her with too many ideas, now she was stuck painting the same landscape scene again and again. She had started to sketch some of the people that came into the bakery, but even there, it was boring-- the same simple haircuts, practical shoes, and drab, lifeless clothing. Occasionally people passed through wearing long bright cloaks; they almost glowed in comparison to the normal customers. However, all had refused to stop for a portrait.

She set up her easel on the west bank of town, the spot where she could see the only interesting house in the area. It almost looked like a chess rook, and occasionally strange sounds and colors would come out of it. The man who lived inside would have been a great character study, if she could get him to sit for a session: his flyaway blonde hair and bright blue eyes would have been a highlight of her portfolio.

She was just sketching in the final lines of the windows when she saw the blonde man run outside, writing furiously. A small bird came down and picked up the paper, and he hurried back inside. /He must be training carrier pigeons,/ she thought, adding that to her mental rolodex of strange things country folk did. Angela continued on the sketch, marking in the odd structures on the roof.

All of a sudden, the sound of three large cracks filled the air. She turned, seeing three men in long black robes, that she swore weren't there before.

"Crazy Xeno, at it again. Whaddya think it will be this time?"

"Shite -- a muggle. /Stupify!/"

She woke four hours later to a blazing headache, a setting sun, and a large charred area of ruins where the strange house had been.

** As she stepped through, she suddenly felt her senses become awash in a sensation that felt familiar, though she knew it had not touched her since she was just a toddler.

A sharp metallic tang hung in the air, the air that blew the branches of the gnarled trees in this place, filled to the brim with sacrifice and reverence. The magic in the air reached out, testing, guiding, and begging; begging for supplication, for donation, for /blood/.

The ground beneath her feet gave way, step by step, sanguine earth dragging her down, attempting to get her to join her life with the life of the realm, the offerings of her ancestors, collected through the millennia, each generation a guardian and a protector of this sacred place.

The plants in this place were unique, having drunk deeply of lifeblood rich with magic, the payment to enter the grove. Gnarled branches swayed, almost in greeting, in persuasion, coercing those in their presence to forego logic and their vows, and take a taste of the scarlet fruit hanging from the trees; a single taste reputedly gave one true visions of the nature of magic at the cost of innocence and sanity. A second cost one's life.

The third, one's soul.

It had taken years of research, of rediscovering her family's charge to protect both this unstaunched thicket of magic and knowledge, upheld since it was abandoned by the mages and priests of old. Blood sacrificed at every turn, used to breed trees, enchant crystals, and even bend space itself. It had all been worth it.

And as she approached the stone altar in the centre of the grove (cracked and stained, crimson like all else in this realm), she drew her ritual blade, drawing it across her palm, blood dripping on stone, on roots, on earth.

Blood dripping to saturate the ground of the garden of Eden.

** Harry hadn't returned to England in decades, not since the muggles had initiated World War III and North Korea had launched their nuclear missiles but now that the fallout was safer, he stood in the remnants of Diagon Alley, staring at a shadow, permaburned into a wall. It could have been anyone, he knew. but its placement in the Alley made him think it was Ron who had been managing the shop the day the missiles flew. He reached out and touched it, whispering a promise. "Never again."

He turned to his followers, fifty thousand wizards and witches, sworn to his service, sworn to his cause, sworn to his hate. To exterminate the remnants of the muggle filth.

** *In the Library*

--------------

The Hogwarts Library was quiet that morning, the crisp sound of pages being turned and the skritch of quills creating a gentle symphony to accompany Hermione's study. The castle was still waking, most preferring to spend a dozy Sunday morning in bed - but Hermione had always been an early riser, and she relished in the quiet. She was seated at her usual desk under the window overlooking the grounds, and sunbeams drenched the Gryffindor in a warm glow, the smell of books and ink tangible in the close air. Every so often, a book would fly overhead, casting an excitedly flapping shadow over Hermione's notes, and she would absentmindedly wave her wand and banish it from her alcove - let it go bother someone else.

With a satisfied flourish, Hermione finished the essay she had been working on (/Six feet on the dangers of human to humanoid transfiguration/) and leaned back in her chair with a gentle sigh, rolling her neck as she looked out the window. She had picked out this spot early on in her first year - before Halloween and trolls and ridiculous boys and /friendship/ - not only because it was secluded, but because it looked out over the lawns and - well. Her mother would call it nosiness, but Hermione preferred /curiosity/. Either way, it gave her an excellent view of the Hogwarts grounds, and she had spent many a study-break watching the tiny figures below.

The grounds were mostly empty this early in the morning, but a flash of silver-blonde hair caught her eye, and Hermione had to grin when she noticed the black head of the person walking beside it - noticeably untidy even from this distance. The two figures were walking down towards the lake, and Hermione snorted as she shook her head, her riot of curls dancing as she did so.

Still grinning smugly (because /hah/, she /knew it!/), Hermione turned away from the window and stood, stretching as she wandered away from her desk and into the nearest aisle. She slowly walked through the various sections, not really looking for anything in particular, letting her hand drift and search as she picked out a book - flipped through it - and then returned it to it's proper place. One book hummed as she went to pick it up, and only settled when Hermione hushed it, fondly stroking her hands over the spine before moving on.

She had just picked up a book with a promising title when two arms reached around her waist and pulled her into a hug. Hermione huffed and looked sternly up at her boyfriend's freckled face.

"I've told you not to surprise me like that, Ron."

The redhead grinned down at her, placing a quick peck to the top of her curls. "It's either that or be ignored in favour of your books forever, love. Come on, Mione. I've brought you breakfast."

Hermione let Ron lead her back to her favourite desk, where her work was still spread haphazardly, and a plate of toast and an apple sat waiting for her. She squeezed Ron's hand gently in thanks as she sat back down, and Ron carefully moved a pile of books so he could sit on the table, ignoring Hermione's pointed look as he stared outside.

Hermione huffed fondly and nibbled on her toast as she flipped through her essay, checking it for errors. Everything was just starting to slow down to that gentleness that she so often found in the library, when a yelp cut through the quiet.

"Bloody hell!" Ron shouted as he looked down at the grounds, and Hermione winced, "is that Malfoy- and Harry?!"

Hermione took one look at her boyfriend's shocked face, and started giggling. Ron had only just managed to turn his head to stare disbelievingly at her when a shrill voice once again cut through the library.

"FOOD! In the library! OUT!! GET /OUT!!!/" and suddenly Madam Pince was there, waving her wand at Hermione and Ron, screeching as the books on Hermione's desk came to life.

Hermione only just had the forethought to shove her work and supplies into her bag before Ron had grabbed her hand and was leading her out of the library, Madam Pince screaming at them as the flying books swooped at them from above. Ron swore, a lucky book hitting him upside the head, and Hermione gasped for breath as she laughed, the few other students in the library staring at the two Gryffindors as they ran by.

As they reached the door, Hermione looked back over her shoulder - Madam Pince had given up the chase, and only the most stubborn of books was still chasing them. The sunlight was illuminating the shelves, dust floating between the aisles that she had spent so many hours exploring. She couldn't see it, but her alcove was back there, with it's perfectly sized desk and lovely view.

Ron squeezed her hand as the door slammed behind them, and he gave her a bashful look. Hermione smiled fondly.

"Don't worry. The Library can wait. It'll still be there when I come back."

It always was.
