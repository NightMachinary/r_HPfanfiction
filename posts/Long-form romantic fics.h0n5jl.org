I'm looking for romantic fics. Preferably long form, but i won't turn down a fantastic short/one-shot.

I'm not really looking for fluff, but more mature depictions of romance. Including post-DH stories.

I have little interest in slash, but i'll overlook it for a fantastic recc as long as i know what i'm expecting!


** I read a lot of romance fics, some of the highlights IMO include:

Linkffn(Cadmean Victory) - the final word in Harry/Fleur fics

Linkffn(Grow Young with Me) - post-DH Harry/OC, easily my favorite OC, possibly my favorite in-progress fic

Linkffn(the lie I've lived) - Harry/Fleur again, very well-done

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the worth of the soul) - Harry/Susan, but there's a lot of Harmony to get through on the way there. I love Hufflepuff fics in as many ways as I can get them, and this is my favorite Harry/Susan

Linkffn(stepping back) - time travel Harry/Bellatrix, IMO a better romance than Delenda Est, although not as good of an all-around fic

Linkffn(Daphne Greengrass and the importance of intent) - Haphne at it's finest

Linkffn(ingenio ab artifex) - abandoned Harry/Fleur, pretty wildly different from the rest of these

Linkffn(the things we do for love) - Haphne again, if you recognize the author, I think this is his best work

Linkffn(Harry Potter and futures past) - Harmony time-travel soulmate fic. Definitely on the fluffier side of this list

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
