I think I've read almost every SI fic out there so please, any story you can find that has a self-insert character in it. Preferably one with a time-travel or reincarnation theme, not just an OC from nowhere. If they're one of the characters' siblings or children that would be awesome. Crossovers are welcome too. Surprise me guys.

P.S. Just not My Immortal. You don't know how much I've suffered when I tried reading that in one go.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

Not exactly what OP is asking for, but In Bad Faith and Magical Me deserve a mention. They're both the most readable self-inserts. Unfortunately both are incomplete.

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.

It has a really nice storyline and Heather was a great OC, though I can't help but notice that she was acting so mature at just five years old that I can't believe Petunia and the Dursleys didn't notice at all (or they probably just didn't care) Anyways, thank you for the rec!

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

**** To be honest, I've never really liked these kinds of fics where Harry communicates with the horcrux inside his head and he either turns out bad, super-powered, or Tom gradually becomes a softie. I tried it but it didn't really hold my interest much. I 'did' see how you can say that the horcrux acts like an SI. Other than that, the story was really good, just not for me.

*** I don't how this became about me posting my own recs but sure! I warn you though, this is going to be long.

linkffn(10356239) Disenchanted is really my most favorite SI fic. I always love a great Black family story, and the summary was right, the SI really WAS realistic. I can't tell you how much I love this.

linkffn(9399640) I also love a good Malfoy family fic. It's always a pleasure to see how Lucius and Narcissa acts whenever they are with family.

linkffn(7613196) This fic REALLY deserves a mention, even though technically, this isn't an SI fic. But since Harry/Rigel's personality seems SI/OC enough, I decided I'll put this here. This is the best fem!Harry and gender-switching story I've ever seen in the history of ever! And I'm not saying this lightly since I've already read a lot of fem!Harry and gender-switching fics. I highly recommend this.

linkffn(11269078) While the Hogwarts chapters are slightly the same as the ones in canon, there is still the very unique life of Lorena.

linkffn(10155888) The first chapters may be a bit awkward at first, but once the story progresses it gets REALLY good. I love me a good Cedric fic.

linkffn(11606100) What did I say? I really love a good Cedric fic. And when the SI is his twin, that's just even better.

linkffn(11150000) I also love SI fics with the Weasley family, though while I usually prefer one of the Weasleys time travelling or getting reincarnated, this works too!

linkffn(12369247) I've actually just finished this when it got recommended here and it's really good!

linkffn(11452174) Another Evans sister is something I didn't know I wanted in life. It's a really great fic.

linkffn(12372526) Another Malfoy family fic. While the SI sometimes overreacts to things, I find that this is sometimes more realistic than SI reacting calmly to everything that is happening to them. It's a good change from the norm.

linkffn(11299908) While Harry as an SI is really more common than you think, I find this fic to be better than the others.

linkffn(10746833) This is the fic where I got to see what Moody will do when he suddenly gets a child. Awesome characterization of Moody and the SI.

And that's my favorite SI fics list. Whew! That was long. You should see my time-travel/reincarnation fics list. xD I do hope more people will recommend more SI stories because I would want to read something I didn't already have for a change. After all, repeating these gets boring after a while.

  When I imagined being a witch I imagined magic and flying. I imagined proving to the world that Slytherin and Evil are not synonymous. I imagined love and adventure. But most of all I imagined waking up-eleven years old-on the Hogwarts Express alongside Harry and Ron. So why, pray-tell, am I in a nursery, in 1970? This is not what I imagined! A realistic SI.

  When someone dies and is reborn, especially reborn into a fictional world, one would assume that their first reaction would be to change the world around them to their liking. I'm here to tell you that what I did was, in fact, the exact opposite. I'm the girl who went out of her way to change absolutely nothing. Why? Because fate chose wrong. I'm not a hero. SI
