:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Up until this moment, I was sure that it was [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21033122/chapters/50027546][Life 15]]. It's really not.

It was probably MoD!Harry (though, its only effect in the story was him reliving his life). It had about 8-10 chapters and it's a WIP. It was on AO3. The pairing in tags was probably tomarry. The premise is very similar to Again and Again and the author was probably inspired by it. It's the first time Harry decides to be sorted into Slytherin and just roll with life.

___________________________

When Snape delivers his welcome speech, he takes Harry aside and sneers something like "You're probably angered/sad about your sorting but there'll be no resorting, even for you".

Harry feigns being oblivious, "Is there something wrong with my sorting?"

Snape splutters and tells something like "Sure you know where you are? In Slythering dorms?"

"Is there something wrong about being a Slytherin?"

"No"

Harry smiles, "I thought so."

_______________________

Harry proposes a binding contract to his dorm-mates to keep everything happening in the room to themselves, everyone agrees and then Harry takes his snake (named Inigo) out and proceeds to talk to him. They talked in snake terms, like, not "dorm" and "dorm-mates" but "nest" and "nestmates". Everyone is shocked and Blaise swears in Italian ("Merde").

____________________

There are also mandatory health-checks for Slytherins, and firsties are told that they'd better sign up and be on time, or they'll share the fate of Marcus Flint (?), something about Severus being severely displeased. Harry is shocked there are health-checks and signs up for the latest date and time possible. When it's time for his health-check, him being abused is discovered. Harry, if I remember correctly, is not sure if it's abuse. Snape then proceeds to play "yes or no" with him (if the situation described by him is familiar) and tells something like "There's a boy in a family. The family loves each other, yadda-yadda, but it doesn't apply to the boy. The boy is often overlooked, looked harshly upon and often goes without 3 meals a day, yadda-yadda" and Harry tells yes.

The health check was around Chapter 7 or 8.

I either don't remember what was next or I haven't read further yet.

Do you know that fic?

^{I was so completely sure that it was named Life 15. Wtf?}


** You seem to be combining your recollections of a few fics.

What you've described of the conversation between Harry and Snape, the name of Harry's pet snake, and the health checkups all exactly matches scenes in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15087428/][Harry Potter and the Greatest Show]]. It's a work-in-progress MoD fic in which Harry gets sorted into Slytherin after waking up in his young body in the past.

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.

*** No I think OP meant a re-do fic, where he dies once and goes back to before first year

Though I believe it was a mashup of ficonfusion
