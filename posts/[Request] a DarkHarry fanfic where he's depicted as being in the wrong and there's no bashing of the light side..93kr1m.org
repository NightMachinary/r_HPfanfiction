I have a dilemma: I like the idea of Dark!Harry, but I also like Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Dumbledore....pretty much all the characters that are typically bashed in dark!Harry fanfics.

Not only that, but I like the Dark side being actually, y'know, dark. No "Muggles really will kill us all" or "Nah, it was just Light propaganda"--just their canonical "I want muggles and muggleborn gone, and I'll fight a war to do it."

What I was wondering is, are there any fanfics where Harry joins the dark side and he's actually depicted as being /wrong/ for it? Where no one from the light side joins him, where Hermione and Ron have to battle against a boy who used to be their friend, where Snape has to watch him make the same mistakes he did, etc etc. Things like that.

Not particularly after romance fanfics, but just in case there's one that matches this description: I'm fine with slash, and I don't like Draco/Hermione or Snape/Hermione. Any other pairings are fair game.

*** I totally agree with this rec, it definitely fits.

It honestly pains me that "The Darkness Within" is one of the better dark Harry fics. The plot itself isn't totally terrible, but the writing just isn't very good. It was one of those where I read it, and it wasn't bad but it was something I'd be hesitant to reread.

I'm not sure if it just is that "hard" to write a good dark harry or what, but the fandom could certainly use more of the genre if well done.

**** I've read a few 'dark harry' fics. In my opinion, the problem lies in giving the characters believable justification for their actions aside from sadism or "for the evulz!" In real life there are many groups that do 'bad' things while thinking that they have good reasons: Baader Meinhof style revolutionaries who believe that the oligarchy can only be ousted through violence, or KKK style extremists who believe that they are fighting to protect their values against alien outside influence. Rather than explore those mindsets, most authors take the copout of crafting their 'dark' characters as one dimensional Disney villains who just 'like being evil'.

As OP mentioned, it's common to paint muggles as the ultimate enemy or to have Slytherin's reputation be the result of propaganda. These methods make the motivations of the 'dark' side easier to empathize with, and thus easier to write.

I second OP's request; I'd love to see a 'dark' fic in which the 'dark' side justifying their actions doesn't require that the 'light' side be wrong.

*** Y'know, I've seen that fanfic around for /years/ but never actually gotten around to reading it because the summary wasn't that great. Your description is way more informative. Can't lie, I'm laughing at the fact that I've wanted to read what I requested for years and it was apparently right in front of me the whole time.

Thanks for the rec!

** Linkffn(Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7) totally fits. Harry really really struggles with his decisions. He knows he does bad things, he knows he is even a bit evil; but yet things still occur. I really think the author does a great job of making it somewhat believable.

Ignore the cringe summary, it is certainly worth a read.

*** Ooh I read the tags and warnings on AO3 and it actually sounds pretty interesting. I haven't read a story that needs to warn you that it's depressing in a while. Bonus points for still being regularly updated.

I'll definitely read this! Thank you!
