Looking for fics with a more prominent Nicholas Flamel, meaning he's in the fic a LOT.

Over 70k+ words!


** You could say there is a lot of Flamel in “Where in the World is Harry Potter” (linkffn(2354771)) and its two sequels.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** One depiction of Flamel I always have in my head whenever he's in fic is that of of the one in Sanction's The Phoenix and the Serpent (linkffn(637123)) - a really unique and very crackpot Flamel, but one that fits in with the whimsy of Harry Potter. Be warned tho, it is one of my absolute favorite fics (and I would argue one of the better written out there) it is sadly incomplete, tho close enough to the end that you have a general idea of what it would be like. A good hero's journey type fic, very Odysseus-esque with some incredible OC's.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding?
