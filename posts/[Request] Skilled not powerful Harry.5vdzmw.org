I've been looking for a fic like this for a while, so I'm wondering if you guys can help me out. I'm looking for some fanfics where Harry is skilled and knowledgable, but not magically powerful. A Harry who uses knowledge, cunning, and trickery to defeat his enemy, instead of being this all powerful magician.


** linkffn(3885086) has a severely underpowered Harry, but I still root for him.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.
