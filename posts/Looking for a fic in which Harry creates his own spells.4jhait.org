Hey there,

as the title says, I'm looking for a fic, preferably with a smart and not-so-dependant!Harry, in which he creates his own spells. More than 200k words would be absolutely fantastic as I hate short fics, but I could settle with 70-100k or ongoing and recently updated stories as well. Thanks a bunch in advance!


** Harry has his own spell in linkffn(Hogwarts battle school). Hermione makes LOTS of spells (it's sort of her thing) in linkffn(the arithmancer), although if you really want a harry centric fic I'd look elsewhere.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** Hn yeah. I already read A Cadmean Victory twice. Although the ending was a bit..well not good in my opinion [[/spoiler][I prefer my protagonists alive and well at the end of a story]] The fanfiction in itself is brilliant.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
