** Doghead Thirteen has a fic called linkffn(Enter The Dragon) in which Harry gets turned into one of the dirty great dragons from Shadowrun, if that counts. It's actually really well written, as well!

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.
