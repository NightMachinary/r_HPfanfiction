So, I was reading /Seventh Horcrux/ on SB, and saw a comment about how great a Luna X Harry-who-is-actually-Voldemort pairing would be.

I looked around a bit, but couldn't find anything. Would any of you know of a good fic like this?


** Here's a Tonk!HarryMort (well, sorta Harry!mort). It's a bit more serious than Seventh Horcrux though.

** As far as harrymort/luna goes the only rec i can make is the omake section of seventh horcrux where emereld ashes explains why it couldnt work. I dont know if space battles has the omakes easily readable, but i know that the last chapter on ffn has them all.

I realise that my rec is literally the oposite of what you asked for and im sorry, i just love talking about seventh horcrux
