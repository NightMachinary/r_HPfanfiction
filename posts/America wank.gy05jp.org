What's up with the America wank in a lot of stories. I'm reading a fanfic that is pretty good, but the amount of time spend bashing the British and prepping up America is distracting from the story. The author had Harry visit America and claims Harry isn't famous outside of Europe because Voldemort was a small time terrorist that America could have assinanted at any time.

And this seems to be the case in a lot of fanfiction where Harry leaves England. There always has to be some plotline where Hogwarts isn't actually the best school in the world and how the countries he's visiting look down on England. They have to have a shit ton of other magical fields that are common place on top of everything England has.

It's one thing if different countries have different specialties like France being know for it's charms and America for it's animagus, but people like Dumbledore and Voldemort should still be the strongest in the world.


** I think it has something to do with stuff like how Hogwarts has gaps in its syllabus and you can poke quite a few holes in its claim to be a the best school in the world. People like to bash things in their fic to sound smarter- I'm probably guilty too, it's common. Like taking Dumbledore's moral greyness and having the author's favourite character 'see through him' and declare him evil, for example. Add on the fact that a lot of fic authors are American or want to build a better school than Hogwarts, and you get mary sue Ilvermorny.

Same sort of deal goes for making the foreign government more capable than the British Ministry and minimising Britain's terrorists in comparison. It's a big flex basically. It's fine for the people who like to read/write that, but I must agree I do prefer more rounded out schools which have strengths and weaknesses like Hogwarts does, it makes for a more interesting dynamic.

I'm currently writing a fic where Wizarding America isn't nearly as united as you'd think it'd be and outside of the east coast it's one big cluster fuck. like you have thriving independent native magical communities, mormons are doing their own thing it's gonna be great

*** This sounds amazing. The USA is a young country, founded nearly a century after the statute of secrecy. There is no reason to think the magical countries of North America line up with the Muggle countries. I despise the way extended canon treats the USA as "Britain, but bigger". Seriously, Pottermore, there's one magic school for all 50 states? Europe has three schools but a Los Angeles student is gonna travel 4000 kilometers to Ilvermorny? Shyeah, right.

***** My head canon is that whatever/whoever recognizes "prestigious" schools only recognizes schools based on the European model. Because I can suspend disbelief for a lot of things but Ilvermorny is a step too far. Same with the idea that there's only one "prestigious" school in Asia, Africa, South America, etc.

Basing it on the European model explains Ilvermorny's houses, too. American schools don't have "houses"; American kids think JKR invented school houses like she did Quidditch and the Sorting Hat.

So in my headcanon, Americans consider a number of American schools to be prestigious, but Europeans only recognize one. Just as Africans, Asians, etc. have their own highly respected schools (or other learning systems - maybe the reason Europe ignores them is that their magic is traditionally taught in other environments.)

****** I partly agree.

The 11 prestigious schools tend to be the wand based European model. This is why Europe has more schools than the rest of the world.

However, i also think many Wizarding nations are a lot smaller than their counterparts. Such as South America still having the incas, Mayans and Aztecs. Thus only muggleborns born to immigrants and their descendents really need a special school.

This is especially true in Africa and India where culturally the regions are incredibly diverse. It makes sense that India wouldn't have a school as India as a nation has only existed for a century. Africa it is based on your tribes and a mentoring system.

Hell, even Italy wasn't seen as a nation until the 1900s with people being loyal to their regions rather than the country.

Thus, you have your three big European schools, russian/central Asia, South America, North America, Africa, Japan... And probably one in China, the Middle East and either south east Asia or Oceania.

********** Smaller due to population. Don't forget that Britain only has between 3k-30k wizards for ~60 million people.

Very few places have over 60 million people under the same culture. France, Germany are the only similar ones in Europe. You have China (which still has hundreds of cultures, even within the general Han). When you split India up to various states, most would have far less than 60 or so million.

Lesser known could be a number of reasons. Age, population, magic focus or even standard racism within the ICW.

That's how I'm going with 11 big prestigious school that are comparable to hogwarts. It's not to say that these lesser known schools can't be older than hogwarts, or some of them bigger, it's just combined for various reasons they aren't on the list.

My headcanon also has that there used to be 2 more schools. One in Greece that was destroyed by the ottomans and one in Baghdad destroyed by the Mongols.

** This occurs in a specific genre within the fandom; as you said it happens a lot when Harry leaves England for any sort of reason. It seems to me that it's not so common these days (although maybe it is, I haven't read that genre in some times) because American Wizarding World was fleshed out in Fantastic Beasts. I remember before FBAWTFT, a lot of fics had America as a more accepting place of muggles and muggleborns, etc. That was shown to not be the case, so that plot point has died off somewhat I think.

However, I think that a lot of what you're talking about stems from that: for a long time we didn't have anything to go on, and therefore authors, who are almost certainly American in these cases, amplified the romanticized view we as Americans hold of the country. As far as putting down England, it's the same thing as why there are so many bashing fics: TBF, most writers in fanfic don't really know how to write nuance, so they find it easier to just completely villainize the elements that they don't like. It's just in this case instead of bashing a character, they're bashing an entire society.

** I'd agree with almost every one of the replies here, but I'd also like to add that I disagree Harry wouldn't be famous worldwide. He is the *only known person in history* to have survived the Killing Curse. It'd be like someone having a Hellfire missile bounce off of them, when they were a year old.

I've added Harry attending Ilvermorny to my fic, but I certainly don't have America as a progressive or nice place. To wizards and witches, Salem witch trials are probably looked at the way that we see World War II - happened awhile ago, but still visibly imprinted on our national psyche. So the America in my story is paranoid to an extreme about muggles, and a highly militaristic society (including conscription to the aurors after school) as a result of that paranoia.

I think overseas HP fics can be really incredible if the author takes the time to do a little worldbuilding. Consider how incredible jbern's Bungle in the Jungle fics were, where Harry goes to South America/Russia. It's just too many fanfic authors get a patriotism boner and bore their readers to tears explaining how in America everyone shits rainbows and is ultra tolerant...

So it would have taken very little effort for him to spread out his terror to wherever he wanted to.

Why? Why should the two strongest wizards both come from the same relatively small nation? Statistically, it's far more likely the strongest magicians in the world come from China or India, simply because they have larger populations and therefore, presumably, a larger magic population.

***** I was just going for the idea that sometimes smaller nations can do unusually well at things, in spite of statistics.

But you can absolutely think of that metaphor. We know, for example, that many non-Europeans still primarily do wandless magic. That might mean they're weaker at duelling, but are capable of doing very powerful rituals, which have the downside of taking a longer time to set up. Some fics point to a British ritual tradition as well, but there's no reason that one has to exist, or to be accessible any more.

****** Jamaicans are better at sprinting mostly because there is a long history of track and field participation there, and it remains very popular. It is also almost free, which is important for such a poor country, and some people think the training of the athletes on beaches and at high altitudes contributes as well. So basically if you wanna make that comparison, you would never to provide some logical basis for British wizards being better in some specific way. Like, maybe they have an edge on making technology work with magic (ie the magical cameras, radios we see in the books) because they had a head start in the industrial revolution. Just spitballing there.

I also find the wandless magic bit questionable. I believe you're referring to the info about the African wizarding school, since that does mention a preference for wandless magic? I find a lot of the post-book additions through Pottermore to be... reductive at best, and I don't know that it should be used as a basic for canon. Even going by that, there's no indication it makes them weaker duelists. I would like to see more varied cultures and practices in both* canon and fanon, but as it stands a lot of it tends to be a really surface level hodgepodge of real world cultures with very little respect for authenticity, history, etc.

******* There can be a clean and logical reason for British to be top-tier wizards - simply Hogwarts. Being 1000 years old it simply is one of the oldest schools and it is far more modern than other places (I.e. African wizards that don't even use wands) and thus accumulated a lot of knowledge. Also, it's not that big a stretch to have 2 statistical outliers simply come from one country just because.

Dumbledore is the only one who can stop Grindelwald who almost succeeded in taking over the wizarding world. He's so respected for his magical skill that he's given supreme mugwump over the ICW. If there are stronger wizards, where are they? Why are they never mentioned in canon? If Voldemort isn't the strongest wizard, where is the international interference. No country is concerned at all about a British coup?

Like it or not, canon hints towards a power imbalance between Europe/MACUSA and the rest of the world. This reflects the state of power in 1692 and to an extent still reflects power today. If there were more skilled wizards, they would be mentioned.

The actual facts we're given are that Dumbledore defeated a European dark lord and he's respected internationally. That's not nothing! That's pretty impressive, go Dumbledore. But the world is bigger than Europe.

The author doesn't have to let it reduce the stakes if they don't want to. Just because someone stronger exists doesn't mean they have to get involved. Maybe Africa's got a policy of non-interference in European affairs. Maybe Asia's dealing with their own problems. Maybe the strongest magician in the world is a Herbologist who specializes in irrigation charms and who would be worse than useless in a battle.

Better yet, use that to raise the stakes. Voldemort is recruiting internationally! The Americans are here to assassinate Voldemort, but they're total dicks and just making everything worse! Fudge recruited some powerful ICW task force to solve this but the cure is worse than the disease!

Harry scoffed, "Power isn't everything," he scolded, you could be the most powerful being in the universe, but that meant jackshit if you didn't know how to use it, used it poorly, or just didn't have the ability to use it. Squibs were a fantastic example. Just as powerful as regular witches and wizards, but incapable of using their magic.

England? England is known for power. So what is one more powerful wizard amongst others? A powerful young wizard is nothing more than a threat to an older powerful wizard. One to be brought to heel or destroyed. "

But to others?" the General asked, eyebrows raising pointedly as he smirked down at Harry who would have begun to feel uncomfortably hunted, if he weren't increasingly getting annoyed. "Powerful magic users are as rare as pearls in pigswine." He reached out and caught Harry's chin between his fingers, his smirk deepening at the scowl he received, "And just as desired."

** One cannot say definitively that Wizarding America is better(there's very little canon there), but Wizarding Britain definitely has problems with corruption.

- Rubeus Hagrid is expelled from Hogwarts, but never actually put on trial for the crime of killing Myrtle(though I admit he probably should have been expelled for the acromantula /anyway/), and when events lead to the Chamber being opened again, he is taken and thrown in prison without a trial.

- Sirius Black was sentenced to life in prison without a trial, or even a proper interrogation, and when he escaped, he was sentenced to summary execution, again without a trial, only to die fighting death eaters and be declared innocent posthumously.

- Similarly, Barty Crouch Jr. was sentenced in a sham trial(for all that he was apparently guilty), with his own father presiding over the trial, when he reasonably should have recused himself. His father later faked his son's death and kept him under an imperius curse for literally over a decade. When Jr. was discovered to be alive, Minister Fudge has Jr. summarily executed, without a trial. No one is concerned about the lack of trial, just the silencing of testimony.

- A ministry employee attempts to silence Harry Potter permanently, and when Potter is forced to defend himself with magic, Fudge uses this as an opportunity to try and hang him in a kangaroo court, even going so far as to change the timing of the trial in order to attempt to try him in absentia.

And that doesn't even go into just how quickly the Ministry falls in line with Voldemort when he takes over.

There are also issues with Hogwarts education.

- None of the teachers are visibly held to account for their biases, bullying is allowed to go unpunished, or even encouraged by certain professors, Snape being one of the most egregious offenders, expressing pure loathing for a student he's literally never met before, and even sabotaging Harry academically in later books(“Oops. Another zero, Potter.” after ‘accidentally' destroying his potion).

- DADA is extremely inconsistent, being unable to keep a teacher for more than a year for decades.

- History of Magic is taught by a ghost bores everyone to death.

*** Wizarding Britain and Hogwarts both have a lot problems. I don't see any issue with other magical countries shitting on them.

The Murica! Fuck Yeah! approach is shit too though. Honestly given the nature of America I would expect just as much bigotry in Magical America as in Britain, though maybe less talked about and obvious. Perhaps America had a Muggleborn Rights Act at some point that changed a few things and now they all pretend that bigotry is no more rather than everywhere still.

I don't see any problem with other countries pointing out the shit things about others, even with them thinking that their own country is fantastic and flawless. I don't think the author should think that though, and they shouldn't write their country as flawless either.

And also, wizarding world in every country was cut off from mundane world 2 centuries ago, so their way of living and ruling would be different from muggle world. It's like another country. You can't compare justice system in Britain with India, even Indian constitution heavily derived from British one.

And sentencing in Magical Britain is a lot quicker than in Mundane world. Barty Couch and Lestranges could've easily drag the proceedings decades if not years with their money and power in mundane world. And Sirius arrest and sentencing was a PR stunt.

And of course, if one considers Pottermore canon, then once again, Europe has several schools while other continents only get one. Also, how is it that the oldest school in the world is "coincidentally" in the UK? Wouldn't one expect the oldest school in the world to be in either China or mesoamerica?

Yeah, that one doesn't really make sense. As far as i know from my reading on south american indians most tribes, even ones living fairly recently/today but remaining in isolation, have two chief figures - a chieftain, and a shaman/wizard/healer.

Even Europe wasn't that out there in terms of witch burning, it was mostly protestant purist nuts being concerned with those. Magic/occultism was fairly popular topic, to the point where you had court wizards and quite the number of books and treatisies from the period on the topic of it.

Besides, looking at it from logical perspective - an actual HP-style wizard can escape muggles pretty easily, or could've passed himself off as a holy person with god-given abilities. Seriously, noone would be mad at a guy multiplying grain, bread and fish. Furthermore, the negative attitude towards magic of abrahamic religions stems from their definition/ideas of what constitutes magic - namely, dealing with the dead and the evil spirits. HP-style magic isn't that, and any wizard with half a brain could take the Bible and derive an argument that magical people are simply closer to God's image, thus able to create stuff from nothing and trully command the world to do their bidding:

** American children are heavily indoctrinated into a slavish devotion to their country and its symbols. That results in them unable to express or even perceive a more graduated picture of it. When they start writing fanfiction the less observant ones tend to express a completely uncritical picture of their country while the more observant ones can feel a mental dissonance but without the ability to express any criticism of their home they tend to overcompensate and put additional emphasis on the symbols they have to be trained to associate with positivity, in an attempt to express a differentiation.

*** Your first sentence used to be somewhat true. Really, though, "heavily indoctrinated into slavish devotion?" I know when I went through school (I graduated high school in 1971), the portrayal of American history in my history and civics classes was largely a positive one. It wasn't all positive, though, and I did have the nightly news showing the antiwar protests, the domestic bombings, and the riots in Watts, Chicago, Detroit, etc.

By the time my daughter was in school, though, the presentation of the US in school wasn't as thorough, nor nearly as positive. Among other reasons, Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States" had become popular to reference in what passed for history classes. I know my daughter didn't have anything like the civics classes that I had, and, to be honest, I don't remember her actually having an American History class, only a series of World History classes.

The rest of your comment, to me, merely sounds like "Americans are brainwashed to be jingoistic patriots, and don't have the capacity to handle nuance or different points of view, which shows up in their substandard writing." While there is a portion of the population that is "rah-rah-patriot" pro-US, and has been at least since they days of "My country, may she always be right, but, right or wrong, my country," we also have what has been termed the "blame America first" segment of the population.

As for the quality of fanfiction by American authors, you should keep Sturgeon's Law ("Ninety percent of everything is crap.") in mind - poor writing is not by itself a signifier of American authorship.

The whole "american school has more subjects" does make a lot more sense in a way. Just taking a look at population there is bound to be way more students even if there are more than 1 school. Like schools tend to defund programs when they dont have enough students which would be less of a problem with more population. Of course it's likely to only be still somewhat mainstream stuff or like a subset of well established classes. For example in addition to runes class maybe there are classes on specific cultures and their magic.

Like realistically speaking some of the points in bashing do tend to have a basis in reality is all I'm saying. Not saying bashing is good it's just a thing. It's like a lot of Ron bashing being because of the whole triwizard tournament thing. Like it has a basis and jumps off the cliff.

** I think it's primarily because a lot of fanfiction is written by young Americans who have been fed the "America is number one!!" curriculum in school. At least back in my day when I was writing fanfiction as a young teen, we were only /just/ starting to learn that maybe we weren't so great. We didn't start getting into the atrocities until later in high school and by then I had moved on from fanfiction, and it wasn't until college that we were taught how much we actually suck.

I'm a teacher, but my curriculum about America is largely "this is where we live, it's very big, it's birthday is July 4th" because my students are only two, so I can't speak for what they're teaching teenagers nowadays.

Another reason could be because a lot of Americans have some form of national pride, and would want to beef it up. America also currently has a pretty negative image and it could be a subconscious effort to salvage it.
