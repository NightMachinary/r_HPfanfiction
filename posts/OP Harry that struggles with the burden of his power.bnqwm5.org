Hello everybody. Basically all is in the title. I am looking for a Harry that has some significant power(not necessarily from the prophecy). But not all is easy, as he struggles to control it, struggles with the weight of people's expectations and makes fatal mistakes. A somewhat good example is Pureblood Pretense.

Anything aside from heavy bashing and bad writing is ok for me.

Thank you in advance!


** Pureblood Pretense is, at least partially, inspired by linkffn(Saving Connor). A major part of the story is Harry learning to deal with his own power. Particularly interesting is his struggle with how his magic both gives him the power to fulfill his goals, but also makes it incredibly likely that he'll become the type of wizard he hates.

*** I am a bit conflicted over saving connor. I've tried to read it a couple of years ago, but Harry's constant “I am unimportant, I only live to help my brother” that was fueled by Lily seemed kind of over the top and a bit unrealistic to me. But I've seen quite a lot of people praising it, so maybe I should get back to it. Does it change in later installments?

**** In the second half of book 2 and in to book 3, you learn a lot more about why Harry is the way he is. As the story progresses you learn more details about his "training", and as you do his behaviour makes a lot more sense.

He also changes quite a lot over the series. Although I warn you it can be painfully realistic. Just like in real life, Harry will have startling revelations and promise to change... Then fall quickly back into old habits. It's very '3 steps forward, 2 steps back' but he gets there in the end.

** I just finished a brilliant fic that may be what you're looking for. He's not OP initially, but he has ALL of Voldemorts memories, and can instinctively cast spells he sees in them, as well as it seems any memory he gains. I won't tell you why, or how, but he gains the ability to POP like a House Elf through this.

He doesn't really become what I myself would define as OP until the last few chapters, but he does fight at the level of a very good duelist by the time he's twelve, and all sorts of other good stuff I don't want to mention to ruin it.

Could someone else who has read this back me up with how he is OP, yet struggles with the power, and where it originates from. Also no bashing(except on Umbridge a bit, but c'mon, it's Umbridge), and his very nature in this story leads to him trying to shoulder all the burden, at least to a degree.
