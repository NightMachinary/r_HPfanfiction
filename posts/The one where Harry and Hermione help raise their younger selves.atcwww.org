Because plot Harry and Hermione are sent to the pre Hogwarts past. They don't realize that the other has also been sent back. Harry falls in with the Grangers and helps with little Hermione, while Hermione volunteers top help baby sit Harry. I'm 99.9% sure it was a HHR story.

Thank you.

*** I'm so conflicted, it sounds great but it was abandoned only 6 chapters in- I want to read it but I know I will be frustrated when there is no more at the end

**** As someone who has read it, I think it was worth it even though it isnt complete. Don't get me wrong, you'll be PISSED when there isn't any left to read, but what is there outweighs that feeling imo

***** I concur. I remember reading this as it was being posted years ago. It's a great fic. I was also always saddened that it was never finished.
