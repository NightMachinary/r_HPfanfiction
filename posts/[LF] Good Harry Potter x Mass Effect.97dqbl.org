  Harry Potter finds himself, and his normal bi-polar luck, pulled out of a quiet retirement and into the limelight of the 23rd century. He finds a grand new stage upon which his 'saving-people-thing' can act, and before he can say no, is pulled into the middle of a galaxy-spanning conflict. Rated 'M' for bad words and eventual sexy shenanigans, re-worked and re-posted. Enjoy.

*** Getting Too Old For This is much better than Harry Potter: Geth. Then again, I think HP:Geth is a 1/5 story, and Getting Too Old For This is about a 2.5/5. It's pretty much a crack fic thinly disguised as a generic indy!Harry story. It's a pretty fun read, but it goes over the line of funny to stupid just a few too many times. HP:Geth is just a Gethwank fic in the same line as any number of Mugglewank fics. Some people like that I guess.

  When the true nature of the Veil of Death is finally discovered, Harry and Luna embark on a journey unlike anything they could have possibly imagined. An authorized reimagining of Lightning among the Stars. "f*ck this is good! and fun! I don't want to read the story this is based on because nothing shall distract me from this!" - papiliokaze

** Linkffn(12132088) is pretty good. While not complete, it is being actively updated. Story starts ~modern day, and is currently beginning ME3. First few chapters don't have the best writing, but I've definitely seen worse. Writing shows noticeable improvement as it goes on though. Enjoy.

  Harry's unspeakably bored, and bored Unspeakables make bad decisions. Like jumping through the Veil of Death, when they're barely even certain it's safe. Where it goes? ...That's still a mystery. But hey! "Chase that flighty temptress adventure," right?...Right? - Harry steps through the Veil, and into Mass Effect. The Reapers won't know what hit them. MODHarry.
