Is it just me or have the ads on ffn become completely obnoxious, especially on their mobile layout. At this point I'm getting ads as a banner, between chapters as full screen ads, ads at the bottom of each chapter, and the point I think they've gone too far is ads inbetween every few paragraphs.


** Like I know there are solutions, e.g. download as EPUB or get an adblocker, but I'd prefer to give them some revenue, I'm just at my limit of dealing with that many ads

** That's why I prefer to read on AO3 if possible. User-supported, totally ad-free.

** I've noticed a few recently but honestly since it's a free site and all it doesnt bother me. Though I've never dealt with ads mid chapter before

*** it still has a lot of ads but not as many as the OP describes. Between most chapters and at the bottom of the page but not mid chapters. It also gives you heaps whenever you search for something

** Ugh yeah it's over the top and makes reading nearly impossible. Hopefully they'll fix it. I don't mind some ads but one fic had an ad nearly every paragraph, including right after the cheesy an/disclaimer.

** I use Firefox with NoScript and uBlock Origin. The only time I see ads on the site now is when I intentionally disable them for the site to allow the occasional ad to show.

** Like everyone else is saying download the app it's got no adds I've been using it for years and never had one advertisement pop up thank the gods The only downside is it doesn't let the authors know you've downloaded their stories ðŸ˜©

** The ads are so annoying it's a full screen scroll that I get the ads and it's not even one per chapter. I didn't mind the ads that popped from the top or at the bottom they were easy to deal with but this is just beyond a joke I can't even read in peace without being hounded by ads and it's the same with Wattpad it used to be every 3 chapters but every time I read it's like after every chapter. Wattpad never had ads when I giddy started using it.
