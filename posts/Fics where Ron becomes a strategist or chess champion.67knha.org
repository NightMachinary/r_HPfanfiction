Ron applies himself and uses his chess skills, either becoming a chess champion or a strategist(political or military)

The Red knight. Ron is very much a strategist in the way he thinks while he duels, and the plans he concocts.

Possibly the best Ron ever, though a bit (a lot) OOC. Would have helped if we'd seen him grow up into this really complex figure, but given the premise, I can roll with it. The story is fun as fuck.

However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
