Bonus points if it is Lupin (I just read an awesome fic about Lupin raising Harry and trying to prove Sirius's innocence in the wake of the Potters' deaths), but I'm open to practically any character (except maybe Dumbledore) raising the Boy-Who-Lived.

Anyone have a good recommendation?


** What was the one you read? I'd love to give it a look. Here a few I pulled from my favorites. Not all are with Harry being raised from a young age but I hope you will find something you like among them.

*** I read a story called Common Woodbrown by imochan. I read it [[http://rs-games.dreamwidth.org/12509.html][here]]. It definitely focuses on Remus as a character, but I really enjoyed the raising Harry aspects of the story.

And whoah. That's plenty of reading material! I'll definitely be trying a few of those.

** Did you read [[http://whydoyouneedtoknow.fanficauthors.net/Living_with_Danger/index/]["Living with Danger"]]? Remus meets Danger, Hermione's older sister (by 20 years), frees Harry from the Dursleys and Sirius from Azkaban. IMHO one of the best fan fiction stories ever, though I didn't like the rest of the series that much. (5 main stories, plus oneshots, alternate universes, etc. - a big lot of reading material!)

** Well have you ever read the Danger series?

Hermione has an older sister who goes by 'Danger' (like 16-20 years older, Hermione was an accident at this point) who cares for her and babysits Harry every so often. Lupin runs into them one day, recognizes Harry. Lupin and Danger conspire to free Harry from the Dursleys because of their abuse, and manage it. They run off into hiding and raise Harry and Hermione together. Sirius comes in later. Draco can come too.

It sounds cheesy as hell (and sometimes is, but isn't all fanfic?) but it's actually really good. There are 5 complete books which each range from 35-50 chapters (roughly 200-400k words each). Damn now I need to go reread.

[[http://whydoyouneedtoknow.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/#Dangerverse_Main][Here's the link to the main page.]] Read from "Living with Danger" and move up the list.

Oh yeah and for your convenience, the books come in .html, .pdf, .epub, .mobi, .lit, and .txt forms!

*** That's a good example of a very, very AU story. Just as a warning, it has almost nothing to do (at least as far I as got, third book?) with the canon Harry Potter universe or storyline. I mention this as it sounds more like OP was looking for more canon complaint stuff.

In that set of tales, Lupin isn't really Lupin, but an OP in wolf's clothing. Harry and Hermione also have nothing to do with the canon characters or their personalities. Which is fine, but that wasn't exactly clear to me when I started the series. I like AU stuff, but things got...odd later on (as another poster here mentions) and the world building was hit or miss.

My main issue was the thematic whiplash. I started off really loving the writer's approach and style, and the new stuff she (?) was putting into the world, but it quickly got weird when "wolf pack" themes started dominating. Literally.

That was...strange. It got entirely too much of a "my first BDSM" vibe at that point for me, with 11 year olds (and younger) acting out those themes (albeit without the sexuality usually present, at least at that point in the story). That I didn't like this is /also/ odd, because it isn't like that is a squick of mine or anything.

So yeah. Read the first "book" at least, but beware the oddness. Things are also very, very sweet and saccharine, and the drama is usually very minor and quickly resolved (or at least, the resolution is clear immediately), so prepare yourself.

**** Huh. I actually haven't read it in years, and I don't think that the last books were done when I did. I don't remember those being to terrible issues. Then again, I was also a lot younger when I read them. The themes you mention may have gone over my innocent little head.

***** Harry /literally/ grabs his OC "litter mates" by the neck to /literally/ establish dominance in one scene. They expose their necks to him in submission. Harry has a scene earlier where he does that as well with Lupin.

Before Hogwarts, they all sleep in a mixed age and gender pile on cushions whenever they can. The Lupin/MarySueOC off screen sex and on screen romantic relationship is also very much "wolf pack" themed. So. Yeah. There was also some questionable natural science on wolf behavior, alphas, and pack politics, but I was willing to let that slide until it got weird.

Again, nothing wrong with that sort of stuff, especially among the adults, but it surprised me (and not in a good way) when kids started being involved. With the kids, there was never anything overtly sexual that I read, but Lupin was running "pack" discipline in a way that spontaneously had Harry acting very, very animalistic and dom at Hogwarts, which was when I quit.

/Anything/ that even sniffs of "training" kids when it comes to kinks sets off all possible alarm bells in my mind and really puts me off. It was never overtly moralized, awkwardly excused, or in any way sexualized, so I might be reading too much into something the author thought of as cute and innocent. But I couldn't see it entirely that way and wasn't interested in reading further. Love to hear other people's thoughts on this.

****** Like I said, I was young and naive. I may not have been reading enough into it, or you may be reading too much, or both. I honestly couldn't tell you. I have been meaning to read it again, all the way through this time since the last three books are actually done. I want to say that when I finished my last reading, book three only had like 2 chapters. If I remember this conversation by the time I hit the parts you mention I'll let you know what my reaction to them is now that I'm actually aware of that kind of thing.

**** Huh. Yeah, a lot of times I end up disliked the noncanon portrayals of werewolves. I'll try it, but I'm not entirely sure I'll enjoy. "Alpha" tropes in werewolf fics are sometimes really uncomfortable to read. >.<

Thanks for the warning, though!

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell...

It is long. It is good. It isn't for everyone. Meets the OP's requirements for non-Dursley, but doesn't really spend any time on those relationships until literally the last couple of posted chapters. So maybe not what OP was looking for.

*** I appreciate the rec, and I have tried reading MoR. I thought the author was certainly well-read and creative, but disliked the general tone of the piece as well as the characterizations. Genius!Harry is always iffy for me, and in the case of MoR, I disliked how the author portrayed his intelligence. It's a well-written story and incredible in its length and scope, but not one for me.

So thanks, but no thanks!
