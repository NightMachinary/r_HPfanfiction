So this is part discussion part fic search. I was reading a Naruto fic the other day where due to some unforseen circumstances Naruto becomes a perv like Jiraiya.

I was wondering if instead of an angry Harry, or some other variant he takes all off of the comments about being a deviant to heart and becomes a deviant. One thing leads to another and he becomes a perv. Even if he doesn't mean to be.

Does anybody think this could be a viable story idea? What might Harry see our do that causes this change? How might it affect the events at school or in general? Could this even be anything other than a crack fic?

What's got me thinking that it could be is that there is a fic where Harry is an incubus and I like it. Warning it's more of an outlet for the author to write smut scenes but some how there is a plot. linkffn(10084910)

What else could happen if Harry takes thinks that his aunt and uncle take to heart? I know that there is a lazy Harry somewhere that is about this plot idea.


** This could only be good if it wasn't smut. Would work well as a non-crack comedy or a very cracky one.

*** That's what I was thinking. The Naruto fic is not smut and neither is incubus even though both could definitely have their moments. Neither are the quote on quote crack fics, but as a Harry Potter fic it would definitely have to be borderline at least.

  Harry's world is flipped upside down when he is visited by a naked fairy on his fourteenth birthday. Finding out that he is a rare type of incubus known as a Choiceling is the least of his problems when he finds out just how drastically his life is about to change. How will young Harry manage an entire year at Hogwarts when he has to have sex at least once a day just to survive!

** There was one, where this was a subplot. Iirc it was a “Harry Potter with videogame-elements“ story, meaning Harry could improve himself by gaining exp and the likes. At one point Harry aquires a negative trait to his character-sheet, the 'womanizer' passive skill. It's a negative skill which allows him to aquire one additional positive skill or something, and it can be removed by investing quite a few experience points, but there's a catch: unlike many other RPG stories, here the skills actively change the personality of the user, meaning that once a negative trait is aquired, the user no longer perceives it as negative, and loses motivation to change it.

I don't remember whether the story got smutty or not, but it stood out because this change in character was really well written.

Sadly I don't remember which of the many RPG stories it was :/

***** As of yet, nay.

The sad thing is that the story could genuinely have benefited from presenting the flaw as negative, and instead we seem to have the groundwork laid for what might end up being a cheap harem solution. I mean, I am not going to go on a crusade for it because it's pointless, but it kind of seems like a potential waste of what could have ended up being a good story.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
