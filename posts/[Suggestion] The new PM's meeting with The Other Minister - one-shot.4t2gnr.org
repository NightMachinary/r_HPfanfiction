I doubt I'm the only one, but I've been patiently waiting for a good little one-shot that deals with the new British Prime Minister's meeting with "The Other Minister", and finally one has been posted.

Disclaimer: I'm not British, and I endorse no opinions on political matters across the pond. I just thought this was a neat one-shot idea and that it should be shared! If there are others like it that have already been written, please share them here too. I'd love to read them!

** Hopefully this isn't tooting my own horn too much, but I wrote a fic about a historical Minister of Magic (1920's) meeting the British PM and the President of the US. I wrote it before anything was revealed from the upcoming Fantastic Beasts movie, but the few differences don't have any real impact.

  The new PM sits in her office alone in the middle of the night, and two strange men visits. What is going on? An entire new world of ideas wash over the PM as she struggle to keep up with them. Can be interpreted as political satire, but it's written purely for fun.

*** I think suggestion is suggesting someone write an idea you've thought up, and promotion is promoting already-written works.

***** Just took a quick look at the stuff tagged with suggestion, and it turns out it's used similarly to the promotion tag, making one of them redundant. I did find something tagged suggestion the way I thought it was supposed to be used for, but otherwise, yeah. And apparently suggestion flair is supposed to be used to "Request feedback for your story," while promotion flair is to say that a story is awesome, but in practice, they aren't seriously different.

*** Sorry if it's the wrong flair! I'm not a writer, just a reader, so I suppose I was thinking as a reader. I only saw the titles of the flairs, not any descriptions, so I thought that suggestion was "this might be a fic to check out". I guess I thought promotion was only fics that you yourself wrote and wanted to get out there, but in retrospect that was silly of me. Sorry for the wrong flair! I think that for future clarification, someone should add definitions to the possible tags.
