I might be confusing multiple fics here (as we do) but the features of the story I remember are:

- Ron and Hermione were paid by Dumbledore to spy on Harry, with Harry's money

- Harry and Daphne meet up at Diagon Alley after Harry has been to Gringotts (for Siriu's will reading I think)

- Harry and Daphne apparate to a hotel near the beach and get married (marriage contract, I think) and get it on

- I think it's also dark!evil!Harry and he and Daphne go ham after they get married.

- I think there's mention of Hermione being on Holiday in France with her parents and buy clothes and books with Harry's money

â€‹

I think there is also mention that Harry and Daphne and been friends/dating in secret.


** You've described probably a few hundreds of fics.

*** What is this tendency (so common on this sub) to bash what other people enjoy? Like, the person just requested help in finding a fic; they did not, however, invite snobby and elitist comments on how their reading preferences are, apparently, so inferior to yours.

**** You are quite correct Boris, and also exactly the kind of person this community needs more of.
