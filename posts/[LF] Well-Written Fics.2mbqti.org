I read for a living, so I'm pretty picky about what fanfics I read. The style needs to be good enough quality where it at least won't grate on me (poor pacing, shoddy dialogue, lacking or inexplicable character development, and poor grammar are my pet peeves).

Basically, I'm looking for well-written fics that mimic the novels in following either a student or professor through an adventure at Hogwarts. They would preferably have the following criteria, but as long as it's well-written, I'll take it:

*Long, >50k words, and completed\\
*if it follows an OC, they can't be annoyingly introduced--no Mary Sue type stuff\\
*I'd prefer to avoid second-generation fics because I hated the epilogue\\
*Romance appears somewhere, preferably slash, but I'll take anything as long as it's good--doesn't need to be the focus.\\
*I like the dynamic between professors and students in the book, so I'd like to see well-written representations of the professors and see them mentoring/interacting with students (McGonagall is my favorite)--seems hard to find fanfics that do more than just kind of mention them (from when I've been able to comb through)\\
*Any rating\\
*Canon or not canon, doesn't matter, but still should be believable within the context of the HP world

I haven't read HP fan fiction in a really long time (since high school), and I've become much more picky about the quality of writing. I've tried checking lists of "Best HP fan fiction," but even those didn't really do it for me. Some of the recs here seem pretty good, but don't really mimic the form of the books, which is also important. (Basically, I want more Harry Potter.)

(Sorry if this was set up wrong--I couldn't find the subreddit rules, even though it said they were listed below.)


** Have you tried searching this subreddit?

Here's a couple threads that might be of interest:

If you come by the subreddit every couple days or so you'll find a thread with the best of whatever on it.

Other than that, the hardest part will be finding fanfics with competent teachers. Everything else is quite plentiful.

*** I have tried searching, and my problem seems to be I'm pickier about quality of writing than most people are. (I also just don't have the time to dig through piles and piles of fanfics or even piles of suggested fanfics.) But I'll look through those too, thanks!

**** Well you're only going to get piles of suggestions. You're expecting a very personal review of thousands of stories to get the story that's perfect for you. Sorry but only you can do that. Our time is just as valuable as yours, and you're just going to be disappointed if it's not up to your rather vague standards anyway.

** This hits a lot of your boxes: is canon-compliant, complete, very, very well written, great interactions with Hogwarts staff, and has so much Original Flavor I honestly believe if you gave someone who'd never heard of Harry Potter the 7 books plus this, they wouldn't blink an eye when they got to "Book 8."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] - "The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?"

** Try [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=313068][Run]]! It's set right at the end of the war and follows the characters who died in the afterlife. It doesn't mimic the form of the books but it reads like canon, and believably explores many eras of characters in the same world, while also keeping a tether on the things happening in the "real" life. The author's been published, if you want any assurance of quality.
