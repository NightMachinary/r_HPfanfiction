I'm looking for a fan fiction I read a while ago where Mad-Eye Moody finds Remus in Diagon Alley right before his transformation and helps apparatus him home and then offers him a place to daft for a while. Lmk if you know which I'm talking about! Thank you!!

** There's a fic called in desperate manner in which Moody does find Remus before his transformation, but there's nothing about him offering Remus a place to stay.
