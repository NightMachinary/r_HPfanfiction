I always find it weird that there are all these fics about Harry coming across his creature inheritance and then he has like long hair, wings, and is submissive to Draco and Snape or Lucius and Volde. I was wondering where it came from.

*** Specifically it's because of Radcliffes height. If movie Harry had been taller he would be a dominant magical creature more often. Which I actually don't hate.

** Pretty sure it came from people wanting Slash Smut. Kinda like the Cloud/Sephiroth epidemic if you are old enough to remember it.
