Has anyone came across any fics that offer a creative or interesting answer as to why the caretaking and cleaning of a magical school is left to an old man who can't do magic? Just curious


** My headcanon is that the elves do all the work (naturally). But they need to report to someone (because you can't have elves in charge of themselves can you), and Headmasters don't want to be bothered with it (or a Headmaster needed a job for his nephew or something) so they created the position of Caretaker. People in that position quickly figured out that it was a busywork position (like many fanfic Ministry positions) -- look like you're busy and important even though there's nothing for you to do so that the position doesn't get eliminated. Dumbledore realized that the position could be handled by someone without magic so he hired one.

** Some fics run with the idea that menial jobs (caretaker, grounds keeper) are given to squibs as a sort of pension, providing them with a livable income and a place to reside in relative peace. In those fics, liberal-minded wizards view squibs as tragically disabled people unable to care for themselves in normal society.

A few fics which touch on that:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540013/1/Benefits-of-old-laws][Benefits of Old Laws]] - A minor side-character OC is a squib who works in her family's potions shop. Among other topics, this fic explores the problem of squibs existing as uncomfortable outcasts that wizarding society prefers not to acknowledge. For this reason, many squibs leave the wizarding world to integrate with muggles.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] - Fred and George consider Filch off-limits for pranking because of his disability. In chapter 101 Dumbledore mentions that he kept Filch on staff out of pity, with the idea that the man would be unable to support himself if he were ever let go.

** I always had this idea to write a filch fic that explores his origin. It centers around a squib squadron in the british royal air force or navy that fights during ww2 against grindlewald. Filch saved Dumbledore in some way then becomes disabled. Dumbledore runs into him years later, homeless and mentally or physically disabled Dumbledore offers him a job to repay the debt of filch saving his life.

** I've not seen anything, but I think Dumbledore just took pity on the guy and gave him the job so he could stay in the world he loved, only it just served to make him bitter and resentful of all the magic-capable people around him.

*** I thought Molly Weasley made the kids do it because of typical parenting reasons. It "builds character" to do it the hard way, or the work keeps them too busy to cause trouble ("idle minds are the devils workshop").

I don't think those reasons apply to Filch, though it would be funny if this whole time he has been working off a life sentence of community service as a character building exercise because squibs don't get sent to Azkaban.

**** yeah i meant it more in the sense that they share the common reason of 'no reason'. aka plot hole. But the community service would be funny too. Maybe Filch is secretly a tough-guy hardened criminal and now spends his days pelted with dungbombs by stupid kids.

** I've always assumed his position is traditional because a founder had a squib cousin they gave a job to or something like that.

I also like the idea that technically the caretaker counts as a 5th house. The founders had their squib caretaker sleeping nearby when they finalized the magics to make the Hogwarts house system. Not even they realized the existence of a 5th house. Nobody has ever been sorted into it and even the sorting hat doesn't know but if someone ever asks to be sorted into the caretaker's house they will be.

** There was a post on the main HP subreddit a while ago that implied that he could restore the Hogwarts paintings, either out of artistic skill or being the only one with such a detailed memory of the halls that only he could remember all the necessary details.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/9hemam/spoilers_books_23_filch_might_not_have_been_good/]]

It's a very interesting idea.

** Filch does have certain duties that house-elves cannot complete by virtue of their status in society and the fact that you are not supposed to see house-elves. The main one is disciplinary: Filch seems to be in charge of discipline, being the one who keeps confiscated items, who writes students up for their misdeeds, and who administers detention when it is not taken by a specific teacher. Another one is (along with Hagrid) castle security.

** My headcanon, which has kind of bled into my story linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor), is that it was as a favor to him. Throughout his childhood, Argus grew up /worshipping/ Hogwarts, and could not bear the thought of never ever going there once he learned he was a Squib. Dumbledore, being a sentimental old fool, did the same thing he did for Hagrid and gave him a menial job so he could stay on the ground. He can never match the Elves' efficiency of course, but he really, really /wants/ to, to prove himself worthy of his place in Hogwarts, and he works himself into the ground.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.
