I was just wondering if there were any fics out that had a Harry who was decently trained and could be considered strong either for his age or just strong for a wizard in general, but I don't really want him to be this edge lord who pushed everyone away from him. Are there fics out there like this? I don't really have any other preferences but decent grammar would be nice.

Disclaimer: this is my own fic and it is a completed year 1 fic in a series where i am writing through the years as i go. year 2 is currently in the works. Harry is strong for his age and has a growing social circle he is working on across all the houses. If you have any questions just let me know!

I second this, it's an amazingly diverse world. But do be warned, it's 600k words spread out over three books. But the last book only has 30k words and hasn't been updated in 12 years. Still very much worth the read!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13082443/1/The-Life-He-Leads]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3542057/chapters/7796585]]

The life he leads by WardernintheNorth explores a Harry Potter where Neville is the BWL and Harry is an introvert with anxiety issues. He is talented and gifted, especially in Transfiguration.

Children of Revolution explores a world where Voldemort won, and both Neville and Harry were spared. They grow up under a new regime where magic is might. But old prejudices live on. Harry is shown as powerful, skilled and charismatic. I especially liked how Hermione is portrayed, utterly dedicated to the new regime and its goal, while Draco is shown as someone deeply regretful of their actions. Warning this is a slash fic! (No sex seen though)

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12125300/1/Black-Luminary]]

In a world where the light side holds all the power, Harry is the last scion of Potter family after his family was mysteriously murdered as a child. Following their demise, Harry was being raised as a pawn and trophy, yet isolated by everyone. Sirius, being pressured by the ministry to cut ties with Harry, turns to his family (that he still deflected from when he left for Hogwarts) for help. The black family bands together and they abduct Harry, raising him to be a black.

Years later when he goes to Hogwarts (kids starts school at 14 in this universe), he has to content not only with attacks from the light side for what they label as betrayal on his part for switching camps, but also with purebloods feuds aiming to destroy the black family. To put cherry on top, the black family is really evil, but he still loves them. And in time he'll have to choose between duty and love.

This Harry is extremely obsessed with charms, and has all sorts of knowledge of archaic magic. What's interesting is that he doesn't come across as powerful (in the way of duels), but when pushed comes to shove his enemies always ended up regretting it.

It's probably the best fanfic I've ever read, too bad it isn't finished.
