To distract from the secret world government of /wizard/ people.

The Abteilung für Geheimhaltung der Zauberei developed a new charm to make muggles ignore the fact that a place exists, but the test run in Bielefeld showed that it needs serious improvement.

Gringotts is actively spreading the idea that ancient aliens built the pyramids so that any muggle sighting of magic around their dig sites would be classified as UFO sightings. They also contributed to funding the Stargate movie, thank you very much.


** So, what you are saying is that Bielefeld actually exists but wizards tried to hide it?

Nice try shill, not falling for it!

**** Spar dir deine Lügen, ich kenne die Wahrheit.

That being said, wizards pushing conspiracy theories to distract from magic ... I don't know, seems too meta. I don't think magicals know enough about muggles to come up with something like that ...

... unless someone is helping them.
