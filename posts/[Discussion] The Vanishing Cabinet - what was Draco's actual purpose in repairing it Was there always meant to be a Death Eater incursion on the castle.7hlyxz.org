I've been thinking about this and I can't quite figure it out.

As far as I can tell, Draco only seems to have been tasked with killing Dumbledore. To this end, the whole business with the vanishing cabinet seems almost pointless.

Did Voldemort always intend for the Death Eaters to sneak into Hogwarts? Was this a secondary assignment for Draco? If Draco had somehow managed to kill Dumbledore earlier in the year, would they still have made an attack once the cabinet was repaired? (Assuming that [a] Draco escaped blame and was still at school, and [b] the school was even still occupied at that point. If it wasn't, did they intend to sneak in and claim the castle?) If Draco had killed Dumbledore earlier, would Voldemort himself have come through to try and kill Harry?

Or did Draco repair the cabinet as a method of escape for when he killed Dumbledore? Was the Death Eater attack a sporadic plan made when Madam Rosmerta reported that Dumbledore had left the castle, and the vanishing cabinet provided a suddenly useful path into Hogwarts?

Did the Death Eaters even know about the cabinet from the very beginning? Draco visited the Borgin and Burke's alone (in the book, at least), but although he threatens to send Greyback to check on Borgin during the school year, can we be certain this is a genuine threat and not just Draco grandstanding?

*tl;dr:* What was the actual purpose/aim of the Death Eaters infiltrating Hogwarts at the end of sixth year?


** I think it was said by Narcissa Malfoy in the Half-Blood Prince that Voldemort gifting Draco the task of killing Dumbledore was punishment for the failed retrieval of the prophecy in the Department of Mysteries the previous school year, a gang that was led by Lucius. In other words, Voldemort never expected Draco to actually carry through with the plan, rather he wanted Draco's parents to suffer under the weight of their son's failure, caused by that of his father. Voldemort was playing mind-games with the Malfoys then, driving them near to the brink of insanity. That's what I got anyway from the Half-Blood Prince.

To answer your question more directly, since Voldemort never expected Draco to succeed, the infiltration was to carry through with his plan to get rid of Dumbledore, leaving both Hogwarts and Harry vulnerable. It was said that Snape knew of the plan, leading Narcissa to make the Unbreakable Vow with him to keep Draco safe in his attempts to kill Dumbledore. In the end, Voldemort always wanted him dead (as he's the only one he - meaning Voldemort - ever feared).

*** Meaning, then, that the infiltration was always part of Voldemort's plan. He would've assigned Draco to do it alongside his attempts to kill Dumbledore.

That's mostly what I was trying to figure, so I could take it into account as part of an AU. If Voldemort plans the infiltration because he expects Draco to fail, then if he assigns Dumbledore's assassination to someone he expects to succeed, he wouldn't also plan the infiltration.

**** You have to note that even if Dumbledore were to die some other people that Tom would want gone would still be there, weaker than him but still strong, such as McGonagall and Flitwick, and for some reason access to the castle from the outside was limited to him. As such, it means that for as long as he, or anyone else under him, found out about the other vanishing cabinet, him tasking someone with the repair is still a real possibility.

I don't have the cabinets ever turn up, but I've got another method he could access the castle. Given that, do you think he would plan an attack on the castle that year?

Also, Snape, Draco, & co. fled as Dumbledore died, but if the fight went more in favour of the Death Eaters (no Felix Felicis or Harry warning RHr to be on the lookout) then do you think it would have gone on longer and Voldemort himself might have turned up once he got word of Dumbledore's death?

****** Hmm ... those are good questions.

With the first one, I personally believe that Tom is at the very least aware of the broken cabinet in the room of lost things. As such, the cabinets not coming into play would have to mean that the one at Borgin and Burkes got lost or destroyed or alternatively no death eater of any competence ever limited the place. It may be something to pay attention to, as your readers may wonder about it. That said, assuming he is the same as in canon I would presume he'd take the other way in, since for some reason that (getting inside without going through whatever defences Hogwarts could have had) mattered to him.

As for the other one, it definitely would have gone for longer, but I would expect some casualties on the heroes' side for it. Now, Tom himself appearing does not seem all that likely to me for one reason: the whole plan with the cabinet seems to have been caused by him ... being afraid, I guess, of something in Hogwarts' defences. As such, with apparition not being available to him and thus him being limited to some kind of tunnel or passage, I do not see him bothering unless there was something he desired so badly, and with Dumbledore dead and him not really being that afraid of Harry there doesn't seem to be anything of that kind there. Then again, at least in canon Tom was somewhat crazy, so I don't see people questioning his appearance too much unless you establish him as above that in your story.

But they would have to know about BOTH cabinets. Knowing about the one in B&B is useless if you don't know where the other one is. Draco put two and two together because he saw the working cabinet the summer before his second year, and then he learnt about the broken one in his fifth year after F&G shoved Montague into it.

But now I'm remembering that the one in Hogwarts only broke because Peeves knocked it over in COS, which only happened because Sir Nick convinced him to, which only happened because he witnessed Harry getting in trouble with Filch. Given that this never happens in my fic, that means there's a working vanishing cabinet still in Hogwarts. (Assuming it was Peeves that broke the spells; I suppose they could have been using it just for decoration if it was physically fine but magically broken.)

... which actually means that for a while there was a link between Hogwarts and B&B that no knew about. Dumbledore didn't seem aware ("That was clever... there is a pair, I take it?" -- unless he's pretending not to know about it), which makes for a terrible security risk.

If the cabinet never once shows up or ever gets mentioned in all the story before 6th Year, readers probably won't wonder about them not being used as part of the HBP storyline. I've found that when you're ~200k deep in an AU, certain canon things will just slip past you completely. Even now I've realised there's a working cabinet in place, coming up with a subplot that involves it is likely to come across as forced at this point. Better to just leave it all completely unmentioned. (But I'm thinking of utilising it in some other fic now. The idea of an unbroken vanishing cabinet in Hogwarts early on is too intriguing not to explore.)

On the matter of Voldemort breaking in, I agree with your points. I wasn't initially planning to have any kind of big attack during that year (just a quiet assassination of Dumbledore), but I started thinking it may be possible and therefore whether Voldemort would do it. The Hogwarts defences can be bypassed, allowing Voldemort to come and go as he pleases, but it's also plausible for that information to never reach him.

I guess it's a matter of whether or not I want to write an attack on Hogwarts. It struck me as a good time for him to make a big stand--to come in and stand over Dumbledore's corpse and say "I win!" (Harry's perceived as a complete non-threat at this point)--but he also doesn't have the Ministry under control yet so he might refrain until he's got them bested, too. On the other hand, laying claim to Hogwarts might give him an advantage against the Ministry? Either as base or operations, or to just say, "I've got your kids, give up or I kill the lot."

... Actually, that might work. I guess I'll have to go do some hard thinking.

(I know my stories will be better for it, but damnit writing was so much easier when I didn't bother to think these things through and just went with whatever my brain came up with first.)

**** I really wonder whether the infiltration was part of Voldemort's original/ultimate plan that year. It's implied that Voldemort never expected Draco to succeed, and for Snape to take over the job in Draco's stead. From "The Princes Tale" in DH (at the time of HBP):

#+begin_quote
  ‘In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have,' said Dumbledore. ‘Now, I should have thought the natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?'

  There was a short pause.

  ‘That, I think, is the Dark Lord's plan.'

  ‘Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at Hogwarts?'

  ‘He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.'
#+end_quote

Since Snape was always someone Voldemort could rely on, in a way the task was as good as guaranteed. And I think we can assume that Snape was indeed the expected successor should Draco fail, because he knew of Draco's assignment when very few others did (as we learn when Narcissa and Bellatrix visit him at the beginning of HBP).

***** If the infiltration wasn't part of the plan, it leaves me wondering why it happened. Draco only fixed the cabinet shortly before Harry and Dumbledore left the school. Are we to think he sent word to the Death Eaters then and it was suddenly decided to attack the castle? Or did he let them know about it earlier so the attack was pre-planned and they were just waiting for confirmation it was time?

I just went to check some bits in HBP, and I noticed this:

#+begin_quote
  "I've got a plan and it's going to work, it's just taking a bit longer than I thought it would!" (Draco to Snape, Ch15)
#+end_quote

That almost sounds like the infiltration is Draco's idea. Perhaps he did it hoping it would ease Voldemort's anger when he failed at killing Dumbledore? Or maybe he was hoping that with a load of Death Eaters in the castle, someone else might kill Dumbledore in a way that would leave Draco able to claim, "I was going to but someone else beat me to it!" (Questionable as to how much that would actually get Draco out of trouble, and as you say Voldemort seems to have expected Snape to do it the whole time, but it's something he might think.)

I've just realised that Bellatrix may very well have known about the plan. She taught Draco Occlumency; there's a good chance she learnt about it then, and Draco does tell Snape that he's got "other people on my side, better people" than just Crabbe and Goyle.

So perhaps Draco comes up with the initial idea, sometime between being assigned the task early in the summer and his trip to Diagon Alley in early August. Bella finds out while teaching him Occlumency, then she or Draco (I lean towards Bella) tells Voldemort about it. Probably after Draco's been to Borgin and Burkes to confirm the working cabinet is still there; possibly even after Draco's reached Hogwarts and got the broken cabinet into the RoR. Voldemort knowing that Draco's going to give him a way into the castle might be why he was more forgiving of taking so long to kill Dumbledore and the two failed attempts, even if he does expect Snape to do it in the end.

****** First of all, I'm so glad I'm not the only person who has wondered about this. I've scoured the web and apparently nobody else ever thought it was weird that this infiltration happened at all.

Okay, anyway: interesting point you bring up with the bit of dialogue in HBP. It definitely seems like he has some sort of plan for the infiltration. I have a hard time thinking Draco (terrified and frustrated) would honestly believe Voldemort might let him off the hook and live if he could let the Death Eaters into the castle.

Your point about Draco hoping to claim someone else beat him to it is interesting, except the Death Eaters who were there were adamant about it being Draco who had to do it. Plus, I could see Voldemort using Legillimency on those present to verify what went on.

It is definitely curious though, when Draco says he has "other people on [his] side, better people" than just Crabbe and Goyle though. Could be just saying that? He could be talking about Bellatrix for sure, but then it makes me wonder a couple of other things:

- How soon before going to Hogwarts did Draco come up with this plan?

- Was Voldemort even aware of the specifics of Draco's plan, and/or how did he check on his progress throughout the year (other than just not seeing any news articles about Dumbledore's murder)? Even if Draco had the Dark Mark (which we don't know for sure), he can't Apparate at that time. Snape is obviously not Apparating with him since Draco's avoiding him. So I'm not sure there.

I hadn't considered that Bellatrix might have discovered Draco's plan while teaching him Occlumency; that's very interesting, and I like that idea. Hm, but if Voldemort is expecting Draco to give him a way into the castle, then why should he bother trying to kill Dumbledore with the necklace and the poison before the cabinet is even ready?

Blah. I've clearly thought about this too much. (Edit: and I do have my own headcanon on how/why an infiltration happened, but as it would sort of ruin the story I'm writing, I don't really want to write it out here. You can PM me if you want though.)

*** I don't think Snape was aware of Draco's plan with the Vanishing Cabinet. It always seemed to me that Snape only knew of the general plan, that Draco was tasked with murdering Dumbledore. Especially in "The Prince's Tale" from DH, where Dumbledore tells Snape (at the time of HBP):

#+begin_quote
  ‘Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up to. A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself. Offer him help and guidance, he ought to accept, he likes you --'
