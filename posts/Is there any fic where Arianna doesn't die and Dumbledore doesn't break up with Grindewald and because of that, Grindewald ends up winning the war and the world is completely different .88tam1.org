** Ariana not dying and Albus staying with Gellert is the premise of this fic, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12177140/1/Phoenix-Corrupted]]).

It's pretty good, though it starts out slow. It's set in Harry's time (Harry is the Boy Who Lived, but the Dark Lord he defeated was Grindelwald), and some things are different as the characters followed different lives. Dumbledore, in particular, makes a pretty interesting antagonist.

  A chance meeting and Albus and Gellert would become inseparable friends, until the death of Albus' sister. But what if Ariana had survived? Almost a century later, a boy named Harry Potter would survive the Killing Curse, finally bringing an end to Grindelwald's war. Now, as he finds a place for himself at Hogwarts, there are signs that suggest that the war might not truly be over.

*** 320,000+ words over 48 chapters. That's in the 5,000-7,500 w/chapter sweetzone at 6,666 words.

Assuming updates are consistent, 48 chapters over 18 months is between 2-3 updates every month.

And it's a very interesting concept, gen pairing, Adventure genre.

What the fuck, where has this story been hiding from me?

I thought the same when I first encountered it. It deserves much more attention than it's gotten. It has its faults, it's not a perfect story (Harry's decision making in year 4 gets a bit frustrating at times, but it's consistent with the circumstances and his characterization), but it's still very good.

It updates roughly once a week, with longer breaks between years. Right now it's about halfway through year 5.

***** I will admit, the first chapter was really good but the rest (I'm on chapter 5, right now) have been a /sloooogggggggg/ to read through. I have to pay attention, because the author is putting in a bunch of changes to the universe that I want to be cognizant of (and to think about how that may have changed things) but it's being packed into like fucking thesis-quality paragraphs of extrapolations on things we already know from SS.

I'll admit, though, that there's nothing that could possibly make me drop it because of that. It's /necessary/ world building, because /holy mother fuck/ is this AU. It's the most canonically-followed AU I've ever read, I think.

A few things I think I can say without using a spoiler tag, because as I said, I'm already on chapter 5 - these aren't any grand reveals, and may interest people into reading it.

--------------

Dumbledore and Grindelwald ran off together after Grindelwald's temper tantrum we discover in DH. Notable differences, though, are that Ariana wasn't killed, she can apparently read thoughts (intentions? feelings?), and Dumbledore allowed Grindelwald to alter the memories of Ariana and Aberforth about the duel (though, to what, hasn't been revealed, yet). They end up leaving Aberforth and Ariana in the care of Bathilda Bagshot.

Tom Riddle seems to have grown up to be the DADA teacher and, after, become Headmaster of Hogwarts. This has the most notable difference of Hagrid having never been expelled and being the Creatures teacher right away. Hagrid has eluded to Tom Riddle helping him in his third year, which would have probably had something to do with Aragog, but hasn't mentioned anything else. It's worth noting that Moaning Myrtle still exists, so I'm not entirely certain how the original Chamber of Secrets opening occurred but it stands to reason that it /did/ happen, to some extent.

Albus Dumbledore was never a teacher at Hogwarts (though his brother, Aberforth, is a retired Auror now-DADA teacher). This may explain how Tom Riddle was never caught for the murder of Myrtle (if that is, indeed, consistent with canon).

The Twiward Tournament is something that happens often. They may have mentioned that it happens every year, but I can't remember. At the very least, /a/ tournament is taking place during Harry's year.

The wizard that Harry "Defeated" was Grindelwald.

Dumbledore doesn't want Harry to live with his muggle relatives, but Tom Riddle insists that Harry chose to stay there, for his own benefit, because he's sure that Grindelwald hasn't actually been defeated.

Dumbledore is rumored to hate muggles, despite the fact that he appears to have come up with a cure for "wild magic" in traumatized witches and wizards (noted, Ariana), which is something displayed on his Chocolate Frog Card.

--------------

As you can see, it's been a /sloooooooooooog/ to read through it all, but all of those changes (off the top of my head) are just from the first /five chapters/. So necessary, but painful.

****** I don't remember all the details from the early chapters (time for a reread?), but the Triwizard happens every three years. The next time it happens is in Harry's 4th year.

**** Basically gen. In fourth year Harry has a crush/sort of a relationship with an OC, but it's no one from Hogwarts, and it's plot-relevant. Couples exist (teenagers dating, adult married couples) but they're in the background, not the focus of the story.
