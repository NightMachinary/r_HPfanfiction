What do we know exists in canon?

There are potions for regrowing bones, for fixing teeth, for making your hair grow, all the way to more conceptual potions like giving you increased luck.

Why does this matter?

I can't help but wonder why (from an in-world perspective rather than a writing one) we don't have a situation whereby the rich purebloods have basically enhanced their children as much as they possibly can. I think it would be an interesting AU to explore, whereby a muggleborn enters Diagon Alley for the first time and is freaked out by all these unnaturally attractive people (think all those fantasy stories where people naturally shy away from the eerily and ethereally perfect features of elves). An AU where the rich have a reason to look down on everyone else, because they are stronger, faster and need less sleep than those who can't afford the potions and rituals used by the pureblood families in their ever increasing and often financially ruinous arms race to have more able children than their political rivals. Into this pretty facade of a magical world comes a muggleborn, relying on the only avenues that the heavily funded and powerful guilds have yet to conquer: Magical power and imagination.

What do you reckon would be the butterflies of such a world? I would imagine you would end up with there being much more of a focus on potions and human transfiguration, with experts being heavily patronised by richer families and promising students being headhunted right out of Hogwarts. With an increase in personal power I could see the Ministry having less of a grip on power, with much more of a focus on families hoarding whatever knowledge they find to give themselves an advantage.

How would you fit Voldemort into this world? In a way his canon character would fit in quite well. He would be an unknown poor orphan looked down by all the people around him in Slytherin, yet be blessed with a ridiculous talent for magic and the perfect mindset and lack of empathy to try out new and dangerous rituals. You could perhaps have an increasing muggleborn movement to share knowledge that is starting to risk breaking the pureblood monopoly on advanced magical knowledge, and the temporary banding together of feuding families to push back against this.

All in all this whole thought exercise is a way to add a slightly darker and deeper colour to some of the plotlines in canon. Instead of just being snobby and having money, Malfoy could legitimately believe himself better than others. Instead of being upset at the eroding of traditions, the Purebloods could have actually worried about muggleborns gaining power that had previously only been held by them. Instead of Slytherins being evil "just 'cause" you have a lot of families in that house actively plotting and feuding with each other to gain the next advantage in the magical arms race. All the houses do it to a certain extent, they're just more openly ambitious. It could give a different twist to why the Dursleys hate Harry, as with the various magical alterations the Potters have done to their bloodline and the early treatments given to the standard magical baby Harry could legitimately be seen as "unnatural" to muggles.

What would you do with such a world? How do you think an AU where the magicals make full use of what is shown and can be extrapolated from canon would end up developing?


** I doubt a lot of this would work outside an unreasonable AU. E.g. Potions and charms that can be continuously reapplied without ill-effect or waning, ignoring that human transfiguration is hard and risky, etc. Basically makes magic seem so limitless that the pretense that wizards have to live in hiding seems like a farce.

**** That was an unintended effect of the potion though, so it doesn't appear that strictly human transformations can work that way with Polyjuice, which is hard just to produce. And Crouch Sr was dead. The issue isn't that transfigurations will undo (outside human transfiguration and conjuration, they usually last indefinitely IIRC), but that human transfiguration, of a living person, is difficult, dangerous and appears to be less than longlasting, if even Grindelwald's was undone by a simple revealing spell.

** It might be interesting, but really the assumption here (and one not supported by canon) is that the lines between rich and poor have been drawn between Pureblood and Non-pureblood. We never really get a good idea of the wealth of anyone besides the Weasleys, so we don't know if it's a general rule that pure-bloods are rich and the weasleys are just the exception.

My take on it is that the purebloods are probably generally richer by their own society's standards, but if you were to look at the "wealth" of a muggle-born plus their family they may actually be on average better off. I can't imagine a muggleborn from a much larger, more sophisticated global economy being too much worse off than their pureblood counterparts.

Wealth is also probably measured differently in both societies anyways, so it may be hard to do a real comparison.

We know for a fact that you can convert between currencies - that's seen in canon. I think the problem really just comes down to statistics. The rich are a humongous minority, and the chances of being born with magic outside of the established wizarding world isn't any greater or poorer depending on your background. It's entirely random, although genetics may play a part.

Unlike quite a few things in life, you can't "buy" the ability to use magic. So, really, the chances of someone being super rich and born a muggleborn are absurdly low.

***** I would say yes, honestly. Despite the fanon trope, Goblins canonically don't seem all that interested in the business side of the Wizarding World. "Inflation" is only a concept which would screw with the wizards themselves - the Goblins just /make and store/ the money. If anything, a huge surplus of it would make them even more necessary. With inflation or a lot of money being minted, wizards would be required to get larger and larger vaults or, at the very least, get more of them.

Considering Goblins are also the only ones capable of minting the money (a secret which they horde and have never shared with wizardkind), they're in full control of that aspect of it.

The real question is whether or not any of the treaties demand they protect some kind of balance.

**** The Malfoys may be very rich by their own societies standards. Those standards may fall a little short however when it comes to the muggle world.

I can imagine that the quality of life may actually be much better for muggles than it is for magicals. This is mostly due to the size of the wizarding world. People take for granted how much the world has changed in the past 100 years alone, mass production and global trade have really changed things and increased the quality of life greatly.

We don't know enough about the wizarding economy or their own methods of growing food or manufacturing things to know.

Being "Rich" in the early 1900s wouldn't hold a candle to the quality of living of the average citizen of a first-world country today. Basic things we enjoy and take for granted were luxuries back then. It's possible that it's the same with the wizarding world. Due to a smaller economy and possibly less trade, things could be more expensive or not even available.

***** You have a point. But I figure they actually have less costs. Electricity, water, gas, internet and phone, cars, they have none of those bills. There's food, clothes, stationery, floo, plumbing, toiletries, household items, and I'm struggling to think of other ongoing or major costs. I don't know how the plumbing works, whether it's fully muggle or not, but I see zero reason why a house elf or a person couldn't just vanish a septic tanks contents every day, or week, or month.

I dunno how expensive floo powder is, but it's probably one of the bigger ones. Food can easily be grown - both Hagrid and Molly manage to produce an impressive amount, and food can be engorged without affecting taste or nutrition, to a certain limit I think. You can conjure most essentials - probably, toothbrushes and stuff would be more expensive, because less demand, but that's cos most people would conjure or transfigure one.

** I feel like it could make for a pretty fascinating AU. Depending on the route taken it could easily diverge into a systematic class system depending on what you could afford or were magically capable of performing. Or it could turn more towards the "family magic" type AU, with families developing their own spells and potions independently and jealously guarding them. As has been said, it doesn't make much sense within Canon, as a lot of assumptions and extrapolations have to be made about the nature of self improvement magics since they aren't really covered at all; but as an AU it gas potential to be very interesting.

** In my AU story, "Patron", wizards use much more magic than in canon - including all sorts of spells on their robes. Which also grant advantages in combat. And even if lack the skill to cast those spells, you can pay someone to do so and you're tougher than the poor. Of course, the more spells on your robes, the higher your status as well. There are other effects as well - most muggleborns do feel like ugly ducklings when they enter Hogwarts, where everyone uses magical cosmetics and charms.

It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
