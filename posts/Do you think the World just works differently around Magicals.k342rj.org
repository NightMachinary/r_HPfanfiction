The most pronounced example I can think of this is what happens to snakes around a parselmouth. Potions could also been seen as another example of this, there is no active magic being done, but if you were to have a muggle try and brew a potion even if they did everything right all they would end up with is a mess.(Just as a muggle can't make a potion I wonder if there are things that Wizards can't do because just by the sheer fact of being magical their presence messes it up?)

Could the separation of he Muggle and Magical world have also benefited the Muggle world with no magicals around to mess things up just by being there? After all over the 300 years since the Magical withdrew from the Muggle world, the Muggle world made a staggering amount of progress.(even if its not true a story were a Wizard or Witch explores the idea would be interesting, after all for them it could surely not be a coincidence that after the split the Muggles made such rapid Progress.).


** Well if you asked the Dursleys, they would certainly say that Harry's presence along with all of the many incidences of accidental magic that happened along with it messed everything up.

That's an interesting thought though. The fact that muggle tech doesn't work on the Hogwarts grounds is canon, so maybe magical people can have a similar effect in close quarters. Like if a wizard held a smartphone, maybe it would freeze or the battery would discharge.

That might explain why wizards tend to have such a difficult time understanding muggle technology when they are able to comprehend stuff like arithmancy. Maybe it's hard for them to observe electronics and things in their proper working order without having a negative impact on them.

*** Maybe the Larger the Magical to muggle Ratio in a given area bigger the effect the Magicals have on the world in the local area is? so Hogwarts/Hogsmeade were you have the Largest concentration of magicals in the UK living there 24/7 for over 9 month of the year and no muggles.

**** It could also be an effect of the castle itself. Maybe someone a few centuries ago added a charm to prevent lightning from damaging the castle, people forgot about it and now have no idea why electronics fail.

***** I think it would be more likely to be a anti-technology protections around the Castle a sort of [[https://powerlisting.fandom.com/wiki/Crash]]! magic over the area around Hogwarts that stops technology after a certain time period from Working.

When you break it down, all magic is like this. A Muggle can speak an incantation and wave a wand. A Muggle can put ingredients in a cauldron and stir.

I don't think Muggles' inability to make potions is any different from their inability to cast spells - both involve taking actions that anyone can perform, but their having special significance when performed by a wizard.

Another example of this is Lily's sacrifice. A Muggle can sacrifice themselves but it's not going to result in a magical effect.

Focusing on the OP question, personally I like to treat the fairy-tale logic that governs the HP world as only occuring in highly magical places, not just anywhere a wizard goes. At places like Hogwarts, yes, objects may spontaneously gain sentience or events may conspire to produce exciting adventures for the students. But in the outside world, these things are rather more rare. A wizard's magic must be actively used to change the world; whereas at Hogwarts there is magic in the place itself as well.

*** To expand on your theory, students coming together to learn magic /is/ a 'magical spell' in its own right - just as waving a wand, stirring a cauldron or swirling tea leaves is. That's why Hogwarts is magical above and beyond other wizarding places. That gets rid of 'magic in the air' that I never really liked much.

**** I think "magic in the air" is just an expression, not a statement of a literal "atmospheric" effect. Magic is in the air at Hogwarts in the same way it is at Disneyland.

*** I tend to think of it as magic not just being something they can do, its something that they are, they are magical.(I think being magical or non-magical is a binary thing you either are, or your not. there is no in between. Magic is not like chakra,Ki,ect were people have different amounts of it).

You take two identical people apart from one being magical and have them both do any task at the same time in a identical way. And they are going to end up with different results, because the magical person just by the fact of being magical puts magic into everything they do its not something they can just stop doing.
