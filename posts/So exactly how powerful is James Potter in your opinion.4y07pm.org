** Personally I never took the "thrice defied him" line to mean they literally duelled Voldemort. From everything we know about the first war, /no-one/ survived a direct duel with Voldemort until he failed to kill Harry. Rather I took it to mean participating in actions that foiled Voldemort's plans, or even refusing recruitment.

I would put James in the second tier of magical skill, with the first tier being occupied by the Voldemort/Dumbledore/Grindelwald-level prodigies, whereas the third tier is occupied by Hermione/Lupin-style wizards who have mastery of most "standard magic" but don't really show any natural magical intuition or flair.

What leads me to this conclusion:

- We know James and Sirius got Os in their OWLs without ever really studying, whereas Hermione and Lupin had to work hard to get similar grades.

- We know the creation of the Marauder's Map was an impressive magical feat. Though we don't know how the responsibility for the map breaks down, it seems likely that Sirius and James, as the group's ringleaders, spearheaded it.

- James became an animagus at an early age, something that shows not only a strong grasp of transfiguration but a natural ability in it.

- We know James was already casting non-verbal magic in his fifth year.

Not completly true. We know that Hermione worked hard AND got Os in her OWLs. We don't know if she HAD TO work hard to get Os in her OWLs. From what we know of Hermione's personnality, it is likely that she would've work hard even if she didn't have to.

It doesn't make her a Voldemort or a Dumbledore, but still.

******* That's largely fanon. Harry doesn't like schoolwork, no, but in his fourth year, he did a lot of extracurricular studying and practice for the TWT. In his fifth year, he taught a group of students --- and there are few ways to solidify one's knowledge better than teaching others --- so he got plenty of practice then as well.

Add to that his massive investment of time into Quiddich, which is all about spatial and situational awareness, hand-eye coordination, and developing the nerve to dive at a snitch a half a meter above a ground from half a kilometer up.

So, never let it be said that Harry put in little effort.

Since this is about comparing with Hermione, consider that she probably spent more time at Hogwarts helping others (including Harry) get better at DADA than working on her own skills.

** There is a definite impression that Sirius was an extremely capable wizard. In the GoF when asked how to get past a dragon Sirius stated that Harry's best bet was to aim at the eyes, implying that he knew other ways to get past a dragon.

Considering that every other champion was nervous leading upto the task, Dragon bypassing is not a class taught activity.

Sirius dueled on par with Bellatrix Lestrange, who in the final battle was duelling three people at once (Hermione, Luna and Ginny who while inexperienced were capable of dueling adults.) To state that Sirius was exceptional would not be an exaggeration.

Lupin was a werewolf who obtained a mastery in Defense. Considering OWLs and NEWTs are maintained by the Ministry, one must assume masteries are as well. If that is accurate, then Remus Lupin obtained a mastery as a "Dark Creature" in a subject that would be tested by people who would have known exactly what he was. Also, there is no evidence that people did not know that Lupin was a werewolf, just that parents of students did not connect that Lupin was a werewolf. As the only forms of communication between Hogwarts and the parents seem to be letters from the students, and the Daily Prophet, it is not a stretch to assume that the parents knew that Remus Lupin was a werewolf, but not that he was teaching.

Peter Petigrew was stated to be an average wizard. In Snape's memories we see him struggling during the written portion of the OWLs, and during third year everyone who mentions him belittles his abilities. Yet he was still capable enough to blow up a street with a single curse. He was also an animagus at the same time as the Maruaders.

I mention all of these other people because we have no clear measuring stick to James' abilities other than these. Snape while the same age, only has his talents glorified due to his position as a spy. Snape did create curses jinxes and hexes at 16, and was capable of doing amazing magic at the age of 38. However we only have a single altercation between Snape and James as reference, in which James blindsided Snape and bullied him.

However by looking at James' companions that outlived him, we can get a hazy picture of his capabilities. He was an animagus by the age of 15, since he was calling Sirius Padfoot in Snape's memories. He helped form the Map, which is considered an amazing magical accomplishment. It would not be a surprise to me if James was considered on par magically with Bellatrix or any "lieutenant."

My reasoning behind such is thus. James Potter did successfully hold off Voldemort for one minute or so with NO WAND. Lily had enough to time to dash upstairs, go into Harry's room, barricade the door and I assume attempt to apparate away with Harry. If this is either by dodging Voldemort's Killing Curses, or by active battle, we dont know. We cannot trust Voldemort's memories of the night as he is clearly insane, and was taunting Harry at the time. Even if we ignore the Godric's Hollow incident, one can compare James to Sirius and Remus. We know that Remus died to Antoin during the Battle of Hogwarts, and that Antoin was a death eater who killed Moody, and the Prewitt brothers. So we must assume that Antoin was lieutenant level. On the Hierarchy of power based solely on the above argument. 1) Voldemort Dumbledore Grindlewald 2) Bellatrix Antoin Lucius James Sirius Remus Snape Flitwick Minerva and most senior Aurors (Kingsley Moody) 3) Harry(we see Harry duel on par with several death eaters but not any of the above. Harry is crushed twice by Snape) Draco (we see that Harry is wary of fighting draco in Sixth year) Hermione.

the rest are inconsequential. I would state that magically, James was in the top twenty to ten percent of the population, and that Dumbledore and Voldemort were in the top 1 percent.

** There's something to be said for David vs Goliath in this type of battle. James Potter was definitely talented, but he and Voldemort probably didn't fight the same way. Voldemort was a sledgehammer. He was the most powerful wizard in Britain and he used his power to perform awesome feats of magic.

James Potter specialized in transfiguration, which requires power sure, but relies a lot on creativity, attention to detail, and misdirection when used in dueling.

Fighting in open air plays to James strengths. He has a lot of room to work with, he can use his youth and vitality to dodge, the limits on what he can conjure and transfigure are almost nonexistent, and he can keep a larger distance between himself and his opponent. Fighting in the living room plays to Voldemort's strength, the closer quarters negate virtually all of James's advantages and allows Voldemort to press his own.

My final thought is that there's no such thing as a sucker punch in war. Voldemort took advantage of a situation that played to his strengths and that's why he killed James Potter.

I am curious, what would happen if, while voldy and friends were out torturing muggles, a particularly brave muggle with a gun of some sort (ignoring the uks somewhat strict firearms restrictions) managed to get a shot in on Voldemort. Would he die? Is Voldemort capable of sensing that and retaliating? Can he dodge a projectile moving at 2000+ ft/s? Can shield charms block it?

I feel like voldemorts body (at least his new one, made from the ritual) isn't really human. It's more of just a homunculus for his soul to inhabit, and he may not be able to be killed through normal means. Harry kills him in canon via a backfired killing curse, but that strikes at the connection between the soul and the body, not the body itself. So it's possible that more traditional methods of corpsification may not work, cutting, shooting, blunt force trauma and minor explosions. You'd need to use a Killing Curse or destroy the body altogether.

****** There was at least two big words in there that seemed goofy too me, but ignoring that... There's no alluding to his new body being anything more or less than a regular human body. The real argument is the tell-tale argument that has been on here and other forums forever about muggles with guns v. wizards with wands. I do not think that Voldemort would've been any less susceptible to gunshots than the average wizard (apart from the Horcruxes still in place until the final battle). I would think the issue is getting a shot off in the first place. Getting a gun, raising it, firing it, all without Voldemort sensing or seeing that it is coming and stopping it. I do not know if a fast moving bullet is capable of being parried, if shield charms protect against bullets, if redacto or a similar spell would just obliterate the bullet. I'd also be interested to know if people who regularly went after muggles developed some sort of detection spell for muggle weapons before they raided their homes. We never get that sort of POV or hear of it in canon, so who knows.

** On mobile so excuse formatting or any other errors.

In my opinion, the prophecy's statement of thrice-defying is a loose interpretation. For all we know, it was not a 1v1 fight everytime. Most likely it was a group effort that was spearheaded by Lily & James (or alternatively Frank & Alice) in which they lead the attack on Voldemort but not entirely by themselves. I can't see Sirius or Lupin not accompanying James (and Lily) in an attack with Voldemort.

That being said, James had a proven track record as a near master in Transfiguration. I have no doubt that in a head on fight with Voldemort he would be able to hold him off for a small amount of time. I specify 'small' as a few minutes because dueling him to a draw would put him on the same level as Dumbledore.

We don't have a whole lot of information on Voldemort before Canon (even in Cursed Child) but by all accounts Voldemort was /terrifying/ and only Dumbledore could face him 1v1.

All things being equal, I would say that James and Sirius were on the same level of ability. James had innate skill and was a near master of transfiguration. Sirius had the advantages (whether he admitted it or not) of being raised in an affluent, magical family. He (very most likely) had access to magic early on and had years to perfect his skill. After years in Azkaban he still had the ability to defeat Bellatrix, Voldemort's chosen right hand. (admittedly she had been in Azkaban as well).

As I see it this is how it goes:

Dumbledore vs. Voldemort - Draw

Marauders&Lily + Auror Support(Frank and Alice included) vs Voldemort - Hold off for at least 20 min

Marauders vs Voldemort - 10 min

James Potter vs. Voldemort - 4 to 7 minutes dependant on location and situation

James vs Bellatrix - could go either way depending on situation and location. Any win would probably be Pyhhric (I think I'm spelling that right lol) victory either way.

James Potter vs Snape - A difficult win for James but a win nonetheless. Senior Auror vs Potions Master (albeit with Dark Arts skills) somewhat obvious. Childhood rival does NOT equal adult rival in skill.

Again this is all just speculation from Canon and Cursed Child stuff. Take it as you will. I also add that Voldemort caught James and Lily off guard. They thought they were safe because of the Fidelis and the supposed deception

The prophecy states that they defied him. Nothing else. It could be that they fought him in battle, or it could've been that they call his mother by names for all we know.

With that comparison, you're comparing the dead at 21 James Potter to a 37ish year old Snape who probably spent 12 or 13 those of 16 years preparing for to spy on Voldemort when Voldemort makes his (most likely) inevitable return. That would include learning/mastering Occlumency/Legilimency, and bumping up his combat skills from what I could only assume were damn good to "draw with McGonagall and Flitwick simultaneously" good.

Snape managed to fight off Mcgonagall for few seconds when Flitwick who at first didn't know what was happening arrived and enchanted the armor (before Mcgonagall has the chance to do so), Snape then managed to physically escaped it and threw it on the coming teacher so he could ran off. At no point Snape fought both Mcgonagall and Flitwick at once.

I always had the impression that deceiving Voldemort wasn't a thing he actually did until Voldemort's return. We don't know how inner rankings of the Death Eaters worked, but I highly doubt that Snape during the late 70s early 80s had the kind of access to Voldemort he did after the 'resurrection.' Yes, he was chosen by Voldemort to infiltrate Hogwarts as a Potions Professor, but I would not be surprised if that was because he was the only Death Eater Potions Master.

Your attempts to make James seem on Voldemort's level are amusing, really. I doubt he even qualified as a nuisance. Read the flashback scene in Deathly Hallows where Voldemort approaches Godric's Hollow: never once does he consider James or Lily the slightest threat.

Then why exactly did you start a thread titled "how powerful is James Potter" and present James fighting Voldemort "to a draw" as evidence of James being powerful? Stop backtracking now.

JKR's quote clearly implies that she thinks of any mundane attempt at resistance as "defying", which apparently includes beating any old Death Eater. I'm not even sure why you zeroed in on "escape". I assure you that if that James had done anything significant to Voldemort personally, Voldemort would have at least spared him a solitary thought while approaching Godric's Hollow. Voldemort does not forget slights toward his person. It seems to me the reason the Potters and Longbottoms were chosen were because they were the only two couples in the Order who were actively resisting Voldemort and were ready to have a kid.

And yes, it is indeed rather amusing.

** I take "Thrice Defied" to be twice that Voldemort attempted to pry James and Frank both towards his cause. A join me or face my wrath kind of thing, but since they were already part of the Order, they defied him. The third time would have been in any of the major battles where the Dark Lord was present.

I'm with you on the sucker punch bit, but that was because even James hadn't known that Sirius had switched places with Peter. Sirius wouldn't have wanted to stay hidden to keep the Fidellius impregnable, but Peter would have easily done so; had he not betrayed them.

Also: I think that The Troubles are a better metaphor, since they would have occurred during the same time in the muggle world, as well as providing cover for the press to blame any extra casualties of Voldemort's war on the IRA/Ulster Guard/etc.

Plus, the war itself didn't involve the Ministry. As Hagrid said "We didn't know who ter trust." Meaning that much like the muggle side of things, you never knew who exactly was on which side until the bomb went off or there was a protest.

That and the fact that they at least wouldn't have told Remus, since he'd started to become suspect to the others during the war.

Remember that Voldemort was practicing wandless magic before Hogwarts and that he was able to fight Dumbledore into a stalemate while Dumbledore was wielding the elder wand. James Potter might've been a fairly powerful wizard but Voldemort's in another league entirely.
