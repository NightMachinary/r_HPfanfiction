:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember much about it since I only read part of the first chapter, but it was a fanfiction that seemed to be centered around Hermione in fourth year. The main thing I remember about it was that Hermione was enchanting her robes or something like that. It had been mentioned in a discussion about harry potter robes in the books vs movies.


** Hermione does enchant her robes in my story "Patron" and it starts in fourth year, though it is an AU.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous Boy-Who-Lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
