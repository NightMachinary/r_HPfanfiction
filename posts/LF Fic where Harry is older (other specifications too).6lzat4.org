So a long time ago I read a fic where Harry was older than normal. He was in Cedric's year I believe, as well as Fleur.

He joined the Triwizard Tournament, and I think dated Fleur at one point. He also had a group of friends who were the older siblings of Draco Malfoy (?), and their characters. I also think he had a younger brother and was the WBWL

Lost the title long ago, figured I'd come here to see if anyone else had it

***** Wrong one, he didn't dated Fleur in this fic and wasn't friend with Draco's brother. But it still is a good fic. I think the fic he is looking for is linkffn(6864381)
